    <HEADLINE>MOEA TO HELP MANUFACTURERS IN INDUSTRIAL ZONES IN CENTRAL TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will
soon send a service group to industrial zones in central Taiwan to
learn first hand the damage sustained by manufacturers during the
devastating earthquake ten days ago.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by MOEA found that the Fengyuan, Taiping, Tali
and Wufeng District Administrative Centers in Taichung, the Chaotun
and Nankang Industrial District Administrative Centers in Nantou
County as well as the Chuanhsing Industrial District Administrative
Center in Changhua County were all badly damaged in the 7.3-magnitude
earthquake which has killed more than 2,200 people to date.</P>
      <P>The industrial zones, the production centers of traditional
machine tools, manual machine tools and bicycles, have seen their
exports suffer in the wake of quake.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said that the effect of the earthquake can be
summarized as follows: power outages and rationing have led to
production disruption, production equipment was damaged in the
earthquake, foreign importers have switched their orders to other
destinations and the warehouses that store imported materials were
damaged by the quake.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they are currently mulling various
strategies to cope with the above in order to help the manufacturers
in the district administrative centers tide over present
difficulties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KOREAN AIR AIRLIFTS 30 TONS OF RELIEF GOODS TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Korean Air all-cargo plane airlifted 30
tons of relief goods to earthquake-plagued Taiwan on Friday, marking
the first direct flight to the Republic of China by a South Korean
carrier since the two countries cut direct airlinks in 1992.</P>
      <P>The ROC's Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent staff members to
receive the relief goods at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport,
the main gateway to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The goods, including 300 tents, 1,000 sleeping bags, 1,000
blankets and 1,200 cases of mineral water, will soon be transported
to hardest-stricken disaster zones in central Taiwan which bore the
brunt of the 7.3 magnitude earthquake which rattled the island on
Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>The ROC cut direct airlinks with South Korea on Sept. 15, 1992,
three weeks after Seoul switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei
to Beijing on Aug. 24, 1992.</P>
      <P>Over the past seven years, South Korea has repeatedly expressed
hopes to resume direct flight services between the two countries.
The two sides, however, have so far failed to come to terms on
conditions for resuming direct airlinks.</P>
      <P>Diplomatic sources said one main obstacle is South Korea's
reluctance to upgrade the level of bilateral negotiations on the
issue for fear of offending Beijing. Moreover, South Korea's
handling of its switch of diplomatic allegiance more than seven
years ago deeply hurt the ROC's national dignity and feelings of its
people.</P>
      <P>Observers said Friday's landing of the Korean Air plane at CKS
Airport may offer a ray of hope for resumption of direct airlinks
between the two countries in the future.</P>
      <P>South Korea has shown goodwill to the ROC since last Tuesday's
deadly earthquake wreaked havoc on the island. In addition to
sending an elite team to Taiwan to assist in search and rescue
operations in quake-stricken areas, many civic South Korean groups
and individuals have also donated money to help surviving quake
victims.</P>
      <P>The strong earthquake has claimed more than 2,100 lives, injured
over 8,700 others and left some 100,000 people homeless.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>World Vision of the United States is
in the process of raising US$5 million for Taiwan to use for
reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts in the wake of the
devastating earthquake that struck the island on Sept. 21, said
Richard Sterns the relief organization's chairman on Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAL, EVA AIRWAYS FLIGHTS TO MANILA OPERATE NORMALLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By David Hsu and Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Due to a statement on Thursday by Philippine
President Joseph Estrada expressing his hope that current
negotiations covering the Taiwan-Philippine aviation agreement
would be prolonged an extra day, Taiwan airlines' flights to Manila
operated normally Friday.</P>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) has already completed its preparations for
the suspension of all its Taipei-Manila and Kaohsiung-Manila flights
once the government here makes a formal announcement.</P>
      <P>Until an agreement on the renewal of the Taiwan-Philippine 1996
aviation accord is reached, CAL is only accepting individual
passenger reservations.</P>
      <P>At present, CAL operates 21 weekly flights from Taipei to Manila
and Kaohsiung to Manila.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways said that prior to the government formally announcing
the suspension of Taiwan-Philippine flights, it will continue to make
reservations. However, because the government's announcement is
expected at any time, EVA is only accepting a limited number of
reservations.</P>
      <P>EVA Airways operates 11 Taipei-Manila flights per week.</P>
      <P>The Far East Air Transport Corp. (FAT) said it too would
immediately stop its Taiwan-Manila route once the government makes
the announcement. At present, FAT operates five Kaohsiung-Subic Bay
flights per week.</P>
      <P>Beginning Friday, Philippine Airlines (PAL) suspended all its
Manila-Taipei flights.</P>
      <P>CAL Manila bound flight CI637 took off from Kaohsiung at 7:40
a.m. and landed on time at the Manila international airport at 9:20
a.m. CAL flights CI631 and CI633 from Taipei to Manila took off at
8:10 a.m. and 1 p.m. respectively and landed on time at the Manila
international airport.</P>
      <P>The CAL manager at the Manila international airport, Lin
Tsu-keng, said the airport's authorities have yet to receive
instructions from their government telling them to refuse CAL
flights' requests for landing rights at the airport.</P>
      <P>On Friday, all scheduled EVA Taipei-Manila flights also made
normal taking offs from Taiwan and landings at the Manila airport.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN TIES WITH INDONESIA, MALAYSIA SEEN WORSENING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bilateral relations between Australia and
its two neighboring countries -- Indonesia and Malaysia -- are
worsening at a surprisingly rapid pace over East Timor thanks to
Canberra's provocation against Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur.</P>
      <P>The threat of "hot pursuit" by Defense Minister John Moore, who
said the Australian-led UN peacekeeping force might cross the East
Timor border to pursue attacks from pro-Indonesian militias has
prompted warnings from Indonesia of "adverse consequences" and forced
the commander of the peace keepers, Major-General Peter Cosgrove, to
clarify his role and insist that it was limited to East Timor only.</P>
      <P>It also prompted Indonesia's outgoing ambassador to Australia to
warn Canberra against its provocation and aggressive behavior in its
role in East Timor. He said tensions between Indonesia and Australia
were climbing "like a ladder and had reached the top step."</P>
      <P>Australia's role in East Timor also caused a friction between
Canberra and Kuala Lumpur after Prime Minister Mahathir demanded that
Australian troop presence in East Timor be reduced because of its
"heavy-handed dealing" with the problem in the former Portuguese
colony.</P>
      <P>Mahathir made the complaint to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan
at a meeting in New York, saying: "I have seen pictures of Australian
troops pointing guns at almost everybody. Is it necessary to point
guns at people who are obviously unarmed?"</P>
      <P>But Prime Minister John Howard on Thursday "emphatically and
categorically" rejected Mahathir's accusation that Australian troops
were behaving belligerently.</P>
      <P>U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, now in Jakarta, defended
Australian troop behavior, saying the peace force needed to act in a
"very aggressive manner" to confront militia elements threatening
violence.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with President B.J. Habibie, Cohen warned Habibie
and other senior government officials that Indonesia would suffer
"severe damage" if the army failed to disarm the militias.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Commandant Cornello Gama of the resistance force
Falintil on Thursday came down from the hills in East Timor to open
negotiations with the UN peacekeeping force and handed a truckload
of weapons to the Australian-led force as a gesture of collaboration
with the peace keepers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL REFORM SEEN AS CHINA'S PRESSING PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While marking its 50th anniversary of
founding the Communist regime, mainland China has succeeded in its
economic reform in the past 20 years, but it has failed in its
political reform, which is one of many pressing problems for the
mainland.</P>
      <P>In an editorial headlined: "China Faces Revolutions of the
Future," the Australian on Friday says: "Over the past 20 years,
China has thrown off much of the dogma associated with
Marxism-Leninism and has made big strides in its efforts to modernize
its economy." "The modernization of China, and its emergence fully
into the international community, is one of the most important
dynamics of the century," it adds.</P>
      <P>But the editorial says "political reform seems to have ground to
a halt. This is the uncompleted half of the reforms of the past 20
years." "The Chinese authorities have argued that by pursuing
economic rather than political reform they have avoided the fate of
(Mikhail) Gorbachev's Soviet Union."</P>
      <P>"But this process can only go so far. Eventually even economic
performance requires greater political space. This is particularly
true as the information industries increasingly dominate modern
economies," the editorial says.</P>
      <P>It says China also faces other problems because its state-owned
enterprises "remain beyond effective reform. The banking system is a
mess. Unemployment is a threat to social stability. The environmental
problems are catastrophic."</P>
      <P>"None of this is to deny the many pressing problems which afflict
China today," the editorial says.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COX: CLINTON ADM. QUIETLY ADMITS CHINA STOLE SECRETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Sept.   30   (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and a Senate penal are respectively investigating the
allegations that Communist China has stolen US nuclear weapons
secrets, Rep. Chris Cox (R-CA) pointed out that the Clinton
administration has quietly admitted in writing that the House Cox
Committee report was correct in concluding that spies working for
Communist China stole US nuclear warhead designs.</P>
      <P>"It's not alleged, it's a fact," stressed the California
Republican congressman in an interview with the editors of Human
Event monthly magazine, which will be published in its latest issue.</P>
      <P>Cox, who chaired the House select committee that investigated
Communist Chinese theft of US weapons technology, pointed to the
little-noticed National Security Estimate, titled "Foreign Missile
Developments and the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States
Through 2015," which was released earlier in September 1999.</P>
      <P>The National Security Estimate stated for the first time that it
is the judgment of the entire intelligence community that the three
new long-range weapons systems that the People's Liberation Army is
going to roll out in the next few years "will contain US warhead
information," and that is "what we stated in our report," noted Cox.</P>
      <P>"The media keep saying that there is no proof that anything was
really stolen, they say the Cox report is overstated." But the facts
are, the congressman said, "that the PRC had acquired classified
information about every currently deployed nuclear warhead in the
US arsenal."</P>
      <P>The National Intelligence Estimate stated that "with the JL-2
submarine-launched missile," Cox added, "the PRC will be able to hit
the United States from Chinese territorial waters, which is exactly
what we stated in our report. In addition, these three weapons
platforms will likely be fitted with miniaturized nuclear warheads
influenced by stolen US designs acquired through espionage. So
every single piece of this is now officially the public view of the
intelligence community."</P>
      <P>Cox pointed out that the Central Intelligence Agency chairs the
committee that published the National Security Estimate, but that the
panel includes all US intelligence agencies.</P>
      <P>Most of the security breaches perpetrated by the PRC have taken
place during the Clinton years, said Cox. "In our report, we have
given either exact or approximate dates for most of the thefts. With
the exception of one that is pinned down at the end of the Carter
administration and another that probably occurred during the Reagan
or Bush administration, all the rest of them, as outlined in our
report, occurred during the Clinton administration," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the FBI was ordered earlier this week to widen its
probe of the allegations that Communist China has stolen US nuclear
weapons secrets after it failed to file any charges against suspected
Taiwan-born scientist Wen Ho Lee following an investigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCIENTISTS SEE DIAMONDS HAILING DOWN FROM SOME SOLAR PLANETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Sept.  30  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If experiments at the University of
California, Berkeley, are any indication, future explorers of our
solar system may well find diamonds hailing down through the
atmospheres of Neptune and Uranus.</P>
      <P>These planets contain a high proportion of methane, which
UC-Berkeley researchers have now shown can turn into diamond at the
high temperatures and pressures found inside these planets.</P>
      <P>"Once these diamonds form, they fall like raindrops or
hailstones toward the center of the planet," said Laura Robin
Benedetti, a graduate student in physics at UC Berkeley.</P>
      <P>The team, led by Benedetti and Raymond Jeanloz, professor of
geology and geophysics, produced these conditions inside a diamond
anvil cell, squeezing liquid methane to several hundred thousand
times atmospheric pressure. When they focused a laser beam on the
pressurized liquid, heating it to some 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit,
diamond dust appeared.</P>
      <P>They're reporting their experimental findings in a paper in the
Oct. 1 issue of the journal Science.</P>
      <P>The demonstration that methane can convert to diamond as well as
other complex hydrocarbons in the interiors of giant planets like
Neptune hint at a complex chemistry inside gaseous planets and even
brown dwarf stars. Brown dwarfs are small, dim stars barely larger
than the largest gas giant planets.</P>
      <P>"This is opening the door to study of the interesting types
of chemical reactions taking place inside planets and brown dwarfs,"
Jeanloz said. "Now that technology is able to reproduce the high
pressures and temperatures found there, we are getting much better
quality information on the chemical reactions taking place under
these conditions."</P>
      <P>Our solar system's other gas giant planets -- Jupiter and Saturn
-- may also contain diamonds produced under such conditions, though
they contain proportionately less methane than Neptune and Uranus.</P>
      <P>"As more planets are found in unexpected orbits around other
stars, the effects of internal chemical processes will need to be
further clarified in order to obtain a general understanding of
planet formation and evolution," the authors concluded in the Science
paper.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMMUNIST RULE IN CHINA BRANDED AS "FIFTY YEARS OF EVIL"</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London, Sept. 30 (CNA)
(By Mark Ou)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The past half century of communist rule in
China was branded as "fifty years of evil" by a leading British
newspaper as Beijing's leaders prepare to celebrate the 50th
anniversary of the people's republic.</P>
      <P>The paper went on to say it is a shame that Western democracies
have been woefully reluctant to denounce these evils.</P>
      <P>The mass-circulation Daily Telegraph noted Thursday in an article
by Graham Hutchings, its correspondent in China from 1987 to 1998,
that the anniversary is the "Party's party not the people's", and
Beijing's leaders do feel the need to "camouflage the calamities of
half a century of communist rule and show their determination to stay
in power."</P>
      <P>While not denying the achievements made during the past 50 years
in China, Hutchings said they "pale alongside the terrible toll in
human sufferings, destruction, waste and folly exacted under Chinese
communism."</P>
      <P>The Daily Telegraph wrote in an editorial under the headline,
"fifty years of evil", that over 30 million people have died during
the past 50 years under Chinese communist rule, which have seen the
Tiananmen Square massacre, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution,
the Great Leap Forward movement, the anti-rightist campaign against
intellectuals, the invasion of Tibet and the killing of landlords in
the first years of the revolution.</P>
      <P>"As it has aged, the People's Republic may have become
less murderous, but it remains exceptionally oppressive", the Daily
Telegraph comment observed. It is under this context that the comment
drew attention to the different route chosen by Taiwan, the other
China across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>It noted that while communist China remains "an odious
leviathan", Taiwan has transformed itself from a polity run on

      <P>The comment said the track record of communist China is "an
affront to what passes for civilized behavior." It is with this
conclusion that the comment called it a shame that the liberal

      <P>In a related report from Hong Kong by its correspondent David
Rennie, the Daily Telegraph also debunked the propaganda of Beijing's
"one country two systems" formula for the former British colony.</P>
      <P>It is clear after the return of Hong Kong to China that "one
country has been placed above any idea of two systems," said the
report. It quoted Margaret Ng, a member of Hong Kong's Legislative
Council, as saying that the former colony may looks the same
outwardly, but the soul has changed; "if you live here then you can
feel the difference."</P>

    <HEADLINE>70% TAIWAN PEOPLE FEEL BEIJING INSINCERE IN QUAKE AID: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of local people feel that
Beijing was not sincere in offering aid to Taiwan after the island
was hit by a devastating earthquake on Sept. 21, according to the
results of a public opinion poll released on Friday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,070 adults, conducted by Sanlih
Entertainment Television from Sept. 29-30, found that 70 percent of
the respondents said they are dissatisfied with mainland China's aid
to quake-plagued Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Survey results also show that some 40 percent of those
interviewed said Taiwan should only accept mainland China's
cash aid, while a roughly equal number of the respondents said
the government should only accept mainland China's relief goods.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's Red Cross Society has donated US$100,000 in
cash to its Taiwan counterpart and offered to send 500,000 renminbi
(about US$60,000) worth of relief goods to help Taiwan's quake
victims.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 46 percent said they were satisfied
with the government's overall post-earthquake relief performance,
but 37 percent said they were discontent with the government's
performance.</P>
      <P>Moreover, 60 percent said they feel that the government failed
to take swift post-earthquake relief actions in the initial stage.</P>
      <P>In contrast, 92.9 percent said they were satisfied with private
groups' participation in post-quake relief operations, and 92
percent said they were content with the military's relief
performance.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 87 percent gave positive evaluation of local news
media's coverage of disaster scenes and post-quake rescue and relief
actions, and 64.9 percent said they believe that media coverage is
helpful to the government's relief effort.</P>
      <P>As for top government leaders' performance, 36.2 percent gave
President Lee Teng-hui a score of 60-to-69 points on a zero-to-100
rating system, while 25.5 percent said they feel Lee's performance
failed to live up to their expectation.</P>
      <P>While 34 percent gave a positive evaluation of Vice President
Lien Chan's performance in quake-relief operations, 27.6 percent
said they feel Lien's performance failed to meet the minimum
passable level of 60 points.</P>
      <P>As for Premier Vincent Siew's performance, 36.4 percent gave a
lower-than-60-points rating, while 30 percent gave his performance a
grade of 60-to-69 points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN THANKS INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY FOR ITS HELP (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has offered its heartfelt thanks to
the international community for its help and sympathy at a time of
unprecedented hardship resulting from the devastating earthquake
which struck the island on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>The quake, which measured 7.3 on the Richter scale, rattled
central Taiwan in the early hours of the morning, killing at least
2,100 people, injuring 8,700, and leaving some 100,000 others
homeless. The quake was one of the deadliest in the world this
century and the strongest ever on the tremor-plagued island.</P>
      <P>Rescue workers from Singapore, South Korea and Japan arrived in
Taiwan within hours of the disaster, followed over the next few days
by search and rescue teams from around the world -- Austria,
Australia, Britain, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany,
Hungary, Hong Kong, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Slovakia, Spain,
Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United States and the United
Nations.</P>
      <P>None of those countries maintain formal relations with the
diplomatically isolated Republic of China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Japan, which has a uniquely sentimental attachment to Taiwan that
stops short of diplomatic recognition, sent the largest search and
rescue group, comprising 145 people including 10 doctors, as well as
19 sniffer dogs and two truckloads of gear.</P>
      <P>Sympathetic to the cultural sensitivities of the people of
Taiwan, the Japanese rescue workers saluted the dead bodies for five
seconds before moving them. They also changed their coarse work
gloves for finer ones before moving the corpses to avoid "hurting"
the deceased for a second time during their retrieval.</P>
      <P>The Japanese, who have been professionally trained and are
advancedly equipped, also moonlighted as toilet cleaners in
earthquake-stricken areas when they had finished with rescue work in
order to prevent the spread of disease from the filthy portable
toilets installed at the temporary settlement camps for survivors.</P>
      <P>Two Japanese doctors virtually climbed and crawled to a mountain
village in Nantou, the hardest-hit county in central Taiwan, to save
several elderly people left injured and homeless after their homes
vanished in landslides triggered by the massive temblor.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the 73-member US rescue team, made up of technical
experts from the United States Agency for International Development's
Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, and Fairfax County Urban
Search and Rescue Team from the state of Virginia, was one of the
most elite and advanced teams to pitch in with the rescue operation.</P>
      <P>The US team found and rescued one man who had been trapped for 48
hours but didn't even seem to know about the earthquake.</P>
      <P>"What happened to my apartment?" 33-year-old survivor Hsu Tse-kai
asked after crew members spent eight hours digging him out of a
four-story chunk of building that had been compressed into about
three meters of rubble.</P>
      <P>In addition to the team's swift response and tireless rescue
efforts, cash donations and relief goods sent from the United States
in the week following the quake topped all the relief aid from any
other country.</P>
      <P>Jack Brown, leader of the US team, said in addition that if
Taiwan decides to set up a disaster relief corps similar to the US
team, he and his colleagues will be very pleased to offer needed
assistance.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most media attention, however, was directed at a
16-strong South Korean team who detected a six-year-old boy alive in
a massive pile of rubble, all that remained of a 12-story residential
building in the city of Tali in Taichung County, four days after the
earthquake.</P>
      <P>The child was pulled alive from the rubble of the demolished
building after a painstaking nine-hour effort.</P>
      <P>The leader of the Korean team was seen on local and international
TV breathlessly and excitedly describing the progress of the
unearthing of the child, the only survivor of the toppled building.
Unfortunately, however, the boy had become an orphan because both his
parents and two younger siblings were killed in the disaster.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The French emergency workers, who flew halfway around the world
to get here, spent a whole week in the town of Puli in Nantou County
working around the clock to save and find possible survivors under
hunks of fallen concrete and piles of bricks in toppled buildings.</P>
      <P>Although they did not discover any survivors, the French rescuers
found new friends among the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Thierry Bruge, who was injured by falling concrete during a
search mission, and was confined to a wheelchair with casts on his
right hand and right leg, said the warmth and hospitality shown by
the people of Taiwan were so overwhelming that he hated to leave.</P>
      <P>Team leader Pierre Bansart said he was highly impressed with the
brotherhood and compassion the people of the island shown to each
other during their trying time.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the team managed to grab just a few hours
f sleep during their five-day rescue mission, Bansart and his crew
traveled to Taiwan's National Police University before leaving the
island to demonstrate their rescue gear and lend their experience and
expertise to their Taiwan counterparts.</P>
      <P>They also expressed hope that Taiwan will stand on its own feet
again soon, and that it will establish its own rescue system before
long.</P>
      <P>Deputy team leader Dominique Autant, who saved an 18-month-old
baby girl from earthquake debris in India in 1993, said that when one
frees himself from psychological and material bondage and walks into
a calamity, he will find just how insignificant man is. "You will
face the world with a new attitude," he said.</P>
      <P>"You will not find a perfect life until you reach out to help
others," Autant added.</P>
      <P>From Russia came 73 emergency workers, three sniffer dogs, three
heavy-duty vehicles and some 30 metric tons of gear aboard a giant
Iluyshin military transport aircraft.</P>
      <P>The Russians pitched in with search and rescue work immediately
upon arrival at an air force base in Central Taiwan, working nonstop
for three days and three nights.</P>
      <P>A total of 21 emergency workers came from Germany, with 18
sniffer dogs and 1.5 metric tons of gear.</P>
      <P>Upon leaving for home after finishing their mission, the Germans
received thunderous applause from Taiwan people who gathered at the
airport to see them off, an act of gratitude that reduced some of the
team to tears.</P>
      <P>The team leader said that although he and his team have been to
many places around the world to carry out post-disaster rescue and
relief work, they found the esprit de corps and compassion in Taiwan
to be the most overwhelming.</P>
      <P>Germany also sent a funeral service delegation aimed at offering
Taiwan help with handling corpses and related sanitation issues.</P>
      <P>A member of the delegation, who alone handled 500 dead bodies in
one week in Turkey following the devastating earthquake there a month
ago, said he found there was actually little they could do in
Taiwan's quake-stricken areas.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan are respectful of the deceased, he said,
adding that they tried their utmost to store the dead bodies on ice,
but were unwilling to have the bodies of their relatives treated with
disinfectant.</P>
      <P>The rescuers from Spain greatly impressed their Taiwan
counterparts with their skills in handling emergency work.</P>
      <P>Showing no trace of the stereotypical "carefree" Latin
temperament, the Spanish emergency workers traveled quietly and
joined the rescue work professionally and solemnly, making the local
people, particularly the relatives of the victims, feel that they
were sincerely helped and respected.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the most highly praised team, however, was the group of
Mexican rescue workers. Although they arrived with only ropes and
hammers, the 14-strong Mexican team worked like their nickname --
"the moles" -- burrowing beneath debris and wreckage, sometimes
digging with their bare hands. The crew members, which include
doctors, lawyers, sailors and company executives, did not seem to
mind that they were mostly working only to retrieve bodies.</P>
      <P>One thing is for certain, though. None of them, from whichever
country, will ever be forgotten by those they toiled so hard to help,
and they will carry with them forever the gratitude and thanks of the
people of Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Whistles blew and car horns blared in
downtown Taipei on Friday as an expression of the sorrow local people
are feeling over the victims of the devastating earthquake which
struck on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>A ceremony to pray for the dead to rest in peace was held at the
scene of the Tunghsing building which collapsed in the 7.3-magnitude
earthquake, killing more than 80 people.</P>
      <P>Presiding over the ceremony, Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
extended his deepest sympathy to the families of the victims in an
emotional and choking voice.</P>
      <P>Ma said that although rescuers had worked day and night for the
past 10 days, they were unable to save more than 80 people buried by
the quake as they slept, which he said was his deepest regret.</P>
      <P>Ma also extended his appreciation for the search and rescue
workers for their strenuous efforts during the past 10 days. The
rescuers succeeded in rescuing 107 people, including a pair of
brothers who miraculously survived after being trapped for 130 hours
beneath tons of rubble.</P>
      <P>Saying that the end of the search effort will mark the beginning
of the reconstruction work, Ma vowed to provide every possible
support and assistance to the families of the victims.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that the loss of life will lead to an
awakening of the people to the danger of earthquakes and the need to
be prepared.</P>
      <P>Around 1,500 people from Taipei City Hall, police and military
personnel who took part in the search and rescue operations, families
of the victims, and religious groups took part in the ceremony to
soothe the souls of those who passed away in the quake.</P>
      <P>Workers began to clear the wreckage in preparation for
reconstruction work on Thursday evening, but they will continue to
search for about a dozen more bodies believed to be still trapped
under the wreckage.</P>
      <P>A police traffic cordon around the building since the quake was
lifted on Friday as work began to spray disinfectant and restore
sanitary conditions in the surrounding area.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Army personnel were
mobilized on Friday for a new mission: to demolish within one month
all houses and buildings in dangerous condition in Nantou County, the
hardest-hit area in the "921 earthquake."</P>
      <P>The commanding officer in charge of the military's post-quake
reconstruction efforts, Army Commander-in-Chief Chen Chen-hsiang,
issued the order, and also commanded his men to complete the
construction of 5,000 prefabricated houses in three weeks, to provide
temporary homes for thousands of homeless quake victims.</P>
      <P>More than 100,000 residents -- nearly 20 percent of the total
population of the county -- lost their homes in the 7.3-magnitude
temblor which ripped through central Taiwan on Sept. 21, taking more
than 2,100 lives and leaving over 8,700 injured, according to
statistics released by local governments.</P>
      <P>County officials say that a total of 30,000 housing units will be
needed to accommodate the homeless, but as of Thursday, the county
government could only ensure the construction of 9,500 temporary
housing units, 6,000 of which have been donated by public and private
relief groups.</P>
      <P>The local government is calling for more aid for the housing
reconstruction, the official added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in order to speed up the post-disaster reconstruction
in Nantou County, the central government has also commandeered
privately owned specialist vehicles such as cranes and tow trucks.</P>
      <P>More than 300 various heavy vehicles arrived on Friday in six
different relief centers in the mountainous county.</P>
      <P>The move was the result of the first order under an emergency
decree to commandeer 1,417 vehicles and heavy construction machinery,
as well as the personnel to operate the equipment, from the private
sector.</P>
      <P>The emergency decree, promulgated last Saturday by President Lee
Teng-hui and ratified by the legislator on Wednesday, empowers the
government to mobilize resources to speed recovery in the hardest-hit
regions.</P>
      <P>For each commandeered vehicle, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications will pay around NT$10,000 (US$314.47) per day for at
least one month, officials said. Under the terms of the decree, they

order will face punishment of up to seven years, and a possible fine

    <HEADLINE>4.5-MAGNITUDE QUAKE RATTLES EASTERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An earthquake measuring 4.5 on the
open-ended Richter scale hit Hualien in eastern Taiwan at 12:39 p.m.
on Friday, according to officials of the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB).</P>
      <P>The temblor occurred 14.5 kilometers northwest of Hualien, and
originated 20.8 kilometers beneath the earth's surface, said the CWB
officials.</P>
      <P>The quake had an intensity of 3 in the city of Hualien, 2 in
Silin township, Hualien County, 1 in Sankuan township of Taoyuan
County, and 1 in Suao City of Ilan County, bureau officials added.</P>
      <P>The magnitude of a quake is a measure of the amount of energy
released by an earthquake, while the intensity indicates the strength
of the temblor at various distances from the epicenter.</P>
      <P>A tremor with a magnitude of 7 and above is classed as extremely
dangerous, while a quake with a magnitude of 8.2 will release an
amount of energy equivalent to 1,000 times that of the atomic bomb
blast that destroyed Hiroshima during World War II.</P>
      <P>Zero intensity indicates movement that cannot be felt by people
but is measurable on seismographs, while an intensity level of 6
represents very strong movement that can cause buildings to collapse.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEXICAN RESCUERS LEAVE TAIWAN AMID REPORTS OF QUAKE IN HOMELAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nine rescue experts from Mexico left Taiwan
for home on Friday amid reports that their own country was jolted by
a 7.4 magnitude earthquake on Thursday.</P>
      <P>They were the last group of foreign rescuers to leave the
quake-stricken island, and the ones who stayed the longest.</P>
      <P>The Mexicans apparently left Taiwan with worries about their
families and compatriots' safety, saying that they were anxious to
fly home to join post-earthquake rescue and relief operations in
their homeland.</P>
      <P>Mexico sent 18 rescue specialists to Taiwan in three groups
shortly after Taiwan was rattled by a devastating earthquake on Sept.
21 which has so far claimed 2,100 lives and injured over 8,700
others. Nine other members of the elite Mexican team left earlier
this week.</P>
      <P>Mexico formed a 30-member rescue brigade nicknamed "Topos" -- the
Spanish word for mole -- after it was hit by a 8.3 magnitude temblor
in 1985 which resulted in more than 10,000 deaths.</P>
      <P>All Topos members have received stringent professional rescue and
relief training. Armed with enormous experience and superb skills,
the Mexican rescuers had given their all to the rescue and relief
operation upon their arrival in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the past eight days, the team has taken part in search and
rescue work in several hard-hit townships in central Taiwan,
including Taichung County's Tali and Kukuan as well as Nantou
County's Chushan, Puli and Chichi. They managed to help rescue five
survivors trapped in the wreckage of toppled buildings, as well as
helping to unearth buried bodies.</P>
      <P>The Mexicans often worked like moles, burrowing beneath debris
with primitive gear such as ropes and hammers. Sometimes, they even
dug with their bare hands.</P>
      <P>On the eve of their departure, the nine Mexicans still joined
forces with two local firefighters to dig a passage into a caved-in
tunnel along a mountainous stretch of central Taiwan's Cross-Island
Highway near Kukuan to search for a buried car believed to contain
two or three women. Although they failed to find the vehicle, their
bravery, devotion and professionalism won the respect of local
rescuers and much praise from members of the public.</P>
      <P>After more than a week of working in each other's company, the
Mexican rescuers and their local counterparts have developed bonds of
true friendship, and they prayed together for the well-being of
Taiwan and Mexico before the Topos team's departure from the central
Taiwan disaster zones on Thursday evening.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS QUAKE IMPACT ON UPCOMING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a Gallup opinion poll
released on Friday show that a devastating earthquake that rattled
Taiwan on Sept. 21 has had a strong impact on the island's next
presidential election scheduled for March 2000.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,070 adults residing throughout the
island was conducted from Sept. 29-30 by Gallup Taiwan Co. at the
request of Sanlih Entertainment Television, a local cable TV
service.</P>
      <P>Survey results found that nearly 50 percent of the respondents
said they have yet to make a decision on whom to vote for in next
year's presidential election. The ratio was far higher than those
recorded in similar polls conducted before the deadly earthquake,
which has claimed more than 2,100 lives and injured over 8,700
others.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, more than 60 percent said they oppose the
proposal that the presidential election be postponed due to the
recent killer quake.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that former Governor James Soong, a ruling
Kuomintang member who is running a rival campaign challenging
the party's presidential candidate, incumbent Vice President Lien
Chan, continued to lead the pack, with a 35.3 percent support rate.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian, the main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) presidential candidate, trailed behind Soong, with
16.9 percent of the respondents throwing support behind him.</P>
      <P>Only 10.5 percent said they would vote for Vice President Lien
if the presidential election were to take place the following day.
The three other presidential hopefuls -- Lee Ao, Hsu Hsin-liang and
Cheng Pang-chen -- only received marginal support rates of 0.3
percent, 0.2 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 34.4 percent said they have not yet decided for whom
to vote and 12.2 percent refused to answer the question.</P>
      <P>Liu Yi-chun, a research fellow with Academia Sinica,
Taiwan's highest academic institution, said the high ratio of
swing voters indicate that the powerful earthquake has had a
profound impact on the forthcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>"The impact includes making voters who originally had decided on
their choices change their minds or decline to express their
intentions," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Poll results also show that every presidential candidate's
personal reputation has declined significantly in the wake of
the deadly earthquake, Liu said.</P>
      <P>While 70 percent of those interviewed said they support the
promulgation of an emergency decree to facilitate post-earthquake
relief and reconstruction work, 62 percent said they nix the
suggestion by some lawmakers that next March's presidential election
be postponed.</P>
      <P>Asked who they think will be most competent to lead the country
in carrying out various post-quake reconstruction programs after the
2000 presidential election, Soong still led the pack, with a 30.6
percent support rate; followed by DPP's Chen, 16.9 percent; and
Lien, 14.2 percent.</P>

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Urban Search &amp; Rescue
(US&amp;R) working groups and California Task Force 3 is scheduled to
arrive in Taiwan on Sunday to gain first-hand knowledge of Taiwan's
handling of the aftermath of the Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Unlike other foreign rescue teams, such as the US rescue team

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Police Administration (NPA) on
Friday ordered police islandwide to begin a sweeping crackdown on
hoarding of materials badly needed for relief and reconstruction work
following the massive earthquake that shook Taiwan on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>The NPA issued the order after receiving tips that some retailers
were attempting to corner the market on daily necessities and other
goods in high demand after the 7.3-magnitude earthquake.</P>
      <P>An investigation team under the Criminal Investigation Bureau
(CIB) and the Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission have combined
efforts to look into several such cases.</P>
      <P>The CIB said the materials vulnerable to price-rigging are mainly
those badly needed in post-quake reconstruction work. Prices of some
of materials were reportedly even inflated to double the usual
prices.</P>
      <P>Police said that in addition to small shops, some large-scale
convenience stores, supermarkets and shopping malls are also subject
to checks by police.</P>
      <P>Police said retailers found hoarding materials in attempts to
sell them at higher prices will be punished with jail terms of one to
seven years, with possible maximum fines of NT$5 million to be
determined at judges' discretion.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  1  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A uranium leakage such as the one which
occurred in Japan will not happen in Taiwan because the uranium used
in local nuclear power plants is imported from foreign suppliers,
Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) officials said on Friday.</P>
      <P>The officials said in addition that Japan's uranium leak
originated from a fuel processing plant of a type not used in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to foreign news reports, a private uranium fuel
processing plant located 140 kilometers northeast of Tokyo leaked
high-grade uranium, sending radiation levels soaring to 4,000 times
greater than normal, in an unprecedented emergency.</P>
      <P>Three nuclear workers were hospitalized, more than 160 people
were evacuated, and thousands of nearby residents were reported to be
sheltering indoors.</P>
      <P>The fuel used in Taiwan is encased in inert metal when it is
imported, making it very stable, and the officials stressed it cannot
leak or contaminate the environment.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, they went on, the nuclear fuel does not reach its
critical point until it is treated in the reactor of the nuclear
power plant, and each plant has a double-separated electrical
protection system to further decrease the possibility of radiation
contamination.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI ANNOUNCES SUSPENSION OF TAIWAN-MANILA FLIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Sept.  30 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan on Friday announced suspension of
flights to and from Manila, effective Tuesday, after negotiators
failed in a last-ditch effort to address the stormy dispute over
airline seat quotas for each side.</P>
      <P>Shih Ting, director general of the East Asian and Pacific Affairs
Department under Taiwan's Foreign Ministry, said at a press
conference that flight resumption will depend on the result of future
negotiation.</P>
      <P>Shih said that Taiwan will adopt "a series of necessary measures
to cope with the latest development and that the Philippines should
take responsibility for all subsequent developments."</P>
      <P>Shih said that the measures will include a gradual reduction in
the number of Philippine workers in Taiwan, of whom there are
currently more than 100,000. He added that Taiwan will seek to import
labor from other foreign countries, possibly including Vietnam and
Nicaragua, to fill the vacancy left by Filipinos.</P>
      <P>He accused mainland China of "manipulating the incident," and
said that Taiwan has lodged a protest with the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Shih said that Beijing has driven a wedge between Taiwan and the
Philippines by complicating the purely commercial bilateral talks on
the renewal of a 1996 air accord. Shih based his accusation on
information collected through diplomatic and other channels, but he
did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>In an effort to save its poorly-managed flagship carrier,
Philippines Airlines (PAL), the Philippines demanded at the first
round of negotiations, held in Manila July 29-30, that the weekly
quota, stipulated in the 1996 pact as 9,600 passengers for each side,
be lowered to 4,000, but that reduction was rejected.</P>
      <P>During the second round of talks in Taipei between PAL and the
two Taiwan airlines flying the Taipei-Manila route, China Airlines
(CAL) and EVA Airways, Taiwan agreed to cut the weekly passenger
number to 6,500, but the Philippines then demanded a further cut to
3,000, resulting in a breakdown in negotiations.</P>
      <P>Manila on Thursday unilaterally announced termination of the
Taiwan-Philippines route, but at the request of Philippine President
Joseph Estrada, both sides held one additional day of negotiations
Friday, though it yielded no concrete results.</P>
      <P>The termination of flights may cost CAL and EVA Airways NT$2
billion (US$62.5 million) annually in lost revenue.</P>

attain freedom, democracy and equal wealth in the future.</P>
      <P>Sheu made the remarks in response to a statement by mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin marking the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of the Beijing government on Friday.</P>
      <P>Jiang stated that following the return of Hong Kong and Macau to

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SCHEME UNDERMINES TAIWAN'S LAUNCH OF SATELLITE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's launch of the ROCSAT-2, the
island's second satellite for scientific research, was again delayed
due to interference from Beijing, sources from the National Science
Council (NSC) said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The project is doomed to be delayed because the contracted German
builder of the ROCSAT-2 -- Dornier Satellite System GmbH -- can not
obtain an export permit from the German government, according to NSC
officials.</P>
      <P>NSC Chairman Huang Cheng-tai declined to comment whether the
ROCSAT-2 development project will consequently be aborted. His only
comment was, "let's do our utmost for the country."</P>
      <P>According to sources, Dornier has made out a contingent proposal
that aims to keep the launch plan in place while simultaneously
avoiding direct confrontation with Beijing over the issue.</P>
      <P>NSC and Dornier signed a contract on Feb. 8 of this year to
jointly build the ROCSAT-2 spacecraft as well as one of the two
payload systems to be installed on the satellite.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, NSC's Space Program Office (SPO) and Dornier
will form a concerted team of specialists to jointly complete the
spacecraft's design and make up, develop and manufacture spacecraft
parts and components, as well as assist relevant Taiwan companies
develop sub-system parts and components.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, Dornier will develop a payload system
-- a remote sensing instrument -- for the satellite. The payload
system will have a high resolution and varied-band spectra to give
the research and communications satellite high-performance
capabilities. The capabilities include the scanning and identifying
of objects two meters from the ground surface.</P>
      <P>It is known that Beijing has constantly interfered with the
project. Beijing claims the ROCSAT-2 will be used to conduct
espionage activities as it will carry a high-performance camera.</P>
      <P>The ROCSAT-2 was originally scheduled to be launched in late
2002. However, due to Beijing's interference, the German government
beginning early this year, has on three separate occasions postponed
giving Dornier an export permit.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement, Dornier must return the US$600,000
deposit to Taiwan if it fails to obtain an export permit by the end
of August.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday, the SPO has yet to receive its deposit back from
Dornier. Huang added that the space office has already suspended
payments for any further costs concerning the satellite.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of an export permit, SPO and Dornier actually

SPO mission was sent to Germany to work in a Dornier-contracted
laboratory in the southern German town of Friedrichshafen.</P>
      <P>Several Taiwan companies, including Shihlin Electric &amp;

    <HEADLINE>CPC NOT TO HIKE PETROLEUM PRICE IN OCTOBER</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) said on Saturday that despite the rising cost of crude oil, it
is not planning to hike the price of petroleum this month.</P>
      <P>CPC officials said that the corporation imported 22.55 million
barrels of crude oil in September at a cost of US$20.13 per barrel.
This compared with US$18.15 per barrel in August.</P>
      <P>They noted that during the past week, West Texas crude averaged
US$24.5 per barrel, adding that with the surge of world crude
oil prices, CPC is under pressure to hike its price.</P>
      <P>However, in order to stabilize domestic prices in the wake of the
7.3-magnitude earthquake that hit Taiwan on Sept. 21, CPC has
temporarily decided not to hike the price of petroleum.</P>
      <P>The CPC officials said that they will review the domestic price
situation and reconstruction progress before making a decision
on whether to rise the price of petroleum in November.</P>
      <P>To reflect rising import costs, CPC has hiked the price of
petroleum four times since April of this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is an alternative model for
mainland China in Beijing's drive towards further economic and
political development into the 21st century, the Australian
Financial Review said Saturday in an editorial.</P>
      <P>The editorial, titled "Time Is Ripe for Some Soul Searching in
China, said "Taiwan provides an alternative model of political and
economic development to the communist model. China needs to recognize
this to avoid conflict over Taiwan's future."</P>
      <P>It says two decades of market-oriented economic reform under the
Communist Party have brought wealth and stability to some Chinese.</P>
      <P>"But the inefficiency of state-owned enterprises and the
difficulty of burying losses in a modernizing banking system are
putting a brake on future economic growth," the editorial says.</P>
      <P>It says despite its economic reform, China still needs more
reforms in order to join the World Trade Organization.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 2 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite Beijing reiterated on Friday that it
would push ahead toward peaceful unification with Taiwan under the
"one country, two systems" policy, its strategy of achieving the goal
by military threat has not changed, a ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's mainland affairs
department, made the remarks in reaction to mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin's speech at Tienanmen square marking the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Chang said there was nothing new in Jiang's speech, stressing
that Beijing's strategy of "forcing a peaceful unification through
military intimidation" has not changed.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Jiang's claim that "... socialism is the only way
to save and develop China," Chang said that in light of historic
developments, Jiang's wording should be corrected to "only China is
saving socialism from collapse."</P>
      <P>Chang noted that only when mainland China accelerates economic
development and pushes for democratic reforms can cross-strait
relations be harmoniously developed.</P>
      <P>He said President Lee Teng-hui's proposal last week that the
proper way for cross-strait relations to develop would be under the
precepts of "ruling separately while standing at parity," "peaceful
competition," and "unification under the principle of democracy."
Chang said the precepts definitely defined the contents of Taiwan's
policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang suggested that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait resolve
their disputes through dialogue and warned that if Beijing continues
to impose military threats on Taiwan, the alienation across the
strait would only widen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO TAIWAN CARRIERS CONTINUE CHARTERED FLIGHTS TO PHILIPPINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Oct.  2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The sky over the Bashi Channel between the
Republic of China and the Philippines was quiet on Saturday as the
two countries have suspended scheduled direct flight services.</P>
      <P>The Manila downtown and airport offices of the two Taiwan
carriers -- China Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways -- which originally
operated scheduled flights between Taiwan and the Philippines remain
open on Saturday to handle the aftermath.</P>
      <P>The two carriers arranged for Taipei-bound passengers who had
made reservations to take a Cathay Pacific Airways (CPA) flight from
Manila to Taipei via Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>CAL and EVA executives said their service counters at the
Manila airport will continue operations for at least one week to
arrange for passengers to transfer to other airlines.</P>
      <P>Travel agencies in Manila have long not accepted reservations
for Manila-Taipei and Manila-Kaohsiung flights and demanded that
passengers take CPA flights to Taipei or Kaohsiung via Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>According to airline sources, a CPA flight ticket from Manila to
Taipei via Hong Kong costs about US$400, nearly 60 percent higher
than the price offered by CAL and EVA for a direct flight from
Manila to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung, CAL
arranged for 70-plus passengers who originally planned to take its
CI-637 flight to Manila early Saturday morning to transfer to other
flights due to the suspension of direct Taiwan-Philippine airlinks.</P>
      <P>Thirty-one of those passengers took CAL's CI-623 flight to
Hong Kong at 8 a.m. They would then took a British Airways flight to
Manila from Hong Kong. The remaining 42 passengers took CAL's CI-625
flight to Hong Kong at 1 p.m. This group of passengers then took a
CPA flight to Manila. As CAL didn't exact additional charges for
such transfers, all passengers accepted the carrier's arrangements.</P>
      <P>CAL said those who made reservations and purchased tickets before
Saturday will all be exempted from paying additional charges for
"detoured" flights. However, those who purchase tickets after
Saturday will have to pay differentials between direct and indirect
flights.</P>
      <P>In contrast, EVA has chosen to offer refunds to its clients as
it only has limited number of flights to Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The ROC's Civil Aeronautics Administration on Friday announced
suspension of scheduled flights between Taiwan and the Philippines,
effective Saturday, after negotiations failed in a last-ditch effort
to address disputes over airline seat quotas for each side.</P>
      <P>For the time being, bilateral airborne traffic will only
rely on chartered flights operated by two Taiwan carriers --
Far East Air Transport Corp. and U-Land Air Lines.</P>
      <P>Far East now only operates chartered flights between Kaohsiung
and the Subic Bay, a stronghold for Taiwan-invested companies in the
Philippines. An airline executive said the company will suspend
chartered Kaohsiung-Subic Bay flights a month later.</P>
      <P>U-Land Air Lines currently operates chartered flights from
Taiwan to two Philippine tourist resorts -- Cebu and Laoag. The
company said it has yet to decide when to suspend its chartered
flight services to the two Philippine cities.</P>

jointly-sponsored by the China External Trade Development Council and
the Bonsai Art Association of Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Bonsai gardeners and ornamental stones collectors from 23 nations
around the world participated in Saturday's exhibition by displaying
hundreds of examples of exquisite bonsai works and collected stones
with natural and story features. Japanese collectors call the art of
collecting the stones "Suiseki."</P>
      <P>Over 100 pieces of antique Chinese bonsai pottery, from the Sun,
Ming, Yuan, and Ching dynasties, are also on display. In addition to
the exhibition, there will be workshops, in which bonsai artists, as
well as stone and old pottery collectors, from Germany, Indonesia,
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, will deliver speeches regarding their
experience and involvement in collecting and/or creating the unique
art form.</P>
      <P>The first Asia-Pacific bonsai, stone and Chinese antique pottery

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) on
Saturday urged the public to be on guard against attempts by Beijing
to use the devastating "921 earthquake" to drive a wedge between the
government and the people here.</P>
      <P>MND officials said that local people should remain alert to any
attempt by Beijing to use the tragedy to undermine the public's trust
toward the government, saying that in the past Beijing has
systematically used ploys to undermine the government.</P>
      <P>They said that local people should be aware that the government
has devoted all its effort to relief and reconstruction efforts since
the massive quake hit Taiwan on Sept. 21. The killer tremor has
claimed more than 2,200 lives and injured over 8,700 others to date.</P>
      <P>The officials also said that military police will increase
patrols in the earthquake-stricken areas to ensure order and security
is maintained.</P>
      <P>Although large numbers of military personnel have contributed to
rescue and reconstruction efforts in the wake of the massive quake,
the defense officials said the combat readiness of the military has
not been compromised.</P>
      <P>They reported that the military continues to closely monitor the
mainland Chinese military to prevent any attempt to ambush or
infiltrate Taiwan while the island recovers from the earthquake.</P>
      <P>They said that Beijing's military movements have remained normal
in the wake of the quake. Intelligence reports do not indicate that
Beijing will attempt any military move, since any action would risk
international condemnation.</P>
      <P>The MND officials added that immediately after the massive
earthquake the ministry set up a contingency center. The center's
responsibilities are to keep abreast of all relief efforts, heed the
needs of the quake stricken people, maintain order and collect public
opinion.</P>
      <P>In addition, four advance command posts have also been set up in
the most seriously damaged areas of Nantou, Hsinser, Sungshan and

    <HEADLINE>157 PEOPLE BENEFITED FROM VICTIMS PROTECTION LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 157 people had benefited from
the Victims of Crime Protection Law as of the end of September, the
Ministry of Justice (MOJ) reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The ministry released the tally in connection with the
celebration of the first anniversary of the enforcement of the
Victims of Crime Protection Law.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong told a news conference that the
law has provided rays of light and hope for victims of crime by
offering them protection and financial compensation.</P>
      <P>Noting that each application for protection or financial
compensation implies a hard-to-heal wound to the victim and his or
her family, Yeh said measures taken under the protection law have
helped warm up their broken hearts.</P>
      <P>Yeh went on to say that the implementation of the crime victims
protection law also symbolizes a change in the government's criminal
policy, shifting from solely emphasizing investigation of evidence
of crime to seeking a balance between probing evidence and
protecting victims of criminal activities.</P>
      <P>Since the law took effect on Oct. 1, 1998, Yeh said local people
have gradually become familiar with its provisions and that the
number of applicants for benefits of the law has also increased
steadily.</P>
      <P>"The accumulated amount of compensation given to those who were
seriously injured or crippled due to other people's criminal
activities and to bereaved families of those who were murdered now
approaches NT$10 million per month," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Quoting MOJ tallies, Yeh said accumulated financial compensation
offered to crime victims had reached NT$54.23 million as of Sept.
30.</P>
      <P>To establish a comprehensive judicial protection network for
crime victims, Yeh said the MOJ pushed for the formation of an
independent crime victims protection association in January this
year. The association has so far set up 21 branch offices throughout
the island to offer timely services and protection for crime
victims.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yeh said the ministry has pooled resources with
other government agencies, including the Ministry of Education, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, the Council
of Labor Affairs and the Government Information Office, to offer
necessary support and assistance to victims of domestic violence,
rape and traffic accidents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EARTHQUAKE FURTHER SADDENS LESS-PRIVILEGED ABORIGINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  2  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Sept. 21 devastating earthquake that
gave Central Taiwan a geographical facelift by flattening peaks and
creating lakes, has also uprooted aboriginal homes and shattered
their fates.</P>
      <P>After the deadliest earthquake this century struck Taiwan, all
roads leading to aboriginal villages in the Hsinyi and Jenai
townships of Nantou County, just near the epicenter, were blocked and
damaged, stranding members of the Atayal and Bunun tribes on a
completely isolated island.</P>
      <P>Most of the survivors were elderly, women and children. To keep
them alive in the wake of the earthquake, physically strong young men
toiled round-the-clock on collapsed mountains, carrying water and
food back to the village.</P>
      <P>Because the roads the younger men of the tribe used had rocks
continually falling from toppled mountains, each trip took at least
six hours.</P>
      <P>Aboriginal policemen, numbering a mere five in the Hsinyi and
Jenai areas, became one of the last-remaining hopes of the stranded
tribal people.</P>
      <P>Two of the policemen, Chuan Chung-ming and Sung Chao-tien in
their Han Chinese names, climbed onto demolished mountains in an
effort to save seven elders. Since roads and adjacent mountains had
been washed away by landslides, the duo braved a turbulent river
using ropes to connect them to reach the elders. They helped the weak
elders swim to the opposite bank and to safety before carrying them
on their backs one by one to their police station for settlement.</P>
      <P>Representatives of 16 aboriginal and supporting groups met in
Taipei Saturday to solicit relief and reconstruction assistance for
the Atayal and Bunun people who have made the mountains of Central
Taiwan their homes for centuries.</P>
      <P>At the gathering, which carried the theme of "Meihomisan,
Muhuaishu," the participants encouraged the Atayal and Bunun tribes
people to "live well" and to "hang on." "Meihomisan," a Bunun phrase,
means to live and survive well, while "Muhuaishu," an Atayal group of
words, means to hang on and be strong.</P>
      <P>The representatives said the aborigines were not only the last
groups of survivors to receive relief goods, they also received the
least amount of the least-wanted supplies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The spokesman for the US Department of
State, James Rubin, said on Friday that mainland China and Taiwan
should refrain from any action that might raise tensions across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while answering a question concerning the

support for Taiwan had emboldened President Lee Teng-hui and was
making war inevitable.</P>
      <P>Zhu reportedly told a group of foreign business leaders in
Shanghai that "sooner or later, an armed resolution will settle the

      <P>Rubin noted that "it is not a new position for China to view the

our policy as one of the reasons Taiwan does not proceed on a course
that China would prefer on any given subject."</P>
      <P>"So there is nothing new," he pointed out, adding that "we are

      <P>Rubin went on to say that "our statements and actions have been
designed to reduce tensions and promote a peaceful resolution of

    <TEXT>
      <P>Four more countries -- Malawi, the
Commonwealth of Dominica, Haiti and Grenada -- voiced support for
the Republic of China's bid to re-join the United Nations at a UN
General Assembly debate session on Friday.</P>
      <P>Malawi Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation
Minister Brown Mpinganjira said at the session that the United
Nations should consider issues related to the ROC's representation in
the world body based on the principle of membership universality and
respect for national equality.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC is a democratic country with a population
of more than 21 million, Mpinganjira said the United Nations should
not continue to ignore its existence.</P>
      <P>The Malawi minister stressed that he believes the ROC's
re-entry to the UN and its affiliated organizations will be an
important factor to international peace, stability and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Dominica Foreign Minister Norris
Charles said the ROC is democratic model in Asia and has the
capability and willingness to fulfill the obligations stipulated in
the UN Charter.</P>
      <P>Over the past decades, Charles said the ROC has scored
remarkable achievements in economic development, which has enabled it
to help other developing countries to fight against poverty through
various aid programs.</P>
      <P>Charles said his country is concerned that the United Nations has
rejected the admission of such an industrialized country which has a
democratically elected government to exercise sovereignty on a
clearly defined territory.</P>
      <P>The United Nations must take steps to correct this unfair
situation to ensure that the people of the Republic of China on
Taiwan have a voice in the world body and its affiliated
organizations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Haitian Foreign Minister Emmanuel Fritz Lonchamp
expressed his country's concern about the development of relations
across the Taiwan Strait, urging the two sides of the strait to take
appropriate measures to create an environment for forging mutual
trust, respect and goodwill. By so doing, Lonchamp said
he believes that people on both sides of the strait will
benefit.</P>
      <P>Lonchamp also expressed regards for victims of recent natural
catastrophes in Turkey, Taiwan, the Bahamas and the United States.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister of Grenada Mark Isaac also said at the
session that the United Nations should review its Resolution No. 2758
adopted in 1971, which gave the China seat to mainland China at the
expense of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Praising the ROC as a democratic country fully upholding
humanitarianism, Isaac said the ROC has generously used its
hard-earned money to help other developing countries. "The ROC has
assisted in manpower training and provided professional expertise
and capital aid to help other countries become self-reliant," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Isaac further said that the ROC has created an economic miracle,
becoming the world's 14th largest trading power and holding one of
the world's largest foreign exchange stash.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the international community should not ignore
such a vibrant and generous country, Isaac said the United Nations
should respect the 22 million ROC people's basic right to take part
in UN activities.</P>
      <P>During the UN General Assembly's two-week general debate
session, many other countries, mostly the ROC's diplomatic allies,
have also spoken for the ROC's UN bid.</P>

leaving over 8,700 injured.</P>
      <P>After being briefed at Puli's relief headquarters concerning
military relief operations, Lee appeared concerned about how quake
victims were being sheltered, waste eliminated, houses and buildings
in dangerous condition dismantled, and temporary houses built for
those who lose their home in the massive earthquake.</P>
      <P>The president asked local authorities to listen to the people's
voice, as well as to the opinions of experts and scholars, when
rebuilding Puli.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice President Lien Chan, accompanied by Chairman Chau
Shuo-puo of the Taiwan Provincial Government, inspected the site
chosen in Shueili village for the establishment of a shelters complex
for quake victims.</P>
      <P>Lien called the 16-hectare land, owned by the state-run Taiwan
Power Company, perfect for the planned shelter. The land will
eventually hold more than 1,500 prefabricated houses. Lien instructed
that the work continue without hesitation.</P>
      <P>"There is no need for you to ask for instructions or approvals of
upper authorities on the works that should be done immediately," Lien
stressed to Shueili village leadership.</P>
      <P>At another quake stricken area in Nantou, Premier Vincent Siew
revealed that a private donation quake fund management foundation
will soon be set up to assist on-going governmental efforts in relief
and post-quake reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Siew noted Koo Chen-fu, leader of the Koo's Group and a prominent
business tycoon who is also Taipei's top negotiator to Beijing, is
considered the best man to chair the planned foundation.</P>
      <P>In related news, Vice Premier Liu Chao-hsuan announced in
Taichung that the government has finished a short-term employment
plan, aimed at providing work opportunities to quake victims,
allowing them to have a chance to "earn their own relief aid."</P>
      <P>Liu said that 20 job introduction centers around the island, run
by the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs, have been mobilized
for the mission. So far more than 1,300 quake victims have responded
to the employment program, by seeking a temporary job, he noted.</P>
      <P>The vice premier is also the executive-in-chief of the Executive
Yuan's commission for the promotion of post-quake reconstruction

      <P>More than 8,000 rounds of ammunition went
missing from an air force base in northern Taiwan, the Air Force
General Headquarters confirmed on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The ammunition for 65K2 rifles of the logistics squadron
stationed at Taoyuan Air Force Base were found to be missing during a
check on Sunday morning. Someone had apparently broken into the
munitions depot by tampering with the steel chain on the door.</P>
      <P>The Air Force is working with police to investigate the case.</P>
      <P>Police were informed of the theft at about 8:00 Sunday morning,
but did not publicly announce the incident in the hope that the
ammunition could be quickly retrieved.</P>
      <P>Police said that as the quantity of missing ammunition is large,
and the depot's location is somewhat secret, they suspected that
someone familiar with the area around the depot, such as active or
retired military personnel of the air force base, were responsible.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Sunday extended appreciation for the efforts of countries that
support membership in the United Nations for the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>During the UN General Assembly's general debate session from
Sept. 20 to Oct. 2, 25 countries supported the ROC's UN bid, urging
admission based on the principles of universal membership and respect
for national equality.</P>
      <P>The countries also expressed concern about a peaceful resolution
of cross-strait issues and extended condolences for victims of the
killer earthquake that rocked Taiwan Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials noted that since the commencement of separate
government of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in 1949, the ROC has
practiced democracy and become the legitimate representative of
22 million people residing in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.</P>
      <P>They said that Beijing is trying to create a facade that Taiwan
is only a local government by claiming that it represents Taiwan in
the international community.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Beijing's request that other countries
get its approval before lending support to rescue operations in the
wake of the Sept. 21 earthquake is a gross violation of humanitarian
principles and a move that they said has demonstrated how ridiculous

      <P>They said the unfair treatment of Taiwan needs to be addressed

    <HEADLINE>QUAKE-DAMAGED SUN MOON LAKE UPGRADED TO NATIONAL SCENIC AREA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nantou,  Oct.  3  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To facilitate reconstruction of Sun Moon
Lake, the central and Nantou County governments decided to upgrade it
from a provincial-level scenic area to a national one, Nantou County
Magistrate Peng Pai-hsien said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The lake area suffered damage in the devastating earthquake that
rocked Taiwan on Sept. 21. The national scenic area will be jointly
managed and operated by the central government and the Nantou County
government.</P>
      <P>Kuanghua Island, situated in the center of the lake, will be
renamed as Lalu Island, which is the name used by the local
aboriginal Shao tribe, with the hope of honoring the souls of the
Shao's ancestors, said Peng.</P>
      <P>Several renowned hotels in the area that were damaged during the
quake are not allowed to rebuild on their original sites until an
overall reconstruction plan can be established, Peng added.</P>
      <P>Sun Moon Lake, located in Nantou County in central Taiwan, was
one of Taiwan's most famous tourist spots before the earthquake
struck on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>In order to raise enough funds for the cash-strapped county that
has relied heavily on agricultural products for tax revenue, the
county magistrate said it is essential to develop the tourism
industry to broaden the county's tax revenue source.</P>
      <P>As a result, the lake was chosen as an important source of
revenue, and Premier Vincent Siew has promised to pour in a
considerable amount of capital to rebuild the lake which was once
flooded with tourists.</P>
      <P>As for Kuanghua Island, Peng said it was originally used by the
Shao to worship their ancestors and renaming it Lalu Island actually
restores its original name.

    <HEADLINE>TAIPOWER LIFTS INDUSTRIAL POWER RATIONING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) lifted its
rationing of electricity on the industrial sector on Monday, one day
earlier than promised, in the wake of the devastating Sept. 21
earthquake.</P>
      <P>The end of the ration allowed some 1,000 high-voltage users in 12
industrial zones in northern Taiwan to resume full production. Power
to the 12 zones was disrupted immediately after the killer earthquake
struck central Taiwan. Even though some power was restored to
Taiwan's industrial sector shortly after the earthquake, until Monday
the industrial sector had been subject to the Taipower-imposed power
rationing.</P>
      <P>The killer earthquake, measuring 7.3 on the open-ended Richter
scale, ruined high-voltage substations near the quake's epicenter in
central Taiwan, resulting in widespread disruption of electricity to
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipower, Taiwan's sole electricity supplier and distributor,
managed to transmit 700,000 kilowatts of electricity generated from
the Taichung Thermal Power Plant near the Taichung Harbor to northern
Taiwan Monday by bypassing collapsed substations. It sent the power
directly through the Omei Ultra-High Voltage Transmission Line near
Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>The north-bound transmission is expected to increase to 1.3
million to 1.5 million megawatts Tuesday, Taipower officials said.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials meanwhile attributed cooler weather as another
factor enabling Taipower to lift the industrial power rationing
earlier than scheduled.</P>
      <P>Monday's lift of industrial power rationing will help hundreds of
electronic and high-technology companies in northern Taiwan located
beyond the famous Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park to
recalibrate their sensitive equipment and facilities.</P>
      <P>The majority of Taiwan's computer and high-tech companies are
located in northern Taiwan. The island produces more than half of the
world's chip sets and motherboards, plus 45 percent of all notebook
computers.</P>
      <P>With more electricity expected to be transmitted from southern
and central Taiwan to the north in following days, Taipower officials
said household power rationing is expected to be lifted on Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>Full power restoration for the entire island is expected on Oct.
12, they added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipower is striving to build the Third North-South
345 KV Ultra-High Voltage Transmission Line in order to ensure a
steady supply of electricity in the long run, they said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Monday that
the Cabinet will push for the establishment of a non-governmental
commission to manage private donations for post-earthquake relief and
reconstruction programs.</P>
      <P>Siew made the statement at a meeting of a Cabinet special task
force overseeing progress in post-quake rehabilitation work, which
focused discussion on the management of private donations for
helping surviving quake victims rebuild their homes and lives.</P>
      <P>Preliminary tallies show that the special bank account opened by
the Cabinet to accept private donations has so far received more
than NT$4.63 billion from domestic corporations, civic organizations
and individuals.</P>
      <P>In addition, many local residents have also donated relief funds
to various non-governmental organizations, with the accumulated
amount estimated at NT$4 billion. Cabinet sources said the
government still lacks a clear picture about this part of donations.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are currently many channels to collect private
donations, Premier Siew said he sees a need to integrate all these
donations to ensure their effective use.</P>
      <P>Siew said the Cabinet should take actions to organize an
independent private commission to manage the huge funds, adding that
the commission can be led by C. F. Koo, a respected business tycoon
and senior adviser to President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Other social celebrities or elected representatives, including
Academia Sinica President Yuan T. Lee and Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng, can serve as the commission's board members, Siew
said, adding that the proposed non-governmental fund management
commission should manage the donations in line with the principles of
justice, openness and transparency.</P>
      <P>An earthquake, measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale, rattled
Taiwan on Sept. 21, claiming more than 2,200 lives, injuring at least

      <P>The armed forces will stay in
earthquake-stricken areas to help out with post-disaster
reconstruction although the uniformed men and women have ceased
participating in search and rescue efforts, Defense Minister Tang Fei
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Tang added that the military will continue to provide stricken
people with all the resources necessary to facilitate post-quake
reconstruction.</P>
      <P>On Monday the top defense official again made fact-finding tours
of military bases in central Taiwan which bore the full blunt of the
Sept. 21 devastating earthquake, the deadliest to hit Taiwan this
century, with a death toll exceeding 2,200.</P>
      <P>Tang visited two military bases in the hardest hit areas which
are currently being used as makeshift relief camps as well as two
temporary shelter bases built by the military several days after the
deadly quake struck on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Tang said since the killer quake rocked Taiwan, the military has
mobilized 200,000 men to pitch in with rescue, search and emergency
assistance work.</P>
      <P>Now, 13 days after the quake, the military is focusing its work
and attention on reconstruction, as well as accommodating and
resettling survivors and people who were made homeless by the quake.</P>
      <P>Some 11,000 people are currently taking refuge in 19 military
shelter bases across central Taiwan, according to Tang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of National Defense is preparing to build
235 temporary housing units in the now-demolished Tungshih Hospital.
The former hospital's land will be converted into a rehabilitation
complex for stricken people with convenient stores, an activity
center, nursing homes, medical clinics and an amusement park for
children in its vicinity, Tang added.</P>

      <P>An earthquake measuring 4.7 on the

amid countless aftershocks from the devastating earthquake that
struck the island Sept. 21, said sources from the Central Weather
Bureau on Monday.</P>
      <P>The temblor, with an epicenter some 21.5 kilometers northeast of
scenic Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan's geographical heart, was found
originating 4.5 kilometers beneath the earth's surface, the weather
bureau's seismologists reported.</P>
      <P>The temblor had an intensity of 3.0 in Mingchien in Nantou County
and at Alishan (Mt. Ali) in Chiayi County, and 2.0 in Sihu in Yunlin
County and in Chiayi City.</P>

jolted the Central Mountain Range, the backbone of Taiwan, with an
epicenter some 29.8 kilometers south of Yushan (Jade Mountain), the

stricken areas out of curiosity, adding that this is a critical time
for reconstruction in the wake of the devastating earthquake that
rocked Taiwan Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Nantou County, which in the past has been a popular tourist
destination due to its idyllic scenery, tasty rice wine and lush
green mountain ranges, suffered heavy losses in the massive quake.</P>
      <P>Many roads, bridges, historical buildings and scenic spots were
badly damaged or destroyed by the 7.3-magnitude temblor and
aftershocks, as well as by the mudslides they triggered.</P>
      <P>Visitors, after watching days' worth of television images of the
quake's aftermath, have obviously decided to see for themselves,
resulting in serious traffic jams on only the second weekend after
the killer quake.</P>
      <P>Some stood on the side of the embankment of Chuoshui River to
look at the ruptured Mingchu Bridge. Some watched the office of the
Fenghuang Bird Center being covered by a mudslide, and some took
pictures of tilted or collapsed buildings, especially the landmark
buildings of the Chichi Train Station and the Lantien Institute.</P>
      <P>Some even came to the temporary shelter centers for people who
were made homeless by the quake. The visitors were in high spirits
and well-dressed. Their appearance raised the ire of many stricken
victims.</P>
      <P>Police said that some of the outsiders were spending the weekend
visiting relatives and friends in the stricken areas, but most other
visitors just came out of curiosity.</P>
      <P>Local reports said that travel agents have taken advantage of the
worst earthquake in decades in Taiwan to try to reap benefits from
the terrible tragedy, which has to date claimed the lives of more
than 2,200 and injured more than 8,300.</P>
      <P>Some travel agents offered a one day tour of the stricken area in
Puli, with departure points in Kaohsiung, Taichung and Taipei.</P>
      <P>The tour includes the hardest hit areas of several townships and
villages, such as Chaotun, Kuohsin and Puli.</P>
      <P>The tilted and collapsed Puli Winery, Township Hall, police
stations, and Chichi Rail Station have been the favorites of the
throng of tourists. Some of them even crossed police lines to take
photographs.</P>
      <P>Puli Township chief Chang Hung-ming said that the town is
planning to preserve collapsed landmark buildings to bear witness to
the catastrophic quake.</P>
      <P>But he said that this is hardly the time for tourism as the town
is currently occupied with reconstruction work. He urged tourists to
have more patience, saying that they will be heartily welcomed after
one or two months of reconstruction.</P>

      <P>Construction shares took the lead among the eight major stock
categories, ending the day with 4-percent gains.</P>
      <P>Chemical and plastics issues, despite posting a 0.4-percent loss,

    <HEADLINE>'MIRACLE' BROTHERS PITCH IN WITH QUAKE RELIEF EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two brothers who were miraculously saved
after the killer earthquake that hit Taiwan last month have pitched
in with volunteer relief work in central Taiwan to repay the debt
they feel they owe the Goddess of Mercy.</P>
      <P>The two brothers, Sun Chi-kuang, 20, and Sun Chi-feng, 25,
accompanied by Buddhist monks and their father, Sun Cheng, on Sunday
went to Chungliao Village in Nantou County, one of the areas hit
hardest by the Sept. 21 magnitude-7.3 earthquake, to help prepare
meals for those affected by the quake.</P>
      <P>Facing the bright lights of the media, the two brothers did not
say much, only that they felt so sorry when watching TV reports or
reading newspaper accounts of the miserable situation in
quake-stricken areas.</P>
      <P>They added that coming back from near death, they hope to do
something for society. They were encouraged by their mother, a devout
Buddhist, to join volunteer projects of Fokuangshan, a large Buddhist
group based in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Suns said that though what they can do is little, they will
do their best to help every quake-stricken area. The brothers will be
joined by their father on their journey through all areas affected by
the quake.</P>
      <P>The two men were rescued after being trapped for 130 hours under
tons of rubble after the 12-story building in which they lived in
Taipei collapsed during the devastating temblor.</P>
      <P>Chi-kuang actually walked out of the wreckage on his own.
According to his account, he emerged after hearing the Goddess of
Mercy tell him to escape from a tiny hole in the wreckage. He said
that he had clung to life by eating some rotten apples found in a
nearby refrigerator, and by drinking water sprayed over the rubble by
firefighters and drinking his own urine. Chi-fong was later rescued
to the great excitement of rescue workers.</P>
      <P>When they were in the hospital for treatment after their ordeal,
the two brothers vowed to devote the remainder of their lives to
doing good deeds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YEN'S RISE TO BOOST TAIWAN EXPORTS TO JAPAN: BOFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The yen's strong resurgence against the
dollar and Japan's recent robust economic performance are expected to
result in spectacular growth for Taiwan's exports to Japan, said
government economic officials on Monday.</P>
      <P>Officials with the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs pointed out that the total value of
Taiwan's exports to Japan has registered growth of nearly 20 percent
since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>However, exports from South Korea, Singapore and mainland China
to Japan have also shown sizable increases; the competition has thus
become extremely harsh, indicated BOFT officials.</P>
      <P>It is evident that Japan's economic situation has bottomed out
and is rebounding. According to an estimate by the Wharton
Econometric Forecasting Association, Japan is expected to register
0.8 percent economic growth in 1999, thanks to the economic
rehabilitation policy implemented by the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>A comparison among the values of Asian countries' exports to
Japan, based on the year's first seven months' export volume, shows
that South Korea ranked at the top with export growth of 17.48
percent, followed by Taiwan with 17.38 percent; Singapore ranked
third with growth of 12.29 percent, while mainland China registered
an increase of 8.19 percent, noted BOFT officials.</P>
      <P>The officials further stated that export of machine goods and
electrical equipment, which are staples among Taiwan exports to
Japan, registered growth of 50 percent and 20 percent, respectively,
in the first seven months of the year, compared with last year's
figures.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Japan's demand for personal computers is expected to
increase by 8 percent for 1999 to cope with the Y2K crisis, thus
perhaps resulting in growth for Taiwan's exports in the
telecommunications sector, economic officials said.</P>
      <P>It is noteworthy, pointed out the officials, that machinery,
electrical and electronic products, as well as plastic and fishing
goods made in mainland China, have outshone those made in Taiwan in
the Japanese market to date, while machine equipment made in South
Korea also crowded out many of those products made in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUAKE-RELIEF DONATIONS FROM ABROAD REACH NT$620 MILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Donations from abroad have reached NT$620
million (about US$19.5 million) since Taiwan was jolted by a
devastating earthquake on Sept. 21, an official with the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Chi-ping, an official from the MOFA's Information and
Cultural Affairs Department, made the statement at a public hearing
on post-earthquake relief work chaired by Legislator Chin Hui-chu
(KMT-Taipei City).</P>
      <P>Of the amount, Chang said, more than NT$500 million was
contributed by overseas Chinese, and the remaining was donated by
11 foreign countries.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics compiled by the Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission, Chang said ethnic Chinese from around the world have
donated more than NT$500 million to help quake-affected people in
Taiwan. Donations from Chinese descendants residing in the United
States and Canada alone exceeded NT$450 million.</P>
      <P>Chang further said the United Nations and 21 countries around
the world sent a total of 41 rescue teams, composed of 767 cave-in
and logistics experts and 99 sniffer dogs, to assist in
post-quake search and rescue operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang said, 90 countries and nine international
organizations sent messages, expressing their regards and condolences
for local quake victims. In addition, 11 foreign governments donated
a total of NT$9 million in cash to help finance relief and
reconstruction programs here.</P>
      <P>At present, only the Singapore rescue team is still in Taiwan,
while all other foreign rescue teams already returned to their own
countries.</P>
      <P>Chang said the MOFA has through various channels expressed the
ROC government and people's heartfelt gratitude for all the aid and
assistance offered by foreign countries in post-earthquake relief
operations here.</P>
      <P>Chang said all the donations from abroad will be managed by the
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chang Lin-cheng, a
National Taiwan University political science professor, said the
MOFA should set aside "humanitarian aid" budget for
offering first aid to other countries hit by natural disasters.</P>
      <P>Noting that humanitarian concern and aid should be offered to
needy countries without bias or discrimination, Chang said Taiwan
should not include too much political consideration in offering
humanitarian aid to avoid affecting the ROC's international image.</P>

      <P>Fifteen mountain
climbers from the Taipei City Flying Eagle Alpinist Association were
found dead at the 61.5-kilometer mark of the Central Cross Island
Highway in central Taiwan, police reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Police said that the climbers had taken a minibus to climb
Mountain Chilai in central Taiwan and were buried under falling rocks
when the earthquake jolted Taiwan on Sept. 21, claiming more than
2,200 lives and injuring more than 8,900 people.</P>
      <P>The accident occurred 500 meters from a station of the Tehchi Dam
power generating plant, reported police, who speculated that the
group might have been saved if the minibus had been able to continue
along its route for two more minutes.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei Alpinist Association had asked authorities to
carry out a rescue attempt after losing contact with the group.</P>
      <P>Military and civilian rescue teams had sent helicopters several
times to fly over possible accident sites but failed to find
anything. Police and the Taichung County Rescue Team had formed two
groups to search for the ill-fated climbers.</P>
      <P>The rescue teams had uncovered no trace of the missing group over
the past ten days until the minibus was found on Monday morning.</P>
      <P>The rescue team tried to dig out the climber's bodies by hand as

      <P>The Panamanian branch of Taiwan conglomerate
Evergreen Group on Sunday categorically denied the company has any
plan to withdraw its diversified businesses from the country.</P>
      <P>Currently Evergreen Group has businesses in shipping, air cargo
transport and real estate, as well as a container terminal, in
Panama; and officials of the company's branch office said in a news
release that all the businesses are in operation, in response to the
Panamanian port authority's recent announcement that Evergreen was
planning to pull out of Panama.</P>
      <P>According to the news release, Evergreen owns a fleet of 120
cargo vessels in Panama, of which half sail under the flag of that
country, and EVA Airways is continuing regular service along its
Taipei-Panama City route. The group has also poured over US$100
million into Panama's Colon Container Terminal which is operating as
usual.</P>
      <P>The news release also revealed that the rumor of Evergreen
Group's withdrawal might have been sparked by the group's
negotiations on cooperative investments with several international
business groups, which might have been misunderstood as intent to
withdraw.</P>
      <P>Aside from the existing businesses, Evergreen Group is planning

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
will give a press conference on Tuesday to explain progress in
various post-earthquake relief and reconstruction programs, the
Presidential Office announced on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee is expected to detail his feelings and views about what he
has heard and seen during his inspection tours of hardest-hit areas
of central Taiwan over the past two weeks, a Presidential Office
official said, adding that the president will also answer questions
from journalists.</P>
      <P>The official noted that Lee has made frequent visits to central
Taiwan since the 7.3-magnitude earthquake wreaked havoc in the region
on Sept. 21, and has personally helped some surviving quake victims
to resolve their problems.</P>
      <P>By now, the first-stage post-quake rescue and relief operations
have finished, and the even more tough reconstruction work is set to
begin.</P>
      <P>The official said that in the process of the initial-stage relief
work, the government came under fire for its lack of coordination and
low efficiency.</P>
      <P>"We feel there is a need for President Lee to explain what the
government has had to do after the promulgation of an emergency
decree to speed up post-earthquake resettlement and reconstruction
work, as well as what the government can do under the emergency
decree," the official said, adding that Lee will also reaffirm the
government's determination to do its utmost to help quake-affected
people rebuild their homes and lives as well as improve the country's
infrastructure to ensure a safer living environment.</P>
      <P>The official further said that as head of state, Lee must explain
the government's determination and its plans for coping with the
aftermath of the devastating earthquake, in order to ease the
public's misgivings and restore its confidence and trust in the
government.</P>
      <P>As Lee has criticized some of the local media's handling of
earthquake-related news events, interaction between the president and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bracing for a surge in service charges on
government debts because of treasury bonds issued to fund the
earthquake reconstruction, a Ministry of Finance (MOF) official said
on Monday that the ministry is mulling whether to raise the limit on
the amount of such bonds.</P>
      <P>Wang Jung-chou, vice minister of finance in charge of treasury
affairs, said that his ministry is studying the options of either
raising the limit of 15 percent of the government's budget, or
lifting it completely.</P>
      <P>Although the government is not bound by the 15 percent limitation
under the six-month emergency decree declared by President Lee
Teng-hui on Sept. 25, the outstanding government debt will surpass
the limit until long after the six-month period has elapsed.</P>
      <P>The amount of government bonds currently stands at about 14.71
percent of the government budget, and Lee is instructing the ministry
to raise another NT$80 billion via bond issuance or borrowing to
finance the earthquake relief operation.</P>
      <P>In light of the NT$1 trillion (US31.25 billion) price tag for the
reconstruction after the 1995 Kobe-Osaka earthquake in Japan, the
Taiwan authorities estimate that it will take NT$160 billion (US$5
billion) to reconstruct the earthquake-stricken areas of the island.</P>
      <P>In addition to bond issuance, the government will temporarily
divert money from back-burner projects to the relief operation for
the time being, and will prepare a budget for next year according to
the reconstruction needs, said Wang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT  STABILITY  PARAMOUNT: ROC  FOREIGN  MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Oct.  3 (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie &amp; Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Jason Hu
said in an interview with Le Monde newspaper on Sunday that what is
of greatest concern to Taipei is peace and stability across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hu was asked by the French paper to comment on Beijing's
celebrations to mark the 50th founding anniversary of the People's
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Saying it is not a bad thing for a country to celebrate its
national day, Hu stressed however that if the occasion is used to
propagate nationalism, it is certainly not helpful.</P>
      <P>The paper interpreted Hu's remarks to indicate Taipei's concern
that Beijing's display of military power in its national day military
parade constitutes a threat to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister refuted Beijing's claim that "Taiwan is a
trouble-maker," asking: "We have already had too many troubles of our
own. Why would we seek to bring more troubles upon ourselves?"</P>
      <P>Hu admitted, however, that Beijing was angered by ROC President
Lee Teng-hui's recent redefinition of cross-Taiwan Strait relations
as a "special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>The paper noted that Taipei officials have defended Lee's
statement by pointing out that he was just stating the undeniable
fact that the PRC's sovereign power has never extended to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Hu also expressed Taipei's disappointment over
France's lack of support when the Taiwan issue was discussed recently
at the United Nations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EARTHQUAKE DOES LITTLE TO DENT TAIWAN'S ECONOMY: RATING AGENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   4  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Increased government expenditure on
earthquake reconstruction will stimulate Taiwan's mid-term economic
growth according to a report by the rating company Standard and
Poor's and its Taiwan's affiliate the Taiwan Rating Corp. on Monday.</P>
      <P>This growth will occur despite the devastating Sept. 21
earthquake which dampened the island's production somewhat, according
to the rating report.</P>
      <P>Although the quake caused widespread property damage on the
island, and although ensuing power outages have disturbed the
island's industrial production, the report said these factors will
trim Taiwan's gross domestic product growth by only 0.25 percent,
bringing it down from 5.74 percent to 5.5 percent, but still better
than the 4.65 percent recorded for the previous year.</P>
      <P>The report noted that the power outages led to rationing, which
is expected to end by Oct. 12, just three weeks after the disaster.
The rationing has caused some 19,000 factories around the island to
lie idle, not least those in the semiconductor industry in the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park, which has suffered losses of
an estimated US$1 billion per week since the disaster.</P>
      <P>The banking industry is another sector which is bearing the brunt
of the temblor because of the collapse of many mortgaged buildings
and the expected large-scale defaulting on loans extended to owners
whose property has been damaged, said the report.</P>
      <P>It predicted that the non-performing debt ratio will rise from 5
percent to more than 6 percent next month given that more than 10,000
houses were destroyed by the temblor.</P>
      <P>However, the extra expenditure on rebuilding of infrastructure
and buildings will boost the demand for construction materials, and
this will stimulate economic growth, the report continued.</P>
      <P>In light of Taiwan's small foreign debt and its huge foreign
currency reserves, the report foresees no problem for the island to
come up with the extra cash required for rebuilding.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry, which earned huge profits in the first
three quarters of this year, was not badly hit by quake claims,
because earthquake insurance policies had not been popular among
Taiwan clients prior to Sept. 21. Rather, insurance companies are
expected to get a windfall from the disaster with an expected surge
in demand for life and property insurance, said the report.</P>
      <P>The petrochemical and steel industries, the backbone of the
island's economy, have hardly been affected by the tremor at all, and
are expected to enter a boom period because of the island's
reconstruction efforts, said the report.</P>
      <P>However, the government's economic index, which in August
indicated that the island's economy was recovering from the Asian
financial crisis, is expected take a blow in September with the
island's export orders dipping by 15 percent-20 percent, compared to
the same period of one year ago, the report concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US HOUSE ADOPTS BILL FAVORING WHO MEMBERSHIP FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  4  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US House of Representatives on
Monday passed a bill in favor of Taiwan's participation in
international organizations, especially the World Health
Organization.</P>
      <P>The bill, easily passed by a voice vote, requires Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to report to the Congress before Jan. 1,
2000, on US efforts to support Taiwan's participation in
international organizations, especially the WHO.</P>
      <P>Calling on other members to support the bill, Rep. Sherrod Brown
(D-Ohio), who sponsors this legislation, said the denial of Taiwanese
participation in the WHO is "an unjustifiable violation of its
people's fundamental human rights".</P>
      <P>Douglas K. Bereuter (R-Nebraska), chairman of the House Asia and
Pacific subcommittee, said it "defies logic to exclude (Taiwan's) 20
million people from this international disease prevention
organization".</P>
      <P>"There is no doubt that Taiwan can offer much in terms of medical
and pharmaceutical expertise," he added while speaking on the floor.</P>
      <P>The Senate will have to pass a similar bill and then a
presidential signature will be required for the bill to become law.</P>
      <P>In 1997, the Republic of China on Taiwan applied, to no avail,
for an observer status at the Geneva-based WHO. Taiwan lost its
membership at all UN-affiliated agencies after withdrawing from the
United Nations in 1971.</P>
      <P>Monday's action in the House represents another effort by
Taiwan's supporters in US Congress to help the island take part in
more international activities.</P>
      <P>The measure, H. R. 1794, does not call for membership for Taiwan
but said the island should have "appropriate and meaningful
participation in the World Health Organization".</P>
      <P>At the request of Beijing, the US administration has adopted a
policy of not supporting membership for Taiwan in international
organizations where statehood is required, such as the WHO.</P>
      <P>It promised in a 1994 policy review, however, to help Taiwan's
voice to be heard in such organizations and to help Taiwan join
organizations where statehood is not a prerequisite for membership.</P>

confront the spiritual powers of the universe without any doubt,
shows that he understands the will of God. The fact that he is
prepared to wait a hundred generations after him for the man of
perfect divine nature without any misgiving, shows that he
understands the nature of man."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>ROC DOES NOT PROPOSE RESUMPTION OF AVIATION TALKS WITH PHILIPPINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has not asked
the Philippines to resume aviation talks after the two countries
suspended direct airlinks on Oct. 2, the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The CAA was responding to a Philippines Airlines (PAL) statement
that Taipei has called for resumption of negotiations on direct
flight services between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Philippines had never responded to the ROC's
bottom line for maintaining bilateral direct airlinks proposed on
Sept. 23, the CAA said the Philippines instead unilaterally proposed
that the weekly quota be cut to 3,000 passengers for each side
from 9,600 stipulated in the 1996 Taipei-Manila air agreement.</P>
      <P>After a breakdown in negotiations, Taipei was forced to
announced on Oct. 1 that direct Taiwan-Philippines flight services
would be suspended from Oct. 2.</P>
      <P>The CAA said unless the Philippines agreed to the ROC's
proposal that the weekly quota be lowered to 6,500
passengers, not the PAL-proposed 3,000 passengers, the ROC has no
plans to re-open aviation talks with the Philippines.</P>
      <P>According to Tuesday's PAL statement, the Philippine flagship
carrier said because of its poor structure, it cannot withstand free
competition.</P>
      <P>The PAL then urged the two Taiwan carriers -- China
Airlines (CAL) and EVA Airways -- which until recently operated
scheduled Taiwan-Philippines flights to "sympathize" with its
plight and accept its proposal to cut the weekly quota to 3,000
passenger for each side to pave the way for early resumption of
direct airlinks.</P>
      <P>The Philippine carrier went on that it is currently burdened
with a debt of US$2.2 billion. If the airline fails to take
immediate measures to boost its business, the PAL said it will
go bankrupt and that its 8,000 staff members will lost jobs, which
will eventually lead to a serious social problem in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The PAL further said the Philippines had agreed to cut the
weekly quota from 9,600 passengers to 3,000 mainly because it
wanted to maintain airborne traffic between the two countries. In
fact, the airline claimed that the new quota far exceeds the actual
demand. According to the PAL, the number of travelers
between Taiwan and the Philippines totals an average of
3,800 per week.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the PAL statement, the two Taiwan carriers -- CAL
and EVA -- said the Philippine carrier's demand is unreasonable,
saying the PAL cannot ask them to "bail it out" at their expense.</P>
      <P>CAL and EVA executives said the PAL-proposed weekly
quota is unacceptable because it does not possess any
economic value for them.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the two carriers said the PAL's tally of passengers
between the two countries is incorrect. According to statistics
compiled by Taiwan's two international airports -- Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport and Kaohsiung International
Airport, the number of travelers between Taiwan and the
Philippines reached an average of 21,000 passengers per week in the
first seven months of this year.</P>
      <P>During the seven-month period, CAL's average weekly passenger
volume was more than 7,000 while EVA's exceeded 5,000,
according to airline records.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 50 inmates went to central Taiwan on
Tuesday to pitch in with quake relief work in the wake of the massive
Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice said that the group went to a park and a
gateball field in Tunghsih, Taichung County, to clean up areas badly
damaged during the killer quake.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials noted that, in view of the extensive damage
from the temblor, the ministry has acted in line with a law that
allows inmates to leave institution grounds in order to engage in
agricultural work, road and building construction, and other
activities that are deemed beneficial to the public.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they have chosen inmates who have
experience in construction, plumbing and painting to form this first
group of 50 to join reconstruction efforts.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Justice Tseng Yung-fu said that in order to be
eligible for reconstruction work, inmates must possess a related area
of expertise, must have demonstrated good behavior while
incarcerated, and must pose no risk of escape.</P>
      <P>In addition to actual participation in relief work, the ministry
said inmates of various prisons, penitentiaries and juvenile
delinquent correctional centers have also chipped in NT$33.58 million
(US$1.05 million) for relief efforts in the aftermath of the
earthquake, which has claimed more than 2,200 lives and injured more
than 8,300 to date, and has resulted in extensive damages.</P>

of the massive Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remark when he gave his first administration report
to the Legislative Yuan since the killer earthquake which has to date
killed more than 2,200 and injured more than 8,300.</P>
      <P>Cheng Lung-shui of the opposition New Party lashed out at the
government for its chaotic rescue and relief operations, overlapping
command centers, and serious shortage of professionals for rescue
operations.</P>
      <P>Siew said that after the catastrophic temblor hit central Taiwan,
many roads were impassable, electric and telephone lines were cut,
and government response in handling the crisis did seem a little bit
slow.</P>
      <P>But he said that the government then rapidly mobilized 200,000
people to pitch in with rescue and relief operations. CNN television
reporters and many foreign rescue teams that came to Taiwan have
praised Taiwan's efficiency. Even so, he said that this is no reason
for the government to not review the overall operation.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chien Hsi-kai of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party questioned that as early as 1996, experts warned that massive
earthquakes measuring higher than seven on the Richter scale would
hit Taiwan, but the government has turned a deaf ear to repeated
warnings.</P>
      <P>The inefficiency of government rescue and relief efforts added to
the misery in quake-stricken areas, Chien noted.</P>
      <P>Siew said that Taiwan is located in an earthquake-prone region,
and the government has always attached great importance to calamity
control, so therefore stricter construction codes should be
established.</P>
      <P>Siew also said that the lack of advanced equipment for rescue
efforts, as evidenced in rescue attempts last month, is due to the
government's tight budget.</P>
      <P>In reviewing relief operations, the government will support
increasing related budgets, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Hsih-liang of the opposition New Party noted
that President Lee Teng-hui had said the reconstruction work will be
completed in three years and questioned why Siew had given a
five-year timetable.</P>
      <P>Siew said that experts, in considering the aftermath of the
massive Kobe earthquake in 1995, have concluded that a five-year time
frame is appropriate due to the extensive damage from the quake.</P>
      <P>Regarding the appeal for the government to establish a lottery to
help raise money for relief efforts, Siew said the Cabinet is
studying the feasibility of the proposal, saying he believes a
one-time lottery could be held and proceeds earmarked for relief
operations.</P>
      <P>Siew also said that reconstruction work will be implemented in
stages, and that more than NT$100 billion (3.14 billion) has been
designated for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The reconstruction of townships and villages will be conducted
according to the "build, operate and transfer" (BOT) model, by which
the private sector will build in those areas, operate the areas for a
certain period of time, and then transfer them to the government, in
order to reduce the financial burden on the government, Siew said.</P>
      <P>He also said that the government is already coordinating the more
than 70 donation accounts in the private sector with more than 40
similar accounts set up by the government, hoping that all donations
will be administered by a committee headed by Senior Presidential
Adviser Koo Chen-fu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's unemployment, buoyed by strong

and to as low as 5 percent by the year 2001, according to a new
survey by the Australian Financial Review.</P>
      <P>The daily reported the survey of business economists shows the
unemployment rate would fall to 6 percent or lower over the next year
or two due to long economic expansion of this country.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has just celebrated its 50th
anniversary of founding the communist regime, but there won't be any
quite time in Asia due to the tensions in the Taiwan Strait,
Indonesian archipelago and the Korean Peninsula, according to the
head of the Sydney Institute.</P>
      <P>Gerard Henderson, executive director of the prestigious
institute, on Tuesday noted the tension between China and Taiwan has
been underestimated in Australia, saying the Australian government
only focused on the East Timor problem and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>He reminded that Canberra should look beyond Indonesia because
other issues remain and these problems could cause instability in the
Asian Pacific region. He cited the tensions between Taiwan and China
and the Korean Peninsula.</P>
      <P>In his article headlined: "Let's Look Beyond East Timor"
published in the Sydney Morning Herald on Tuesday, Henderson said:
"Despite last week's military exhibition, it is unclear whether China
has the capability to invade and subdue Taiwan. Yet, without
question, it is able to create a significant amount of instability in
the region."</P>
      <P>He believed Prime Minister John Howard was most anxious to obtain
as much backing from the United Stats as possible in support of
Australia's peace-enforcement role in East Timor.</P>
      <P>"In view of this, it is timely to remember that if tension
develops in the Taiwan Strait, it is likely that the US will expect
Australia's support," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANNUAL INCREASE IN CONSUMER PRICE INDEX TO REMAIN UNCHANGED: DGBAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual increase in the domestic consumer
price index for 1999 is expected to remain unchanged at 0.5 percent,
an estimate made by the government in August, said officials on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) pointed out that although the devastating
earthquake which occurred on Sept. 21 would surely affect consumer
prices in the central Taiwan areas that were hit hard by the temblor,
the island's annual consumer price index as a whole is likely to
remain as previously assessed.</P>
      <P>Chen Chang-hsiung, director of the Third Bureau under the DGBAS,
said that according to a survey made by the DGBAS, nationwide
consumer prices in late September, after the temblor, were even lower
than those of early September. Domestic consumer prices are not
likely to fluctuate much in the near future; however, costs in the
transportation and communications sectors, as well as housing costs
in quake-affected areas, may rise, observed Chen.</P>
      <P>The grand total consumer price index for September is 103.40, an
increase of 0.07 percent from the previous month, mainly as a result
of the rise in tuition fees nationwide and the Mid-Autumn Festival
which occurred in September, said the DGBAS official.</P>
      <P>The grand total wholesale price index for September is 95.84, an
increase of 0.25 percent from August; but it showed a drop of 4.28
percent as compared with the same period last year, according to
DGBAS figures.</P>
      <P>As for details of price increases in various sectors, there was
an evident rise in the funeral sector, which raised September prices
25 percent over the previous month's, an increase of 13 percent as
compared with the same period last year, according to statistics
released by the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>Among the 564 items considered for the consumer price index by
the DGBAS survey, watermelon ranked at the top by registering a price
increase of 43 percent, followed by pineapple's 28 percent; the 25
percent rise in funeral fees ranked third, followed by baby-sitting
fees with an upward move of 11 percent, and by increases of 9 percent
each for high school tuition fees and parking fees, the DGBAS figures
showed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>USA TODAY PUBLISHES "THANK YOU" FROM ROC GOV'T</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 4 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>USA Today published Monday a letter from
C.J. Chen, ROC government spokesman, expressing Taiwan's gratitude to
the rest of the world for their support and sympathy as well as
humanitarian assistance following the Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>"We would much prefer that anything but disaster be the basis for
closer cooperation with the rest of the world," he said.</P>
      <P>The director-general of the ROC Government Information Office
wrote that "The tremendous warmth and generosity shown us following
the earthquake Sept. 21 have made the people of Taiwan feel they are
not alone, that they are indeed an integral part of our global
village."</P>
      <P>Chen told the American readership that messages of support and
sympathy quickly came from President Bill Clinton and many other
world leaders. And more than 20 countries generously responded to the
devastating earthquake by providing humanitarian assistance in the
form of rescue teams and equipment.</P>
      <P>When time was of the essence, he said, "it was heartening to have
teams of search-and-rescue professionals from the USA, Japan, France,
Russia, Singapore and many other countries helping alongside our
rescue teams. We know for a fact that lives were saved as a result of
our joint efforts."</P>
      <P>Of course, Chen noted, "even expert assistance from the
international community cannot mend broken hearts or bring back
missing loved ones: The loss for the people of Taiwan is very real.
We would much prefer that anything but disaster be the basis for
closer cooperation with the rest of the world."</P>
      <P>But this event has brought all citizens of the Republic of China
on Taiwan closer together than ever -- "and more determined to build
new links to the international community, even as we rebuild
collapsed bridges in Taiwan," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say that the minutes in which the news of the
earthquake's magnitude spread around the world and the hours within
which international experts were already arriving by air,
"underscored just how small our planet has become at the end of the
20th century."</P>
      <P>Yet, Chen wrote, "it doesn't have to take a disaster to remind
us that Taiwan is very much a part of the international community --
and that we matter to each other. The government and people of the
Republic of China on Taiwan are grateful for the kind assistance of
the international community. We shall never forget."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TEMPORARY HOUSES TO BE COMPLETED BY END OF OCTOBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung County, central Taiwan, Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien
Chan said on Tuesday that construction of temporary houses for the
921 earthquake-affected people should be completed by the end of
October.</P>
      <P>Lien made the directive during an inspection tour of the
military's post-earthquake reconstruction commanding center in
Taichung County's Taiping City in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that timing is very important in post-disaster relief and
reconstruction work, Lien said he hopes all prefabricated houses for
homeless quake victims can be completed before the end of this month
to facilitate resettlement programs.</P>
      <P>Lien also reminded military servicemen participating in
post-quake reconstruction work to pay special attention to their own
safety while demolishing quake-damaged buildings or infrastructure
facilities.</P>
      <P>Quoting President Lee Teng-hui, Lien likened the military's
contributions to post-earthquake relief and resettlement to "winning
a battle."</P>
      <P>Lien said he has always been moved during his extensive
inspection tours of quake-stricken areas over the past two weeks when
he saw so many soldiers, policemen, civil servants and volunteers
work diligently to rescue survivors, unearth buried bodies, take
care of the injured and arrange shelters for the homeless.</P>
      <P>Lien encouraged all military officers and enlisted men to
continue assisting in post-quake relief work so that various
resettlement and reconstruction projects can be completed quickly.</P>
      <P>The vice president also urged the military to continue
transporting daily necessities and relief goods into villages or
townships whose transport networks were damaged in the Sept. 21
devastating earthquake.</P>
      <P>A 7.3-magnitude earthquake ripped through mountainous central
Taiwan's Nantou County at 1:47 a.m. Sept. 21, claiming more than
2,250 lives, injuring over 8,700 others and leaving some 100,000
people homeless.</P>
      <P>Lien said he believes that with concerted efforts of the
government, military and members of the general public, tough
post-quake reconstruction work can be finished smoothly.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Vincent Siew also praised the military's
performance in post-earthquake rescue and relief operations during a
Legislative Yuan question-and-answer session.</P>
      <P>With the military's assistance, Siew said, more than 4,900
people trapped in toppled buildings and 4,600 others stranded
due to damaged roads were rescued islandwide after the deadly
tremor.</P>
      <P>In related news, the Ministry of National Defense said
since Oct. 1, all military hospitals have offered psychological
counseling services and physical checkups for military officers and
conscripts who have taken part in rescue and relief operations.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) candidate Chen Shui-bian left for Japan on Tuesday to learn
from that country's experience in post-earthquake reconstruction
work.</P>
      <P>Chen said prior to his departure that he is visiting Japan in
his capacity as convener of a DPP post-earthquake reconstruction
coordination committee.</P>
      <P>Japan's port city of Kobe was rattled by a 7.2-magnitude
earthquake on Jan. 17, 1995. Chen said he believes that Taiwan has
much to learn from Japan in coping with the aftermath of a
devastating earthquake that wreaked havoc in Taiwan on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Chen said he most wants to study how the Japanese government and
people have cooperated closely to help quake-affected people rebuild
their homes and life as well as to complete various reconstruction
programs in a short period of time.</P>
      <P>During his tenure as Taipei mayor, Chen said he also made
a visit to Kobe in March 1995 to study Japan's post-quake
relief and resettlement measures in the first one-and-half months
after the quake, which killed some 6,000 people and left one-fifth
of Kobe residents homeless.</P>
      <P>Following his return from that visit, Chen said he pushed for
the establishment of Taiwan's first firefighting bureau under the
Taipei City Hall and took the initiative to set up a
disaster-relief mechanism with the mayor or deputy mayor as the
chief commander.</P>
      <P>"This mechanism has functioned well in the relief center at
Taipei's main disaster site in the Sept. 21 earthquake -- the
Tunghsing Building," Chen said, adding that he hopes that his

    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Dan, which hammered northern Luzon
in the Philippines with winds gusting up to 170 kph on Tuesday, is
seriously threatening quake victims in camps in central Taiwan with
torrential downpours that may trigger landslides.</P>
      <P>Some 100,000 people in the central counties of Nantou and
Taichung were left homeless by a devastating magnitude-7.3 earthquake
on Sept. 21, which also killed over 2,200 people and left more than
8,700 others injured.</P>
      <P>Weather forecasters from the Central Weather Bureau feared that
those staying in camps and taking refuge in military shelters and
temporary houses must brace themselves for strong winds and heavy
rains on Tuesday and the following two days as Typhoon Dan moves
westward toward the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>Although the typhoon is not heading for Taiwan, and its wind
strength subsided from the previous 170 kph to 126 kph on Tuesday
afternoon after making landfall in northern Luzon, Dan is expected to
bring strong winds and torrential rains to the entire island of
Taiwan, particularly its western and southern areas, the weather
forecasters said.</P>
      <P>Heavy rains are likely to trigger further landslides in the
fragile and volatile mountainous areas in Nantou, Taichung and Yunlin
counties that were hit hardest by the Sept. 21 earthquake, the
deadliest to strike Taiwan this century.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) warned that power
rationing, which was imposed in the wake of the deadly earthquake,
may resume if temporary high-voltage transmission lines are damaged
by the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Taipower was forced to impose power rationing on industrial and
household electricity users in northern Taiwan after several of its
substations and high-voltage transmission lines were ruined by the
earthquake, interrupting north-bound transmission of electricity from

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew said
Tuesday the problem between Taiwan and mainland China is political in
nature, so there is no way to solve it by military force as the
mainland has long proclaimed.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remark during the legislative general questioning
session in response to a lawmaker who asked whether Taiwan had
heightened combat readiness to counter reported mainland Chinese
intentions to take one of Taiwan's offshore islands by force before
Taiwan was hit by the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party legislator Chien Hsi-kai, who raised
the question, said sources indicated that the mainland had planned a
military drill near Taiwan and could have made use of the drill to
take over one of our offshore isles in retaliation against Taiwan's
"special state to state relationship" theory.</P>
      <P>Chien also asked Siew whether armed forces authorities had
ordered all army personnel stationed at offshore islands to refrain
from taking leave so as to be prepared for confrontations with
mainland Chinese.</P>
      <P>Instead of answering the question directly, Siew said the
mainland has never renounced the use of force in dealing with Taiwan.
Taiwan has continued to strengthen combat ability in order to
confront potential military threats from the mainland, he added.</P>
      <P>Siew said he believed the mainland would hesitate to start a war
since Taiwan has consistently improved its combat ability.</P>
      <P>The premier went on to say that Taiwan does not support the idea
of resolving cross-strait problems by force, and in handling
cross-strait issues, will continue to uphold the principles of
non-provocation and non-evasion, but reserves the right of
self-defense.

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL ANNUITY PROGRAM TO BE POSTPONED FOR ONE YEAR: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Plans for the much-discussed National
Annuity Program will be suspended for one year, as the country is now
in dire need of vast quantities of cash to finance post-earthquake
reconstruction, officials from the Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The postponement means that the timetable for implementing the
national annuity program remains unclear, said Liu Yu-lan, director
of CEPD's Manpower Planning Department.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui estimated that it will take about NT$250
billion (US$7.86 billion) to finance post-disaster reconstruction. A
devastating earthquake measuring 7.3 on the open-ended Richter scale
struck central Taiwan on Sept. 21, leaving at least 2,200 people
dead, more than 8,800 injured and some 100,000 others homeless.</P>
      <P>The quake, the deadliest to hit Taiwan this century, gave Taiwan
a geological facelift by flattening mountains, creating new lakes,
and ruining most of the roads and infrastructure in the central
Taiwan counties of Nantou, Taichung and Yunlin, where numerous
buildings and houses have collapsed.</P>
      <P>The national annuity program was originally scheduled to be
launched in 2000, with estimated per capita monthly contributions of
NT$870 (US$27) to be paid by eligible ROC nationals between the ages
of 25 and 64. People aged 65 and over could receive a monthly pension
of NT$2,000 (US$63) for the rest of their lives, according to
preliminary CEPD plans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TIES MARKED BY AWAKENING AND WANING OF BROTHERHOOD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   5  (CNA)
(By Chang Hui-yen
and Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Political confrontation has stained
relations between the two governments on either side of the Taiwan
Strait, but under the surface, an awakened brotherhood has bridged
the gap between the people of each side.</P>
      <P>Compassion for each other has arisen since the late 70s, when the
sweet and tender voice of the late popular Taiwanese singer Teng
Li-chun penetrated the bamboo curtain and soothed thousands of
mainland Chinese souls. Renewed contact and curiosity gave both sides
opportunities for reconciliation.</P>
      <P>The late 70s also became a turning point in Beijing's 50-year
history when the reform-minded communist leader Deng Xiaoping allowed
some openness toward the outside world.</P>
      <P>In the 80s, Chinese people on the mainland were able to hear some
undistorted stories about Taiwan. In 1987 when Taiwan permitted its
people to visit relatives on the mainland, and mainlanders were
allowed to come to the island for the same reason, direct contact
between people first became possible. A long-forgotten brotherhood
was reawakened.</P>
      <P>Over the past 10 years, both Taipei and Beijing have gradually
relaxed controls on visits between Taiwan and the mainland. Such
visits have become more and more frequent.</P>
      <P>The rekindled brotherhood could be witnessed with numerous
academic and cultural exchanges and extensive economic activities by
Taiwanese businesses in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, a waning of such sentiment among the people of
Taiwan could be sensed during the past two years. A mainland official
even complained to a Central News Agency (CNA) reporter about Taiwan
people's indifference when Beijing's embassy in Belgrade was bombed
by NATO.</P>
      <P>Between 1987 and 1998, people from Taiwan made a total of 19.5
million visits to mainland China. Most travel consisted of brief
visits to relatives or sight-seeing tours. Few chose to settle there,
not even those retired servicemen who withdrew to Taiwan with Chiang
Kai-shek's troops, leaving their families behind in 1949 when the
Chinese communists took over the mainland.</P>
      <P>Nearly 214,000 mainlanders visited Taiwan between 1987 and 1997.
Through the end of last August, a total of 29,258 mainlanders had
been allowed by Taipei to resettle in Taiwan, and some 10,000
mainland women had married Taiwanese men.</P>
      <P>Stowaways from the mainland have been a big headache for Taipei
authorities. More then 35,000 were caught between 1987 and 1997, and
authorities estimate that there are now some 1,400 in hiding across
the island.</P>
      <P>Polls conducted in the past few months indicate that indeed the
people of Taiwan are drifting away from the aspiration of
reunification.</P>
      <P>In 1992 when northern China suffered from massive flooding,
people in Taiwan responded immediately by sending handsome relief
resources. The 1998 Yangtze flood did not give rise to comparable
compassion "because the Taiwanese people's feelings were hurt by
Beijing's arrogance and its untiring battering of Taiwan," said the
CNA reporter.</P>
      <P>She added that when people in Taiwan extend a helping hand to
their compatriots on the mainland, they do not mix the gracious
compassion arising out of brotherhood with politics. Furthermore,
they can not accept Beijing's jeering comment that rescue and relief
assistance from the international community is a result of Taiwan's
"earthquake diplomacy."</P>
      <P>The reporter said that after 50 years of separation, people on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait require much goodwill as a basis for
mutual trust. In pursuing a long-term goal of reunification, the
people of Taiwan would demand such a reunion occur under a system
based on liberty, democracy and economic equality.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S 1999 CPI GROWTH TO POST AT 0.5 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual growth rate of Taiwan's consumer
price index (CPI) will amount to 0.5 percent this year, predicted the
Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Director-General Shih Yen of the central bank's economic research
department labeled the prediction as "reasonable," indicating that
the figure suggests stable consumer prices in 1999.</P>
      <P>The impact of the Sept. 21 earthquake and subsequent islandwide
power rationing on the prices of goods will be limited, although
there has been increased demand for certain items since the
earthquake devastated Taiwan, claiming more than 2,200 lives, Shih
noted.</P>
      <P>During the first nine months of the year, the average CPI annual
growth rate registered 0.27 percent, while September CPI growth was
posted at 0.59 percent, according to statistics released by the DGBAS
on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that in September, wholesale prices
declined 4.28 percent and prices of imported goods dropped 2.5
percent, compared to the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Shih said that there are several factors contributing to the
stability of consumer prices this year, including Taiwan's tariff
cuts for imported goods, the New Taiwan dollar's appreciation against
the greenback, limited growth of domestic demand, and the real estate
market's continued sluggishness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BIGGER JOLT UNLIKELY NEAR GROUND ZERO OF THE MAJOR QUAKE: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is unlikely that an earthquake stronger
than the magnitude-7.3 temblor that wreaked havoc on the island Sept.
21 will strike the ground zero area in the next couple of years,
seismologists from the Central Weather Bureau predicted on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The earthquake experts said although current science is still
unable to predict earthquakes, they believe that a jolt bigger than
the one on Sept. 21 is unlikely in the same area over the next couple
of years.</P>
      <P>Seismological data collected by the weather bureau showed that
the frequency of aftershocks from the deadly Sept. 21 earthquake has
gradually subsided, with less than 10 per hour on Tuesday, compared
with the approximately 150 per hour detected in the first several
days following the quake.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday afternoon, two weeks after the devastating quake,
11,131 aftershocks had been detected, and 104 of them were temblors
of magnitude 4 or greater, the earthquake experts said.</P>
      <P>They discouraged the general public from believing recent rumors
that bigger earthquakes are bound to shake Taiwan again in the near

    <HEADLINE>PRES. LEE SAYS TAIWAN RELIEF ACTION THREE TIMES FASTER THAN JAPAN'S</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  5 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Tuesday quoted a
member of Japan's Diet as saying that Taiwan's relief action for
earthquake victims was three times faster than Japan's.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also issued an emergency order more quickly than Japan,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Lee considered "we have done well" in dealing with
relief efforts for earthquake victims.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the central government was performed well
in issuing the emergency order. The government issued the order in
only five days, whereas it had taken 37 days to issue a similar order
to assist victims of a flood on Aug. 7, 1959, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The Japanese Diet member quoted by Lee had become vice political
minister of the Economic Planning Agency of Japan in Monday's Cabinet
reshuffle. She donated 1,000 prefabricated houses to Taiwan and told
Lee that Taiwan's relief action was three times faster than that of
Japan.</P>
      <P>Lee quoted the Diet member as reporting that Japan required a
month to finish relief work, while Taiwan needed only 10 days. She
was elected to the Diet from Hyogo Prefecture, where she rode a
motorbike to the quake-stricken area every day after the 1995 Kobe
earthquake. She spoke highly of Taiwan's "efficiency in dealing with
the disaster."</P>
      <P>Lee called on the populace to have confidence in "the
government's disaster-handling capability" and to stand united so
that reconstruction of quake-stricken areas may be accomplished as
soon as possible.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui said on Tuesday that
efforts to repair souls as well as homes take priority among all
post-earthquake work.</P>
      <P>In his first press conference after a cataclysmic earthquake
struck Taiwan on Sept. 21, Lee said his sorrow over those killed and
injured and sympathy for others affected by the quake are no less
than anyone's in the country.</P>
      <P>Lee said he knows that the post-earthquake reconstruction work,
laborious and challenging, could not possibly be done to everyone's
satisfaction, but he is confident that the government is determined
to accomplish the tasks in the shortest possible period.</P>
      <P>The administrative agencies have since day one embarked on
all-out rescue and relief efforts, hoping that reconstruction and
rehabilitation will be carried out in the most efficient manner with
the greatest possible speed, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>He said it has been 15 days since the devastating earthquake
struck the island. Over the past days, he said, he has visited the
stricken areas several times to see the damage and hear the pleas
from survivors.</P>
      <P>The military and local fire-fighting units were the first forces
to initiate rescue and emergency work after the deadly earthquake
rattled central Taiwan at 1:47 a.m. on Sept. 21, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The armed forces established advance emergency commands in the
earthquake-stricken areas at 4 a.m. the same day, followed by the
Executive Yuan, which mapped out contingent rescue and relief
measures in the evening of that day, Lee added.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 22, he said, the government declared the establishment
of a post-earthquake supervisory headquarters, headed by Vice
President Lien Chan, to coordinate efforts from the central and local
governments and to see that the 15 emergency measures be carried out.</P>
      <P>Over the past two weeks, the military and the public, as well as
private emergency teams from home and abroad, have shed sweat and
blood to search for and rescue victims, saving 4,963 lives and
helping 4,685 others who were stranded, the president said.</P>
      <P>However, he said, unfortunately there were still 2,256 people
dead, 55 buried alive and 53 unaccounted for as of Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said that after he was briefed by the Executive Yuan on Oct.
2 regarding the progress of overall post-earthquake emergency and
relief work, he issued a six-point reconstruction order, hoping that
relevant agencies will complete their assigned tasks as follows:</P>
      <P>-- Complete assessment of damaged and dangerous houses and
buildings in earthquake-stricken areas in one week;</P>
      <P>-- Complete erection of prefabricated housing units in hard-hit
areas in 10 days;</P>
      <P>-- Finish handling waste disposal in one month;</P>
      <P>-- Help survivors repair their souls and free them from sorrow
through the help of religious organizations;</P>
      <P>-- Assign work to surviving victims, allowing them to repel fear
through work so as to help them lead normal lives as soon as
possible; and</P>
      <P>-- Effectively carry out the orders of the emergency decree.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
said on Tuesday that the government is making all-out efforts to help
earthquake-affected people rebuild their families.</P>
      <P>"The government is confident and is determined to complete the
reconstruction work," Lee told a press conference at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>He said that the most important task at present is "how to help
the affected people walk away from grief and rebuild their families
and gardens."</P>
      <P>The president expressed his sorrow over the casualties and losses
incurred in the 7.3-magnitude temblor that ripped central Taiwan
before dawn on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>More than 2,250 persons were killed and more than 8,000 others
were injured in the strongest quake to hit Taiwan in nearly 100
years.</P>
      <P>He extended his gratitude, on behalf of the ROC government and
the people, for the concern and assistance from the international
community, the armed forces, and fire-fighting and rescue personnel,
as well as philanthropic groups throughout the island.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the quake, Lee said, the government took swift
action to rescue trapped victims and to resettle displaced people.</P>
      <P>The government's first-phase tasks have been going smoothly and
are almost finished, and ongoing second-phase tasks are focused on
reconstruction work, he said.</P>
      <P>To expedite implementation of related government measures, Lee
pointed out, the government set up a center to coordinate
rescue and relief efforts on Sept. 22, headed by Vice President Lien
Chan, and the president promulgated an emergency decree on Sept. 25.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that he further issued a six-point order on
Oct. 2, with the main points being: completing checks on dangerous
buildings within one week, completing establishment of prefabricated
housing units in hard-hit areas within 10 days, and completing
disposal of waste and rubble within one month.</P>
      <P>Although not all the people were satisfied with the government's
measures, the president said, he was satisfied with what the
government has done.</P>
      <P>He quoted a Japanese Lower House member as having said that
"Taiwan's rescue operations were three times faster than those of
Japan," when compared with the 1995 Hanshin earthquake.</P>
      <P>Lee also stressed the importance of training and equipment for
fire-fighting and rescue personnel, saying that the government should
increase the budget for the National Fire-Fighting Agency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THINK TANK SAYS 'AMERO' MONETARY UNION WOULD BENEFIT CANADA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct. 5 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian research institute says a common
North American currency would bring about lower long-term interest
rates, greater price stability and improved trade.</P>
      <P>A report released by the Fraser Institute calls for a North
American Monetary Union that includes Canada, the United States, and
Mexico. Such an arrangement would benefit Canada, as its productivity
and living standards would increase, the study says.</P>
      <P>It proposes a common currency, called the "amero," which would
have its own distinctive emblem on one side and national symbols on
the other.</P>
      <P>The study's author, Herbert Grubel, argues that flexible exchange
rates have not brought Canada the benefits promised by its advocates.</P>
      <P>Instead, he says, they have reduced labor market flexibility and
delayed Canada's adjustment to declining world prices for natural
resources.</P>
      <P>"This system has contributed to Canada's high and excessive
reliance on the production of natural resources," says Grubel, a
senior fellow at the Vancouver-based institute.</P>
      <P>"A monetary union will ensure that we move to the high-tech and
other profitable and expanding industries at a more optimal pace, and
Canadians' productivity and living standards will increase
correspondingly."</P>
      <P>The study also argues that Canada's cultural sovereignty and
political independence would not be affected by monetary union,
because it would not inhibit Canada's ability to pursue its own tax,
spending, social, regulatory and foreign policies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's largest mining and industrial

half the number of its plants, in a bid to reduce losses due to
increased competition from imports.</P>
      <P>The announcement was made Tuesday by the chief executive of

marks a historic decision to pull out of the steel industry after the
company closed its steel plant in Newcastle, New South Wales last
week, laying off 1,500 workers.</P>
      <P>He told reporters the company would sell three more steel plants
worth A$3 billion (US$1.97 billion) and would only retain its
profitable steel mill in Port Kembla, New South Wales, which produces
steel sheeting for use in car manufacturing construction and
packaging.</P>
      <P>Anderson said the massive sales could result in the layoff of

      <P>A young Japanese female
survivor of the 1995 Kobe quake came to Taiwan to pitch in with
relief efforts three days after the island was hit by a devastating
jolt on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsia-mei, using her Han Chinese pseudonym, put aside her own
studies at an international studies graduate school to join a
Japanese emergency team sent to Taiwan to aid in search and rescue
operations.</P>
      <P>She ended up staying after the Japanese emergency team pulled
out, joining the volunteer forces sponsored by Tzu Chi, the island's
largest Buddhist and philanthrophic organization founded by Taiwan's
Mother Teresa -- Master Cheng Yen.</P>
      <P>In the first week after her arrival, Lin helped by cooking at a
shelter center in Chungliao, a township in central Taiwan severely
affected by the quake.</P>
      <P>Later, she transferred to Nantou City, located in the hardest hit
county, pitching in with masonry work on the playing field of a
baseball stadium where some two hundred prefabricated housing units
were built to house people made homeless by the deadly earthquake.</P>
      <P>Lin, whose own home was ruined during the Kobe quake in 1995,
said it took her years to forget the horrible memories that used to
repeatedly run through her mind. The earthquake-stricken scene she
saw in central Taiwan brought back those nightmares.</P>
      <P>At the same time, she said she was overwhelmed by the spirit of
community involvement the Taiwanese people demonstrated and the
compassion they showed toward their fellow countrymen in the wake of
the catastrophe.</P>
      <P>After the deadly quake struck Taiwan, most of the roads and
bridges in the most affected areas were damaged. As a result, the
military Seagull Rescue Operation Squadron served as the only means
of transportation to and from earthquake-stricken areas</P>
      <P>Hung Ai-wen, an Air Force helicopter pilot and a graduate from
the ROC Air Force Academy, has toiled day in and day out since the
quake hit by flying search, logistics and air-drop operations.</P>
      <P>Even though her wedding was only three days away, Hung continued
her flying missions over the disaster areas. "My wedding's nothing
compared with running missions to save lives," she said.</P>
      <P>Liu Shui-yuan, owner of a metal plate factory in Chushan, also
one of the hardest hit townships in central Taiwan, received a new
nickname in the wake the quake -- Uncle Water.</P>
      <P>Liu, 61, had a deep-water well drilled in his backyard in
downtown Chushan just days before the quake struck.</P>
      <P>The Chushan Township, as well as all the hardest hit counties of
Nantou, Taichung and Yunlin, were left with no water and electricity
after the quake when the Shihkang Dam, the major water and power
supplier in the region, partly burst and several conveying pipes were
damaged.</P>
      <P>Liu's well, with precious water flowing all day long, turned out
to be the sole water source in the vast neighborhood.</P>
      <P>Liu not only offered free water to his neighbors, but also asked
the local police station to broadcast to the entire town where the
people could go to receive clean water free of charge.</P>

      <P>The devastating earthquake of Sept. 21
damaged a large number of schools in central Taiwan, forcing more
than 5,500 youngsters to be sojourned to other cities and counties in
order to continue their schooling, Education Minister Yang
Chao-hsiang said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 5,518 teenagers and children from the
earthquake-stricken areas have been moved out of their demolished
towns to continue their studies in safe places around the island,
Yang noted.</P>
      <P>The sojourned students have either been consigned to the care of
their adopted parents, or are staying with their adult relatives or
in boarding schools, Yang added.</P>
      <P>Yang said the sojourned youths, who may have suffered lingering
emotional damage in the wake of the destructive earthquake, need
extra care and guidance in their new study environment away from
home.</P>
      <P>Taichung, the closest city to the earthquake-stricken central
Taiwan counties of Nantou, Taichung and Yunlin, received the greatest
number of the sojourned youths islandwide -- a total 1,091 junior
high and primary school students.</P>
      <P>Taipei City and Taipei County in northern Taiwan followed,
receiving 742 and 692 students respectively.</P>
      <P>Other teenagers and children were relocated to Changhua County

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD CLEARLY STATE TAIWAN DEFENSE POLICY: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  5  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing should be made to understand
that the United States will intervene militarily on Taiwan's behalf
if Communist China attacks, according to an American expert.</P>
      <P>Ross H. Munro, director of Asian studies at the Center for
Security Studies in Washington, wrote in the National Review that
Beijing's dramatic statements on Taiwan, aimed primarily at the
American audience, are designed in part to hide the fact that
Communist China's policy on Taiwan is "the product of a careful
weighing of China's strategic interests."</P>
      <P>In the eyes of PRC leaders, Munro pointed out, Taiwan is first
and foremost a strategic target that must soon be subjugated if
Communist China is to realize its goal of becoming Asia's dominant
and unchallenged power. But the Clinton administration,
unfortunately, with its persistent obtuseness, has failed to
recognize Communist China's policy as a clear challenge to the vital
strategic interests of the United States.</P>
      <P>Munro noted that in fact, the Taiwan issue would not be
incendiary today if there had not been a momentous shift in Communist
Chinese "Grand Strategy" in the first half of the 1990s. Just as
Taiwan was reaching a democratic consensus in favor of continued
autonomy, the post-Deng Xiaoping generation of younger and more
ambitious political and military leaders in mainland China was
adopting a new grand strategy. The goal is to dominate Asia as every
Chinese dynasty at the height of its power had done throughout
history.</P>
      <P>Suddenly, he said, the Beijing regime saw Taiwan's autonomy in a
new and adversarial light: as a barrier preventing Communist China
from achieving its strategic ambitions. The new generation of
political and military leaders had concluded by 1994 that, in order
to achieve the goal of dominating Asia, it must first seize control
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In December 1994, Munro wrote, the Communist Chinese military
establishment held what amounted to a closed-door "Invade Taiwan!"
pep rally. Sponsored by the Ministry of National Defense and the
PLA's General Staff Headquarters, the gathering was characterized by
officials as a "report session on strategic policy on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The main themes of the four-day meeting were that it would be
necessary to use military force to achieve reunification and that "it
will be better to resolve the issue of Taiwan earlier than doing it
later. This will help develop the entire country and stabilize Asia
and the whole world." It was also stated that "the most appropriate
time" to attack Taiwan was between 2000 and 2005.</P>
      <P>The timing of these events is significant, according to Munro,
because they all preceded by many months the announcement of
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to Cornell University, the event that
most US Sinologists identify as the turning point in Communist
China's Taiwan policy. Obviously, the Communist Chinese leadership,
particularly military leaders, seized on this event as an excuse to
bare their real intentions towards Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But perhaps the clearest evidence of Beijing's new strategic
ambitions, Munro said, appeared in a March 1996 article published by
"Taiwan Affairs," a PRC journal. The title alone -- "Taiwan's
Geostrategic Value Makes Reunification Essential" says it all. After
reiterating the usual argument that Taiwan has always been part of
China, author Lu Junyuan made it plain that Communist China's real
interest in Taiwan is as a strategically valuable piece of real
estate, saying "We can thus see that Taiwan occupies a unique and
advantageous spot on the geostrategic map."</P>
      <P>Yet, Munro pointed out, President Bill Clinton and his top
officials refused to recognize that there is a fundamental strategic
conflict of interest between Communist China and the United States:
Beijing wants to dominate Asia, while Washington is still committed
to maintaining a balance of power in Asia and preventing any single
power from dominating the whole region. They also blamed Taiwan for
preventing US-PRC relations from being dramatically and permanently
improved.</P>
      <P>Munro is convinced that the United States should first learn from
Communist China. The Communist Chinese are right in attaching
enormous strategic importance to Taiwan, he said. The United States
has no military forces based in Taiwan, nor does it need them, as
long as Taiwan's own robust forces continue to control its territory.
The American military should remain the back-up force -- ready to
intervene on Taiwan's behalf if the island is unable to counter a
Communist Chinese military offensive.</P>
      <P>Second, Washington should reduce "strategic ambiguity." For many
years, Munro wrote.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO LAUNCH RELIEF SALES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) under the
Executive Yuan is to launch a program to sell agricultural products
as a relief project for earthquake victims in the island's
agricultural zone, said the head of the COA on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The worst temblor in a century, which struck Taiwan on Sept. 21,
greatly damaged central-island harvests, noted COA Chairman Peng
Tso-kwei.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level COA will sponsor three events in the near
future to promote the sale of "earthquake tea" and "earthquake
pears," among other agricultural products, to help quake-affected
growers weather their harsh plight, said Peng.</P>
      <P>The killer quake has resulted in devastating losses for growers
of pears, bananas, tea and oranges; this year's orange harvest is
likely to sustain losses of 30 percent, Peng pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although the damage attributed to the quake is limited to a few
kinds of fruit and tea, and thus will not affect the supply of fruits
and vegetables islandwide, the government still hopes that the public
will show their love and generosity by purchasing agricultural
products from quake-affected growers.</P>
      <P>The agricultural products sales program sponsored by the COA will
focus on the sale of pears and persimmons from Tongshih Township,
star fruit from Choulan Township, and oranges from the townships of
Fungyuan and Daikaug, said COA officials.</P>
      <P>Public supermarkets run by the local governments of Taipei County
and Taipei City will cooperate with the COA's relief program.</P>
      <P>Purchases totaling over NT$1,000 can be delivered to customers'
homes, said COA officials.</P>

      <P>Canberra, Oct. 6 (CNA): The United Nations will increase the
international military presence in East Timor to 9000 troops and
boost the police force to 1640 officers as part of its plan to
convert the Australian-led force into a peacekeeping mission.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bishop Carlos Belo, spiritual leader of East Timor and

      <P>Under the plan, the UN will allow Australia to begin scaling
down its military presence as early as next month as the transition
to a UN force begins, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>In Dili, the Australian-led UN force has struck a temporary deal
with pro-independence Falintil guerrillas under which the Timorese
fighters could keep their weapons so long as they stay away from

      <P>Gusmao, who many see as the president after East Timor becomes
independent, said it was too early for Falintil forces to disarm and
he urged the UN to retrain them for a new security force.</P>
      <P>The Australian-led UN force on Tuesday moved into East Timor's
southern region on a mission to disarm two of the last remaining

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The popular Kinmen kaoliang (sorghum) wine
has attracted interest from a US winery that intends to cooperate
with the Kinmen County government-run distillery to produce a
sorghum-rice blended liquor for markets worldwide.</P>
      <P>American United Distilled Products Co. (AUDP) President Douglas
Mangine paid a courtesy call on Kinmen County Magistrate Chen
Shui-tsai, who concurrently serves as Kinemen Wine Co. chairman, on
Wednesday to discuss possible cooperative projects.</P>
      <P>Kinmen, a Taiwan-held frontline island group, lies closer to
mainland China than to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Mangine was accompanied by Masanobu Shinohara, head of the AUDP's
Tokyo office, and Yuichiro Hamada, chairman of Japan's Hamada Wine
Co., an AUDP subcontractor, during his Kinmen trip.</P>
      <P>Mangine told Chen that they have tasted the Kinmen-produced
kaoliang wine and were impressed by its fine quality and special
flavor.</P>
      <P>Mangine said his company hopes to cooperate with Kinmen Wine Co.
in producing and marketing sorghum-rice blended wine, or kaoliang
sake, around the world.</P>
      <P>Chen said Kinmen Wine Co. welcomes the AUDP cooperation proposal,
adding that making inroads to the world market is Kinmen Wine Co.'s
long-term business goal.</P>
      <P>In fact, Kinmen Wine Co. has produced three flavors of kaoliang
sake, with alcohol contents ranging between 12 percent and 15
percent.</P>
      <P>Chen guided his guests in touring Kinmen Wine Co.'s second
distillery, where kaoliang sake is produced. After savoring a cup of
kaoliang sake, Mangine gave it the thumbs up for good flavor.</P>
      <P>Kinmen kaoliang has long commanded a large share of Taiwan's
highly competitive spirits market. Chen said Kinmen kaoliang also
enjoys a warm welcome in mainland China, where its black market price
is twice the retail price in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is a
kaoliang wine fan, Chen said Gorbachev bought a dozen bottles of
Kinmen kaoliang when he visited Taiwan a few years ago.</P>
      <P>Chen said Kinmen Wine Co.'s board of directors will meet in the
next few days to discuss the AUDP cooperative proposal. If all goes
smoothly, Kinmen Wine Co. will form a strategic alliance with the US
firm to jointly explore new markets for its kaoliang sake.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN POISED TO BECOME WORLD'S WAFER FOUNDRY HUB, SAYS TSMC CEO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With continued growth in semiconductor
design capability and expansion of OEM production techniques, Taiwan
will undoubtedly turn out to be the world's wafer foundry hub in the
years ahead, a leading electronics industrialist said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Morris Chang, chair and CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Company (TSMC), said it will still take some 20 to 25 years for the
world's semiconductor industry to mature. During that period before
the industry becomes saturated with producers, the sky is the limit
for semiconductor makers and foundry services to continue to
flourish, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's domestically-developed IC chips are expected to account
for 30 percent to 40 percent of the world market in the next 20 to 25
years, Chang said. Currently, Taiwan makes about 10 percent of the
world's IC chips.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks during a speech upon receiving an honorary
doctorate in mechanical engineering from the New York Institute of
Technology on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang, who holds a doctorate in electrical engineering from
Stanford University, has successfully built TSMC into one of the top
silicon wafer producers in the world in about 14 years, providing
microchips to clients worldwide.</P>
      <P>TSMC, Taiwan's biggest foundry, is catching up with Intel in the
development of cutting-edge microchip technology.</P>
      <P>Regarding the devastating earthquake that struck Taiwan on Sept.
21, Chang said disruption of electricity in the wake of the quake has
forced TSMC to suspend production for about 10 days, incurring an
overall loss of no more than NT$1 billion (US$31.44 million).</P>
      <P>Now, some two weeks after the quake, 98 percent of TSMC'S
production lines in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park,
Taiwan's Silicon Valley, have been recalibrated, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said TSMC is expected to upgrade its current techniques for
manufacturing eight-inch IC wafers to be able to produce 12-inch
models by the end of 2001 or early 2002. He said Intel, the first
company in the world to use 12-inch wafers, is not expected to
commercially produce the larger wafers until 2001.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chang Chung-jui, a Taiwan-born scientist and president of the
New York Institute of Technology, on Tuesday presided over a brief
ceremony to offer a silent salute to the victims of Taiwan's Sept. 21
quake. The institute has regular annual enrollment of students from
Taiwan.</P>

resolution in support of those affected by the quake, and sent
representatives of the three main political parties to present it to
ROC Ambassador Agustin Liu. Sympathy poured in from civic leaders who
expressed their concern to Liu through telephone calls and letters.</P>
      <P>A series of earthquake-aftermath photographs and news reports

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau said on Wednesday
it will invite senior editors and journalists of major foreign news
media to visit Taiwan as part of its efforts to help foreigners
better understand the island's post-earthquake situation.</P>
      <P>The bureau said extensive coverage by international news media
of a devastating earthquake that ripped through mountainous central
Taiwan's Nantou County on Sept. 21 has prompted many prospective
foreign tourists to cancel their Taiwan travel plans.</P>
      <P>Many foreigners mistakenly thought that Taiwan, a small and
densely populated island, had all been affected by the 7.3-magnitude
earthquake, the bureau said, adding that their cancellation of visits
to Taiwan has dealt a serious blow to all travel-related industries
here, including airlines, hotels, tour bus companies, giftware shops
and the like.</P>
      <P>To help travel-related services weather their current
difficulties, the bureau called a meeting on Wednesday to discuss
concrete tourist promotion measures.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, several carriers operating scheduled flight

    <HEADLINE>VEEP LIEN CALLS FOR FAST HANDLING OF LAW-BREAKING BUILDERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan said on Wednesday
that law enforcement authorities should accelerate investigation of
suspected violations of building codes by some property developers
in order to ease homeless earthquake victims' grievances.</P>
      <P>Lien made the demand in his capacity as a vice chairman of the
ruling Kuomintang at a weekly meeting of the party's
decision-making Central Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>Lien, also the KMT's presidential candidate for the 2000
presidential election, said the recent devastating earthquake has
exposed many shortcomings and deficiencies in enforcing the
country's building codes.</P>
      <P>"We have added strict anti-seismic provisions to our national
building codes in 1972. However, some buildings didn't meet the
updated codes," Lien said, adding that many crumbled structures in
quake-stricken areas had been erected by unscrupulous builders who
used empty plastic bottles and tin cans as filler to save
concrete and bricks.</P>
      <P>Lien said conversion of buildings originally designed for
residential use into office complexes has also proved to be a big
problem.</P>
      <P>Noting that lax enforcement of building codes was one of the
major factors behind the collapse of several high-rise buildings
built after 1972, Lien said the government should make an overall
review of the existing building codes and tighten enforcement of the
provisions to prevent recurrence of similar tragedies.</P>
      <P>Lien said although some contractors, property developers,
architects or civil engineers involved in construction of
buildings which crumbled in the quake have been banned from
leaving the country, none of them have been indicted. "I hope
prosecutors responsible for probing those cases will speed up
investigations and bring all those who have violated existing codes
to justice," he added.
 The 7.3-magnitude temblor that ripped through mountainous
central Taiwan's Nantou County on Sept. 21 has claimed more than
2,200 lives, injured over 8,300 others and left some 100,000 people
homeless.</P>
      <P>Lien said all relevant government agencies should cut
red tape and simplify procedures in handling post-quake relief
work. Moreover, Lien said banks should offer the best possible terms
for loans applications from quake-affected people.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lien suggested that those who had any family members
killed or severely injured in the tremor or whose houses were
toppled or seriously damaged be given a six-month exemption
from National Health Insurance payment. Farmers and
blue-collar workers in the quake-stricken areas who had endured
either of the above-mentioned misfortunes should also be exempted
from labor or farmers insurance premium payments for six months, he
added.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet is expected to approve the proposals to exempt those
quake-affected people, laborers or farmers from relevant insurance
payments for six months at its weekly meeting on Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC-US AIR FORCE SQUADRON HOLDS REUNION IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 6 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Confidentiality was the name of the game for
the 34th Squadron of the Republic of China Air Force and its numerous
missions over the China mainland in the 1950s and 60s. For many
years, the flying unit remained a mystery, and no participants in the
ROC-US project could imagine an eventual reunion in Taipei.</P>
      <P>A reunion was finally realized after 40 years, under the
initiative of retired Col. Donald Jackson of the United States and
retired Gen. I Fu-en of the Republic of China. Some 40 retired
pilots, navigators and electronic warfare officers belonging to the
US Central Intelligence Agency-supported project had a warm and
nostalgic get-together at the Grand Hotel on Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>The attendants at the Oct. 6 lunch meeting, all in their 70s,
represent no more than 30 percent of the gallant airmen who
participated in the daring project, which came to an end in the early
1970s with the advancement of spy satellite technology.</P>
      <P>According to the ROC general, the 34th Squadron suffered the
heaviest toll in action among the ROC Air Force units. Between the
early 1950s and the mid-1960s, the squadron carried out 838 missions,
including 585 sorties over the China mainland and 253 over Vietnam. A
total of 140 airmen lost their lives in the low-altitude flight
missions over vast areas guarded by strong air defense systems.</P>
      <P>The ROC general said that during the years of confrontation
between the United States and the Chinese Communists, the information
collected in the missions "opened a window over the China mainland."
He pointed out that this information and aerial photos were important
for the Bomber Defense Analysis Center in Hsinchu, a unit that
studied critical targets for US strategic air force bombers and
missiles in the event of war.</P>
      <P>He added that the information "indeed strengthened the position
of the leaders in Washington when dealing with the Chinese Communists
at that time."</P>
      <P>On behalf of the US veterans attending the luncheon, the US
colonel said that the reunion in Taipei was a sweet and sorrowful
gathering. It took two years for him to establish contacts with his
old colleagues, and after finally deciding to fly to Taipei for the
occasion, they heard about the tragic earthquake disaster.</P>
      <P>Wondering whether the reunion could still be realized, he called
the ROC general and was impressed to learn that all details for the
reunion were being taken care of. Over the past few days, the US
veterans flew to Taipei in groups, and the reunion party was held on
Oct. 6 as planned.</P>
      <P>At the luncheon, the US colonel and other US electronic warfare
officers who had spent between three to five years in Taiwan in the
1950s and 60s recalled how the project was designed and how dangerous
missions were planned. The Chinese pilots and navigators, on the
other hand, recounted the tremendous dangers of the missions.</P>
      <P>On this joyful occasion, however, all attendants nevertheless
remembered the many airmen lost in action and some others who had
passed away over the past few years.</P>
      <P>The 40-year wait for the reunion might be a little long, but
better late than never. "As a matter of fact, this kind of reunion
was not possible for many years due to the confidential
characteristic of the organization and its missions," explained the
ROC general.</P>
      <P>In the past two decades, stories about the squadron were
gradually revealed. A get-together was not seen as a problem, but for
a long time it did not occur to anyone to organize such a reunion.</P>
      <P>With the efforts of all surviving members of the squadron, the
reunion was realized at last. The ROC general discussed the
significance of the gathering, saying that "our reunion today
ostensibly is a happy get-together of old friends, but in essence, it
is a testimony of the contribution made by the 34th Squadron to the
free world."</P>

      <P>Mainland dissidents Wang Dan and Wei
Jingsheng and Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui are possible
recipients of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, a Hong Kong-based human

      <P>"A key person in Norway who knows the recipient's identity

29, and only a few key people know the result.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese authorities will be unhappy with this year's Nobel
Peace Prize," one of the key people said in a speech recently, which
the center said is "unusual," and likely refers to Wang Dan or Wei
Jingsheng.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APEC RELEASES STUDY ON E-COMMERCE USE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  6  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) Telecommunications Working Group on Wednesday released results
of a survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers on the adoption and use of
electronic commerce by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in APEC
member economies.</P>
      <P>PricewaterhouseCoopers polled SMEs, companies with 500 or fewer
employees, in all 21 APEC economies and received responses from more
than 1,300 businesses. Research also included more than 40 focus
group meetings to identify real and perceived barriers to e-commerce
use by SMEs.</P>
      <P>Such enterprises are key to economic growth in APEC economies,
accounting for nearly 50 percent of total GDPs and 35 percent of
exports.</P>
      <P>"This study provides us with strong indicators of how our
governments might further facilitate the use of e-commerce. It also
shows us that SMEs welcome the involvement of APEC governments in
addressing perceived barriers and facilitating adoption through a
wide range of measures," explained Peter Ferguson, APEC
Telecommunications Working Group representative for e-commerce
issues.</P>
      <P>Nearly 70 percent of responding SMEs identified the need to raise
confidence levels and establish national and international legal
frameworks as important for fostering increased use of e-commerce.</P>
      <P>More than 60 percent of respondents viewed limited access to
information about suitable business models and technologies for
e-commerce as a barrier to be overcome.</P>
      <P>Also highlighted among the findings was a call for more
government use of e-commerce in areas such as procurement and
provision of services.</P>
      <P>Most responding SMEs saw improved customer relations, improved
supply chain integration and reduced input costs as real or potential
benefits of their e-commerce initiatives.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S MOST NOTORIOUS CRIMINAL EXECUTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's most notorious criminal was
executed Wednesday evening after being sentenced to death for his
crimes that panicked the general populace, the Justice Ministry said.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-hsing, 40, was shot to death by a firing squad in
Taipei prison, and his body was immediately rushed to Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital in Linkou, northern Taiwan, where Chen's organs,
including his heart, lung, kidneys and corneas, were removed by a
team of surgeons for transplantation. His liver, because of a
hepatitis-B infection, could not be used.</P>
      <P>Chen had expressed his willing to donate his organs after his
death as a "way of showing regret and compensating society."</P>
      <P>Chen, along with two others, Kao Tien-min and Lin Chun-sheng,
kidnapped, raped and killed the 17-year-old daughter of famous TV
celebrity Pai Ping-ping in April 1997.</P>
      <P>The trio then committed a string of kidnappings, murders and
rapes while they were at large, resulting in the resignation of then
Interior Minister Lin Feng-cheng and National Police Administration
Director-General Yao Kao-chiao after public outcry mounted against
the authorities' inability to apprehend the gang.</P>
      <P>Lin and Kao were killed separately in shootouts with police.</P>
      <P>Chen, after the death of his companions, broke into the house of
a South African diplomat in November 1997, holding him and his family
at gunpoint. Chen later surrendered to police.</P>
      <P>Chen became a devout Christian during his detention in prison.</P>
      <P>Chen's organs will be transplanted to six patients at Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital, National Taiwan Hospital and Veterans General
Hospital. But hospitals will not notify recipients of the source of
their new organs to avoid "unnecessary troubles."</P>
      <P>A patient awaiting a lung transplant at National Taiwan
University Hospital risked life by refusing to accept a new lung
after speculating that it could be from the nation's No. 1 "bad man."</P>
      <P>His brother-in-law, Cheng Chih-hui, was sentenced to life in
prison for his involvement in the Pai case.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AGAIN JOLTED BY QUAKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An earthquake measuring magnitude 5 on the
open-ended Richter scale rocked north-central Taiwan at 1:34 a.m.
Thursday amid numerous aftershocks from the devastating earthquake
that struck central Taiwan on Sept. 21, according to Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) reports.</P>
      <P>The tremor was detected about 19.9 kilometers southeast of the
north-central city of Chupei with its epicenter located 24.65 degrees
latitude north of the equator and 121.07 degrees east longitude, said
CWB earthquake experts.</P>
      <P>It originated 11 kilometers beneath the earth's surface, the
seismologists said.</P>
      <P>The temblor had an intensity of 4.0 in nearby Nanchuang Township
in Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>The seismologists were not sure that Thursday morning's tremor
near Chupei was an isolated earthquake or one of the aftershocks from
the deadly quake on Sept. 21 which killed at least 2,200 people and
left more than 8,700 injured and some 100,000 others temporarily
homeless.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, two weeks after the devastating quake, more than
11,000 aftershocks had been detected, although most of those were
imperceptible except to monitoring instruments. Of the total, 105
were temblors of magnitude 4.0 or greater, the earthquake experts
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, seismological data collected by the CWB showed that
the frequency of aftershocks from the deadly Sept. 21 earthquake has
gradually subsided, with less than 10 per hour on Wednesday, compared
to approximately 150 per hour in the first several days following the
quake.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US HOUSE RESOLUTIONS INTRODUCED TO HELP TAIWAN IN EMERGENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Rep. Chris Cox has introduced a
joint House resolution stating that US agencies should not ask
Beijing for approval before providing Taiwan with emergency
assistance after natural disasters.</P>
      <P>Cox has also introduced another resolution saying that the US
President shall take all necessary steps to support Taiwan's
membership in the International Committee of the Red Cross and the
World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>When the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake that struck Taiwan was
discussed on the House floor on Sept. 28, the Republican Policy
Committee chairman pointed out that "Sometimes it takes an enormous
tragedy such as this earthquake to bring home how futile it is for us
to maintain the political differences that we do have across the
globe."</P>
      <P>"I think everyone watching on television saw that the people of
Taiwan are not the dangerous splitists so often derided by the
Communist government in Beijing, but men and women and children
fighting for a better life, just like all of us," said Congressman
Cox.</P>
      <P>He noted that "The American Red Cross felt it necessary to check
first with Beijing, and that slowed down getting aid to people when
they most needed it."</P>
      <P>Speaking to remedy this situation, Rep. Cox concluded
his remarks by stating that "I think we need legislation to make sure
that every non-governmental organization in America, every charity in
America understands that if there ever is another medical emergency
or natural disaster in Taiwan, they can get their relief there right
away without having to check with Beijing first."</P>
      <P>The California Republican also introduced House Joint
Resolution 70 on Tuesday stating that the US president shall take
all necessary steps to ensure that US government agencies as well
as US and international non-governmental organizations
providing emergency humanitarian, disaster relief or medical
assistance, be notified that when an emergency necessitates the
provision of such assistance to Taiwan, they may provide it as
quickly as possible without first seeking the approval of the
Beijing government.</P>
      <P>Since direct and unobstructed participation in international
health cooperation forums and programs is crucial to help ensure good
health and access to emergency assistance for every citizen of the
world, the resolution also requires that the president shall take all
necessary steps on behalf of the US government to support the
membership of Taiwan in the International Committee of the Red Cross,
the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and the
World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>The resolution further requires that President Clinton
shall submit a status report to Congress by Nov. 1 on the
administration's efforts to accomplish these objectives.</P>

      <P>The great power game among the United

Australian expert.</P>
      <P>In his article published by the Australian Financial Review on
Thursday, Gary Klintworth, visiting fellow at the Australian National

the (Asian) region have stopped flashing. In the South China Sea,
China and the Philippines are considering joint naval patrols."</P>
      <P>"In the Korean peninsula, a more nuanced U.S. diplomatic effort
has reassured Pyongyang of the benefits of freezing its ballistic
missile tests," he said.</P>
      <P>Klintworth said the suggestion of an intensely competitive great
power game between the US, Japan and China in northeast Asia is
exaggerated. "More work has to be done on the Theater Missile Defense
(TMD). But China and the US share vital strategic interests and
continue to cooperate on the Korean peninsula and the easing of
tension and misunderstanding in the Taiwan Strait," he said.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Japanese head liaison officer in Taiwan
presided over a ceremony in Taipei on Thursday marking Japan's
donation of 1,000 ready-made houses to earthquake victims made
homeless by the destructive tremor.</P>
      <P>Shintaro Yamashita, director-general of the Taipei Office of the
Interchange Association, the de facto Japanese embassy in the
Republic of China in the absence of formal diplomatic relations,
officiated at the ceremony marking the donation worth around 250
million yen (approximately US$2.33 million), including transportation
and other handling fees.</P>
      <P>Lin Chin-ching, president of the Association of East Asian
Relations (AEAR), received the donation on behalf of the people of
Taiwan. AEAR is a quasi-official Taipei organization authorized to
handle exchanges with Japan after Tokyo shifted its diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1972.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, Yamashita stated his admiration for those
people who worked around the clock in the earthquake-stricken areas
to rescue trapped victims and to rebuild homes.</P>
      <P>Yamashita said that as soon as his office received an appeal by
Lin for possible acquisition of the Japanese prefabricated housing
units used to house victims of the 1995 Kobe quake, he notified the
authorities in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The donation followed quickly upon Japanese government approval
thanks to the rapid response by authorities in the Hyogo Prefecture
near the port city of Kobe, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>For his part, Lin expressed Taiwan's gratitude to the Japanese
government and people for pitching in with timely and invaluable help
in post-earthquake rescue, relief, and reconstruction efforts.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan's thanks should be directed particularly towards

    <HEADLINE>ROC-PANAMANIAN TIES REMAIN FIRM: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between the Republic of China and
Panama remain firm and solid, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The ministry made the statement in response to a Hong Kong-based
business newsweekly report that Panama, an important ROC ally, may
be close to establishing formal diplomatic relations with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said ROC Ambassador to Panama Lan
Chih-ming told Hu Cheng-yao, director of the ministry's Central and
South American Affairs Department, via telephone early Thursday that
there won't be any change in ROC-Panamanian relations.</P>
      <P>"Lan told Hu that new Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso de
Gruber and Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman had assured him on
many occasions that Panama will maintain its longstanding
relations with the ROC and will even further strengthen bilateral
ties in the future," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Panama's trade and economic exchanges with
mainland China will not affect or disrupt its relations with the
ROC, Chen said he would not make any comment on a former Panamanian
vice president's visit to Beijing in August. "We focus our attention
to substantive relations between our two countries," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen went on to say when Premier Vincent Siew headed an ROC
delegation to attend Moscoso's inaugural ceremony on Sept. 1, the
new Panamanian president repeatedly assured Siew that her
administration will continue expanding cooperative ties with the
ROC.</P>
      <P>"Moscoso also told Siew that she hopes to visit the ROC in the
near future," Chen said, adding that the MOFA is arranging exchanges
of high-level visits between the two countries. New Panamanian
ambassador is scheduled to arrive in Taipei late this month to
assume his post.</P>
      <P>The Far Eastern Economic Review (FEER) reports in its Oct. 14
issue, which hit newsstands on Thursday, that a high-level Panamanian
delegation recently visited Beijing, a sign that a diplomatic shift
could be in the works.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the report, a MOFA official, who preferred
anonymity, said the news was provided by Juan Pablo Pereira,
Panama's chief representative in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA official, Pablo is a pro-Beijing
politician. Pablo was once placed on a list of candidates for the
foreign minister post. However, senior Panamanian authorities
dropped him from the list because of his left-leaning
stance.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official further said Cesar Pereira Burgos, who led a
Panamanian delegation to visit Beijing from late September to early
October, is Pablo's father.</P>
      <P>In the FEER report, Pereira was referred to as president of
Panama's Foreign Affairs Commission. In fact, the MOFA official
said, Pereira is just one of the commission's 15 advisers.</P>
      <P>The official said even though mainland China-Panamanian economic
links are growing steadily, the Panamanian government has repeatedly
denied reports that there may be changes in its relations with the
ROC.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the official said Panama's second vice president is
scheduled to visit the ROC either in December this year or next
spring and that President Moscoso is also likely to visit Taiwan next
year.</P>
      <P>Quoting Pablo, the Far Eastern Economic Review describes
Pereira's weeklong visit to Beijing from late September to early
October as "doing the diplomatic introduction of the new government"
of President Moscoso.</P>
      <P>The weekly also quotes Pereira as saying that Panama "will not
close doors on the possibility" of establishing relations with
mainland China as economic links between the two grow.</P>

the board of the Washington Post and Newsweek, in an interview
that the ROC government would soon propose lifting martial law to
actively promote democracy, but new political parties should abide by
the Constitution and anti-communist policy. He also emphasizes that
the ROC would never negotiate with the Chinese communists.

1990: The National Unification Council is established under the
Office of the President to help plan the policy framework for
national unification, and to integrate various opinions about the
issue at all levels of society.

    <HEADLINE>SEPTEMBER FOREIGN TRADE DECLINE DUE TO EARTHQUAKE IMPACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic and trade activities in
September were significantly impacted by the massive Sept. 21
earthquake and subsequent large-scale power rationing, as shown by
recessionary foreign trade performance for the month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exports grew 0.9 percent in September compared to the same
period last year, while imports declined 0.1 percent. The figures
contrast with double-digit growth of both exports and imports in July
and August, according to statistics released on Thursday by the
Ministry of Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>In September exports reached US$9.56 billion, while imports
amounted to US$8.4 billion. As a result, the island enjoyed a US$1.16
billion foreign trade surplus, the statistics revealed.</P>
      <P>MOF Statistics Department Director Hsu Kuo-chung said that
although the killer earthquake severely damaged the island, the
ministry predicted Taiwan would still enjoy a foreign trade surplus
of some US$10 billion for the year.</P>
      <P>Hsu said MOF experts will not be certain how the "921 earthquake"
has affected Taiwan's 1999 export until mid-October, but they
predicted export growth would reach a level between 6.5 and 7
percent.</P>
      <P>The temblor's impact appeared no more serious than the previous
MOF assessment, according to the daily export volume clearing
customs, Hsu said. He noted that the September daily volume averaged
US$476 million before the earthquake, and merely shrank to US$449
million after the quake.</P>
      <P>Thanks to continued growth of the US economy and recovery of
Asian economies, Taiwan exports registered 6.2 percent growth in the
first nine months of the year, while imports posted a 1.4 percent
rise, according to the MOF statistics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEMORIAL SERVICE TO BE HELD ON OCT. 11 FOR QUAKE VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A memorial service is scheduled to be held
on Oct. 11 to mourn the victims of the killer earthquake that struck
central Taiwan on Sept. 21, said officials of the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui will deliver a speech in
commemoration of the dead during the service, which will be held in
the gymnasium of the National College of Physical Education and
Sports in Linkuo Township. At the ceremony, Academia Sinica President
Lee Yuan-tseh will lay a wreath on behalf of all levels of Taiwan
society.</P>
      <P>All official celebrations of the anniversary of the nation's
founding, which falls on Oct. 10, will be canceled as a result of the
devastating temblor, the island's worst in a century.</P>
      <P>Officials of the MOI, who are responsible for preparation work
for the memorial service, said that the main purpose of the ceremony
is to offer condolences to bereaved families and lead victims out
from under the shadow of the quake, so that they will be confident in
the reconstruction of their homes and the rehabilitation of their new
lives.</P>
      <P>According to the MOI plan, people from various religious groups
as well as delegates from all walks of life, totaling about 10,000,
will be invited to the memorial service to say prayers for the dead.</P>
      <P>Heads of all five branches of the central government and all
Cabinet members, together with members of Congress and municipal
officials, led by President Lee Teng-hui, will mourn for the dead.</P>
      <P>"If You Open the Inner Window of Your Heart," a soprano solo by
Chien Wen-hsieu, is slated as a prelude to the memorial service,
which will be followed by a moment of silence with all attendants
standing.</P>
      <P>The memorial service is expected to conclude in the midst of
choir songs, said MOI officials.</P>
      <P>A committee was formed to coordinate preparation work for the
service. It is presided over by Vice President Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, there are no plans to erect a monument in memory of
the 921 quake, MOI officials disclosed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA REFUSES TO SHOULDER FARMERS CREDIT UNIONS' HUGE LOSSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Thursday that it can not shoulder all losses incurred by farmers
credit unions, and definitely can not buy out quake victims'
collateral or bear total costs for credit union reconstruction.</P>
      <P>The COA rejected petitions by farmers credit unions at a
conference, for which central Taiwan credit union officials had
specifically come to Taipei in order to request government
assistance.</P>
      <P>The credit unions suggested measures which include:</P>
      <P>-- joint finance of a fund totaling NT$60 billion to be used to
revitalize farmers credit unions and to buy out collateral losses;</P>
      <P>-- allocation of NT$67.5 billion for credit union office
reconstructions and for making new loans;</P>
      <P>-- awards of preferential loans for reconstruction of credit
union offices, requested on the grounds that the financial
institutions be given the same benefits as individual quake victims,</P>
      <P>-- assumption of all credit union operational costs.</P>
      <P>Credit union demands, exceeding NT$100 billion, were rejected by
COA officials, saying the amount was beyond government reach and that
the COA has already allocated NT$3 billion for farmers living in
earthquake-affected areas.</P>
      <P>According to a report by credit unions, 38 farmers credit unions
located in Miaoli County, Taichung County and Nantou County were
seriously damaged by the Sept. 21 earthquake, and reported NT$10.9
billion in collateral losses, while their total reconstruction costs
reached NT$26.2 billion.</P>
      <P>The report also revealed that loans worth NT$27 billion among the
overall NT$135 billion in loans made by those credit unions were at
risk of becoming dead loans after the quake, which damaged vast
amounts of collateral, land and agricultural products.</P>
      <P>A domino-effect financial crisis looms at the grassroots level
and threatens to strike if the government fails to take measures to
help the cash-strapped farmers credit unions and respond to their
requests, warned credit union officials.

    <HEADLINE>SWEDEN DONATES RELIEF GOODS TO TAIWAN'S QUAKE VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Sweden on Thursday donated NT$50 million
(about US$11.57 million) worth of relief goods to help
earthquake-affected people in the Republic of China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 80 tons of relief materials, including 354 large tents,
1,485 sleeping bags and 10,000 blankets, were airlifted to Taiwan by
the ROC's largest carrier China Airlines free of charges.</P>
      <P>The Swedish government sent John Pehrson, a parliamentarian, and
Claes Goran Karlsson, an official with Sweden's Rescue Services
Agency, to Taiwan to present the relief goods on its behalf.</P>
      <P>Shaw Yu-ming, a deputy secretary-general of the ROC's ruling
Kuomintang, received the donation in a ceremony held at the party's
headquarters in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Pehrson said he has come to Taiwan on behalf of the Swedish
parliament and government to express concern and support for the
people of Taiwan at the time of their grief.</P>
      <P>Noting that Swedish and Taiwan people share common values and
ideals of upholding freedom, democracy and human rights, Pehrson
said he hopes the Sweden-donated goods can help those who have
become homeless after a 7.3-magnitude earthquake rattled Taiwan on
Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>For his part, Shaw thanked the Swedish government for its
generous donation on behalf of the ROC government and the ruling
party.</P>
      <P>Noting that Sweden spends 1 percent of its gross national product
(GNP) on international humanitarian aid annually, Shaw said Taiwan
should learn from Sweden in helping other developing countries.</P>
      <P>The tents donated by Sweden can accommodate 20 people each and
have lighting equipment. Residents can also cooking in those tents.</P>
      <P>Shaw said the tents will be sent to hardest-stricken aboriginal
villages in mountainous central Taiwan's Nantou and Taichung
counties.</P>
      <P>In the company of several officials from the Cabinet's
Aboriginal Affairs Commission and the KMT's Youth Affairs
Department, Pehrson and Karlsson visited Taichung County's Tungshih
and Shihkang townships, two of the hardest-hit areas, in the
afternoon.</P>
      <P>The 921 earthquake was the worst natural disaster to hit Taiwan
in a century, which has claimed more than 2,200 lives, injured over
8,500 others and left some 100,000 people homeless.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US RESCUE TEAM PRAISES ROC GOVERNMENT'S PREPAREDNESS IN RELIEF WORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  6  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of the US rescue team from
Virginia that came to Taiwan to save victims of the Sept. 21
earthquake, on Wednesday praised the professional preparedness of
Taiwan's government in quake rescue efforts.</P>
      <P>Mike Tammillow, leader of Virginia Task Force One (VA-TF1) of the
Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue Team, delivered the compliment
during a dinner party hosted by Stephen Chen, Republic of China
representative to the United States, to honor the task force's good
deeds in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tammillow, who participated in two major rescue operations, in
Turkey and Taiwan, during a one-month period, said that his team
learned a lot on the Taiwan mission.</P>
      <P>When the team's advance detachment arrived in Taipei soon after
the destructive temblor struck in the early morning hours of Sept.
21, Tammillow said, they were met by Taiwanese officials who were
prepared with detailed information about quake-stricken areas,
including blueprints of buildings that had collapsed, burying
numerous sleeping dwellers.</P>
      <P>The VA-TF1 had never had such experiences when offering disaster
assistance in foreign countries, Tammillow added, also noting that
the US rescue team is willing to provide know-how to help Taiwan
authorities form their own search and rescue teams.</P>
      <P>Members of the rescue team who participated in the Taiwan relief
mission are obliged to submit reports on the Asian operation within
three months after returning home in order to review and document
response to the disaster, according to Tammillow.</P>
      <P>More than 90 members of the rescue team, which includes the
Fairfax task force, disaster response experts from the US Agency for
International Development (USAID), and search and rescue specialists
from Miami and Dade County, attended the party. At the gathering,
which was also attended by many team members' spouses, Chen presented
each member a certificate of appreciation expressing the heartfelt
gratitude of the government and people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The team began rescue operations on Sept. 22 in Touliu, an urban
area that is approximately 32 miles from the 7.3-magnitude earthquake
epicenter, in Nantou County. On the following day, the team dug out a
32-year-old male survivor from amid the rubble of his former
residence.</P>
      <P>The US crew had also saved four lives in Turkey, after that
country's devastating temblor, before going to Taiwan. The group is
commissioned by USAID to provide international aid, and the
government pays for training and equipment and handles costs
associated with missions.</P>
      <P>The "921 Earthquake," Taiwan's largest this century, claimed more
than 2,200 lives islandwide and injured more than 8,700 people. Puli
township in Nantou County, the epicenter of the massive temblor, was
almost entirely destroyed, leaving tens of thousands of people
homeless.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE MAINLAND SPOUSES TO BE ALLOWED TO SETTLE IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal
to raise the annual quota for mainland Chinese spouses of Republic
of China nationals to be allowed to settle in Taiwan to 3,600 people
from current 1,800.</P>
      <P>The proposal to double the annual quota for mainlanders to live
here with their Taiwan husbands or wives was initiated by the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), which charts Taiwan's policy
toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Su Chi said at the Cabinet's weekly meeting that
the relaxation was made on humanitarian considerations.</P>
      <P>"An estimate based on figures provided by civic groups and
individual scholars shows that the number of marriages across the
Taiwan Strait exceeds 50,000," Su said, adding that some 30,000
mainland spouses are still on the waiting list for permits to settle
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su said the MAC has proposed the large increase in hopes that
the quota will not be changed again in the next three years.</P>
      <P>The new quota will take effect with the endorsement of the
Legislative Yuan, the ROC's lawmaking assembly, which is
expected to approve the proposal soon.</P>
      <P>Su went on to say that the government will offer easier access
for mainland spouses to the National Health Insurance coverage once
they are allowed to settle on the island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su said the government will also take measures to
prevent mainlanders from working here under fake marriage
arrangements.</P>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait were separated politically in
1949 at the end of a bitter civil war. The two rivals have since
maintained no official-level contacts.</P>
      <P>Civilian exchanges have expanded since Taipei permitted
mainland-bound visits in late 1987. Bilateral trade has been booming
and the number of cross-strait marriages has also been rising
steadily.</P>
      <P>Under current Taiwan regulations, mainland spouses can apply for
settlement in Taiwan after two years of their marriages.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER SAYS ROC-PANAMANIAN TIES STABLE AT PRESENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  7 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Thursday
that relations between the Republic of China and Panama are stable.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review reported on
Wednesday that Panama might switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei
to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Hu said that rumors always exist, and this one indicates that
Beijing is continuing its attempts to lure away countries that are
friendly toward the ROC.</P>
      <P>The magazine quoted Juan Pablo Pereira, Panamanian representative
in Hong Kong, as reporting that Cesar Pereira Borgos, chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee of Panama's Legislative Assembly, headed
a delegation to Beijing with the aim of "diplomatic introduction of
(Panamanian President) Moscoso's new government." Cesar Pereira is
Juan Pablo Pereira's father.</P>
      <P>The publication also quoted the elder Pereira as saying that
Panama "will not close the door on the possibility" of establishing
relations with mainland China as economic links between the two grow.</P>
      <P>Answering questions raised by the press, Hu said that it is
natural that conflicting information sometimes arises in democratic
nations.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the magazine article reveals Beijing's unchanged
intention to destroy ties between the ROC and countries with which it
has diplomatic relations. Hu stated that Beijing has especially
strengthened its pressure on ROC allies in Central America, adding
that Beijing's efforts will never cease.</P>
      <P>After double checking, Hu deemed ROC-Panamanian ties to be stable
at present, and said that rumors are only rumors. He urged the public
to carefully consider the credibility of those who leaked the news.</P>
      <P>In related news, the younger Pereira said on Thursday that the
Panamanian government has deeply treasured its diplomatic relations
with the Republic of China and hopes that relations will be further
expanded in the future.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a Central News Agency correspondent, he
clearly declared that Panama and mainland China have not yet
negotiated establishment of diplomatic relations. He did, however,
admit that Panama-mainland China relations were steadily growing.</P>
      <P>The younger Pereira did not rule out the possibility that Panama
and mainland China would begin official negotiations to establish
diplomatic relations in the future. At present, the contact between
Panama and mainland China is leading in this direction, he added.</P>

the difficulties resulting from the quake. The group will take over
the work of Salvation Army members now in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Many victims could not handle the blow of losing their relatives

Chen said. Members of the Salvation Army will assist victims'
psychological recovery in accordance with each individual's
situation, he added.</P>

      <P>Justice Minister Yeh Chin-feng said on
Thursday that the execution of kidnapper-rapist Chen Chin-hsing was
conducted in accordance with the normal operations of her ministry.</P>
      <P>She said the Justice Ministry had no intention of deepening the
public's scars from death at a time when the island was just shocked

      <P>Chen, who had murdered four people and was involved in more than

      <P>Saying that she had no feeling of happiness over Chen's execution

protracted pain suffered by Chen's victims and their families.</P>
      <P>She urged the public to review this case seriously and
cautiously, and not to make snap judgments merely based on a few
comments.</P>
      <P>Regarding the plan by a pastor to publish a 500,000-word book by

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  6 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the worst case, conflict across the
Taiwan Strait "could affect the future of the entire region for years
to come, with everyone a major loser," a senior US official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Calling the situation "perhaps the single most dangerous issue in
Asia" in the coming decades, the official said the US role is to
promote stability by maintaining the current framework governing
relations between Washington, Beijing and Taipei.</P>
      <P>While Kenneth Lieberthal, senior director for Asian Affairs at
the National Security Council, stood by the existing framework,
scholars went further and called on both Beijing and Taipei to show
more flexibility.</P>
      <P>During a discussion on the future of US-PRC relations, David
Lampton, director of China Studies at the Paul H. Nitze School of
Advanced International Studies (SAIS), suggested that both sides
"take the worst fear of the other off the table."</P>
      <P>"I'd like to see them ... suspend the threats of either
independence or force, and work on cooperation," he said.</P>
      <P>The expert also said that the Beijing leadership has to come up
with a formula that attracts the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Deterrence can keep them from going independent but deterrence
will never achieve unification for the Chinese people," he said.</P>
      <P>For the United States, Lampton said, in addition to opposing the
use of force by mainland China, Washington has to make it clear to
Taiwan that it should not engage in "excessively provocative
behavior."</P>
      <P>Paul Wolfowitz, dean of the SAIS, agreed that mainland China
should adopt a more positive approach and offer inducements to Taiwan
rather than threats.</P>
      <P>When asked whether Beijing would consider renouncing the use of
force in exchange for a promise from Taiwan not to declare
independence, the mainland China envoy to Washington did not give a
direct answer.</P>
      <P>Instead, Li Zhaoxing reiterated Beijing's position that the
threat of military force is not aimed against the people of Taiwan
and that there can be no compromise on the issue of sovereignty.

      <P>The Sept. 21 earthquake
has not only given central Taiwan a geological facelift by flattening
peaks and creating lakes, it has also shattered the cadastral map of
the mountainous region, said Taiwan's top land administrator on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yuan-hsu, director of the Land Administration Department
under the Ministry of the Interior, who returned to the hardest hit
areas to inspect on Thursday, said the temblor and its powerful
aftershocks have made a large-scale land resurvey in central Taiwan

      <P>Land surveyors found that Tungshih and Hsinshe Townships of
Taichung County have shifted several kilometers in a northwesterly
direction while Tiehchanshan, located in Tachia Township, shifted
south-southeast as a result of a collision between two sections in
the earth's crust along a deadly fault line.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that in Taichung County alone, some 340,000
pieces of land will have to be re surveyed to decide their cadaster
in the wake of the deadliest quake to hit Taiwan this century.</P>
      <P>Tseng Teh-fu, director general of the Interior Ministry's Land
Survey Bureau, said he saw a rice paddy at the juncture of Fengyuan
City and Shihkang Township that used to be level with the adjacent
road become a terraced field after the jolt shook the land.</P>
      <P>Tseng said a pear orchard on a 1,000-ping (6,000 square feet)
tract of land in Tungshih became a hill after the land shifts caused
by the quake, reducing the tract to a 60-ping stand -- a geostratic
sabotage he has never seen in his 30 year career.</P>
      <P>Taichung County has become smaller cadastrally after the deadly
quake while neighboring Nantou County has become larger, said Tseng.
Taichung and Nantou counties were the hardest hit areas in the Sept.
21 quake.</P>

(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Adrienne Clarkson, the first ethnic Chinese
and second woman to become Canada's governor general, Thursday
sought Canadians' help in her effort to build a "color-blind" Canada.</P>
      <P>In her installation speech, Clarkson stressed the idea of
inclusiveness and her idea to make Canada a "color-blind" society.</P>
      <P>"The essence of inclusiveness is that we are part of a society in
which language, color, education, sex and money need not, should not
divide us, but can make us more aware and sensitive to difference,"
she said.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister Jean Chretien praised the new governor general as
"a person of singular talent, discernment and achievement, who today
becomes the representative of our Head of State in Canada."</P>
      <P>"She and her family were initially turned away when they sought
refuge in Canada because they were Chinese. Her presence here today
tells us how far we have come as a nation. A nation built by
immigrants. By those who sought our national dream and our safe
haven," Chretien said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that her becoming governor general is a telling sign
of the way times have changed in Canada, sending a powerful message
that Canadians are resolved to share their experiences and keep a
strong and distinctive Canadian presence in the global village.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>US Congressman Ron E. Paul introduced a
resolution to end US membership in the United Nations on Thursday
after UN threats to deprive the United States of its voting right in
the UN General Assembly.</P>
      <P>UN Undersecretary for Management Joseph Connor has warned the
United States that its voting right at the UN General Assembly would
be revoked if Washington refused to repay its debts totaling $1.2
billion to the international organization as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>To counter this threat, Rep. Paul introduced a House Resolution,
titled the "American Sovereignty Restoration Act of 1999, which calls
on the US government to repeal The United Nations Participation Act
of 1945. It adds that the president shall terminate all participation
by the United States in the United Nations and any of its affiliated
agencies.</P>
      <P>The resolution also calls for the US to withdraw from its
agreement with the United Nations regarding the UN Headquarters in
New York, ban the appropriation of any funds or voluntary
contributions to the United Nations or its affiliated agencies,
terminate U.S. participation in UN peacekeeping operations and its
contribution to any UN military operation, prohibit the United
Nations from occupying or using any U.S. government property or
facility, and revoke the diplomatic privileges and immunities enjoyed
by UN personnel and members of any mission to the United Nations of
any foreign government.</P>
      <P>In addition, the proposed bill requires the United States to
withdraw from the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization and the World Health Organization, as well as repeal the
UN Environmental Participation Act and all conventions and/or
agreements with the United Nations and its affiliated agencies.</P>
      <P>The resolution states that effective on the date of its

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Panamanian Foreign Minister Jose Miguel
Aleman has denied a report that Panama is considering establishing
diplomatic relations with mainland China, a Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Hu Cheng-yao, director of the MOFA's Central and American Affairs
Department, said Aleman clarified and denied the report during a
meeting with Republic of China Ambassador to Panama Lan Chih-ming on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Far Eastern Economic Review reported on
Wednesday that Panama might switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei
to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The weekly business magazine quoted Juan Pablo Pereira,
Panamanian representative in Hong Kong, as reporting that Cesar
Pereira Borgos, president of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the
Panamanian parliament, headed a delegation to Beijing with an aim of
"diplomatic introduction" of Panamanian President Moscoso's new
government. Cesar Pereira is Juan Pablo Pereira's father.</P>
      <P>The weekly also quoted the elder Pereira as saying that Panama
"will not close the door on the possibility" of establishing
relations with mainland China as economic links between the two grow.</P>
      <P>"During his meeting with our ambassador, Aleman said Cesar
Pereira is just an adviser to the Foreign Affairs Commission," said
Hu, adding: "Aleman also stressed that Cesar Pereira's visit to
Beijing from late September to early October was of a private nature
and didn't carry any diplomatic significance."</P>
      <P>Hu said Aleman also expressed his regret to Ambassador Lan over
improper remarks made by the Panamanian Hong Kong representative,
adding that Aleman has asked Pablo Pereira to refrain from making
public speeches on issues other than the economy or trade-related
topics.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, Aleman also asked Lan to convey to the ROC
government and people that relations between the two countries remain
stable and friendly.</P>
      <P>Just a few days ago, Hu said, Aleman told Lan that Panama will
maintain formal diplomatic ties with the Republic of China while
forging closer commercial and trade links with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Panama remains one of the ROC's important diplomatic allies as
mainland China continues its efforts to further isolate the ROC
diplomatically in the international community.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FREIGHTER CREW RESCUED AMID STORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  southern  Taiwan, Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>All 15 crew members of
the Panamanian freighter Fukuo Shin, which suffered mechanical
failure amid stormy weather, were safely rescued by Taiwan military
personnel just before noon on Friday, according to Kaohsiung Harbor
authorities.</P>
      <P>The ship carried a Japanese captain and 14 Philippine crew
members, who broadcast an S.O.S. for urgent help around 7:30 Friday
morning after the vessel's engines failed. The crew then anchored the
ship about half a nautical mile offshore from Kaohsiung's Chiching
Port.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor authorities immediately requested assistance
from the air rescue division of the Kaohsiung police department and
from the Seagull Emergency Operation Squadron of the armed forces.</P>
      <P>Braving strong winds and torrential rain brought on by Typhoon
Dan, the Seagulls managed to save two crew members on their first
try. The rescue attempt was suspended for about two hours due to
dangerous weather conditions, according to the harbor authorities.</P>
      <P>The Seagulls resumed the rescue mission around 11:00 a.m., and
with several difficult flights in the storm, they transported all
stranded crew members to safety at Kaohsiung Harbor.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) on Friday set up
an emergency task force as Typhoon Dan threatened the entire island
with downpours and strong winds.</P>
      <P>According to weather forecasters, as of 3:00 p.m. Friday, Dan was
centered 220 kilometers southwest of Penghu Island in the Taiwan
Strait, with a radius of 200 kilometers and packing winds of 33
meters per second. Dan was moving northward at a speed of 12
kilometers per hour.</P>
      <P>The whole island is expected to come under Dan's outer perimeter
as it was continuing to move in a northerly direction, weather
forecasters said.</P>
      <P>People on the offshore Penghu and Kinmen islands in particular
should brace themselves for strong winds, while those in eastern,
central and southern parts of Taiwan should be prepared for
torrential rains, they warned.</P>
      <P>Residents of central Taiwan areas that are now fragile and
volatile in the wake of the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake should be
on full alert for landslides and mudslides triggered by floods.</P>
      <P>In low-lying coastal areas of the southern counties of Chiayi and
Tainan, residents should prepare for possible inundation by sea
water, the weather forecasters said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR TAIWAN: AUSSIE SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   8   (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian scholars suggested that
international incidents and military alliances, such as the Kosovo
crisis and a US-initiated Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system, could
have implications for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Three scholars presented papers on Australia's strategic and
defense policy, its perspective on TMD, and implications of the
Kosovo crisis for Taiwan, at the "International Conference on
Australia and East Asian Security into the 21st Century" held at the
National Chengchi University on Friday.</P>
      <P>Scholars from Australia, the Republic of China, the United States
and South Korea were invited to present papers at the one-day
conference which was cosponsored by the ROC's National Chengchi
University, the Australian Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei,
and the Taiwan Research Institute.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Australia is concerned about the prospect of a
"missile and counter-missile" arms race in Northeast Asia, Dr. Gary
Klintworth of the Australian National University said that "we do not
want a contest in which there can only be losers and a likely risk of
a nuclear standoff between China and the US."</P>
      <P>The Australian scholars said that TMD at mainland China's
doorstep is seen as a challenge by Beijing. "China already has a
basic anti-missile system of its own, and therefore by implication it
recognizes the benefits of ... missile defense," he added.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that "both China and Taiwan are important members of
the APEC community and they rank among our top export markets," Dr.
Klintworth said that "we see Taiwan's continued independence from
mainland Chinese control -- within a one-China framework -- as being
in the best interests of China, Taiwan and the region."</P>
      <P>To do away with the prevailing spirit of distrust and avoid
missile and counter-missile proliferation in Northeast Asia, the
scholar suggested that huge diplomatic efforts are required to
establish constructive dialogues.</P>
      <P>Dr. Greg Austin, research fellow at the Australian National
University, in his paper pointed out that the NATO war against Serbia
earlier this year and the subsequent occupation of Kosovo by NATO
forces created new optimism and new fears around the world.
"Political leaders in China, Russia and the Third World talked of a
threat to world order and international law posed by the West's new
doctrine."</P>
      <P>A series of symposia discussing the Kosovo crisis as "a new
threat to strategic stability" was held over the past few months.
"Kosovo has created a new Zeitgeist (spirit of the times) throughout
major capitals of the world," said Austin.</P>
      <P>While the NATO war against Serbia represented, according to
Chinese perceptions, the first military manifestation of the Clinton
doctrine of expansion of democracy, the Australian scholar warned of
the implication of the Kosovo Zeitgeist for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that most of mainland China's leaders suspected that they
might need to go to war to oppose military interference, such as the
NATO action against Serbia. He feared that "sentiment in the
leadership has been moved -- above all by the Kosovo Zeitgeist --
closer to the desire to teach Taiwan a lesson."</P>
      <P>Calling on both Taipei and Beijing to work beyond rhetoric,
Austin opined that "if Taiwan pushes China further, appeal to the USA
will not save it from severe punishment."</P>
      <P>He added that "Once the punishment action occurred, the spirit of
deterioration in China-US relations would end, and bottom out at
sustained military confrontation of a Cold War type with the Taiwan
Strait as the dividing line similar to the inner German border during
the US-Soviet stand-off."</P>
      <P>Dr. Desmond Ball of the Strategic and Defense Studies Center of
the Australian National University gave a briefing on the evolving
security architecture of the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Speaking on principal features of the emerging regional security
environment, the scholar pointed out that "China has emerged as the
country of most concern in the region." He further stated that "It is
essential that China be engaged in multilateral dialogues,
confidence-building arrangements, preventive diplomacy, and other
forms of security cooperation in the region."</P>

      <P>Representatives from some 970 foreign and

opening of a five-day international electronic components and
equipment exhibition at the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>More than 1,800 booths were set up by the business companies to

range of precision electronic equipment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's semi-official China External Trade Development Council

(TEEMA) jointly sponsored the fair that will run through Tuesday.</P>
      <P>TEEMA Chairman Wu Si-chung indicated that the fair is part of the
Taipei International Electronics Show of 1999, which also includes an
exhibition of finished electronic products, scheduled for Oct. 16-20.</P>
      <P>The sponsors decided to divide the show into two separate
exhibitions because there is not enough display space at the Taipei
trade center to accommodate all relevant businesses at one time, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>The lack of display venues is a challenge for Taiwan's electronic
sector, which requires more channels to promote and demonstrate their
products, Wu noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN POLICE CRACK DOWN ON TRANSNATIONAL ILLICIT GAMBLING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   Oct.   8   (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police from Taiwan's Criminal
Investigation Bureau (CIB) and a local law-enforcement task force on
Friday raided the headquarters of a gambling ring that allegedly
organized illegal betting on baseball games and lotteries in both
Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>The police arrested the alleged leader of the ring, Shi
Jung-chung, 31, at the Kaohsiung-based headquarters in southern
Taiwan, while another squad nabbed Wu Jung-tih, 41, at the ring's
branch in Pingtung County on a charge of running an illicit gambling
operation.</P>
      <P>At the raided headquarters, the police also seized six computers,
24 fax machines, 24 video cassette recorders, five telephone units,
20 calculators, two needle cameras, five monitors, a number of
gambling tickets, and several account books, all of which are
regarded as evidence supporting alleged illicit gambling, according
to the police.</P>
      <P>After checking the account books, the CIB found that the ring had
accepted more than NT$10 billion (US$314.47 million) a year from
gamblers in Taiwan and the United States since the ring was
established in December 1996, the police said.</P>
      <P>The gambling activities were allegedly conducted through the
Internet, the world's largest communications network, with gamblers
betting on professional baseball games in Taiwan and the Unites
States or buying lottery tickets using home computers, the police
added.</P>
      <P>The ring erected over 30 branch sites around the island, which
together averaged over NT$174.63 million (US$5.49 million) in illicit
gambling transactions per day, the police noted.</P>
      <P>Acting on tips, the CIB launched the mission to crack down on the
transnational illicit gambling, resulting in the largest raid of its
kind on the island. Police are investigating the case further.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GAS PRICE TO BE REVIEWED BY END OF OCTOBER: CPC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 8 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials of the state-run Chinese Petroleum
Corp. (CPC) said that the issue of whether to raise the domestic
gasoline price will be reviewed and discussed by the end of October.</P>
      <P>The CPC was referring to the dilemma it faced owing to the fact
that it has not met the government's projected profit target since
July, and is thus under increasing pressure to raise the price. On
the other hand, with an eye to stabilizing consumer prices in the
wake of the killer earthquake, it would be painful to raise the gas
price.</P>
      <P>The CPC made public Friday its pre-tax profit in September, which
was NT$1.49 billion short of the projected profit target.</P>
      <P>The business turned over NT$33.25 billion in September, with a
pre-tax profit of NT$332 million, according to figures released by
the CPC. Since the projected profit set by the government budget for
the CPC is NT$1.82 billion, the shortfall totals NT$14.9 billion.</P>
      <P>As the international gas price has surged in recent months, the
CPC, not reflecting the cost in its current gas price, did not meet
its profit goal for three months in a row: shortages of NT$178
million in July, NT$112.4 million in August, and NT$148.9 million in
September resulted in heavy pressure for the CPC to adjust its price
upward.</P>
      <P>The CPC originally planned to raise the gas price in October.
However, since stabilizing consumer prices was set as one of the top
priorities of the government, the CPC thus decided not to raise the
gas price in October.</P>
      <P>What matters most for the CPC in weighing the price issue, said
head of the CPC, is not its petroleum import cost, but rather the
island's social situation after the temblor, and stable consumer
prices.</P>
      <P>The CPC is to review and discuss the current gas price by the end
of October, said the CPC official, adding that a decision will be
made after issues concerning domestic consumer prices, quake
rehabilitation and social conditions have all been taken into
consideration.</P>
      <P>Were it an issue of sheer reflection of purchase cost, the CPC
would have adjusted the gas price upward much earlier, stressed the
official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA DOESN'T COMMENT ON PAPUA NEW GUINEA'S DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's representative to Taipei Sam
Gerovich said Friday at an academic conference that Australia's
concerns over Papua New Guinea related only to the issue of economic
governance in that country, not to the possible establishment of
diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gerovich of the Australian Commerce and Industry Office in
Taipei, told attendants at the "International Conference on Australia
and East Asian Security" that "the Australian government did not make
any comment about choices on diplomatic recognition between Beijing
and Taipei by Papua New Guinea, nor does it do so with any other
country."</P>
      <P>He said that Australia was only concerned that Papua New Guinea
might have been seeking funds from Taiwan as an alternative to
committing itself to necessary economic disciplinary measures under
an IMF/World Bank program.</P>
      <P>Stressing that successive Australian governments have for nearly
three decades maintained a "one China" policy, Gerovich said that "it
has been Australia's consistent view that the relationship between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits is for the PRC and Taiwan to
resolve."</P>
      <P>He elaborated that during Chinese Communist President Jiang
Zemin's recent visit to Australia, Australian Prime Minister John
Howard had made it clear in public and in private that Australia
believed the current tensions should be resolved peacefully, without
any resort to military force.</P>
      <P>The trade representative said that "Taiwan remains an important
partner for Australia, and the Australian government is committed to
promoting the development of bilateral relations."</P>
      <P>"Prime Minister Howard reaffirmed this in his speech at
Parliament House during President Jiang's visit," Gerovich added.</P>
      <P>Since 1992, the Republic of China and Australia have signed seven
important bilateral agreements. Last year, two-way trade between the
ROC and Australia totaled US$4.5 billion, making the ROC Australia's
seventh largest export market and its ninth largest supplier of
imports, according to Timothy Yang, secretary-general of the ROC's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>Invited to address the conference's opening ceremony Friday
morning, Yang said that "our external relations and foreign policy
are very much geared to cooperation with all countries and we have
every interest in working together for peace, security and economic
prosperity for all nations."</P>

    <HEADLINE>83% OF FIRMS IN QUAKE-STRICKEN AREAS RESUME PRODUCTION: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of manufacturing companies in
earthquake-stricken central Taiwan have resumed normal operations,
according to the results of two surveys released on Friday.</P>
      <P>The surveys of manufacturing firms in hardest-stricken areas,
including Nantou, Taichung and Yunlin counties as well as Taichung
City, were conducted by the China Productivity Center at the request
of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>The first poll was conducted on Sept. 23, two days after the 921
earthquake that ripped through mountainous central Taiwan's Nantou
County and claimed more than 2,200 lives islandwide. A total of 109
companies were surveyed and 92 of them responded to the
questionnaire.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 49.5 percent of the respondents said
their production facilities were slightly affected in the tremor;
11.9 percent said their production lines were seriously damaged;
another 11.9 percent said their facilities remained intact.</P>
      <P>By industry, the electric appliances industry was worst
affected, with 33.3 percent saying their production facilities
were damaged; followed by the machinery manufacturing industry, with
16.7 percent of companies in the line damaged; and the metal
processing industry, with 13.3 percent affected.</P>
      <P>By areas, 70 percent of damaged manufacturing firms were located
in Taichung City and Taichung County.</P>
      <P>The second survey was conducted from Sept. 24 to Oct. 4, with
170 of the 201 firms questioned responding to the poll, which focused
on exploring their financial losses.</P>
      <P>Survey results showed that 42.4 percent of the companies
interviewed said they had suffered financial losses in the
devastating quake.</P>
      <P>Among them, 23.5 percent said their financial losses were
estimated at below NT$1 million (US$31,447); 4.7 percent said they
lost NT$5 million to NT$10 million in the killer quake; 3.5 percent
estimated their losses at NT$10 million to NT$30 million; and 3.4
percent said their financial losses ranged between NT$1 million to
NT$3 million.</P>
      <P>Among those whose production facilities were damaged, 23.9
percent said the damage was mainly done to their plants; 23.4
percent said their production machines were damaged; 21.4 percent
said their production line was affected; 21.4 percent said they saw
their orders and the number of clients decline; 19.4 percent said
they had difficulties obtaining parts supplies after the quake; 20.9
percent said they have been troubled by raw materials supply
problems since the quake; and 20 percent said they have suffered all
kinds of the above-mentioned damage and problems.</P>
      <P>Asked about their post-earthquake situation, 83.5 percent said
they have resumed normal operations; 5.9 percent said they need one
more week to resume normal production; 4.1 percent said they expect
to resume normal operations in two weeks; and another 4.1 percent
said they can resume normal production in one month.</P>
      <P>The figures show that 97.6 percent of the firms can resume
normal operations in a month, while only 2.4 percent said they need
more than three months to resume full production.</P>
      <P>Analyzing survey results, Vice Economics Minister Lin Yi-fu said
most companies in the disaster zones hope that the government will
offer low-interest loans and tax deductions or exemptions to
facilitate their recovery from the damage.</P>
      <P>Lin said the MOEA has asked the Finance Ministry to offer
NT$50 billion in low-interest loans for companies to repair
their damaged production facilities.</P>
      <P>Lin further said the ministry will ask the Finance Ministry to
consider quake-affected firms' requests for tax exemptions and
deductions.</P>

      <P>The Guatemalan Legislative
Assembly recently passed a resolution to support the Republic of
China's bid for membership in the United Nations and other
international organizations, including the World Health Organization
(WHO).</P>
      <P>The resolution, which was passed by the Legislative Assembly last
month, also called on Guatemalan administrative departments to back
the ROC's bid for membership in the international organizations. The
resolution will be presented to the Central American Parliament and
Panama for their support.</P>
      <P>The resolution said that the ROC was the first republic in Asia
and one of the founding members of the United Nations. The ROC was
also one of the first countries to sign the charter of the United
Nations. The United Nations, however, passed Resolution No. 2758 at
its 26th General Assembly to expel the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The Guatemalan resolution went on to say that Resolution No. 2758
had not completely resolved the China problem. It also said the UN
resolution deprived the more than 2.2 million people of Taiwan of
their rights to education and environmental and cultural protection
under the United Nations system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the international situation has changed greatly since
Resolution No. 2758 was passed 29 years ago. Therefore, the
resolution should be amended, the Guatemalan Legislative Assembly's
resolution said.</P>

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Friday promised
to help Taiwan's largest private disaster relief team obtain more
funds for improving personnel training and purchasing advanced

      <P>Braving drizzling rains, Lee toured the Republic of China Search

express his gratitude for the group's assistance in relief
operations in the wake of the Sept. 21 earthquake, Taiwan's worst
natural disaster in a century.</P>
      <P>Over the past 17 days, Lee said, he has spent 13 days in the
quake-stricken areas. "During those inspection tours, I have often
seen members of the corps striving hard to rescue trapped survivors
from the wreckage of crumbled buildings," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said he admires all team members' bravery and devotion. "I
also appreciates your assistance in post-earthquake relief
operations," the president added.</P>
      <P>The non-profit rescue team was founded 18 years ago. Its members
come from different walks of life, including teachers, drivers,
construction workers and white-collar salaried people. All of them
are volunteers.</P>
      <P>The corps mobilizes more than 2,000 members to join search
and rescue operations in the wake of the deadly 921 earthquake.</P>

group has been troubled by a lack of funds for sending members
abroad to receive advanced search and rescue training and improving
its own facilities and equipment.</P>
      <P>In response, Lee said he will ask relevant government authorities
to help the team resolve its financial problems.</P>

      <P>The quality of life on the outpost island of
Kinmen has improved substantially over the past decade since it
opened for tourism, the Kinmen County government reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>The government made the report based on its analysis of various
indexes, showing that opening to tourism has helped the prosperity of
the island opposite mainland China's coastal city of Xiamen.</P>
      <P>The report said that Kinmen's population increased to 51,060 in
1998 from 43,294 in 1989, reversing the downward trend of the past.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County's share of the gross national product grew to
NT$13.32 billion in 1998 from NT$4.86 billion in 1989, up 174.14
percent, and averaged NT$260,000 per capita, an increase of 135.34
percent over the past decade.</P>
      <P>The literary rate among people over six years of age was 87.23
percent in 1998, up 4.64 percent from 1989.</P>
      <P>In terms of transportation, car ownership numbered 20.8 cars per

      <P>Water and electricity consumption and usage of household
electrical appliances have also shown substantial increases.</P>
      <P>Regarding medical care, there was only one doctor for every
10,000 people in 1989, but 11 in 1998.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the report also found that social order has
declined, as the number of fires and traffic accidents increased with
the rapid economic growth, a problem that the government said must be

      <P>Losses from housing loans in
earthquake-affected areas totaled NT$40 billion, Vice Finance
Minister Chen Tsung said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although financial institutions had estimated the
losses at NT$110 billion, actual losses would not surpass NT$40
billion after subtracting the value of loans for land purchases from
the estimate.</P>
      <P>Wang Kao-chin, vice president of the Bank of Taiwan (BOT), said
that the BOT had a total of NT$26.9 billion in outstanding loans as
of the end of September, and that the BOT had accumulated NT$15.4
billion in bad loans. The preliminary estimate of BOT housing loan
losses in quake-stricken areas was only around NT$3.8 billion, an
amount not expected to affect the BOT's financial situation in the
period to come.</P>
      <P>Even if the estimated figure does indeed turn out to accurately
reflect the amount that victims can not pay back, it would not have a

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned Taiwan Power Company
(Taipower) on Friday clarified misgivings about its nuclear plants
being located on fault lines.</P>
      <P>Taipower was responding to a report by the latest edition of the
Chinese-language weekly Yazhou Zhoukan, which said that Taiwan's
nuclear plants are all located on fault lines.</P>
      <P>The report said that Taipower's first nuclear plant was built on
the Chinshan fault line in Taipei County, and the second one is
located on the Hsinchuang Fault line in Taipei County. The third
plant is located on the Hengchun fault line in Taiwan's southern
county of Pingtung, and the fourth is on the Chuchi fault line in
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Taipower was asked about the safety of its nuclear plants in the
wake of the Sept. 21 earthquake, which badly damaged the power
transmission system in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taipower Vice President Hsu Chin-tang said that earthquake
monitoring systems were installed in all nuclear plants, and if a
tremor registering more than five on the Richter scale occurs, a
safety feature will be triggered to shut down the plant.</P>
      <P>Hsu also said the Taiwan's choices of nuclear plant sites and the
plants' anti-quake design plans were made according to the nuclear
energy regulations of the Untied States, meaning that within an eight
kilometer radius of a nuclear power plant, there should not be an
active fault line.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage of choosing a site for a nuclear plant, the
company must check the terrain within a 200-kilometer radius from the
proposed site and collect geological data on previous earthquakes so
as to avoid the threat of active fault lines, Hsu added.</P>

said that he would only study Su's proposal that the government and
construction companies undertake the responsibility of returning
houses dangerously damaged in the massive Sept. 21 earthquake to
their original state.</P>
      <P>Su has therefore decided to stage the protest as planned.</P>
      <P>Su said in an afternoon press conference that the night protest
will only be an appeal in a peaceful and rational manner, and
expressed the hope that President Lee Teng-hui will receive the
group's representative and respond substantially to the requests of
the quake-affected residents.</P>
      <P>Regarding Lee's scheduled trip to inspect Taichung quake-stricken
areas again on Saturday, Su said that the president and other
high-ranking officials have already inspected the areas so many
times, and the people have repeatedly expressed their hopes, and he
lamented that the government has not heard the voice of the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOTORCYCLE USERS MAY SOON HAVE TO PAY PARKING FEES: MOTC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Motorcycle owners might soon be required to
pay parking fees in the future according to a white paper released by
the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The Institute of Transportation under the MOTC recently completed
the white paper dealing with problems resulting from too many
motorcycles on the island.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials said that as of August of this year, there were 18
million motorcycles in Taiwan, or just under one for every two
citizens. Although the previously rapid growth in the number of new
motorcycles on the road has slowed in recent years, the number is
still steadily increasing by 3.56 percent each year.</P>
      <P>MOTC officials lamented the fact that the increased use of
compact passenger cars has not replaced the use of motorcycles,
adding that more motorcycles on the road has created such problems as
chaotic traffic and a lack of parking spaces.</P>
      <P>The MOTC has therefore set a three-stage goal in its white paper
to deal with the problems resulting from the huge number of
motorcycles.</P>
      <P>The short-term goals will be to gradually cut the number of
motorcycle parking spaces in arcades and on sidewalks, to convert
some car parking spaces into motorcycle parking spots, to increase
parking space around public transportation sites, to crack down more
on violators of motorcycle parking regulations, and to push for
motorcycle parking fees in certain zones.</P>
      <P>The middle-term goal will be to encourage the public to use the
public transportation network more. The government hopes that public
transportation use will rise to more than 40 percent of people's
total transportation requirements during this stage.</P>
      <P>When the public transportation network can meet more than 50
percent of the public's needs, the government will begin to push for
the long-term goal, MOTC officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that during the last stage, the ministry will
consider increasing the cost of possessing and using motorcycles and
automobiles and will push for the creation of `off-limit' areas for
vehicles during certain times of the day, hoping that the public
transportation system will eventually take the place of private
vehicles.</P>

      <P>The United States has indicated to Beijing

in case of a Chinese attack, Cohen said "We have a `One-China'

    <HEADLINE>US BUSINESS LEADERS ACCUSED OF KOWTOWING TO BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 8 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Republican presidential hopeful Gary
Bauer on Friday called on American businessmen to put US interests
and values ahead of trade with Communist China and stop kowtowing to
Beijing's "thuggish leadership."</P>
      <P>The former Reagan administration official said in a statement
that "Coming as it did in the midst of the worst Communist Chinese
crackdown on human rights since the Tiananmen Square massacre, the
sight of 300 of the world's leading capitalist businessmen kowtowing
to Beijing's thuggish leadership was chilling and deeply troubling."</P>
      <P>Even as Beijing put its aggressive new militancy on display in a
missile-rattling parade of weaponry to mark the 50th anniversary of
Communist dictatorship, scores of American CEOs attended the Fortune
Global Forum in Shanghai. "Here again we witnessed the spectacle of
US businessmen putting profits ahead of the principles of freedom and
democracy," said Bauer.</P>
      <P>As an example, The Republican conservative leader pointed out
that Maurice Greenberg, chairman of the insurance giant American
International Group, "obediently toed the Communist line by
denouncing the notion that China needs more democracy."</P>
      <P>Especially troubling, Bauer noted, was the presence in Beijing of
top executives from media conglomerates, such as media giant Time
Warner's Gerald Levin, who calls Communist dictator Jiang Zemin "my
good friend," and Viacom's Sumner Restone, who suggested at a press
conference in Beijing that American journalists should avoid being
"unnecessarily offensive" in covering news in other countries.</P>
      <P>Mr. Redstone even told the beaming Communist Chinese dictators
that "We do not view it as our role to tell the government of China
how to run China. We want to do business. We cannot succeed without
being a friend of the Chinese people and the Chinese government."</P>
      <P>But Bauer stressed that "I believe that the best demonstration of
our friendship for the Chinese people is pressing the Chinese
government to respect basic human rights and stop oppressing its
citizens."</P>
      <P>"Will American news organizations be pressured to pull their
punches on reporting China's human rights abuses in order to serve
the commercial interests of their parent companies? This prospect is
both real and disturbing," said Bauer.</P>
      <P>"Are American businessmen so beguiled by profits that they are
willing to abandon their country's most cherished ideals of freedom,
democracy and human rights? If true, that is a sad commentary on our
times. These gentlemen seem to have forgotten that they are Americans
first and businessmen second," added the presidential hopeful. (By

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTOR OFFICE ISSUES ARREST WARRANT FOR CONSTRUCTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Prosecutor's Office in Taichung has
issued an arrest warrant for the constructor of a building complex
which collapsed in central Taiwan during the massive earthquake last
month.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Hsu Wan-hsiang said he issued the warrant after Chang
Ming-chen, owner of the construction company that built the "golden
Paris" community complex in Tali, Taichung, refused to answer
questions about alleged violations of building codes.</P>
      <P>Several high-rise buildings in the complex either cracked,
tilted, or collapsed, resulting in 79 deaths during the magnitude 7.3
earthquake that hit central Taiwan Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Chang and his family emigrated to Canada prior to the killer
quake and a task force to trace down wanted criminals is now
coordinating efforts with judicial authorities in Canada to help
revoke Chang's resident permit and repatriate him to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taichung Prosecutor's Office has also asked the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs in Taiwan to revoke Chang's ROC passport.</P>
      <P>Chang has faxed a message to the Taichung Prosecutor's Office
through his friends in Taiwan on Friday, saying that although he
would take moral responsibility for the victims of the quake, the
collapse of the building should be blamed on incomplete construction
codes. He also said that he would not return to face questions, local
reports said.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed that it was never expected that an earthquake as
strong as the one on Sept. 21 could hit Taichung, and that the
complex had been built to withstand a magnitude 5 earthquake, as
specified in the construction codes. Therefore, he says he should not
take the blame.</P>
      <P>In the wake of last month's killer jolt, the Prosecutors' Offices
in Panchiao, Taipei County, Taichung and Changhua have begun to probe
cases concerning deaths and casualties caused by buildings that
collapsed or were badly damaged in the quake.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the Prosecutors' Offices have already frozen
the properties of 53 building contractors, construction companies and
architects since the Sept. 21 quake. Presently, 19 people are under
arrest, 20 have been released on bail and a total of 52 people are
barred from leaving Taiwan due to faulty construction cases related
to the earthquake.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FRUIT BAZAAR HELD FOR QUAKE-AFFECTED FARMERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  9  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A fruit bazaar was held in Taipei on
Saturday for the benefit of farmers in mountainous central Taiwan
which was rattled by a devastating earthquake on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>The bazaar was organized by the Cabinet-level Council of
Agriculture (COA) to help sell fruits and vegetables from
quake-stricken Miaoli, Taichung, and Nantou counties, which produce
many cash crops, including pears, persimmons and pomelos.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Peng Tso-kwei said the fruit harvest in central
Taiwan is bountiful this year. However, the 921 earthquake disrupted
traffic networks in the region, hindering fruit harvesting and
affecting market demand.</P>
      <P>Many fruit and vegetable growers in disaster zones were saddened
to see their cash crops rotting on their battered farms. Peng said
the bazaar was aimed at helping farmers get over their current
difficulties and encouraging them to redouble efforts to rebuild
their shattered businesses and lives.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew, accompanied by Peng, arrived at the square
in front of the COA office at 9 a.m. to kick off the charity sale,
dubbed the "Thank You for Your Love" bazaar.</P>
      <P>Siew said Taichung and Nantou counties bore the brunt of the 921
earthquake. Noting that many residents there saw their homes and
businesses shattered in the tremor, Siew said he hopes people
residing in other parts of the island will pool resources to help
quake-affected compatriots rebuild their homes and lives.</P>
      <P>Led by Siew and Peng, many COA officials joined the promotional
drive to sell agricultural products from disaster zones. Their
efforts won a warm response from the spectators.</P>
      <P>A case of pears from Taichung County's Hoping village, with a
normal market value of NT$1,000 (US$31.45), managed to fetch
NT$15,000 and a case of guavas from Nantou County's Chichi township,
located at the epicenter of the killer earthquake, sold for NT$5,000,
33 times its normal market price.</P>
      <P>Also on sale were star fruit, dried longans, processed plums,
sweet persimmons, pomelos, vegetables, flowers and other agricultural
products.</P>
      <P>At noon, Vice President Lien Chan arrived at the site, fueling
another high point in the bazaar. In addition to purchasing a large
quantity of fruits himself, Lien helped auction off many cases of
high-quality pears, with each fetching NT$40,000 to NT$50,000. Three
specially designed floral postcards with Lien's signature managed to
fetch NT$160,000 in total.</P>
      <P>COA officials said the bazaar is expected to attract many other
buyers before it ends on Monday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Stock transaction tax revenues totaled only
NT$7 billion (US$220.12 million) in September, a sharp decrease from
NT$8.3 billion in the previous month, the Ministry of Finance said on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>MOF officials attributed the marked decrease to the massive
earthquake on Sep. 21 and also to the Moon Festival which fell on
Sept. 24 this year. As a result, the Taiwan stock exchange was closed
from Sept. 21 until Sept. 27.</P>
      <P>With the reduced number of trading days after the killer jolt and
the resulting power rationing, production and trading activities were
seriously affected, they said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the extensive damage caused by the quake
means housing tax revenue will be severely affected.</P>
      <P>The large-scale power shortage and rationing in the wake of the
earthquake also means that manufacturers have suffered heavy losses
and business tax revenues will also decrease.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the MOF is scheduled to unveil its
statistics on national tax revenue on Monday. But they mentioned
that the real effect of the killer quake on tax revenue may really
only emerge in October or November</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is the full text of President
Lee Teng-hui's Double Ten National Day message.
Ladies and Gentlemen:</P>
      <P>Today is the 88th National Day of the Republic of China. Each
year, we greet this day with boundless joy. Today, however, we must
solemnly and seriously review our nation's founding principles and
forge a consensus of unity to overcome sorrow and pain and to create
a bright future for us all.</P>
      <P>In the early hours of September 21, a major earthquake with a
magnitude of 7.3 hit the Taiwan area, causing severe casualties and
immense losses. The earthquake not only shocked the international
community, but also left us in lasting sorrow.</P>
      <P>During the past 20 days, I went deep into the devastated areas,
to determine the full scope of the disaster and the progress of the
relief work. Seeing the destruction of our homeland and our suffering
fellow countrymen, I am grief-stricken; however, I am even more
determined to work together with the entire populace to rebuild our
homeland.</P>
      <P>In fact, since the September 21 earthquake occurred, the
government, the private sector, and all the citizens have shown their
best capabilities and devoted their utmost efforts to the relief and
rescue work. Showing deep compassion for their compatriots and
brothers, they have made it possible for the disaster victims to
receive timely care and feel warmth. The collective efforts, the
courage, and the faith in surmounting difficulties together will
provide the greatest momentum for us to begin the reconstruction of
our beautiful homeland.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the earthquake, we are especially heartened
and comforted by the concern and assistance we received from the
international community, as well as the generous donations from our
overseas compatriots. A total of 38 rescue teams, with over 700
members, from the United Nations and 20 countries in Asia, Europe,
and America, arrived in Taiwan to participate in our rescue mission.
On behalf of the government and people of the Republic of China, I
would like to express my most sincere appreciation to the world
community for its concern and support. Let me also reiterate here
that the Republic of China will strive even more vigorously to
fulfill its international responsibilities and make substantive
contributions to the development of the global community.</P>
      <P>Ladies and gentlemen: Tempering through adversity creates an
opportunity for rebirth. Although the earthquake has left scars on
this land that cannot be healed, we are confident and determined that
we shall accomplish our reconstruction projects within the shortest
possible time under the concerted efforts of every one of us. Giving
consideration to both the characteristics of each area and the needs
of the people, we shall implement a renovation that will bring
harmony to our homeland, so our people can enjoy a safe, new life. We
will also advance more steadily and firmly to expand new
opportunities for national development as we enter the next
millennium.</P>
      <P>In domestic affairs, we will continue to promote reengineering
of the government, along with judicial and educational reforms, to
realize the ideals of democracy, increase government effectiveness,
and encourage the vitality of the private sector. We will thereby
enhance the overall strength of our nation and lay a favorable
foundation for our national development, to meet the intense
international competition of the future.

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL DAY MESSAGE (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 9 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In economics, we will focus on liberalization,
internationalization, and pluralization, actively removing barriers
to investment, accelerating the modernization of industry, and
strengthening the economic structure, in order to maintain economic
stability and growth. Concurrently, we will utilize our advantages of
the present to build Taiwan into a technology island and thereby,
launch a new era for Taiwan's future economic development.</P>
      <P>In the area of social development, we must improve our social
welfare system to protect the minority and disadvantaged groups, in
order to implement social justice and establish a humanitarian and
caring modern society. We must effectively carry out the rule of law,
take strict precautions against natural calamities, and strengthen
law and order to protect the lives and properties of the people.</P>
      <P>On national security, we must consolidate our defense and the
strategy of effective deterrence. We must continue to streamline the
military and regenerate a modern military force. Meanwhile, we must
also actively participate in Asia-Pacific regional security
mechanisms to jointly promote world peace, cooperation, and
prosperity.</P>
      <P>In cross-strait relations, we acknowledge that the nation has
not yet been unified, and the two sides of the Taiwan Strait still
maintain different views on the definition of "one China." However,
we deem that the relationship between the two sides to be a special
state-to-state relationship, which is a historical and legal fact.
Both sides should squarely face this reality. They should use it as a
foundation to promote constructive dialogue. Through parity, divided
rule, and peaceful competition, the two sides should seek peaceful
unification in the future. On Taiwan, the Republic of China has
created a dominion of democracy unprecedented in Chinese history, a
model for the Chinese mainland on its way toward modernization. We
hope that the Chinese mainland authorities will soon implement
democratic reforms, which will create conditions conducive to the
gradual unification of the two sides.</P>
      <P>Ladies and gentlemen: The Republic of China has weathered many
difficulties and challenges since its establishment. It was only
through the perseverance and unceasing efforts of all ROC citizens
that we could surmount these adversities and bring our nation into a
new era. Particularly, in the past five decades, the unity of purpose
and effort of the government and the people has made Taiwan an island
of freedom, democracy and prosperity.</P>
      <P>Today, we face tremendous destruction of property and loss of
life from this devastating earthquake. But, we believe that hardship
will bring us closer together and adversity will regenerate our
strength. Only if we have an iron will and cooperate fully can all
the pain and sorrow be transformed into that new strength, and the
unity of purpose become a force for rebirth. At the threshold of the
new century, let us take that brave step forward to rebuild our
beautiful homeland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RECONSTRUCTION EFFORTS NOT TO AFFECT DIPLOMATIC WORK: HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu said on
Sunday that the ministry will not allow reconstruction efforts to
affect diplomatic work.</P>
      <P>Hu was responding to questions on whether the diplomacy budget
will be reduced after cancellation of large-scale festivities that
included invitations to foreign dignitaries for the 88th anniversary
of the founding of the Republic of China, a measure taken in order to
redirect funds to post-quake reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the ministry has not yet felt any effect on the
budget for foreign aid, but that in the next fiscal year, the
ministry will review which expenses can be cut and channeled into
reconstruction efforts in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>He said the ministry will reduce whatever spending necessary as
long as diplomatic work is not affected and the nation can maintain
its stature and friendly relations with allies.</P>
      <P>On whether the US$300 million in aid to Kosovo promised by
President Lee Teng-hui earlier will be cut, Hu said that the aid
program had been planned to span a period of up to seven years,
averaging US$40 million a year.</P>
      <P>Hu said the ministry had earlier stated that the aid in the first
year would not exceed US$20 million. So far, it is estimated that
only US$6.5 million is required in the first year, an amount well
below the original estimate.</P>
      <P>As for aid during the second year, Hu said that deliberations
over government spending will be made, and added that the most urgent
task now is relief and reconstruction work in the wake of the
devastating Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the ministry will be pragmatic in making a balanced
consideration of diplomatic efforts and domestic reconstruction
needs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMY GETS HIGHEST MARKS FOR RESCUE, RELIEF EFFORTS: POLL</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 10 (CNA The army won the loudest applause for its
role in rescue and relief operations after the devastating earthquake
last month, according to a poll released on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by Academia Sinica, the highest research
institute in Taiwan, took into account physical and psychological
damages, rescue and relief efforts, and reconstruction projects in
the wake of the Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that in quake-stricken areas, people who were
polled gave the army the highest marks of 76.1 percent for its
contribution to rescue and relief efforts.</P>
      <P>The army was followed by the Buddhist group Tzuchi and Christian
groups (71.7 percent), private rescue teams (70.3 percent), foreign
rescue teams (62.1 percent), and firefighters and their co-workers
(54.5 percent).</P>
      <P>Only 33 percent of respondents said the central government has
been helpful in rescue and relief operations, with the local
governments being deemed helpful by just 32.2 percent of
those polled.</P>
      <P>The result of the survey was a far cry from the view held by the
government, which had earlier given its rescue and relief performance
a much better assessment.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that people are still suffering from
"post-quake" trauma after the earthquake, which registered a
magnitude of 7.3 on the Richter scale.</P>
      <P>Nearly three out of four people polled said they could not get
rid of the rocking feeling and were prone to nervousness.</P>
      <P>Of those surveyed, 54.1 percent said they were worried about the
safety of family or friends, and 44.6 percent said they had become
more aware of the vicissitudes of their lives.</P>
      <P>One third of respondents also said they planned to change their
previous way of living and try to bring more meaning to their lives.</P>
      <P>Researchers said the figures showed the importance of
psychological rehabilitation and the changes in values after the
killer jolt.</P>
      <P>Of those polled, 66.2 percent said they believe casualties and
damages from natural disasters like earthquakes could be prevented;
88.5 percent said they believe their living environment is safe.</P>
      <P>Three of every four respondents said they had not taken the right
measures to avoid calamities; only 23 percent said they woke up
family members immediately and ran outdoors.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 82.6 percent of those surveyed have
donated money to quake-stricken areas and 55.5 percent planned to
donate money for reconstruction.</P>
      <P>The researchers said this revealed that the government has
backing and financial support from the public and should make good
use of it.</P>
      <P>They also said that after the quake, the mobilization of citizens
by private groups and the efficiency displayed by such groups became
a major force in the rescue and relief effort. Their speedy
mobilization was in contrast to that of the government.</P>
      <P>The survey was based on telephone calls made between Oct. 4 and
Oct. 8 to 1,110 people over the age of 20.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CETRA POSTS MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY'S POST-QUAKE SITUATION ON WEBSITE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's China External Trade Development
Council (CETRA) proclaimed on its website Sunday that Taiwan's
manufacturing industry has recovered from the Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>The council further stated that industry operations have resumed
with hopes of restoring foreign buyers' confidence in Taiwan's
manufacturing ability before any decisions are made to shift orders
to other countries.</P>
      <P>The CETRA website contained a link to a report on the complete
resumption of manufacturing industry production line activity after
last month's devastating temblor. Posted information included a
statement that all trade fairs will take place as scheduled.</P>
      <P>At the related website, CETRA offered space for local
manufacturers to report on their reconstruction work in an effort to
help international buyers have a better idea of the actual post-quake
situation. It is hoped that such information will help protect
Taiwan's manufacturing industry from being hurt by rumors that
exaggerate losses caused by the quake.</P>
      <P>The council stressed that the temblor occurred in central
Taiwan's mountainous area, where no manufacturing centers have ever
been located. Economic losses stemming from the quake were estimated
at US$10 billion, accounting for less than 0.1 percent of Taiwan's
annual GDP.</P>
      <P>One hundred percent of production lines resumed operation in less
than 20 days after the earthquake, CETRA said, a speed that the
council believed amazed the world.

thanks from the government and people of the Republic of China for
their patriotic deeds and generous donations after the Sept. 21
earthquake.</P>
      <P>Overseas Chinese community leaders returned to Taipei to mark the

Republic of China for the generous overseas Chinese donations, which
had accumulated to NT$860 million as of last Friday.</P>

forces of support for the reconstruction work of the quake-stricken
areas," Siew said.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that although the quake brought grief and pain to

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS URGE PSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION IN QUAKE-STRICKEN AREAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars on Sunday urged the nation to pay
equal attention to physical and psychological recovery in the wake of
last month's massive earthquake.</P>
      <P>The scholars made the appeal during a seminar on psychological
rehabilitation in the post-quake period. The seminar was sponsored by
the non-profit Chinese Learned Society.</P>
      <P>The Sept. 21 quake, recorded at magnitude 7.3 on the Richter
scale, has to date claimed the lives of more than 2,300 and led to
extensive losses and damages in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The presenters at the seminar noted that the government has now
shifted its focus from relief to reconstruction, but they stressed
that psychological recovery should receive the same attention.</P>
      <P>Lan Shan-yin, a professor at National Chengchi University, said
that physical damages could be repaired in two or three years, but
many people in quake-stricken areas, faced with the sudden loss of
family members, could develop a sense of fear and hopelessness.</P>
      <P>Lan urged the government to form a systematic counseling network
of experts to help those quake-affected people emerge from the shadow
of mistrust and a sense of helplessness, and move forward into the
future.</P>
      <P>The government should also pay attention to the employment
situation of those affected by the quake, said both Lan and Lin
Hsien-chung, another professor at the same university.</P>
      <P>Lan said that temporary job assignments will only provide
short-term relief, and the government's main consideration should be
helping people reestablish regular employment.</P>
      <P>Professor Lin said that the government should be more active in
providing job opportunities for affected people to keep them from
becoming pessimistic and helpless.</P>
      <P>Professor Cheng Shih-yen, who has provided psychological
counseling in quake-stricken areas, said that natural disasters force
changes in society, influencing the behavior of affected people.</P>
      <P>After experiencing a crisis, people require a stronger sense of
security, Cheng said, citing the following example: Even if survivors
understand that four bottles of mineral water is sufficient for one
day's use, they may request double that amount in order to feel
psychologically safe.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that some have criticized quake survivors as being
greedy, but their mentality requires a deeper understanding.</P>
      <P>Cheng also suggested that the government pay attention to the
education of children in quake-stricken areas and provide them with
psychological counseling, as many of them lost family members in the
earthquake.</P>
      <P>Cheng also advised people to stay active during the post-quake
period to help ward off depression.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUAKE SURVIVORS LONGING FOR PRAGMATIC HELP AND ESCAPE FROM SORROW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 10 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With tears in their eyes, survivors of the
"921 Earthquake" silently watched and saluted as the national flag
was raised over the Presidential Office Sunday morning.</P>
      <P>Sadness dominated the flag-raising ceremony, which was very
different from that held last year on Oct. 10, the "Double Ten"
National Day of the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Neither colorful decorations nor joyful crowds were present
outside the Presidential Office on the tenth day of the tenth month,
when Taiwan's people were supposed to be enthralled in a series of
celebrations of the ROC's 88th birthday, starting with the
flag-raising ceremony.</P>
      <P>"While watching the flag, I made a wish that I could bid farewell
forever to the sorrow that has lived in me since the earthquake took
away everything I had," said one of the survivors.</P>
      <P>The magnitude-7.3 temblor jolted Taiwan on Sept. 21, leaving more
than 2,200 people dead, over 8,700 injured, and thousands of
residential buildings collapsed. Central Taiwan's Nantou and Taichung
counties sustained the severest damage and losses due to their
proximity to the epicenter of the devastating earthquake.</P>
      <P>More than 100 quake survivors participated in the morning
ceremony. They were members of the 921 Earthquake Victims Alliance,
who, along with hundreds of others from quake-stricken areas, had
camped since Saturday night at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall.</P>
      <P>The group had attempted to stage a peaceful overnight
demonstration by camping on Kaitakelan Blvd. in front of the
Presidential Office on Saturday, with the hope of calling more
serious government attention to their grave suffering from earthquake
damage. The plan, however, was called off after a six-hour stand-off
between representatives of the alliance and police, who treated the
demonstration as illegal.</P>
      <P>After the Sunday morning ceremony, some alliance members
proceeded to Academia Sinica, hoping to meet President Lee Yuan-tseh
of the insititue to demand "real" assistance in rebuilding their
homes.</P>
      <P>Lee recently convened a national private group to monitor
government use of a large amount of money donated for post-quake
reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>Claiming that they have not received one dime of the government's
promised financial aid for housing, the quake survivors tried to
submit a statement to the prominent academic leader. Their statement
consisted of an appeal that the government unconditionally help
rebuild their homes and compensate them for living in temporary
housing.</P>
      <P>However, the group failed to meet with Lee, but was received by
Lee's special assistant Hsie Hsing-kuo, who accepted the statement on
the president's behalf from Su Jen-long, leader of the 921 Earthquake
Victims Alliance. Hsie promised that Lee will personally communicate
with the quake survivors after hearing their voice.</P>

      <P>The MOF restricted the maximum daily decline for listed stocks to
3.5 percent on Sept. 27, six days after the "921 Earthquake" that
severely battered the central part of the island.</P>
      <P>The MOF took the measure in a bid to prevent the local stock
market from suffering heavy losses after the disastrous temblor
damaged central Taiwan's electricity distribution system, forcing the

      <P>The MOF made the decision because Taipower announced on Sunday

    <HEADLINE>QUAKE RECONSTRUCTION TO BE FINISHED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE: PRES. LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui stressed in his
National Day message that the train of suffering was at the point of
turning.</P>
      <P>President Lee said that although the island's biggest earthquake
jolted Taiwan on Sept. 21 and left the nation with a scar incapable
of healing, "through the concerted efforts of the government and the
people, we have confidence and determination and will accomplish the
reconstruction work of the quake-stricken areas as soon as possible."</P>
      <P>The Chinese head of state said that the reconstruction work will
be accomplished by paying attention to the character of each
individual piece of land and to individual demands so as to rebuild
the affected areas into a harmonious landscape and let the people
enjoy a new life.</P>
      <P>At the same time, "we should build the country with more firm
steps and develop our country to meet the needs of the coming
century," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee presided over a central government ceremony marking the 1999
Double Ten National Day at the Presidential Palace on Sunday morning.
More than 300 government and civic leaders, including Vice President
Lien Chan, as well as overseas Chinese representatives took part in
the ceremony.</P>
      <P>The president said that Sunday was the 88th National Day of the
Republic of China. "We always celebrated our nation's birthday with a
joyful mood every year. However, we marked this year's national day
with sorrow and grief."</P>
      <P>Lee called on the people to stand united by reconsidering the
founding spirit of the nation and overcoming sorrow and grief to
build a new nation to be able to meet the needs of the next century.</P>
      <P>The president went on to say that after the earthquake, the
government, civic organizations and the people had concentrated their
efforts to implement relief and rescue work. The determination and
courage to surpass hardships were the biggest factor in rebuilding
quake-affected areas into a beautiful homeland.</P>
      <P>Lee, on behalf of the government and the people of the Republic
of China, also expressed heartfelt gratitude to more than 38 rescue
teams from 20 countries around the world, religious organizations,
and the United Nations for rushing to Taiwan to help with relief work
after the earthquake jolted the island on Sept. 21, claiming more
than 2,200 lives.</P>
      <P>"The Republic of China will positively carry out its
international obligations by making more contributions to the
development of the international community in the future," Lee
stressed.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that the Republic of China has met
various challenges and difficulties since it was established in 1912.
Under the concerted efforts of the government and the people, "we
have broken through hardship and built a new era."</P>
      <P>"We have built our nation into a democratic, free and prosperous
nation over the past five decades," Lee said, adding that "though the
biggest earthquake in history brought grave losses of life and
property, we believe the suffering will make us closer and more
united as well as bringing us power."</P>
      <P>"We should transform our sorrow and grief into strength and stand
united to rebuild the nation into a nation able to stand whatever
disasters come in the next century, " Lee added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen is facing its largest disaster in
the past two decades, after typhoon Dan left the front-line island
with a total power blackout and severed water supply.</P>
      <P>On Sunday both the Kinmen military defense headquarters and the
county government were fully mobilized to repair damages, a military
officer said, noting that all regular military exercises had been
suspended and personnel had been assigned to relief work.</P>
      <P>At least 200 millimeters of rain fell in Kinmen, as Dan blew away
trees along streets islandwide, tore signboards from stores, and
damaged the telecommunications system and more than 20 critical power
transmission lines around the isle.</P>
      <P>Fallen trees and floodwaters blocked transportation on main
roadways, and the local airport was forced to shut down due to poor
visibility for take-off and landing. The terminal was expected to
reopen Sunday afternoon.</P>
      <P>No casualties were reported on the island. However, a report from
another of Taiwan's offshore islands, Penghu, indicated that Dan
claimed one fisherman who drowned when his boat capsized.</P>
      <P>Three others aboard the fishing vessel were rescued, according to
the report, which said that the typhoon cut off the power supply to
more than 5,000 Penghu households.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Dan claimed nine lives and left more than 400 injured in
Fujian, mainland China, which took a direct hit from the storm.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  10  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Internal documents of Taipei's Overseas
Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC) indicated that mainland China will
continue to contain and isolate Taiwan in the international
community.</P>
      <P>According to the documents, Beijing's current Taiwan policy was
worked out in the second half of last year.</P>
      <P>Under that policy, Beijing would take a "soft" posture on some
cross-Taiwan Strait matters, while intensifying containment of Taiwan
in international affairs.</P>
      <P>Owing to the "soft" posture, the documents said, Chairman Koo
Chen-fu of Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation was invited to visit
Shanghai and Beijing last fall.</P>
      <P>But at the same time, Beijing stepped up its efforts to isolate
Taiwan, and that was why the Kingdom of Tonga switched its
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing.</P>
      <P>The OCAC said that mainland China will continue to create a
false image in the international community that the Taiwan issue is
China's internal affairs with an aim to prevent intervention by
foreign countries.</P>
      <P>The documents noted that Beijing is expected to continue
promoting the so-called "reconciliation diplomacy" and "big-country
diplomacy," to set up "strategic partnership" with major countries.</P>
      <P>They indicated that mainland China's intention is to try to deny
the fact that Taiwan and the mainland are equal political entities,
so as to place the Taiwan issue under the Beijing-fixed frame and to
force Taiwan to engage in "political negotiation" with Beijing. (By

China will break the US$10 billio mark again in this year and
the nation's international balance of payments will also set

on Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to CBC statistics, the current account surplus
 amounted to US$7.5 billion in the year's first three quarters,
more than doubling that of the whole year of 1998. This indicated
that the nation's economic situation was recovering from the
recession.</P>
      <P>The nation's balance of payments netted US$10,347 million
surplus in the first half year. The nation was expected to post a
record surplus of the balance of payments this year surpassing
the US$28,093 million registered in 1988.</P>
      <P>The same CBC statistics show that the balance of payment had

Sept. 21 devastating Chichi earthquake, returned to Singapore on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The squad flew to Taipei on the night of Sept. 21 with 14 metric

their arrival.</P>
      <P>It was among the first foreign rescue teams to arrive in Taiwan,
and was the last to leave.</P>
      <P>The Singaporeans focused their operations at the collapsed
Yungchao Building and Golden Paris Building located in Fengyuan City

dig out scores of bodies.</P>
      <P>Their well-trained rescue operations were highly appraised by
Taichung County's Fire-Fighting Bureau, the Interior Ministry's
Fire-Fighting Agency, and related civil rescue groups.</P>
      <P>A total of 38 foreign rescue teams, with over 700 members, had

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS GROUP SENDS OPEN LETTER TO BEIJING, TAIPEI, HK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Oct. 10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hong Kong and Kowloon Trades Union
Council Sunday issued an open letter to the government leaders in
Beijing, Taipei, and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The council said in the letter that Beijing leaders should
recognize that Taiwan and mainland China are being ruled by two
separate political entities, because Taiwan is in fact ruled by the
government of the Republic of China, which was founded in 1912; while
the mainland is ruled by the government of People's Republic of
China, which was established in 1949.</P>
      <P>The letter, issued on the "Double Tenth" National Day of
the Republic of China, said that since most Taiwan people detest the
"one Country, two systems" formula proposed by Beijing, other
unification formulas should be studied in order to facilitate the
development of the Chinese nation.</P>
      <P>The council also said that mainland China should not threaten
Taiwan with military force. The biggest obstacle to their unification
lies in the difference in their systems and ways of life, which can
not be resolved by military force, it pointed out.</P>
      <P>The council expressed the hope that Taiwan will continue to
implement its "Guidelines for National Unification" after the
Presidential election is held in March, and that Taiwan's major
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will give up its
pro-independence party platform.</P>
      <P>The council also urged the government of Hong Kong to set up a
"representative office" in Taipei and maintain friendly relations
with Taiwan. The government should allow the people to fly the
national flag of the Republic of China in public places on the
"Double Tenth" national day as they did before Hong Kong's handover
to Beijing on July 1, 1997, it added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee Kwok Leung, president of the council, said he was
appalled that Hong Kong police removed a national flag of the
Republic of China from a public place Sunday morning. Some Hong Kong
people have a passion for the flag of nationalist China, he said.</P>

      <P>Roughly 7,285 hectares of land, or 0.26
percent of Taiwan's territory, was affected by the killer quake of
Sept. 21 which left 2,200 people dead and 8,700 injured, sources from

mountainous region of central Taiwan, peaks were toppled, rivers were
blocked by shifting land and roads and playgrounds were raised into
hills or terraced fields.</P>
      <P>Topping the geological facelift list was the Chiuchiufeng (99
Peaks) mountain range in Nantou County, where 5,900 hectares of land
crumbled. In Yunlin County, the Chingshuichi (Clear Water Brook) was
blocked by slided land triggered by mountain runs, making it a
land-locked lake.</P>
      <P>In addition to the lost lands, 1,807 other locations in Taichung,

that those countries or customs territories that have entered the

entry and have become quasi-members of the WTO.</P>
      <P>Trilateral talks among mainland China, the United States and the
European Union (EU) on mainland China's WTO entry have dragged on for
14 years without any significant breakthroughs mainly because Beijing
cannot propose a plan on tariff concessions and the opening of its

    <TEXT>
      <P>In the midst of the heated debate
over Mainland China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
US Republican Congressman Tom Campbell expressed strong opposition to
China's admittance, saying that it would have a negative impact on
America's industry and global competitiveness, and would ultimately
hurt the American consumer.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Campbell highly recommended Taiwan's membership in
WTO, citing Taiwan's free-market economy and transparent economic
institutions.</P>
      <P>In his commentary published in the San Jose Mercury on Sunday,
Campbell said the question of allowing mainland China and Taiwan into
the WTO should be decided on economic merits.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the example of WTO member Hong Kong, which is now
part of China, Campbell said that customs regions, not necessarily
countries, are admitted into WTO. So it is "entirely appropriate"
that Taiwan be admitted based on economic merits, without thereby
reaching any conclusion that Taiwan is a separate nation.</P>
      <P>Campbell stressed that his observation that China's economy still
does not qualify for the WTO is a "dispassionate judgment," made
without regard to any animosity toward communism or to human rights
conditions in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 108 builders and architects have
been arrested or are under investigation on charges of murder or
endangering public safety since the devastating magnitude 7.3
earthquake struck Taiwan on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Islandwide, 12 people in the construction and real estate
business were arrested, 40 were released on bail and 56 others were
restricted from leaving the country in the wake of the deadly quake,
which wreaked havoc on central Taiwan and caused immeasurable damage
to property, including buildings and houses.</P>
      <P>Personal or company assets of 69 individuals or firms among the
accused were declared temporarily frozen by law enforcement
officials, sources within the Ministry of Justice reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Following the quake and its powerful aftershocks, investigators
in Yunlin County discovered that three crumbled buildings had been
built by a construction company that had used empty plastic and tin
oil containers as filler to save on concrete and bricks.</P>
      <P>In the hardest hit townships in central Taiwan, as well as in
Taipei City and Taipei County in the north, where the Sept. 21 quake
registered at magnitude 4, poor construction caused relatively new
buildings to tip over despite the strict anti-seismic provisions that
were added to the national building code in 1972.</P>
      <P>An 11-story building in Tahli that was uprooted and fell backward
and a 12-story apartment building in Fengyuan that peeled off from an
adjoining tower and landed on its side were among the damage alleged
to have occurred because of poor construction.</P>
      <P>"If you have 51 fault lines running across your country, you need
to be more careful about building," said Hideo Ishikawa, a civil
engineer from Osaka who came to Taiwan to pitch in with assistance
after the quake.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVERSEAS CHINESE MARK ROC'S NATIONAL DAY TO SHOW PATRIOTISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  10  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese communities in the United
States marked the Republic of China's Double Ten National Day on
Sunday with a solemn mood as Taiwan is still struggling to overcome
last month's devastating earthquake.</P>
      <P>While festivities were canceled or toned down, Chinese residents
in major US cities held sunrise flag-raising ceremonies, bazaars
and fund-raising lunches or dinners to celebrate the ROC's 88th
National Day.</P>
      <P>In Washington, D.C., all overseas Chinese associations in the US
capital held a joint evening party to mark the Double Ten National
Day and raise funds for post-earthquake relief and reconstruction
projects in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, ROC Representative to the United States
Stephen Chen said donations for helping Taiwan's quake-affected
people had exceeded US$850,000 as of Oct. 9 in the great Washington
area alone.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said, the Washington-based World Vision has
raised an additional US$1 million in relief funds. On behalf of the
ROC government and people, Chen expressed gratitude and respect for
generous donations from overseas Chinese and American friends.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC government has worked out a detailed
blueprint for rebuilding damaged infrastructure and helping
quake-affected people rebuild their shattered lives and homes, Chen
said Taiwan will overcome sorrow and pain and will create an even
brighter future.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Chairman Richard Bush also
attended the evening party. Bush said Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the ROC's
national founding father, established Asia's first republic 88 years
ago. At that time, Bush said, the world expected to see democracy
take roots in China. "Today, democratic rule at least has been
realized in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Recalling that overseas Chinese gave enormous support for Dr.
Sun's drive to overthrow the corrupt Ching dynasty, Bush said he
believes that overseas Chinese will again pool their wisdom and
resources to help the ROC on Taiwan weather hardships and
difficulties caused by the recent calamity.</P>
      <P>In the San Francisco and Bay areas, sunrise flag-raising
ceremonies were held in Chinatown and on the square in front of the
Santa Clara City Hall, attracting the participation of more than
1,000 people.</P>
      <P>Victor C. Y. Tseng, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in San Francisco, who attended both events, said the
flag-raising ceremonies symbolize overseas Chinese people's
unswerving support for the ROC and their concern for Taiwan's
earthquake victims.</P>
      <P>Some 30 other traditional National Day celebration activities in
the Bay area, including a float parade and a cocktail reception, were
all called off in deference to Taiwan's quake victims.</P>
      <P>Ethnic Chinese residents in the Bay area has so far donated
a total of US$7.39 million for post-quake relief and reconstruction
programs in hardest-stricken central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In New York, more than 2,000 Chinese residents turned out for a
colorful parade in Chinatown to mark the ROC's National Day. Chinese
community leaders said they want to express their loyalty and
support for the ROC with the traditional festive activity.</P>
      <P>"The event was also aimed at inspiring people in Taiwan to
shed the shadow of the 921 killer earthquake as soon as possible and
to rebuild their homeland with confidence and courage," said an
organizer of the parade.</P>
      <P>In the evening, all overseas Chinese associations jointly
sponsored a dinner to raise funds for post-quake reconstruction
projects in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Charles Teng, head of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
New York, attended various National Day celebration activities in
Chinatown to express his admiration and gratitude for overseas
Chinese people's patriotism and support for Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESSES ENLIST FOREIGN COMPANIES' HELP TO CLARIFY QUAKE SITUATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of a business association said
on Monday that the group is contacting foreign enterprises in Taiwan
to explain the island's post-quake situation to the world.</P>
      <P>Chen Fei-lung, chairman of Namchow Chemical, said that since the
massive quake on Sept. 21, which has to date claimed more than 2,300
lives and has resulted in extensive losses, local businesses have
seen a number of orders lost to other countries, and the number of
tourists has declined sharply.</P>
      <P>Chen said the association has taken the initiative to contact
foreign enterprises, hoping those companies will use the Internet to
tell the world that the hardest-hit areas are in the agricultural
counties and cities in central Taiwan, such as Nantou, Taichung and
Changhua, and that the manufacturing and tourism industries have not
been affected.</P>
      <P>Chen and other business leaders toured the hardest-hit areas over
the weekend and decided to give long-term support to those areas.</P>
      <P>Business leaders from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.
(TSMC), Chung Hwa Telecommunications Co., China Steel Corp. and other
enterprises toured the affected areas on Saturday and Sunday to see
if those enterprises could do anything to assist reconstruction
efforts.</P>
      <P>They visited areas where the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake
struck hardest: Chichi, Shueili, Sun Moon Lake and Puli in Nantou
County; and Fengyuan, Shihkang and Tungshih in Taichung County.
Though they did not witness the shocking scenes that immediately
followed the magnitude-7.3 quake, they understood the destructive
power of the killer jolt after observing heavy machinery being used
to demolish badly damaged houses.</P>
      <P>Lin Wen-kuei, president of Feng Hsin Iron &amp; Steel Co. and a
member of the group, said he was shocked to see that a row of houses
had simply "kneeled down," with the first floor slumped to the
ground because of collapsed beams.</P>
      <P>Chen fei-lung said that after viewing the quake-stricken areas,
the group's members have decided to form a permanent association,
adding that all of them will volunteer in reconstruction efforts and
will use their expertise to provide ongoing support.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed the hope that more business leaders will join the
association.</P>
      <P>Kuan Yung-shih, chairman of China Petrochemical Development
Corp., said the members do not believe they have fulfilled their
responsibility simply because they donated money to quake-stricken
areas. He urged more business groups to get organized and provide
much-needed assistance to the quake-stricken areas.</P>
      <P>Central and local government officials have expressed the hope
that business leaders, with extensive resources at their disposal,
would serve as foster-patrons for affected areas, either by providing
employment opportunities for residents or, better still, by setting
up factories there.</P>
      <P>But business leaders countered that this is not the answer to the
problem; they said reconstruction work should not be conducted
rashly, and that it will require overall planning by the government
and professionals.</P>
      <P>Jack Sun, chairman of Taiwan Cellular Corp., echoed the idea,
saying that the government should set up a long-term body to direct
reconstruction and the private sector would rally behind the
government to contribute money and resources.</P>

      <P>Alternative military service has been in the works for some time,
a measure considered by the Ministry of National Defense to alleviate

    <HEADLINE>70% OF VICTIMS NOT CLEAR ON GOV'T RESETTLEMENT PLAN: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 11 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey conducted by TVBS showed about 70
percent of earthquake victims do not clearly understand government
resettlement measures, while nearly half have not yet received any
relief aid subsidies for collapsed houses.</P>
      <P>TVBS, a popular television station in Taiwan, conducted the poll
last Saturday. The survey was answered by 733 people, all from the
island's hardest-hit counties of Nantou and Taichung.</P>
      <P>The questionnaire covered issues concerning: assessment of
building damages and reconstruction, cash received as relief aid,
victims' fears and confidence in future life, government quake-relief
performance and policy, and the upcoming presidential election.</P>
      <P>Although the government has come up with a series of resettlement
measures, only 33 percent of those polled said they were clear about
the government plan, while 52 percent indicated they were not quite
clear, and 14 percent did not even know there were any resettlement
measures offered by the government.</P>
      <P>Regarding provisional housing for temblor victims, three options
were offered by the government: a rent subsidy of NT$3,000 per victim
per month, which may be drawn in a 12-month lump sum; residence in
provisional or prefabricated houses; or residence in public
apartments built by local governments or in military barracks.</P>
      <P>About 56 percent of those polled noted that they would select the
rent subsidy relief measure, 23 percent would like to take up
residence in the provisional or prefabricated houses, and 10 percent
would choose to reside in public apartments or military barracks,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>As for the reconstruction issue, 51 percent hope to have houses
planned and rebuilt by experts, while 38 percent would choose to
rebuild by themselves on the original sites.</P>
      <P>Three weeks after Taiwan's most devastating quake in a century,
which struck the island on Sept. 21, the sorest need of victims now
is cash, said the survey.</P>
      <P>Excluding funds allocated for casualties as condolence money,
which has been paid already, 47 percent of victims whose houses
collapsed or partially collapsed have not yet received relief aid to
rebuild, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>About 70 percent of victims do not want to leave the township or
village where their original residences were located, while 26
percent would choose to leave those places that are full of sorrow
and consternation, the survey also showed.</P>

      <P>Some 7,000 people gathered at a stadium in
Linkou on the outskirts of Taipei on Monday to mourn the victims of a
devastating earthquake that rattled central Taiwan on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>The memorial service, organized by the Ministry of the Interior,
began with an elegy sung by local soprano Chien Wen-hsiu. All
participants then observed a moment of silence to commemorate those
killed.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui laid a wreath before a 12-meter-high
temporary monument, which was situated on a stage with dim blue
lighting, in memory of those who died, and then he bowed three times.</P>
      <P>In a brief speech to the audience, President Lee said that in the
earthquake, many people lost their homes, dearest family members and
friends.</P>
      <P>"The 921 Earthquake caused losses that will be difficult to
recover from, and it left a wound in the hearts of all citizens that
can never be healed," Lee said, adding that his heart is filled with
profound sadness.</P>
      <P>Citing remarks by a noted Buddhist master, Lee said: "The quake
victims are all Buddhas and teachers. They died for the other 22
million residents on the island and they saved our next generations."</P>
      <P>The president ended his speech on a hopeful note, saying: "As
long as there is life, there is hope. I hope that during our
suffering we don't lose confidence, and that when we face obstacles
we become more courageous."</P>
      <P>Lee further said he hopes the prayers and introspection can help
the victims rest in peace and that those who lost their loved ones
can transform their sadness to strength and love for their homeland.</P>
      <P>The president also encouraged all fellow citizens to work
together and join hands to build an even brighter tomorrow for future
generations.</P>
      <P>Following Lee's speech, Vice President Lien Chan took the podium
and read a message commemorating the quake victims.</P>
      <P>Lien said the 921 Earthquake was an unforgettable tragedy, which
claimed 2,321 lives. "In the massive quake, we lost our loved ones.
... Although we can't see you, we feel your presence, your eternal
presence."</P>
      <P>Noting that the nation wants to bid farewell to the quake victims
through the memorial service, Lien said Taiwan will achieve rebirth
through rebuilding. "We'll rebuild our homeland with strength and
love. This is our common promise."</P>
      <P>In the memorial service, many senior government officials,
academics, religious leaders, business executives and
representatives from all walks of life paid tribute to the quake
victims.</P>
      <P>The memorial service helped bring a sense of closure for quake
survivors, an interior ministry official said, adding that it let
those who lost family members and friends know that the nation mourns

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BASKETBALL STAR TO JOIN MAINLAND TEAM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan professional basketball star Chen
Chih-long announced Monday that he will join the Oriental Sharks of
the mainland Chinese professional baseball league in November so he
can play through Taiwan's off-season, which may be extra-long this
year.</P>
      <P>Considering his career as a professional basketball player and
the needs of his family, he has made the decision to play in the
mainland, said the popular player during a press conference in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>He feels deep gratitude to his Taiwanese fans who cheered for him
in numerous games on the island over the past years, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen hosted the press conference in the company of his wife and a
friend, Chiang Feng-nien, who played the role of intermediary in
leading the 30-year-old player to the Oriental Sharks of Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Chen said his contract with the Hungkuo team, one of the six
teams in Taiwan's professional basketball league, expired Aug. 31. As
a basketball player, he will "go where there are games," the
freelancer said.</P>
      <P>He believes that there is ample room in mainland China for him to
practice his "Taiwan skill," the Taiwanese basketball great noted.</P>
      <P>Chen added he is scheduled to fly to Shanghai next Tuesday, where
he will join Oriental Shark players for a practice program and
physical capability testing in Beijing. Not until then, Chen said,
will he sign the contract.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is looking forward playing in the mainland's next
season, which starts Nov. 21 and ends in mid-March, and expects he
will join Taiwan's National Games in December 2000.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan's professional basketball games resume next year, he
will return, but only after completing his mainland contract, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>Asked whether or not he will rejoin the Hungkuo, the sports star
said he was still uncertain about that, but reaffirmed he will always
return to Taiwan if there are games here for him to play.</P>
      <P>Chen's wife, Lu Chu-ying, stressed that Chen's future job in the
mainland is nothing but part-time, and she, along with their two
sons, will remain in Taiwan while her husband works in Shanghai.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EARTHQUAKE DAMPENING DEVICE TESTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  11  (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As recent devastating earthquakes in
Turkey, Greece and Taiwan point to the need for structural controls
that could reduce the seismic impact on structures, a professor of
civil engineering at Washington University in St. Louis has tested a
new device that shows promise in minimizing damage by earthquakes.</P>
      <P>Shirley Dyke, assistant professor of civil engineering at
Washington University's School of Engineering and Applied Science,
tested an earthquake-damping device called a magnetorheological (MR)
damper on a six-foot tall metal structure. The test was performed in
the university's Structural Control and Earthquake Engineering
Laboratory, which she directs. She applied the data from a quake that
hit El Centro California in 1940 to reproduce the effects on the
model. She then compared the resulting impact on the structure with
and without the MR dampers.</P>
      <P>Measuring responses on every floor of the building, Dyke found
that the MR dampers reduced the peak acceleration by 50 percent.</P>
      <P>"That's very encouraging," says Dyke in an article carried by the
University's feature service. "Our purpose was to demonstrate that
these devices are effective for response reduction, and we showed it
clearly at this scale. Our idea is to start with small-scale tables
and then to try it with a large shake table. Now, we're also working
on defining which types of structures would benefit from MR dampers,
and we eventually will design guidelines for them."</P>
      <P>The MR damper is a device that acts like a shock absorber on a
structure. The MR damping technology is inexpensive, relatively
straightforward and will operate on just 20 to 50 watts of power--the
amount used by a household light bulb. And if electrical power is cut
in a major quake, the device would still work because it's powered by
a battery.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS 80% OF QUAKE VICTIMS NOT YET RECEIVE ANY AID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 80 percent of Taichung County
residents whose houses were toppled or severely damaged by the 921
earthquake have not yet received any relief aid from the government,
according to the results of a survey released on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The face-to-face survey of 1,167 residents in various disaster
zones in the central Taiwan county were conducted by the non-profit
Humanistic Education Foundation from Oct. 10-11.</P>
      <P>The foundation mobilized 200-plus volunteers to interview people
either on streets or at temporary shelters for homeless quake
victims. Each randomly selected resident was interviewed for about
30 minutes.</P>
      <P>Survey results show that 79.69 percent of the respondents whose
homes were completely destroyed or seriously damaged in the Sept. 21
earthquake have not yet received any "consolatory money" from the
government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 55.22 percent of those who themselves were seriously
injured or whose family members died or were severely wounded in the
devastating temblor also said they have not yet received any penny
from the government.</P>
      <P>The central government has promised to offer NT$200,000
(US$6,289) for each family whose house totally collapsed and
NT$100,000 for each of those whose houses partially collapsed. In
addition, the government promised to offer each of these
quake-affected households NT$3,000 in housing rent subsidy per month
for a year.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the government agreed to offer NT$1 million in
"consolatory money" for the bereaved family of each quake victim and
NT$200,000 for each of those who were seriously injured.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, many surviving quake victims complained
that even though they have filled in many, many application forms
over the past two weeks, they are still unable to get any "relief
money" from the government.</P>
      <P>As a result, many quake-affected people are still reluctant to
leave their crumbled or damaged houses and have to rely on "relief
goods" for survival.</P>
      <P>Twenty-three percent cited "taking care of their houses and
properties" as the top reason for their refusal to leave the
disaster zones after the deadly quake; 22 percent said the main
reason behind their reluctance to depart is that they don't think
they can find suitable places to live or find new jobs outside their
hometown; while 15 percent said they don't want to leave simply for
emotional or sentimental reasons.</P>
      <P>Asked about who should be held responsible for slow distribution
of relief funds, 27 percent said grassroots-level authorities
should be blamed; 20 percent cited the central government as the
culprit; 10.7 percent said the main reason lies with the county
government.</P>
      <P>Other reasons cited by the respondents included a lack of
information, a lack of time and energy to apply for "relief funds" on
the part of quake victims themselves, low efficiency of various
self-help organizations, quake victims' failure to cooperate and help
each other.</P>
      <P>As for quake-affected people's current living conditions, 70
percent of those interviewed said they can acquire relief goods
within 30 minutes, indicating that basic demands for people in most
disaster zones can now be met. Nevertheless, 2 percent of the
respondents said they have to spend two hours getting relief goods.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 24 percent said they have to pick up
relief goods everyday or once every two to three days, indicating that
they have not yet settled down.</P>
      <P>Survey results showed that 34 percent of quake-affected people
in Taichung County's Tali City have taken part in at least one
self-help organization, more than double the number recorded in the
mountain township of Tungshih. County-wide, 70 percent of all quake
victims have not participated in any self-help organization.</P>
      <P>Eighty-six percent of those interviewed said they have
experienced emotional changes after the deadly earthquake. For
instance, 23 percent said they have often feel anxiety after the
quake; 11 percent said they can be enraged easier; 5 percent said
they often feel powerless and don't want to do anything.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROPERTY LOSSES IN TAIWAN FROM MAJOR QUAKE TOTAL US$ 9.2 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Property losses in Taiwan resulting from
the "921 Earthquake" totaled US$9.2 billion (NT$29.2 million),
according to statistics released Monday by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The figure is far below that of losses incurred by the 1994
Northridge earthquake in California and by the 1995 Kobe quake in
Japan.</P>
      <P>A strong temblor measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale jolted the
Northridge area on Jan. 17, 1994. A magnitude-7.2 quake rocked the
Kobe area on the same date the following year.</P>
      <P>The recent major earthquake that struck the central part of
Taiwan occurred on Sept. 21, with a magnitude of 7.3.</P>
      <P>Property losses from the Northridge quake and the Kobe quake were
estimated to be US$47 billion and US$100 billion, respectively.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's property losses account for 3.3 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP), a much higher figure than the 0.7
percent registered in the United States and 2 percent in Japan, DGBAS
statistics show.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS data, authorities in the United States issued
a disaster-relief order within 15 minutes after the earthquake there,
while Japan and Taiwan authorities issued such orders within six
hours and two hours, respectively.</P>
      <P>DGBAS data also indicated that seven hours passed before the last
survivor was pulled from the rubble after the temblor in the United
States, while the last such rescues were made on the fifth day after
the quake in Japan and the sixth day after the earthquake in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Seventy-two people died and 11,846 were injured in the Northridge
quake; 6,430 people died, 43,782 were injured and three were
unaccounted for following the Kobe temblor.</P>
      <P>The "921 Earthquake" claimed 2,321 lives and injured 8,722; 40
were presumed dead after being buried beneath the rubble.</P>
      <P>There were 114,000 houses damaged in the Northridge temblor,
250,000 in the Kobe quake, and 51,000 in the "921 Earthquake,"
according to DGBAS data.</P>

    <HEADLINE>51% GIVE THUMBS UP TO VEEP LIEN'S POST-QUAKE PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent survey showed that many local
people admire Vice President Lien Chan's performance in the wake of
the 921 earthquake, but such admiration does not seem to have been
translated into support for his presidential bid.</P>
      <P>The survey of 1,159 randomly selected adult residents was
conducted from Oct. 7-8 by Focus Survey Research Co. at the request
of Global Television Co. and The Journalist magazine.</P>
      <P>Survey results found that 51 percent of the respondents give a
thumbs-up to Lien's post-earthquake performance, while 29.7 percent
said they don't admire his performance.</P>
      <P>Even though Lien receives more praise for his post-quake
performance than his two major rivals in the 2000 presidential
election, he still lags behind them in the support rate. Lien has
been nominated by the ruling Kuomintang to run for the next
presidency.</P>
      <P>If the election were to take place the following day, 27.8
percent said they would vote for former Taiwan Governor James Soong;
18.2 percent threw their support behind opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Chen Shui-bian; and 18.1 percent
said they would choose Lien. Soong, a former KMT powerhouse, is
running a rival campaign with Lien.</P>
      <P>While Soong continued to lead the pack, his support rate fell
from a level of well over 30 percent in numerous polls
conducted before the Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that the gap between second-ranking
Chen and third-ranking Lien has been narrowed to a marginal 0.1
percent.</P>
      <P>Asked who they think to be most capable of leading
post-earthquake relief and reconstruction work, 27.3 percent choose
Soong; 25 percent opt for Lien; and 13.7 percent select Chen; while
28.4 percent either decline to answer the question or said they don't
know.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 45 percent said they admire Soong's post-earthquake
performance, compared to 19.7 percent who gave a thumbs-down. In
contrast, 36.4 percent praised Chen's performance, while 25.2 percent
said they disliked his performance.</P>
      <P>The same survey further showed that 47.3 percent agree with
President Lee Teng-hui's remarks that the government has performed
well in post-quake relief work, while 35.2 percent said they
disagree with Lee's evaluation.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 50.7 percent said they were satisfied
with the KMT's post-quake performance, but 33.3 percent said they
were discontent.</P>
      <P>In comparison, 28 percent endorsed the DPP's performance, while
27.7 percent nixed the main opposition party's post-quake
operations.</P>
      <P>As for the minor opposition New Party's performance, 14 percent
said they were satisfied, while 33 percent said they were discontent
with the pro-unification party's performance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS VISIT US TO SAY THANKS FOR QUAKE RELIEF, EXCHANGE VIEWS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct. 11 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwan legislators visited a
US think tank in New York on Monday to express gratitude for US
assistance in post-quake rescue and relief operations and to exchange
views on US-Taiwan-mainland China relationships.</P>
      <P>The group, led by Legislative Yuan Vice President Rau Yin-Chi,
comprises legislators from the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and opposition
Democrative Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>The lawmakers arrived in New York Sunday night and on Monday
visited the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, a US think
tank that has sponsored many unofficial conferences on Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the first for the legislators after the July
9 pronouncement by President Lee Teng-hui of the "state-to-state
relationship" theory, Rau explained Taiwan's stance in dealing with
the cross-strait relationship, saying that the theory did not
constitute a change in Taiwan's mainland policy, but merely spelled
out an existing fact.</P>
      <P>Rau went on to say that a vague definition of Taiwan's position
in terms of the cross-strait relationship does not benefit Taiwan,
since the mainland spares no effort in worldwide dissemination of the
falsehood that Taiwan is part of the People's Republic of China
(PRC).</P>
      <P>"Taiwan definitely is not a province of the PRC, nor can it
become another Hong Kong or Macau," said Rau.</P>
      <P>Rau urged the United States to support Taiwan's stance and also
invited members of the committee to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, committee officials stressed the importance of
maintaining "vagueness" in dealing with cross-strait relations,
despite saying that they better understood Taiwan's theory after
Rau's explanation.</P>
      <P>The group was slated to proceed to Washington, D.C. for other
meetings before returning to Taiwan on Oct. 14.

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTER ISSUES APOLOGY FOR AMMUNITION THEFT FROM AIR BASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Tang Fei on
Tuesday apologized to the public after another theft at an air force
base in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tang issued the apology at the Legislative Yuan to assuage
public uneasiness resulting from the theft. He also stressed that all
armed forces will step up munitions control and inspection.</P>
      <P>The Air Force General Headquarters confirmed on Tuesday that 121
rounds of ammunition, consisting of 60 flare bombs, 22 cartridge
impulses, 22 smoke bombs and 17 grenades, were found to be missing
from an air force base in Taoyuan during a routine check Monday
morning.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Lai Ching-chun of the air force said that it has
alerted a task force that had been formed at the base in the wake of
a previous theft on Oct. 3, in which more than 9,000 rounds of
ammunition for 65K2 rifles went missing.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau has sent agents to assist with
investigation work.</P>
      <P>Lai said that right after the Oct. 3 theft, the air force beefed
up security measures and started adjustments in munitions depot
operations. But because there is so much ammunition, it is difficult
to take an accurate inventory and move it all to secure locations, he
added.</P>
      <P>With two thefts occurring in only nine days, the air force is not
ruling out the possibility that the two incidents are somehow linked,
according to Lai.</P>
      <P>Police have targeted three suspects in connection with the Oct. 3
theft, said Lai, adding that there is some discrepancy between their
statements and the facts, and police are still investigating the
case.</P>

      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian said on Tuesday that he
has organized a 100-member legal service team to provide counseling
for surviving victims of the 921 devastating earthquake.</P>
      <P>Chen, himself a lawyer-turned-politician, said the "All People
Legal Service Group" will travel deep into quake-stricken areas in
central Taiwan from Wednesday to offer free legal counseling services
to all quake-affected people.</P>
      <P>Chen, a former Taipei mayor, said he has found through various
inspection tours of disaster zones over the past two weeks that many
quake-affected people, including those whose houses collapsed in the
Sept. 21 temblor, have little knowledge about the government's
quake-relief measures.</P>
      <P>Chen reminded surviving quake victims to collect and keep
evidence if they want to sue builders for shoddy buildings after the
quake. "Without enough evidence, those who have lost their houses in
the quake may still lose lawsuits against contractors," he
cautioned.</P>
      <P>Chen said the voluntary service team will compile a manual
detailing all earthquake-related legal problems, regulations and
tips for resolving relevant legal problems. Copies of the
manual will be distributed free of charge, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen also urged those whose parents were killed in the
earthquake and had more debts than assets should give up their
inheritance rights before Nov. 20. Otherwise, Chen said, they may
have to inherit their parents' debts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC DAMAGE FROM QUAKE DOUBLE PREVIOUS ESTIMATE: TIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Industrial losses in central Taiwan
resulting from the devastating earthquake will be double the
previously estimated figure, said members of the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research (TIER) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Losses in the manufacturing industry will total NT$360 billion,
or 4 percent of industry products' total value for 1999, which will
result in a 0.5 percent decline in economic growth for the year,
noted researchers with the TIER after an assessment of actual
damages.</P>
      <P>In addition to the losses of industrial products, there was a
slump in the tourism industry and a sharp increase in unemployment,
the researchers observed.</P>
      <P>The previous TIER economic assessment on Sept. 26, five days
after the killer temblor, said that the damages caused by power
outages in the manufacturing sector amounted to "a week's suspension
of operations." That amount of impact would result in a loss of
NT$180 billion, or 2 percent of total production value, thus leading
to a plunge of 0.1 percent to 0.2 percent in economic growth -- with
5.5 percent growth for 1999 still likely to be achieved.</P>
      <P>However, after an on-the-spot survey by the TIER work team, which
was led by institute President Wu Rong-I, conducted in the
hardest-hit counties of Taichung and Nantou, a more accurate estimate
was made.</P>
      <P>The TIER decided to make public its formal quake-damage estimate
by the end of October, when a monthly report on the island's economic
prospects will be presented at the institute's monthly news
conference.</P>
      <P>The island's economic performance in August and September was
robust, a sure indication that Taiwan has left the Asian financial
turmoil far behind, according to TIER.</P>
      <P>The annual economic growth forecast made by the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting &amp; Statistics (DGBAS) in August raised
the figure to 5.74 percent from 5.5 percent. However, if the brisk
economic performance of the third quarter is taken into
consideration, the growth may be even higher than 5.74 percent, said
TIER officials.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, in light of the earthquake disaster, a decline of
0.5 percent in economic growth is expected, amounting to annual
growth below 5.5 percent, the TIER researchers predicted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DISPOSAL OF CONSTRUCTION WASTE A BIG TASK FOR ENVIRONMENT OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Debris from dismantled buildings damaged by
the Sept. 21 earthquake is estimated to exceed 30 million metric
tons, creating a big headache for environmental authorities, who face
a shortage of dumping grounds and strong resistance from the public.</P>
      <P>An official of the Environmental Protection Administration under
the Executive Yuan said Tuesday that the volume of construction waste
from the devastated buildings is almost two times that of Taiwan's
industrial waste for a whole year.</P>
      <P>An island with extremely high population density and growing
environmental consciousness, Taiwan has in recent years had
difficulty finding suitable dumping grounds for refuse from industry
and households, not to mention the huge quantity caused by the
earthquake.</P>
      <P>The government has assigned the armed forces to help with
clean-up operations. In the past two weeks, soldiers have dismantled
and cleared more than one million metric tons of concrete and scraps
of furnishings. Before suitable dumping grounds are found, the
material will be kept at temporary sites near the disaster regions.</P>
      <P>So far, authorities have succeeded in finding 54 temporary sites
for storing the debris. These open-air storage grounds are mostly
located along riverbanks and valleys.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists and geologists voiced their concerns that the
earthquake and aftershocks have changed the hydrodynamics of many
waterways in central Taiwan, and the quake-jolted dikes might burst
with heavy flooding. Floods would move the temporarily-stored waste
downstream, damaging river beds and surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>For long-term disposal, some experts have discussed the Japanese
model. Japanese authorities used most of the concrete waste after the
1995 Hanshin earthquake to create reclaimed land; scraps the mostly
wooden furnishings were burned in controlled open-air fires. However,
many residents neighboring the burning grounds experienced eye
irritation.</P>
      <P>Some environmentalists suggested that the Japanese model might
not be suitable for Taiwan in this regard, because not much of the
material used here for construction and furnishings was made of wood.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration is currently drafting
legislation for compulsory recycling of construction materials, which
is slated for screening by the Executive Yuan next June and will not
be in force until receiving subsequent approval by the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Refraining from going into details about forces governing the
construction industry, an environmental official lamented that
without a legal basis for handling the issue, the disposal of
earthquake debris will become a huge controversial issue.</P>

(By Shammy Chao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The container ship Fukuoshin, which
experienced mechanical difficulty and was subsequently anchored and
abandoned when Tyhpoon Dan struck Taiwan, has run aground in
Kaohsiung harbor.</P>
      <P>Representatives from the shipping agency Chenghwa Co., along with
personnel from its insurance company, on Tuesday surveyed the site
and discussed measures for removing the vessel, which sails under the
Panamanian flag.</P>
      <P>The ship was originally scheduled to leave for Hualien on Oct. 6
to load and transport gravel. However, during bad weather conditions
caused by Typhoon Dan, the engine failed and the vessel drifted at
sea. While the 15 crew members on board were rescued by helicopter,
the ship was towed by a tugboat and anchored off Kaohsiung harbor.</P>
      <P>But because of high waves in the stormy sea, the ship dragged
anchor and drifted until running aground by the Chichin seashore at
Kaohsiung harbor.</P>
      <P>Staff members of the Chenghwa Co. are optimistic that the vessel
can be dislodged with the use of a tugboat because the ship is
currently empty.</P>
      <P>The Fukuoshin weighs 4,556 tons, with a length of 101 meters and
a width of 18 meters. The Japanese captain and 14 Philippine crew
members have been taken care of by the shipping agency.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan continued to shake on Tuesday as at
least three perceptible earthquakes were detected rocking the
mountainous central-north and eastern parts of the island, but no
casualties were reported, according to the Seismology Center of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At 3:10 a.m., a jolt measuring 4.7 on the open-ended Richter
scale was detected about 31.8 kilometers west of Hualien City on the
east coast, with its epicenter located at 23.96 degrees north
latitude and 121.29 degrees east longitude, said the center's
earthquake experts.</P>
      <P>The tremor's focus, or underground center, was 3.8 kilometers
beneath the earth's surface, according to the seismologists.</P>
      <P>The temblor had an intensity of 4.0 in nearby Shilin Township in
Hualien County, 3.0 in Hualien City and 2.0 in Nanshan Township in
the eastern coastal county of Ilan.</P>
      <P>Later, at around 7:56 Tuesday morning, a magnitude-4.5 quake
jolted the central-north mountain range, about 36 kilometers south of
Chupei Township.</P>
      <P>The jolt, with its epicenter at 24.48 degrees north latitude and
120.91 degrees east longitude, was found originating 1.4 kilometers
beneath the earth's surface, according to the seismologists.</P>
      <P>The temblor, believed to be unrelated to the catastrophic Sept.
21 earthquake and its aftershocks, also sent magnitude-3.0 tremor
waves to nearby Nanchuang Township in Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>At 12:17 p.m., another temblor measuring 4.7 on the Richter scale
was detected 42.9 kilometers east of the central city of Taichung,
with its focus only 1 kilometer beneath the earth's surface.</P>
      <P>The jolt had an intensity of 3.0 in Ilan County's Nanshan
Township, 2.0 in Liyutan in Miaoli County, and 1.0 in Hualien City.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday, 22 days after the devastating quake, more than
11,500 aftershocks had been detected, although most of those were
imperceptible except by specialized monitoring instruments. Of the
total, 105 were temblors of magnitude 4.0 or greater, the
seismologists said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, seismic data collected by the Seismology Center showed
that the frequency of aftershocks from the deadly Sept. 21 earthquake
has gradually subsided, with less than 10 per hour this week,
compared to approximately 150 per hour in the first several days
following the quake.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Property losses in Taiwan resulting from
the "921 Earthquake" totaled US$9.2 billion (NT$292 billion),
according to statistics released Monday by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>The figure is far below that of losses incurred by the 1994
Northridge earthquake in California and by the 1995 Kobe quake in
Japan.</P>
      <P>A strong temblor measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale jolted the
Northridge area on Jan. 17, 1994. A magnitude-7.2 quake rocked the
Kobe area on the same date the following year.</P>
      <P>The recent major earthquake that struck the central part of
Taiwan occurred on Sept. 21, with a magnitude of 7.3. Property losses
from the Northridge quake and the Kobe quake were estimated to be
US$47 billion and US$100 billion, respectively.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's property losses account for 3.3 percent of the
its gross domestic product (GDP), a much higher figure than the 0.7
percent registered in the United States and 2 percent in Japan, DGBAS
statistics show.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS data, authorities in the United States issued
a disaster-relief order within 15 minutes after the earthquake there,
while Japan and Taiwan authorities issued such orders within six
hours and two hours, respectively.</P>
      <P>DGBAS data also indicated that seven hours passed before the last
survivor was pulled from the rubble after the temblor in the United
States, while the last such rescues were made on the fifth day after
the quake in Japan and the sixth day after the earthquake in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Seventy-two people died and 11,846 were injured in the Northridge
quake; 6,430 people died, 43,782 were injured and three were
unaccounted for following the Kobe temblor.</P>
      <P>The "921 Earthquake" claimed 2,321 lives and injured 8,722; 40
were presumed dead after being buried beneath the rubble.</P>
      <P>There were 114,000 houses damaged in the Northridge temblor,
250,000 in the Kobe quake, and 51,000 in the "921 Earthquake,"

    <TEXT>
      <P>Zhang Haitao, an engineer who set up a
web page for Falun Gong in May, was indicted Monday by Jilin
Provincial People's Procuratorate on charges of "inciting the
overthrow of state power," a human rights group said here Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said that Zhang, 30, used the web page
to urge his fellow practitioners to protest against the
nation-wide government crackdown on Falun Gong, which began on July 21.
The web page was closed by the authorities on July 24 and Zhang was
arrested on July 29 as a result.</P>
      <P>The information center said that Zhang could be sentenced in a
month to a long prison term, and that about 50 other leaders of Falun
Gong have been detained by police. All of them might be indicted in
this month, it added.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong is a huge but amorphous organization with tens of
millions of followers in mainland China. It combines the ideas of
Buddhism and Taoism with a Chinese traditional breathing technique
called "qi gong." The mainland Chinese government began to crack
down on the quasi-religious sect after more than 10,000
sect members staged an unusual demonstration around the Zhungnanhai
leadership compound in central Beijing in April.</P>

      <P>The government plans to issue NT$80 billion
worth of public bonds in two separate stages as reconstruction
and relief aid for 921 earthquake victims, an official of the Central
Bank of China (CBC) said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chien-cheng, deputy director of the Treasury Department of
CBC, said that the Ministry of Finance sold NT$40 billion worth of
public bonds via the CBC on Tuesday. The ministry was expected to
issue another NT$40 billion in public bonds in mid-November.</P>
      <P>The bonds will mature in 15 years, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said that in order to raise funds for relief aid and
reconstructing quake-stricken areas, the government issued public
bonds to increase capital inflow to the market without causing an
increase in banks' short-term interest rates.</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say that the bonds are always issued in the second

    <DATELINE>Puli,   central  Taiwan,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The famous "Ah-Kung"
(Grandpa) and "Ah-Mah" (Grandma) of the Christian Hospital in Puli in
Nantou County, who returned to their mother country of Norway after
retirement last year, flew back to Taiwan Tuesday to their "real
home."</P>
      <P>Bjarne and Alfhild Jensen Gislefoss, two Norwegian doctors who
have devoted some four decades of their lives to providing medical
care to Taiwan's aboriginal people in central Taiwan, said they just
cannot sit idly by while the Puli Christian (Puchi) Hospital is
braving an unprecedented test and mission in the wake of the
devastating Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>The couple have both served as presidents of the hospital over a
period spanning more than 30 years, and have cared for numerous
aborigines in times of illness.</P>
      <P>Seeing the return of Ah-Kung and Ah-Mah, a teary hospital
secretary said their arrival is a genuine shot in the arm for Puchi,
at a time when it is striving to care for both regular patients and
those injured in the deadly earthquake -- around-the-clock arrivals
who have poured in since early Sept. 21 with never-ending frequency.</P>
      <P>Mr. and Mrs. Gislefoss managed to collect 3,000 blankets in a
charity drive in Norway for Taiwan's cause before flying halfway
around the globe to the island.</P>
      <P>The Gislefosses, who have received numerous certificates of
recognition from the government and from private groups in Taiwan
over the past several decades, have always said that "Norway is our
mother country, but Taiwan is our home."</P>
      <P>Puchi, located in mountainous Puli, sustained considerable damage
to its main administration building during the devastating quake
which battered the central counties of Taichung, Nantou and Yunlin,
killing 2,300 people and leaving 8,700 injured and some 100,000
others homeless.</P>
      <P>With the continual influx of patients, Puchi, with its own
buildings shaking, never turned away any incoming injured. It first
used tents and stretchers and then containers donated by a shipping
company to accommodate patients.</P>
      <P>Puchi, a general hospital famed for its care of aboriginal people
in central Taiwan, was established in January 1956 by Lillian Ruth
Dickson, a US missionary working with limited church donations.</P>
      <P>In 1960, Dr. Bjarne Gislefoss, who helped train 150 local nurses
for the hospital, became the second president of the institution. In
1963, Gislefoss married Alfhild Jensen, a graduate of Oslo Medical
School who had worked as an anesthetist in the United States and was
dispatched to Taiwan on a missionary and medical mission.</P>

(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City government's Health
Department held a seminar on Tuesday to discuss restrictions on
chewing betel nuts in public.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chin-chuan, director of the department, said the government
has no intention of banning betel nut chewing, but considering public
sanitation, his department must impose restrictions.</P>
      <P>The plan to restrict chewing of betel nuts has received wide
support from the public, but has met resistance from betel nut
planters and sellers.</P>
      <P>The sellers said that betel nut consumption is a matter of
individual choice, and it would be too rigid if the government
imposes a ban at government institutions, department stores, tourist
hotels, railway stations and airports.</P>
      <P>In consideration of the sellers' views, the Health Department
made some concessions on the places where chewing betel nuts will be
prohibited.</P>
      <P>Areas of prohibition will include schools, nurseries,
kindergartens, social education halls, libraries, museums,
performance halls, gymnasiums, swimming pools, children's
playgrounds, zoos, medical and nursing institutions, buses and
trains.</P>
      <P>As for government institutions, department stores, tourist
hotels, railway stations and airports, their managers will be free to
decide whether to ban or to set aside special areas for betel nut
chewing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Council of Agriculture (COA) officials said on Tuesday
that betel nut plantations on the island sustained very little damage
in the devastating Sept. 21 Chichi earthquake.</P>
      <P>But they reiterated that the COA will further crack down on some
8,000 acres of unlawfully planted betel nut plantations.</P>
      <P>There are about 54,000 acres of betel nut plantations that were
planted without violating government regulations. However, the COA
will not encourage any farmers to plant betel nuts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEGAWATI MAY BE GUS DUR'S VICE-PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct.  12 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Charismatic Islamic leader Abdurrahman
Wahid and opposition front-runner Megawati Sukarnoputri are working
out a plan for a joint ticket in next week's Indonesian presidential
polls that could prove insurmountable for President B.J. Habibie, who
looked set Monday night to hold on to the ruling Golkar party's
nomination, The Business Times reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Party insiders say Wahid, or Gus Dur as he is popularly known,
will head a ticket with Megawati as his running mate. But in a
compromise deal, the ailing Gus Dur will step down after a period of
time and hand over power to his deputy. Megawati's Indonesian
Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P) holds 153 seats in the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR), the most of any party, but not enough to
form a majority in the electoral college that will choose the
president on Oct. 20.</P>
      <P>In a symbolic gesture of unity, the two leaders journeyed to East
Java over the weekend to pay respects at the graves of their
respective fathers.</P>
      <P>With his nomination by the Reform faction in the 700-seat MPR
last week, Gus Dur has emerged as the front runner among the three
presidential candidates. He is now seen as the ideal candidate for
the nation's top job becuase he can act a bridge between the
nationalists and the conservative Muslims within the MPR.</P>
      <P>Political observer Sukardi Rinarkit, who has close ties with the
PDI-P, said any plan for a Gus Dur-Megawati ticket needs to be sold
to the millions of Megawati supporters who are threatening to stage
massive demonstrations if she is not elected.</P>
      <P>"Megawati will accept the vice-president post, but they have to
sell the idea to the masses, and the visit to East Java was classic
Javanese politics," said Rinarkit. "The symbolism of that visit was
to show the people that the two of them are still together."</P>
      <P>Gus Dur showed that he is the man who is pulling all the strings
when his crucial backing for the Central Axis faction's nomination
helped Amien Rais win the chairmanship of the MPR over the PDI-P
candidate. The behind-the-scenes negotiations will make it harder for
the ambitions of incumbent president Habibie.</P>
      <P>Late last night the ruling Golkar party appeared set to stick to
its earlier decision to nominate Habibie as its sole presidential
candidate. Sources told the Business Times that the ruling party is
also likely to nominate armed forces chief and Defense Minister
General Wiranto as his running mate during its two-day meeting which
ended Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Habibie also alluded to his possible vice-presidential choice in
an interview with Tempo magazine when he said the general is well
suited for the job, given his Javanese ethnicity. Habibie comes from
South Sulawesi.</P>
      <P>Public opinion polls show Habibie trailing his opponents. A
readers' poll conducted by the respected Kompas daily in four major
cities showed Megawati the strong popular choice with Wahid running
second.</P>
      <P>Kompas said 52 percent of respondents chose the daughter of the
country's first president as the next head of state, while Wahid and
Habibie mustered support from only 11 and 10 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Even within his own party, the incumbent is facing some
opposition from a group led by deputy chairman Marzuki Darusman, who
heads the Golkar faction in the MPR. But party insiders told the
Business Times that a sizable number of Golkar members, especially
the regional representatives, are still solidly behind Habibie.

agency repairs (on) structures which were built a long time ago so as
to ensure safety of people working there" are normal activities
falling within Vietnam's sovereignty and completely conforming with
international law and practice.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese ambassador said the areas were hit by a typhoon,
so the repairs were needed. But he stressed there were no new
structures being constructed and that they were adhering to ASEAN
declarations calling for restraint of claimants' movements in the
South China Sea.</P>
      <P>"We assert our indisputable sovereignty over Truong Sa (Spratly)
as well as Hoang Sa (Paracel) archipelagos," Vietnam averred.</P>
      <P>But it stressed it had been cooperative in coming up with a long
term solution to the dispute through negotiations among claimants.</P>
      <P>Vietnam supported the Philippines' stand that "pending such a
solution, the parties concerned should refrain from taking any
actions that would further aggravate the situation."</P>
      <P>It explained its action in the Spratlys was not in violation of
the status quo principle that should be adopted by the claimants.</P>
      <P>Vietnam further said its "position on issues relating to the
Eastern Sea (South China Sea) has been clearly stated on many
occasions."</P>
      <P>Vietnam and the Philippines were asked by the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations to draft the regional code of conduct for the
South China Sea calling for a moratorium on construction in the area.</P>
      <P>The Spratlys are claimed in whole or in part by the Philippines,
Mainland China, Malaysia, Vietnam, Brunei and the Republic of China.

    <HEADLINE>`THREE ARE NOT TOO MANY' SAY TAIWAN DEMOGRAPHERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese couples are being encouraged to
have more than two children under a slogan of "Three (babies) are not
too many."</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's population ages and the birth rate continues to
decline, official demographers say the current national policy is to
encourage married couples to have more children in order to help
increase the proportion of the population that will be under the age
of 40 several decades from now.</P>
      <P>The slogan has been altered as the government's population policy
has changed, said the demographers. Less than 10 years ago, the
government's slogan was "Two (babies) are just fine and one is not
too few."</P>
      <P>According to tallies from the Ministry of the Interior, Taiwan's
population totaled 22,048,356 as of the end of September. Of the
total, 11,293,654 are male and 10,754,702 are female, making up a
ratio of 105:100 between the two sexes.</P>
      <P>The birth rate in the Taiwan, Penghu, Matsu and Kinmen areas
averaged 0.683 percent in 1998, slightly lower than expected, the
demographers said.</P>
      <P>In September, 22,843 babies were born in these areas, marking an
annual birth rate of 1.26 percent, or approximately one new-born baby
every minute.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 10,462 people died in September, averaging one death
every four minutes or a death rate of 0.577 percent, according to the
tallies.</P>

fail to follow an agreement to allow President Jean-Bertrand Aristide
to return to office and restore a democratic government.

1995: Joseph Rotblat, the nuclear physicist who devoted his life
to trying to ban the bomb he helped create, wins the 1995 Nobel Peace
Prize.

1995: France rejects appeals to abandon nuclear tests in the
South Pacific.

    <HEADLINE>QUAKE-HIT AREA CONSCRIPTS GIVEN MORE OPTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Young men close to conscription age from
earthquake-stricken areas in central Taiwan are now allowed easier
access to the Selective Service System (SSS) and the Voluntary
Officers' Program (VOP), sources from the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The initiative is designed to help alleviate unemployment
pressures and the loss of educational opportunities in central Taiwan
in the wake of the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake which killed at
least 2,300 people, injured 8,700 and left 100,000 homeless, while
causing approximately US$9.2 billion worth of property damage, said
MND officials.</P>
      <P>The military currently needs about 4,000 new recruits for the SSS
and VOP, and enlistment priorities will be given to draft-eligible
young men from the central counties of Taichung, Nantou and Yunlin --
the hardest hit areas, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Of the 4,000-some openings, 2,385 will be in the Army, with 673
openings for low-ranking officers and 1,712 for soldiers. The
Military Police Command will offer 35 positions for officers and 210
for soldiers, while the Military Management Command will make 28
positions available for officers and 127 for soldiers, according to
the MND.</P>
      <P>The newly-introduced SSS is designed to allow would-be-conscripts
to perform community service rather than active military duty.</P>
      <P>The SSS will allow the draft-eligible young men to serve in the
fields of law enforcement, education or defense technology, instead
of joining active-duty military units.</P>
      <P>The would-be inductees who are chosen to enter the SSS will face
a two-and-a-half-year obligation, six months longer than the standard
term for conscription into military service. This is because SSS
recruits will work on a nine-to-five basis, in contrast to ordinary
draftees who are ostensibly on call around the clock, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>The SSS conscripts may be required to work as nurses in
retirement homes or for elderly persons who live alone in the
earthquake-stricken areas. They may also serve as policemen or
assistants in educational or medical institutions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the VOP provides nine different divisions, including
artillery, telecommunications, transportation, chemical and aviation,
for college graduates to choose from, allowing them to join the army
as officers for military service periods ranging from five years to
14 years, according to the officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JORDAN DONATES RELIEF GOODS TO TAIWAN'S QUAKE SURVIVORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Jordanian Royal Air Force transport
plane airlifted 14,600 kilograms of relief goods to Taipei on
Wednesday to help surviving victims of a devastating earthquake which
rattled mountainous central Taiwan on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Jordan was the first Middle East country to offer assistance to
the Republic of China in the wake of the 921 earthquake, the worst
natural disaster to hit Taiwan in decades.</P>
      <P>The C-130 Jordanian military transport arrived at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport, the main gateway to Taiwan, at 3
a.m. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials received the
goods at the airport on behalf of the government. The relief goods
included pharmaceuticals, tents, blankets, baby foods, powdered milk
and sleeping bags.</P>
      <P>The relief goods will be sent to three hardest-stricken disaster
zones in central Taiwan, including Nantou County's Puli township,
Taichung county's Tungshih township and Taichung City's Takeng
district.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of formal diplomatic relations, the ROC and
Jordan have maintained close substantive ties. ROC President Lee
Teng-hui and Vice President Lien Chan made private visits to the
Middle East country in 1995 and 1998, respectively.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry officials said many countries around the world,
including those which do not maintained official ties with the ROC,
have offered assistance to Taiwan since the 921 temblor wreaked
havoc in the central part of the island.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate all this humanitarian aid," said a MOFA official,
adding that Taiwan has never hesitated to extend a helping hand to
needy countries in the past and will even increase its humanitarian
aid to other countries in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SEEN TO PLAY KEY ROLE IN US-PLANNED THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is set to play a major role in
the US-planned theater missile defense (TMD) system in its bid to
strengthen ties with America but at the risk of angering mainland
China, the Australian on Wednesday reported.</P>
      <P>The newspaper reported the new role may also reinforce Southeast
Asian perceptions of Australia as a US surrogate in the region after
US Secretary of the Air Force F. Whitten Peters on Tuesday emphasized
the vital role of Australia's Pine Gap joint facility in a new
generation space-based infra-red missile defense system called SBIRS.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Peters as saying that SBIRS would be critical to
the operation of the controversial TMD system being considered for
Japan and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The US-proposed system has deeply angered China because Beijing
regards it as aimed at the mainland and it does not want Taiwan to be
included in the planned system.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Professor Stuart Harris of the Australian
National University in Canberra as saying on Tuesday night that the
US theater missile defense plans had not only angered China, but were
likely to destabilize relations between regional powers.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that the Australian government, however, takes
the opposite view, reflecting the heated debate among security
analysts.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted a spokesman for Defense Minister John Moore as
revealing that the government considered TMD to be an intrinsically
defensive system that did not threaten the security of any nation.</P>
      <P>"The government's policy is one of strong opposition to the
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Our involvement in the
joint facility of activities is designed to counter the destabilising
effects of ballistic missile proliferation," the spokesman told the
daily. The daily reported Peters made the remarks at a ceremony
marking the closure of the US-Australian Joint Defense Facility at
Nurrungar, near Woomera in South Australia on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Peters said there would be "absolutely" no weakening in the
Australia-US defense ties over the base closure. New technology has,
since October 1, allowed satellite information to be transmitted to
the US from a new relay station at Pine Gap, near Alice Springs,
rendering the Nurrungar base redundant, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The daily reported Peters as saying that Australia retained full
access to the information.</P>
      <P>The improved technology enables satellites to detect launches of
smaller, theater missiles, using satellites of the 30-year-old
Defense Support Program, the daily reported. This system will be
replaced by the new SBIRS system in 2004, it said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA ATTRACTS MORE ASIAN TOURISTS IN JULY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia has succeeded in luring back
tourists from Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand and other Asian countries
in July, helping to prop up its recently flagging tourist industry.</P>
      <P>The latest figure released by the Australian Tourist Commission
shows the number of tourists from Taiwan, Korea and Thailand, once
the fastest growing sources of tourists for Australia, surged by
between 6.7 percent and 58.5 percent in July from a year ago.</P>
      <P>Tourist arrivals from India, Singapore, Malaysia, the
Philippines, China and Hong Kong also showed increases, ranging from
4.7 percent to 41.9 percent in the same month compared with a year
earlier.</P>
      <P>ATC officials said the Australian tourism industry is showing
signs of recovery from the effects of the Asian financial crisis over
the past two years.</P>
      <P>"Australia's performance was exceptional and on track to meet a
forecast doubling of inbound tourists by 2008," said Australia's
Federal Tourism Minister Jackie Kelly.</P>
      <P>"This sustained, strong growth augurs extremely well for
continued economic and employment growth across the country. Already
Australia's top export industry, tourism's foreign exchange earnings
are expected to reach more than A$33 (US$22) billion annually within
eight years," she said.</P>
      <P>"On-going government investment in tourism promotion, through the
Australian Tourist Commission is paying dividends in all markets.
This is particularly evident in Asia where ATC strategies have
resulted in double-digit growth from all but a handful of major
markets," she added.</P>
      <P>In the same statement, ATC managing director John Morse said
international arrivals in the first seven months of this year were up
nearly 6 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>"This result indicates arrivals should exceed the official
forecast growth of around 4 percent. The Asian economic crisis and
the decline in outbound travel from Japan has made the global
competition for the tourist dollars stronger than ever. Australia is
performing extremely well in these circumstances," Morse said, adding
"Our promotional strategies in the Asian markets in particular have
been highly effective, ensuring a rapid return to growth."</P>
      <P>He said foreign tourist arrivals between January and July 1999
totaled more than 2.47 million, up 5.9 percent from the same period
in 1998.</P>
      <P>Except for Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan, tourist arrivals from
other Asian countries showed increases from 0.1 to 81.3 percent in
the first seven months of this year against the same period last
year, according to the ATC.</P>
      <P>Arrivals from Japan, the biggest source of tourists for
Australia, plunged 6.4 percent to 412,281 in the January to July
period from a year ago while the number of tourists from Hong Kong
and Taiwan fell 4.6 percent and 1.6 percent respectively, according
to the same source. But ATC officials expect more tourists from the
ROC, mainland China and Hong Kong will visit Australia in the months
ahead despite a devastating earthquake which killed more than 2200
people on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tourist industry sources said Taiwan and Hong Kong have strong
purchasing power and many people there are increasingly fond of
traveling overseas to enrich their knowledge. And Australia, with its
wilderness, large open spaces, and different scenic spots and
attractions can offer a different experience to Asian tourists, they
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is
likely to raise its current official interest rate of 4.75 percent to
help combat inflationary pressure from heated economic growth,
economists predicted.</P>
      <P>Economists from Westpac and other major banks in Australia
believe the RBA could hike the interest rate by at least 0.25 percent
as soon as next February because of a number of factors, including
faster than expected growth in the second half of this year and the
recovery of the global economy.</P>
      <P>Westpac has predicted that Australia's gross domestic product
will grow at around 4.7 percent in fiscal 2000-01. Other banks also
made similar projections for the country's economic growth rate.</P>
      <P>The government has forecast the fiscal 1999-2000 growth rate at
around 3.25 to 3.5 percent, but private economists believe it could

      <P>Australia on Wednesday vowed to step up
its fight with the United States over Washington's curb of its lamb
exports by seeking a solution at the World Trade Organization, Trade
Minister Mark Vaile said.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to the CNA, Vaile said: "We have not been
satisfied with the US government's responses to our requests on their
totally unjustified decision to impose tariff quotas on our lamb
exports. We have no option but to seek a World Trade Organization
dispute settlement panel. Discussions to date have failed. We now
have no option but to seek to have the matter heard before a dispute
settlement panel."</P>
      <P>"The US import restrictions imposed in July on our unsubsidized
lamb exports are unfair and unjustifiable under WTO rules, and are
simply bad policy for US consumers and US lamb producers," he added.</P>
      <P>Australia's lamb exports to the US previously were worth around
US$100 million, but the restrictions will reduce its exports sharply.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington, Oct. 22 (CNA The US Department of Commerce (DOC) made
its final determinations in the antidumping investigation of DRAM
chip producers from Taiwan on Tuesday. The result will be announced at
midday of the next business day.</P>
      <P>In its preliminary status report, the DOC found that the dumping
margins of Taiwan DRAM producers ranged from 4.96% to 30.89% .</P>
      <P>"I expect the final weighted-average dumping margin to be higher
(than preliminary determinations)", said Christopher Corr, a trade
lawyer based in Washington, D.C., who represented several of Taiwan's
semiconductor companies.</P>
      <P>A DOC official involved in the investigation told CNA that the
recent price surge in DRAMs on the global market and the tragic
earthquake that happened last month in Taiwan played no role at all
in the DOC investigation.</P>
      <P>"Don't forget the investigative period of this case is the fourth
quarter of 1997 to the third quarter of 1998," the official said.
Whatever happened afterwards in Taiwan or in international markets
will have no impact on the DOC determinations, he maintained.</P>
      <P>If the DOC holds up in its final determinations , the case will
go back to the US International Trade Commission (ITC) for final
ruling. The ITC has scheduled a final hearing for Oct. 19 and will
make the final injury determinations no later than November 26,
before the dumping orders can be issued.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSERVATIVE MAGAZINE URGES TAIWAN SECURITY ENHANCEMENT ACT PASSAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  12  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An American conservative magazine is
urging the US Congress to pass the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act
without delay and daring President Bill Clinton to veto it, because
the legislation is nothing more than an honorable gesture of support
for democratic Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Weekly Standard wrote in an editorial in its latest issue
that representatives of the World Trade Organization will meet in
Seattle at the end of November and the Clinton administration would
like to strike a deal for Communist China's accession to the WTO
before the meeting begins.</P>
      <P>But bilateral negotiations have been going badly and Beijing has
lately withdrawn even those necessary trade concessions it initially
offered in April. All those American CEOs who went to Shanghai in
late September to attend a global forum sponsored by the Fortune
magazine were also looking for some signs from the Communist Chinese
of a renewed willingness to bargain. Instead, the editorial said,
they got bluntly lectured about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a public speech on September 27, Jiang Zemin reminded his
American visitors that "we will not undertake to renounce the use of
force" to absorb now-democratic Taiwan into the still-Communist
mainland, the Weekly Standard reported. Nor will Beijing "allow" any
foreign country to "support" a continued mainland-Taiwan "split."</P>
      <P>Three days later, in a private interview in Beijing with these
same American executives, Zhu Rongji made explicit Jiang's barely
veiled threat, saying the US must "quit emphasizing" that the
question of Taiwan should be settled only by peaceful means and
Washington must also stop "implying that it would help defend Taiwan"
in the event of war. "Otherwise," Zhu warned, "sooner or later it
will lead to an armed resolution."</P>
      <P>During mainland China's National Day celebrations on Oct. 1,
10,000 People's Liberation Army troops marched under a banner that
read "The issue of Taiwan cannot be delayed indefinitely" while
nuclear missiles capable of reaching California rumbled through
Tiananmen Square. The American government responded to this
provocation by immediately capitulating, asserted the editorial.</P>
      <P>Less than 24 hours after the Tiananmen Square military parade,
the Weekly Standard pointed out, the Clinton White House was leaking
word to the Washington Post that it had "mobilized the business
community" in an emergency effort to defeat a previously almost
invisible piece of legislation called the Taiwan Security Enhancement
Act, now pending in both houses of Congress.</P>
      <P>The editorial stressed that the legislation is mostly "a
restatement of traditional rationale for American support of a free
and secure Taiwan. It certainly poses no practical threat to
Communist China, nor on its face does it threaten US business
activity in China. The legislation authorizes or requires the
president to do little on behalf of democratic Taiwan that he is not
already authorized or required to do under current law. TSEA is thus
an honorable gesture of support for Taiwan, but nothing more."</P>
      <P>"The only reason the American business community has to weigh in
against such a gesture is to please the government of Communist
China. So what started as an effort to build a trade relationship
with the mainland has become American eagerness merely to placate
Beijing. And US relations with a democratic ally have been
corrupted," added the editorial.</P>
      <P>Weekly Standard concluded that "the essential nature of
engagement with China is revealed. Call it appeasement. There is one
institution that can salvage some honor from this disgraceful farce.
That is the US Congress, which should pass the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act without delay and dare the president to veto it."</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PREMIER: NO CRIMINAL RING INVOLVEMENT IN POST-QUAKE RESETTLEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on Wednesday
announced four principles for post-earthquake resettlement, in which
he vowed to prevent underground criminal rings from taking part in
post-quake reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>Liu, head of the post-quake reconstruction committee of the
Executive Yuan, made the statement during the ruling Kuomintang's
(KMT) Central Standing Committee conference.</P>
      <P>He stressed that by no means will he allow criminal rings to take
advantage of reconstruction projects to financially exploit quake
victims and thereby offset efforts the government has been making for
resettlement in the aftermath of the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>All law enforcement officers have been ordered to comprehensively
thwart any plans by criminal rings to participate in reconstruction
projects or manipulate bidding for projects of that kind, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>In order to keep the difficult and complicated reconstruction
work on track, the government has to play the role of locomotive to
assure that all quake victims are settled and every victim has a
house to live in, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>Liu said the following four principles have to be upheld to
facilitate the process of reconstruction: respect for human dignity
in resettlement, as opposed to merely rebuilding houses and
infrastructure; cooperation with the public to jointly carry out the
necessary work; prevention of any penetration by underground criminal
rings in post-quake reconstruction projects; and concern for victims'
psychological recovery.</P>
      <P>In collaboration with 47 other experts, the committee has drafted
an overall practical plan for people and areas affected by the
earthquake, and Premier Vincent Siew will again visit the stricken
areas to listen to people's opinions as a complement to the plan, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Priority tasks to be carried out by Friday are: inspecting
houses; deciding which homes are to be torn down; and determining how
much financial aid is to be received and by whom. Demolition of
collapsed high-rise buildings will start as soon as next week, and
temporary housing will be ready next week.

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND MEN OBTAIN RESIDENCY BY MARRYING ELDERLY ROC WOMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At least 300 young men from mainland China
have obtained legal residency in the Republic of China over the
past six months by marrying elderly Taiwan women, a senior mainland
affairs official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-hsun, director of the Legal Affairs Department of the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said official documents and field
surveys show that 300-plus single elderly ROC women in Taipei and
Taichung areas have married mainland men 30-to-40 years younger than
them during their pleasure trips to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Under current ROC regulations, mainland spouses of ROC nationals
aged over 65 can stay in Taiwan up to three years and six months for
each visit. In comparison, the maximum duration of each visit by
mainland spouses of ROC nationals below that age is only six months.</P>
      <P>Quoting findings of MAC surveys, Liu said the elderly Taiwan
women made trips to mainland China along with tour groups or
religious pilgrimage groups under the arrangement of brokerage
houses.</P>
      <P>"Their marriages with young mainland men were also arranged by
brokers," Liu said, adding that the main purpose of the mainland
bridegrooms is to obtain residency in Taiwan so that they can legally
work here.</P>
      <P>Once the mainland bridegrooms are allowed to reside in Taiwan and
find suitable jobs, they have to pay their "better halves" NT$5,000
(US$157.23) to NT$10,000 a month, depending on their marriage
contracts.</P>
      <P>In some cases, mainland bridegrooms can receive monthly pay from
their Taiwan "wives" for their caring services, according to MAC
surveys.</P>
      <P>The number of marriages between the people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait has increased steadily since the ROC government lifted
a ban on civilian cross-strait exchanges in the late 1980s.</P>
      <P>According to MAC tallies, the number of cross-strait marriages
has exceeded 50,000. As Beijing authorities remain hostile toward
Taiwan, the ROC government has adopted a quota system to regulate
the number of mainland spouses to be allowed to reside on the
island.</P>
      <P>Based on humanitarian considerations, the MAC, which charts
Taiwan's policy toward the mainland, recently decided to double the
annual quota from 1,800 people to 3,600 so that more mainland spouses
can stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past, many young mainland women had come to Taiwan to
work as prostitutes through bogus marriage arrangements with Taiwan
men.</P>
      <P>MAC officials said they have asked immigration officers under
the Ministry of the Interior to tighten checks of relevant travel
papers of mainland visitors.</P>
      <P>The MAC and the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
also said they will tighten screening of entry applications by
mainlanders with marriage ties with local people to prevent
irregularities.</P>
      <P>The SEF is an intermediary body authorized by the ROC government
to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INCREASING PUBLIC CONSUMPTION BENEFICIAL TO REHABILITATION: TIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The best way to help quake-stricken areas
is to increase consumption and economic growth, said the head of the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>TIER President Wu Rong-I called on the general public during a
press conference, asking them to leave their sorrow far behind and do
something concrete for the temblor victims.</P>
      <P>Wu also urged the government to adopt an expanded financial
policy. The issuance of government bonds totaling NT$80 billion for
disaster relief and reconstruction may not be adequate, said Wu,
adding that the government can take advantage of the emergency order
to increase the limits on bond issuance established by the Public
Debt Act.</P>
      <P>As for how much money would be adequate to fund the overall
reconstruction effort, the amount is still being assessed by TIER
researchers, Wu disclosed.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that public consumption accounts for 67
percent of the island's GNP, a consumption slump would only slow
economic growth, which would be good for no one, the TIER president
observed.</P>
      <P>He was referring to a general decline in public consumption in
the wake of the devastating quake, since most of the public deemed
that "joy is a sin" and thus dared not dine out or entertain; all
celebration activities were canceled, and no sales promotions were
sponsored by any department stores.</P>
      <P>The TIER work team made an on-the-spot survey last week following
the "921 Earthquake," with assessment focused on the agricultural
region and manufacturing areas.</P>
      <P>The temblor exerted a negative impact on the island's economic
growth, indeed, said the survey. However, economic performance in the
year's third quarter was better than expected.</P>
      <P>In light of the quake disaster, a decline of 0.5 percent in
economic growth is expected, and the government's projected annual
growth of 5.5 percent may not be achieved, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, if the brisk economic performance of the third
quarter and the increasingly robust economic prospects of the fourth
quarter are taken into consideration, the annual growth would still
maintain a level of 5.4 percent, the TIER researchers predicted.</P>
      <P>A formal report of the investigation will be made public within a
month, said Wu, who is the organizer of the survey work team.</P>
      <P>Other members of the survey team include: Hong Teh-sheng, vice
president of the TIER; Chen Bou-chi, professor of economics at the
National Taiwan University; and Professors Wang Lien Chang-fu and
Wang Tu-fa of the National Chungshing University.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China should not set any
prerequisites to hinder its top envoy's planned visit to Taiwan, a
senior ROC negotiator with the mainland said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shi Hwei-yow, vice chairman and secretary-general of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), made the appeal on the eve of the first
anniversary of SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu's ice-breaking visit to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Shi said the Republic of China government didn't set any
conditions for Koo's mainland visit last year.</P>
      <P>"We earnestly hope that Beijing authorities will also not
impose any prerequisites for top mainland negotiator with Taiwan
Wang Daohan's planned Taiwan visit," Shi said.</P>
      <P>Wang, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), promised to make a reciprocal
visit to Taiwan this year when he met his Taiwan counterpart, Koo,
in Shanghai last October.</P>
      <P>After two rounds of negotiations between SEF and ARATS officials
held earlier this year, the two sides reached a preliminary
agreement that Wang would visit Taiwan either in September or
October.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing broke the promise after ROC President Lee
Teng-hui said in an interview with a German radio station in
July that relations across the Taiwan Strait should be defined as a
"special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Beijing leaders interpreted Lee's declaration as a move to
promote Taiwan independence and has since launched saber-rattling
against Taiwan. Beijing softened its intimidation and belligerent
rhetoric against Taiwan only after the island was rattled by a
devastating earthquake on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Beijing leaders still insist that Wang would visit
Taiwan only after President Lee formally retracts the
"special state-to-state relationship" theory.</P>
      <P>Shi said Lee's "special state-to-state" remarks only affirm a
long-existing reality. Against this backdrop, Shi said, it's
unrealistic to ask Lee to retract the "special state-to-state"
statement.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's status and China's future, Shi said the two
sides already reached a consensus that each side can have its own
definition of the "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>For Beijing, the "one China" principle means that the People's
Republic of China (PRC) represents whole China and that Taiwan is a
province under the PRC. For Taipei, the "one China" is a historical
and cultural concept at the moment. It insists that the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits have been ruled by two separate and equal
governments since 1949 and that "one China" will become a reality
only after the two sides are unified under freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies authorized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIT CHAIRMAN OPPOSES TAIWAN SECURITY ENHANCEMENT ACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 12 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the American Institute
in Taiwan (AIT) on Tuesday said he opposes the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act (TSEA) proposed in the US Congress because it would
severely impact trilateral ties among Washington, Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>AIT Chairman Richard Bush outlined his position while meeting
with members of a Republic of China legislature delegation at a
luncheon he hosted to exchange views on the TSEA.</P>
      <P>The delegation, led by Yao Eng-chi, vice president of the ROC
Legislative Yuan, arrived in Washington on Monday and is scheduled to
return to Taipei on Thursday.</P>
      <P>No reporters were invited to the luncheon, but some ROC
legislators revealed the content of their discussion with Bush to the
Central News Agency (CNA).</P>
      <P>It was learned that Bush is opposed to legislation of the act
because it is not in accordance with current US policy. Bush said the
Taiwan Relations Act has been operating well for the past 20 years,
and the executive branch should retain the right to deal with
diplomatic and military affairs.</P>
      <P>The TSEA was proposed by Jesse Helms (R-NC), chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and by Thomas DeLay (R-TX), House
of Representatives' Republican party whip, in the US Senate and House
of Representatives, respectively.</P>
      <P>The main features of the TSEA are: establishment of a direct
contact channel between the US Pacific Command and Taiwan's military,
submission of an annual report by the executive branch on Taiwan's
arms procurement needs, and authorization by Congress of executive
branch intention to sell sophisticated weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The US State Department and Defense Department have openly
opposed legislation of the TSEA, claiming that there is no need for
such a law, that it probably violates the Constitution, and that it
will have a negative effect on Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the act will probably be passed by the House
of Representatives. However, it will be hard to achieve the
two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of
Representatives that is needed to override a presidential veto.</P>
      <P>Yao told CNA that people from all walks of life in the United
States have speedily provided assistance to Taiwan following the "921
Earthquake" that caused significant casualties, and that both the US
Senate and House of Representatives have adopted resolutions to
express their sympathy and support for the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Yao said he led the delegation to visit the United States mainly
to express the ROC government and people's gratitude for post-quake
assistance and because he hopes that the relationship between both
countries' legislative branches can be further enhanced.</P>
      <P>While talking with ROC legislators, Bush praised the ROC
government for its efficiency in the quake-relief efforts and lauded
overseas Chinese for their enthusiasm in providing monetary and
material aid to Taiwan's quake victims.</P>
      <P>ROC legislators also called on Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) later on
Tuesday. They discussed Taiwan's post-quake relief and reconstruction
efforts and Beijing's politicization of the earthquake.</P>
      <P>Beijing's Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan had stated at a press
conference held in New York following the quake that Taiwan will
always be an unseverable part of China and that he represented the
people of Taiwan in thanking the international community for
providing assistance to the island. His remarks angered Taipei.</P>
      <P>Sen. Landrieu was surprised by Beijing's action and promised to
pay more attention to the matter in the future.</P>
      <P>ROC lawmakers will call on other heavyweights at the US Senate
and House of Representatives on Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUAKE HELPS TAIWAN PEOPLE REGAIN FORGOTTEN STRENGTH: BUDDHIST MASTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan people have recuperated their
forgotten strength and have found countless rays of kindness in the
wake of the cataclysmic earthquake that struck the island on Sept.
21, said Buddhist Master Sheng Yen on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Although the devastating quake dealt a deadly blow to the island,
which was formerly considered socially and politically chaotic, the
experience enabled Taiwan to demonstrate its true colors --
highlighting the good-heartedness of its people and its solid
resources and strong vitality, Sheng Yen said.</P>
      <P>Founder of the well-known Dhama Drum Mountain Cultural and
Educational Foundation, Sheng Yen said that after weathering the
devastating quake, people in Taiwan, particularly those in
earthquake-stricken areas, need a shot in the arm to help them repel
fear and regain peace of mind.</P>
      <P>The urgent need prompted him and his organization to print 1
million copies of "At Ease DIY" pamphlets to be distributed to people
in quake-affected areas and to others elsewhere who might benefit
from them, Sheng Yen said.</P>
      <P>He added that the pamphlets will help people with easy
do-it-yourself approaches to mental rehabilitation, allowing injured
souls to heal by themselves.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen made the donation of the 1 million pamphlets at a
ceremony at the Ministry of Education.</P>
      <P>Recognizing the Buddhist group's compassionate deed, Education
Minister Yang Chao-shiang said he would personally be a mail carrier
for Dhama Drum Mountain and deliver the pamphlets to people in
quake-stricken areas.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen said that in order to facilitate mental and spiritual
rehabilitation efforts, the Dhama Drum Mountain Foundation will train
5,000 volunteers to work with people, mainly in the quake-affected
areas, to help them become free from fear and grief, and find for
themselves their lost power and confidence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SELECTION OF CLOUD GATE TO DANCE AT OLYMPICS BIG HONOR FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  13  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The selection of the Cloud Gate Dance
Theater to perform during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney is a big
honor and encouragement for the Republic of China on Taiwan, Lin
Hwai-min, founder and head of the world-renowned company, said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency, Lin said only a few
top dance companies have been chosen to perform during the Olympic
Arts Festival from August 18 to September 30 next year. Troupes were
selected from Australia, Britain, Germany, Taiwan and the United
States.</P>
      <P>"The selection of our dance troupe to perform during the Olympic
Games is very significant and encouraging for Taiwan because it's a
top honor," he said. "This will be the first time for our company to
perform at the Olympic Games," he added.</P>
      <P>Lin said all dance companies chosen to perform during the Olympic
Games are top-notch troupes well-known all over the world. "I feel
very glad that my troupe can have the chance to perform with other
well-known dance companies in Sydney next year," he said.</P>
      <P>Other famous dance companies chosen to perform are Pina Bausch
from Germany, Bill T. Jones and Amie Zane Dance Company from the
United States, and DV8 Physical Theater from Britain. Lin said the
Cloud Gate Dance Theater is the only Asian troupe selected.</P>
      <P>He said Cloud Gate will stage nine performances, to be held
between August 19 and 22 and from August 25 to 27. The performances
will feature the company's latest productions of "Nine Songs" and
"Moon Water" at Her Majesty's Theater in Sydney.</P>
      <P>The performances will mark the Australian premiere of the two
productions, Lin said, adding, "We were well-received in Berlin in
August when we performed in front of the German audience." He
believed the two productions would receive the same reception in
Australia when the troupe makes its fourth visit to that country.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment 26 years ago, the Cloud Gate Dance
Theater has had numerous performances in the United States, Europe
and Asia, Lin said.</P>
      <P>But he said the Cloud Gate Dance Theater will grace Taipei with
its performance to greet the dawn of the new millennium. "Burning the
Pine Branches" will be performed starting at 10:20 p.m. on December
31 and ending at the very beginning of the year 2000.</P>
      <P>The company will then travel overseas to stage more performances
before continuing to Sydney in August.</P>
      <P>During its 26-year history, Lin said the troupe has trained many
dancers for Cloud Gate so that new blood can achieve a high standard
of dancing techniques in order to perform in many countries around
the world.</P>
      <P>"We will continue to move on and maintain our high standard of
performances in the years to come," he added.

    <HEADLINE>INDONESIAN MILITARY TO DISARM MILITIAS, COOPERATE WITH INTERFET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Indonesia's Defense Minister General
Wiranto has indicated that his military will disarm pro-Jakarta
militias and cooperate with the Australian-led UN peacekeeping troops
(Interfet) along the West Timorese border.</P>
      <P>Australia's Channel Nine TV Network on Wednesday morning quoted
Wiranto as saying that his troops would be cooperative with the UN
peace keepers to "avoid miscommunication and misunderstanding" along
the 250-kilometer border between East and West Timor.</P>
      <P>"My troops would like to invite Interfet for a joint patrol ...
on the border ... to avoid miscommunication, etc. that could cause
casualties and international problems," he told reporters in the
border hamlet of Motaain, the scene of a fatal clash between the
Indonesian army, militias and the Interfet in which one Indonesian
policeman was killed and two others wounded on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The network reported that the Indonesian army would disarm
militiamen in order to avoid similar incidents from happening again.</P>
      <P>In Jakarta, the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday quoted
Major-General Sudrajat, a military spokesman, as saying that
Wiranto's comments meant that hundreds of pro-Jakarta militias in
West Timor would be disarmed.</P>
      <P>"We do not want this area to become a stronghold or base for the
pro-integrationists," he said.</P>
      <P>Channel Nine also quoted an Interfet spokesman as saying that the
UN peace keepers would be very cautious in their patrol so that they
did not cross West Timor's border.</P>
      <P>In Jakarta, newly elected chairman to the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) Dr. Amien Rais told a business breakfast on Tuesday
that Indonesia's next president would lose many of the authoritarian
powers built up by former President Soeharto and would be made
accountable to the parliament once a year and could be impeached if
the circumstances justified it.</P>
      <P>"So we will hold an annual session to listen to the
accountability speech of the president. If accepted, the president
can then go ahead with his or her programs. But if we see that there
are a lot of deviations, a lot of wrong doings, a lot of corruption,
collusion and nepotism, we may vote for a special session of the
assembly to impeach the president or to call a new election," Rais
said.</P>
      <P>In Sydney, the East Timorese independence leader Xanana Gusmao
urged Timorese people not to kill in revenge despite the past
mistakes of the Indonesian army and its pro-Jakarta militias.</P>
      <P>Gusmao said he would go home next week to a new country where he
would ask his people to look forward, not back. "Of course, it will
be with sadness that I return home, because my country has been
destroyed and I remember the same destruction in 1975 when the
Indonesians invaded." he told reporters on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In Dili, however, Bishop Carlos Belo, who returned home last
week, said the Indonesian army must admit their mistake in a show of
regret for destroying East Timor and killing people.</P>
      <P>He said he would ask the United Nations to install a civilian
administration to help East Timor in nation building.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>John Chang, secretary general of the ruling
Kuomintang, on Wednesday traveled to Kinmen to assess the situation
faced by the typhoon-ravaged offshore outpost.</P>
      <P>Chang said he wants to convey the concern of KMT
Chairman and ROC President Lee Teng-hui to the people of Kinmen after
its worst disaster in the past three decades.</P>
      <P>Chang was briefed by Kinmen County Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai on
the havoc wreaked by typhoon Dan and the official's request for
assistance from the central government.</P>
      <P>Chen has asked that the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications help rebuild Liaolo Harbor, provide technicians to
repair damaged power and water lines, and use special funds to
reconstruct major infrastructure. He also requested that the
Department of Health supply disinfectant and medicine and that the
army support post-typhoon construction projects for three months.</P>
      <P>Earlier, former Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong and
Minister without Portfolio Yang Shih-chien also went to Kinmen to
inspect the damage caused by the typhoon.</P>
      <P>Though no casualties were reported during the typhoon, more than
300 houses collapsed from strong winds, and half of the island is
still without water supply.</P>
      <P>Forestry efforts over the past 30 years went down the drain
overnight, with 390,000 trees felled by powerful winds. It is
estimated that it will take at least 10 years for the lush landscape
to recover.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) has proclaimed Kinmen a disaster
area after losses in production value of agricultural products were
estimated at NT$80 million (US$2.51 million).</P>
      <P>The island's sorghum was so badly damaged that the autumn harvest
will fall 2 million kilograms short of the previous estimate. The
Kinmen County government is planning to apply for imports of red
sorghum from mainland China to make up for the shortage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO ARISE FROM QUAKE RUINS: ROC REP. IN FRANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Chow Ming-jie &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuo Wei-fan, the Republic of China's
representative in France, on Wednesday expressed the ROC government
and people's gratitude for French assistance after the Sept. 21
Taiwan earthquake that claimed more than 2,300 lives.</P>
      <P>The envoy assured his French audience that Taiwan will arise from
the ruins of the quake's aftermath.</P>
      <P>Kuo made the statements during an exclusive online live interview
with Alain Wang of the French internet enterprise Canal Web on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo, on behalf of the ROC government and people, expressed
heartfelt thanks for the humanitarian assistance rendered by French
people from all walks of life for the earthquake victims.</P>
      <P>In the same interview, Kuo explained President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of relations between the two sides of Taiwan Strait as a
"special state-to-state relationship" and stressed that Taiwan will
rise up from the quake ruins.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that after the earthquake, more than 80 countries around
the world expressed their condolences and concerns through every
means to the ROC government and people.</P>
      <P>A total of 41 rescue teams -- representing 21 countries, the
United Nations, and various religious organizations -- came to Taiwan
to help rescue survivors. France sent three rescue teams.</P>
      <P>After the earthquake, the estimate for the island's economic
growth rate, which had been projected to reach 5.74 percent for this
year, was readjusted to 5.5 percent, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has experienced both economic and political miracles in
the past five decades and will undoubtedly rise up from the quake
ruins, Kuo stressed.</P>
      <P>Kuo went on to say that a great majority of Taiwanese have
expressed their displeasure with Beijing's politicization of the
international community's assistance to quake victims.</P>
      <P>Beijing even forced an airliner carrying a Russian rescue team to
make a detour around mainland airspace, delaying its arrival in
Taiwan for many hours and thereby preventing the chance to save more
quake survivors, Kuo noted.</P>
      <P>Referring to President Lee's redefinition of cross-strait
relations as a "special state-to-state relationship," he said that
the peaceful reunification of China requires patience and time. China
should be reunited in the future under the principles of democracy,
liberty and economic equality. However, Kuo pointed out that
Beijing's refusal to renounce taking Taiwan by force is the main
obstacle to future negotiations for China's reunification.</P>
      <P>As for process of economic development, Kuo said that Taiwan has
been developing a hi-tech industry that now accounts for 40 percent
of its total exports.</P>

      <P>Deura was positive about the speedy rescue and relief work by
the government and private sector, adding that he believed the speed
and efficiency of quake rescue and relief efforts here were better
than those of Japan after the Kobe temblor.</P>
      <P>He also said that he was impressed by the repeated visits of
President Lee Teng-hui, Vice President Lien Chan and Premier Vincent
Siew to quake-stricken areas to learn about the situation and help
solve problems of the people there.</P>
      <P>Lee also signed the emergency decree soon after the killer

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Japanese military commentator said in an
article published by Sapio magazine that Japan should engage in
security cooperation with Taiwan and South Korea, while maintaining
its ally relationship with the United States as an axis.</P>
      <P>Junhiko Kawamura said mainland China's ambition to invade Taiwan
is being checked by the presence of the Seventh Fleet of the US Navy,
the Japan-US Security Treaty and Taiwan's efforts to improve its
defense capability.</P>
      <P>However, the former vice president of a Japanese military academy
noted that nobody can foretell when the present military equilibrium
might collapse, and if mainland China made a miscalculation, it might
use military force against Taiwan, forcing Japan to take
self-defensive action.</P>
      <P>In case Taiwan is attacked, Kawamura said, the US is obliged to
intervene to defend Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations
Act, and Japan could not sit idly by because to do so would be a
breach of the Japan-US Security Treaty.</P>
      <P>Because the Japan-US Security Treaty cannot be replaced at
present, he said, Japan should make the treaty a top priority and
strengthen cooperation relations with South Korea and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The commentator said that Japan is unlikely to forge direct ally
relationships with South Korea and Taiwan now because of political
realities, and the best way to enhance relations with the two
neighbors is through Japan's ally relationship with the US.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The credit rating institution Standard and
Poor's on Wednesday gave a positive rating to Taiwan and said that
its long term prospects remained "stable."</P>
      <P>The New York-based rating group gave a "AA plus" for long-term
credit ratings and an "A-1 plus" for short-term ratings on the
island.</P>
      <P>It said that the positive ratings reflect strong foreign assets
and paltry foreign debt, noting that the foreign assets of banking
institutions in Taiwan and the Central Bank of China
should outnumber the nation's foreign debts by NT$100 billion this
year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also has huge foreign reserves, ranking third in the world
next only to Japan and mainland China. It is estimated that Taiwan's
foreign reserves will top US$100 billion by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Huge foreign reserves and the island's creditor position also
helped Taiwan emerge from the recent financial storm unscathed.</P>
      <P>The rating institution also cited the strong export-oriented
economy of Taiwan, saying that Taiwan has a flexible labor force and
lively small- and medium-sized enterprises to sustain the economy and
employment growth.</P>
      <P>Though the massive Sept. 21 earthquake had a negative impact, the
outlook for Taiwan growth is still favorable.</P>
      <P>But the good ratings were constrained by the potential
vulnerability posed by cross-strait relations, saying that mainland
China's demands for unification and its sporadic military
intimidation oblige Taiwan to maintain a high degree of military
preparedness and huge defense spending.</P>
      <P>Standard and Poor's estimated that Taiwan will adopt some
measures to alleviate the impact of the earthquake in two years, but
they are not expected to erode its advantages.</P>

      <P>The age range of Taiwanese students
seeking an education in the United States has been found to be
expanding upward and downward, sources from the American Institute in
Taiwan (AIT) reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The fact that more Taiwanese people in various age groups are
seeking an education in the United States indicates that "studying in
America" is no longer exclusively the dream of fresh college
graduates from Taiwan, said Kaohsiung-based AIT officials in charge
of educational and business affairs.</P>
      <P>They noted that more Taiwanese people aged over 40 are now
seeking advanced studies in the US as the "life-time learning" trend
takes off. The number of Taiwanese children studying in the States
has also been found to be steadily increasing, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In addition to an expanded age range, the goals of Taiwanese
students and what they are studying have also become more
diversified, they said.</P>
      <P>The United States has always been the top choice of most
Taiwanese students, absorbing an average of 13,000 of them each year
in recent years, or about 49 percent of all the Taiwanese students
seeking an education overseas.</P>
      <P>In 1998, 30,855 Taiwanese went to the United States to study,
making them the fifth largest group of foreign students in that
country.</P>
      <P>Among the 3,600-odd colleges and universities in the United
States, the University of Southern California has been the most
popular school for Taiwanese students, attracting 726 of them to
enroll last year, according to the AIT officials.</P>
      <P>An American education exposition week is scheduled to kick off in
the southern port city of Kaohsiung on Sunday with over 50
educational institutes from the United States participating.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULDN'T TRY INFLUENCING TAIWAN QUESTION SAYS EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 13 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should not be trying
to influence the outcome of the Taiwan question and should not
express an opinion as to whether reunification is the right answer
for mainland China and Taiwan, said a renowned American China
specialist Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ross Terrill, a research associate at the Fairbank Center for
East Asian Studies at Harvard University, told the "Voice of America"
radio station that the Taiwan question is "no longer just a matter of
finishing the Chinese civil war by reuniting the country."</P>
      <P>The transfer of Taiwan to the People's Republic of China today
would change the balance of power in Asia -- something that would not
have happened in 1949, stressed Terrill. He agrees with those who say
Beijing's desire for reunification with Taiwan now "is a matter of
strategic interest, not purely an emotional desire to reunify the
motherland."</P>
      <P>Therefore, the China expert pointed out, the United States should
not be trying to influence the outcome of the Taiwan question. "Our
role is not to solve the Taiwan problem, but to prevent it from being
solved in the wrong way and to prevent it from being interpreted in
the wrong way," said Terrill.</P>
      <P>VOA reported that the US Congress is considering legislation that
would upgrade the American military relationship with Taiwan and such
an action would be sure to anger Communist China, which is
considering changes in its own approach to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But China expert Stephen Yates said the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act being considered by Congress is not intended to
change US policy. The pending bill "would provide a more specific
interpretation of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act," said the senior
policy analyst at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation.</P>
      <P>"It calls for an increase in contact between the Taiwan military
and the US military, not for the purposes of creating an alliance,
but for the purpose of delivering on the intent, or at least the
understood intent, of the Taiwan Relations Act -- to help Taiwan be
capable of defending itself," added Yates.</P>
      <P>Yates said the bill is designed to ensure Taiwan has access to
high technology weaponry, on which he believes Taiwan is going to
have to rely more than conventional forces to defend itself. And this
may mean that the United States could stay on the sidelines and not
be directly involved in defending Taiwan, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>"The United States intent is not to interpose itself between
Taiwan and the mainland. And it's not necessarily sending a political
signal to Taiwan by considering this legislation, but for our own
interests finds these moves to be necessary," stressed the senior
policy analyst.</P>
      <P>However, Hong Kong journalist Willy Wo-Lap Lam cautioned the
United States against upgrading the level of weapons it sells to
Taiwan. Beijing has said it will not tolerate the US sale to Taiwan
of high technology related to a theater missile defense, and it would
hurt PRC-US relations and could spark another round of anti-American
protests in Beijing and Shanghai, said the China editor of the South
China Morning Post.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE THREATS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE SAYS EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  13  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The more Beijing tries to intimidate
Taiwan, the more "likely the result would be to kill any desire among
Taiwan's people for reunification," said American China specialist
Stephen Yates on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yates, a senior policy analyst at the Washington-based Heritage
Foundation told the "Voice of America" radio station that Communist
China is making a mistake if it tries to take even limited military
action against Taiwan, because every military scenario that Beijing
might be contemplating is likely to be counterproductive. He said he
hopes Communist China would instead focus on sending more favorable
signals to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>VOA reported that as Taiwan's presidential elections approach in
March of next year, the government in Beijing is watching closely
and, some observers believe, preparing for a possible limited
military action against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The radio station quoted Hong Kong journalist Willy Wo-Lap Lam as
saying that Communist China's top leaders were making preparations
for some kind of military action as a way to punish Taiwan President
Lee Teng-hui for saying in July that mainland China and Taiwan should
treat each other as equal states.</P>
      <P>"It would be along the lines of the 1979 so-called punitive
expedition against Vietnam, which means that if they were to do it
this time against Taiwan, they would just go in for a few days, take
over one or two outlying islands -- for example Quemoy or Matsu --
and then there would be no long-term occupation. They would just be
there for a few days. As a result, the Taiwan economy would collapse,
they would teach Lee Teng-hui a lesson, and then afterwards
withdraw," said Lam.</P>
      <P>The Chinese editor of the South China Morning Post and a former
corespondent in Beijing noted that Communist Chinese army leaders
were convinced that such a limited action would not draw in US forces
in defense of Taiwan, but mainland China's top leaders could not
agree on what action to take and at what time during their annual
meeting at the seaside resort of Beidaihe in August.</P>
      <P>So, Lam said, they decided to wait until after Taiwan's
presidential elections in March, when they will have a better sense
of what policy the next Taiwan leader will adopt. If the new
president distances himself from Lee Teng-hui's so-called "two
states" statement, the Communist Chinese army may drop its plan for a
punitive strike against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he pointed out, President Jiang Zemin has
instructed military officials to continue their preparations for war
and make sure that they are totally prepared and have total
confidence in winning the war against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Lam said the recent devastating earthquake in Taiwan gave
authorities in Beijing another reason to delay military action. In
his words, it would not look good for Communist China to stage
provocative war games when the world is seeing such a natural
disaster in Taiwan.</P>

(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The winner of this year's Nobel Prize for
economics, Canadian Robert Mundell, was one of the inspirations
behind the creation of the single European currency, the euro.</P>
      <P>Although Mundell didn't participate directly in its planning, he
did develop one of the first plans for a European common currency.
His work was hailed by economists as groundbreaking.</P>
      <P>His theories clarified how exchange rates fluctuate when a
government shifts from a flexible to a fixed monetary policy. The
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Mundell's most important work
was done in the 1960s.</P>
      <P>Mundell told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.'s Newsworld that he
concentrated on examples within the Canadian economy. The issue of
whether the Canadian dollar should have a fixed or flexible exchange
rate against the US dollar led him to believe that more than one
country could be optimum for a single currency because different
areas have different economic cycles.</P>
      <P>Mundell said he was pleased and surprised by the announcement. He
heard the news second-hand from his son in Los Angeles on Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA OFFICIALS MUM OVER PNG FOREIGN MINISTER'S BEIJING VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
officials on Thursday declined to comment on remarks made by Papua
New Guinea (PNG) Foreign Minister Michael Somare in Beijing Wednesday
concerning Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Reports said that during a meeting with mainland Chinese Vice
President Hu Jintao, Somare reiterated PNG's "one China policy" and
declared that his country "will not develop official relations with
Taiwan." Somare, who arrived in Beijing on Oct. 11, has also met with
mainland Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jaixuan.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said they are closely monitoring the Beijing visit
by Somare, the highest-ranking PNG official to visit mainland China
since the Republic of China and PNG established formal diplomatic
relations on July 5.</P>
      <P>Controversy been brewing ever since the forging of the diplomatic
ties as Beijing continues trying to bring PNG under its fold in an
obvious attempt to further alienate the South Pacific nation from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials declined to speculate on how the ambiguous
Taipei-PNG-Beijing relations will develop, but they are certain that
Beijing will continue attempting to lure PNG away from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Former PNG Prime Minister Bill Skate and Foreign Minister Roy
Yaki struck an agreement with ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu on July 5
in Taipei for the establishment of formal diplomatic ties between the
two countries.</P>
      <P>Skate resigned from office two days later, casting a shroud over
the already volatile diplomatic situation.</P>
      <P>Astounded by Skate's move, ROC Foreign Minister Jason Hu,
regarded as the driving force behind the deal, told a local
television station that Taipei has "nothing to lose" even if the new
PNG government spurns the ROC.</P>
      <P>On July 7, ROC government spokesman Chen Chien-jen said the
Taiwan-PNG ties "never involved monetary aid or loans."</P>
      <P>Despelling rumors that Taiwan bought the new ties at a cost of
US$2.5 billion, Chen stressed that Taiwan "will not, is unwilling to,
and cannot afford" such a massive amount of cash aid to PNG, stating
that MOFA has an annual budget of only US$1 billion.</P>
      <P>PNG, which maintains formal diplomatic ties with mainland China,
was following a "dual recognition" formula when it struck the
diplomatic deal with Taiwan. The ROC and PNG signed an accord in 1995
for "mutual recognition," a step short of formal diplomatic relations
between the two countries.</P>

      <P>An alliance of legislators, scholars and

      <P>The Post-Earthquake Public Reconstruction Projects Supervisory

      <P>Lee said the alliance is not confident of the integrity of
relevant officials in the central and local governments in terms of
quality and safety of public construction, citing the fact that the
number of public structures, including public-run hospitals and
schools, ruined or damaged by the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake was
much larger than that of private buildings and structures.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLAR PAINTS GLOOMY PICTURE OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The possibility of seeing a dramatic
breakthrough in relations across the Taiwan Strait is slim,
predicted a Taiwan-born scholar in the United States recently.</P>
      <P>Kao Ying-mao, a political science professor at Brown University,
made the forecast in a recent interview with a French radio station.</P>
      <P>Kao said cross-strait dialogue is unlikely to resume in the near
future as the chance of top mainland Chinese envoy Wang Daohan making
an unprecedented visit to Taiwan either in October or November is
thin, if not nil.</P>
      <P>The two sides tentatively agreed earlier this year that Wang,
president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), would visit Taiwan either in mid-September or
in mid-October.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing broke the promise after Republic of China
President Lee Teng-hui said in an interview with a German radio
station in July that cross-strait relations should be defined as a
"special state-to-state relationship."</P>
      <P>Lee's statement drew furious reaction from Beijing which
interpreted the declaration as a move to promote Taiwan independence.
Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin then set two preconditions
for Wang's long-talked-about Taiwan visit -- the top Taiwan leader
publicly retracts the "special state-to-state relationship" theory
and receives Wang only in his capacity as chairman of Taiwan's ruling
Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is unlikely to accept Jiang's preconditions,
Kao said Beijing apparently has shut the door for resumption of
cross-strait high-level contact or dialogue.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former Shanghai mayor and mentor to Jiang, promised to
make a reciprocal visit to Taiwan this year when he met his Taiwan
counterpart Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), in Shanghai last October.</P>
      <P>Kao said Wang's Taiwan visit could serve as the first step for
resumption of cross-strait dialogue. "The shelving of Wang's travel
plan has dampened hopes for improving cross-strait relations in
the near future," he noted.</P>
      <P>Kao went on to say that no matter who wins in the ROC's
presidential election scheduled for March 2000, he will find it
difficult to retreat from the "special state-to-state" stance as the
majority of Taiwan people support the definition.</P>
      <P>"Most ROC citizens think that the 'special state-to-state'
statement just affirms a long-existing reality and does not rule out
the possibility of eventual unification of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait," Kao said, adding that many Taiwan people believe if
the ROC wants to survive in the international community and ensure
parity in negotiations with mainland China, it must insist on the
"special state-to-state" principle.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Kao said he sees little possibility
that any future ROC president would retract the theory.</P>
      <P>As for long-term cross-strait relationship, Kao said the status
quo will continue at least for another 10 years. "From the
viewpoints of internal developments on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait and of the general international situation, I don't expect any
dramatic changes or breakthroughs in cross-strait ties over the next
decade," he said.</P>
      <P>In mainland China, Kao said, while its political system may
change and economic reforms may increase, its overall evolution in
the years ahead will remain slow. "As to Taiwan, as most people want
peace and stability, no Taiwan politician would make any dramatic
compromise with the mainland."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Kao said, as the United States is firm on its
security commitment to Taiwan, the possibility of mainland China
using military force against Taiwan is slim.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Kao predicted that cross-strait relations
would basically remain almost the same in the coming decade. "My
observation is that cross-strait economic and cultural exchanges may
increase in the years ahead, but no major progress could be seen in
the political field," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPOREAN TRADE REPRESENTATIVE TOUCHED BY TAIWANESE GENEROSITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>For the Lin family of Dali, a township on
the outskirts of Taichung City, the best way to express their
gratitude was to provide the best accommodations they could offer for
the rescuers from afar who had dedicated their expertise and efforts
to saving Taiwanese people trapped by the killer earthquake.</P>
      <P>The Lin family's hospitality was reported in Singaporean
newspapers, which have provided insight into the genuine friendship
established between the Singaporean rescuers and an ordinary family
in earthquake-devastated central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Much has been said by Taiwan's media regarding the bravery of
foreign rescue teams in the wake of the devastating earthquake; less
coverage was provided on the generosity of Taiwan's public towards
the rescuers from afar." Singaporean Trade Representative to Taipei
Joseph K.H. Koh told a CNA reporter that before their departure the
Singaporean rescuers particularly mentioned the hospitality and
genuine friendship they had found in addition to the sorrow they
shared with the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Singapore Civil Defense Force's Disaster Assistance and Rescue
Team was the first foreign group to arrive in Taiwan after the
disaster to help with rescue operations. The 39-member group was
composed of rescuers and medical personnel.</P>
      <P>Upon their arrival on Sept. 21, the rescuers started their
round-the-clock work in Dali. Considering that the accommodations
arranged for them in Taichung were much too far away from the rescue
site, the Singaporeans were ready to camp nearby.</P>
      <P>The residents of Dali would never allow these helpers to sleep
under the open sky. On the other hand, it was not easy to find
suitable accommodation in the neighboring area. Having heard of the
situation, the Lins, a large family owning a string of housing units
in Dali, decided to offer empty housing units to accommodate the
Singaporeans, including reporters from the Straits Times and the
Chinese-language daily Lianhe Zaobao.</P>
      <P>During the week-long stay with the Lins, the Singaporeans were
very impressed that the Lins not only tried hard to prepare hot meals
and daily necessities for them, but also arranged telecommunications
and other services to meet their various requirements. The family
also refused to accept any payment from their "honored guests."</P>
      <P>These seemingly trivial gestures were the best way the Lin family
could express the deepest gratitude of the Taiwanese people, and it
was greatly appreciated by the Singaporeans, according to Koh.</P>
      <P>The trade representative said he met members of the Lin family at
a farewell party for the Singaporeans at the airport on Oct. 3.
Extending his appreciation, Koh presented the Lins with a framed
newspaper clipping of a brief report and photo of the Lin family and
their guests.</P>
      <P>Koh said that the Singaporean rescuers described their stay in
Taiwan as a "very emotional experience." They pointed out that the
rescue operations were well-coordinated with the participation of
Taiwanese as well as foreign teams. It was actually a harmonious team
spirit that had made any contribution by the Singaporean team
possible, he added.</P>
      <P>Weeks after the earthquake disaster, rescue work has come to a
close and all foreign helpers have departed for home. Taiwan will
remember the warm embrace of the world when it was in urgent need of
help.</P>
      <P>The Singaporean representative said that he himself was deeply
touched by the many nameless heroes participating in rescue
operations and by the friendly gestures of the Taiwanese people as
well as their persistence. He was pleased that people in Singapore
were able to learn of the demonstration of humanism through the media
report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DRAM MAKERS IN DISADVANTAGEOUS POSITION: BOFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese makers of dynamic random-access
memory (DRAM) chips were thrust into a disadvantageous position after
the US government made a determination Wednesday to hike the proposed
import tariffs on Taiwan businesses accused of dumping, said an
economics official on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Director-General Chen Ruey-long of the Board of Foreign Trade
(BOFT) said, however, that the manufacturers, accused of dumping
DRAMs in the United States at prices below fair market value, could
appeal to the US International Trade Commission (ITC) for reduction
of the punitive import taxation.</P>
      <P>The US Department of Commerce (DOC) announced the determination,
in which it reconfirmed dumping by several Taiwanese companies and
accordingly raised punitive tariffs on Mosel Vitelic to 35.58 percent
from the 30.89 percent suggested in its initial ruling in late May.</P>
      <P>Nan Ya Technology faced an import-duty hike from 9.03 percent to
14.18 percent, and Etron Technology from 4.96 percent to 69 percent.</P>
      <P>Only Vanguard International Semiconductor's duty was reduced,
from 10.36 percent to 8.21 percent, while nine other Taiwanese
microchip producers -- including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing,
Winbond Electronics and United Microelectronics -- were slapped with
higher weighted-average duties of 21.35 percent, up from the initial
16.41 percent, according to the DOC's report.</P>
      <P>The United States has been one of Taiwan's major buyers of DRAMs,
importing chips worth US$279 million last year, accounting for 36
percent of the island's total DRAM exports in 1998, Chen said.</P>
      <P>To reduce the impact, Chen suggested local companies take
measures to enhance their cooperation with foreign counterparts,
while appealing and seeking Washington's through review of the case
through both juridical and administrative channels in the United
States.</P>
      <P>Under US anti-dumping legislation, after the DOC makes its
determination on a case submitted by the ITC, the case goes back to
the ITC for a final ruling. The ITC has scheduled the ultimate
hearing for Oct. 19 and will make its final injury determination no
later than Nov. 26.</P>
      <P>If the ITC ultimately determines that the companies were at
fault, the DOC can issue anti-dumping orders within seven days after
the final ITC ruling. Such orders would include notifying customs
authorities to transfer deposits out of temporary holding accounts.
Those deposits had to be paid by the involved Taiwanese DRAM makers
for their continued imports to the United States -- a requirement
following the DOC's initial ruling against the companies in May, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The dumping charge against Taiwan chip makers was filed last
October by Idaho-based Micron Technology Inc., the largest US
computer chip maker, with an output that accounts for some 50 percent
of total annual US DRAM production.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, representatives of more than 80 local manufacturers in
the semiconductor, textile, and steel and metals sectors participated
in a meeting hosted by BOFT to forge strategies against the United
States' anti-dumping move.</P>
      <P>Several DOC officials were also invited to attend the meeting to
explain US anti-dumping laws and regulations, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Over the past several years, the aforementioned sectors have
often faced accusations by US businesses of pouring products into the
United States at below-market prices.</P>

      <P>A delegation from the Republic of China
took part in the 26th International Small Business Congress (ISBC)
which opened Wednesday in Toronto, Canada.</P>
      <P>More than 950 delegates from more than 60 countries are attending
the three-day gathering.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony was presided over by Canada's minister of
industry, who urged leaders of small businesses worldwide to play a
more positive role over next five years, when the Internet is certain
to exert a more powerful impact on the global economy.</P>
      <P>The 25-member delegation from Taiwan was led by Dai Sheng-tung,
chairman of the ROC's Small and Medium Enterprises Association. The
annual ISBC gathering has been held twice in Taipei -- the 12th
meeting and the 24th, which took place two years ago.</P>
      <P>The Steering Committee of the ISBC held an election Tuesday, in
which some of its commissioners were re-elected. John C.I. Ni,
director-general of the Medium and Small Business Administration
under the ROC's Ministry of Economic Affairs, was elected to replace
Liu Chin-cheng, who has retired.</P>
      <P>Ni and Lu Fang-yeou, another delegate from Taiwan, presided over
panel discussions on human resources and on experiences in founding
businesses, respectively, as part of Wednesday's program.</P>
      <P>"Small business -- smart business" is the main theme of the
current ISBC forum, for which Taiwan has much to offer and share in
terms of its dexterity and wisdom in running and operating small
businesses.</P>
      <P>ISBC Chairman John Bullock had high regards for Taiwan's
participation.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the ROC delegation took the chance to express
its deep appreciation for the assistance and concern shown by the
international community after the devastating earthquake that struck
the island last month.</P>
      <P>The delegates from Taiwan also sought exchanges with their
counterparts from the Netherlands, Poland and the host country in
order to enhance bilateral cooperation, trade, and even the
possibility of investment, moves which received responses of

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of Taipei residents
responding to a recent survey said they often feel depressed in their
everyday life.</P>
      <P>The survey of 2,000 adult residents in the greater Taipei area,
comprising both Taipei City and Taipei County, was conducted by the
John Tung Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to
promoting public health.</P>
      <P>Survey results showed that 53 percent of respondents said they
often feel depressed.</P>
      <P>The percentage of adolescents who often feel depressed was even
higher, reaching 80 percent, according to the results of a similar
poll conducted by the foundation in early September. The survey was
administered to 2,000-plus senior high school and vocational school
students.</P>
      <P>The surveys found that those who make less than NT$40,000
(US$1,257.87) a month and do not have any religious beliefs are more
vulnerable to depression.</P>
      <P>Survey results also showed that teenagers who sleep less than
seven hours a day and have lackluster academic records feel depressed
more easily.</P>
      <P>According to the polls, major causes of depression included
setbacks in human relations, a sense of uncertainty about life, and
job frustrations.</P>
      <P>The two polls were conducted before the devastating Sept. 21
earthquake, which claimed more than 2,300 lives islandwide and left
tens of thousands homeless. The foundation said the number of people
troubled by depression will surely increase after the 921 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Quoting poll results, the foundation said marital status,
economic level, religious beliefs and living habits are all closely
related to respondents' feelings about life.</P>
      <P>The percentage of people who often feel depressed is higher among
unmarried respondents than among married ones; people with religious
beliefs are less likely to feel depressed than those without such
beliefs; and those with monthly income of less than NT$40,000 are
more apt to feel blue.</P>
      <P>The polls also found that those who get up late are more prone to
feel depressed.</P>
      <P>Poll results further indicated that adolescents who engage in
exercise other than physical education classes are less likely to
suffer from depression.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Far East Air Transport Corp. (FAT) will
formally open a new route between Taipei to Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia,
from Oct. 21, the board chairman of FAT said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-Kota Kinabalu route is the third FAT international
route after the Taipei-Palau and Taipei-Subic Bay routes.</P>
      <P>Kota Kinabalu is the capital of the Malaysian state of Sabah,
with a population of 300,000.</P>
      <P>Lee Yun-ning, board chairman of FAT, said the opening of
international flight routes in the Asia-Pacific region has been a
goal of the airline in recent years, with the hope of providing
nationals with much better travel service.</P>
      <P>Kota Kinabalu was once destroyed in World War II. The rebuilt
city includes many tourist resorts.</P>
      <P>From Oct. 21, FAT will fly the Taipei-Kota Kinabalu route on
Mondays and Thursdays. Flights will depart Taipei at 10:30 a.m. and
arrive in Kota Kinabalu at 1:45 p.m.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Airport police on Thursday announced the
arrest of two women for allegedly importing unlicensed
pharmaceuticals into Taiwan from Thailand, including weight-loss
pills laced with contraband amphetamine.</P>
      <P>The police bureau at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport
also confiscated more than 700,000 Thai-made diet pills,
contraception pills, flu capsules, painkillers and other
pharmaceuticals.</P>
      <P>Although all those drugs are legally marketed in Thailand, none
of them has been licensed by the Republic of China's
Cabinet-level Department of Health. Moreover, four kinds of
weight-loss pills contain amphetamine.</P>
      <P>The two suspects, identified as Wu A-chiao, 41, and her
younger sister Wu Ni-chin, 36, have been transferred to the
Taoyuan Prosecutor's Office on charges of violating the ROC's
pharmaceutical law.</P>
      <P>Police said as a large number of Thai nationals are working in
Taiwan, the market demand for Thai drugs is enormous here. Many
local groceries specializing in selling Thai articles also sell
pharmaceuticals from Thailand. However, most drugs sold at those
shops were illegally imported.</P>
      <P>Police first uncovered more than 400,000 contraband weight-loss
pills at CKS Airport's luggage claim division and bonded warehouse on
June 21 and again discovered 300,000-plus other unlicensed Thai
drugs in private houses in Taoyuan County and Keelung City on Aug.
20.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations showed that the two arrested suspects had
hidden a large portion of those drugs in their luggage and
deposited only a small portion at the airport's bonded warehouse
for claiming after taxation.</P>
      <P>Police said the two suspects might have used similar ways to
import Thai drugs for distribution to local wholesalers in the past.</P>
      <P>Police said as Thai-made weight-loss pills contain amphetamine,
they are harmful to human health, adding that local consumers should
not take any drugs other than those prescribed by qualified medical
doctors.</P>

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui inspected the
Central Weather Bureau on Thursday and recommended that local
enterprises move their factories to the eastern part of the island
after he was briefed on the earthquake situation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Chinese head of state visited the Central Weather Bureau in
the company of Huang Kuen-hui, secretary general to the Presidential
Office, and Minister of Transportation and Communications Lin
Feng-cheng on Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Hsin-liang, director of the Central Weather Bureau, briefed
Lee on the bureau's work and programs. Hsieh said the bureau located
the epicenter and scale of the 921 Earthquake within three minutes
and released news of the quake within five minutes. The bureau's
report was issued more quickly than those of the United States and
Japan. Seismologists released reports 30 minutes after the 1989
Northridge, California, earthquake and one hour after the 1995 Kobe
quake, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Lee inquired about the epicenter of the 921 Earthquake, which the
bureau placed at 12 kilometers west of Sun Moon Lake in central
Taiwan. Hsin Tzai-chin, deputy director of the bureau, replied that
the temblor's range was very vast and that the earth's surface broke
not at a single point but in a long line. Chichi was the first
breaking point.</P>
      <P>Lee suggested that the bureau propagate more correct concepts
about the earthquake. Although temblor frequency in the eastern part
of Taiwan has been greater than that of the western part, quake
epicenters have usually been located at sea, without much effect on
buildings on the island.</P>
      <P>Local enterprises operating in the western part of Taiwan could
move their plants to the eastern part of the island, Lee suggested.</P>

    <DATELINE>Manila,  Oct. 14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippines and the ROC on Taiwan have
no choice but to renegotiate their abrogated air agreement, since
they will both benefit from a compromise, Foreign Affairs Secretary
Domingio Siazon Jr. said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"For sure there will be negotiations again. But of course, both
parties will have to abide by whatever aviation pact will be
drafted," Siazon said, adding that the Philippines had to terminate
the Philippine-Taiwan air agreement due to violations by China
Airlines and EVA Airways.</P>
      <P>"But we should compromise -- there is no way we can allow the
airlines of both countries to bleed. I think it's better to have a
3,000- or 4,000-seat capacity entitlement than zero," Siazon said.</P>
      <P>Philippine authorities offered Taiwan a 3,000-seat capacity
entitlement, but it refused to accept that amount and insisted that
it be given 6,500 seats. Philippine Airlines (PAL) said there were
not enough passengers to fill the seats requested by Taiwan, due to a
decline in Taiwanese tourists visiting the country.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Assistant Secretary Franklin Ebdalin said Taiwan
had not yet hinted any desire to renegotiate.</P>
      <P>Ebdalin stressed that the Philippine aviation officials were
ready to sit down and talk anew, but only if Taiwanese carriers would
agree to the terms and conditions of PAL, the Civil Aeronautics Board
and the Manila Economic and Cultural Office.</P>
      <P>The Philippine-Taiwan air pact was terminated by the Philippines
on Sept. 30, apparently to save the ailing PAL.

      <P>Koo made the remarks while reviewing the development of
cross-Taiwan Strait relations in the past 12 months after his visit
to the mainland.</P>
      <P>The top negotiator for Taiwan, who visited mainland China Oct.

to visit Taipei this fall.</P>
      <P>If it is difficult for Wang to come, Koo said, he wants to visit
the mainland again to invite him.</P>
      <P>Wang was originally scheduled to visit Taipei this month to
reciprocate Koo's mainland visit, but this plan has been shelved
since Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui redefined cross-strait
relations as a "special state-to-state relationship" in early July.</P>
      <P>Beijing leaders insisted that unless Lee retracted his "special
state-to-state relationship" statement, cross-strait exchanges,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan still sincerely hopes that top
Beijing negotiator Wang Daohan will visit Taiwan, Chang Jung-kung,
director of the Kuomintang's Department of Mainland Research, said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The sincerity of Taiwan has not decreased but increased, Chang
said.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan visit by Wang as soon as possible will help improve
Taiwan people's perception of Beijing, Chang said, adding that
mainland China President Jiang Zemin's recent statement of two
preconditions for Wang's visit was too severe and that the statement
would only create obstacles to meetings between Wang and Koo Chen-fu,
his Taipei counterpart.</P>
      <P>Chang made the statements Thursday while commemorating the first
anniversary of the Koo-Wang meeting in Shanghai, for which he served
as vice spokesman for the Taipei delegation.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Wang's visit would help relieve the Taiwan
people's mood of displeasure toward Beijing after it tried to bully
Taiwan in the wake of island's biggest earthquake of the century on
Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>He hoped that Beijing would grab this golden opportunity.</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say Jiang recently said that Taiwan should
revoke President Lee's "special state-to-state relationship" theory,
and that Lee should receive Wang in his capacity as Kuomintang
chairman, as two preconditions for Wang's Taiwan visit. These
preconditions are not only too severe but also create obstacles to
future Koo-Wang meetings, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>It was understood that Beijing could not accept Taipei's "special
state-to-state relationship" theory and Taipei could not accept
Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula. Both mainland China and
Taiwan should minimize the differences by means of wisdom and
negotiation, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Referring to the differences between Taiwan and mainland China on
the "one China" issue, Chang said that interpretations of "one
China" by each side were agreed upon in 1992 and still exist today,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Exchanges relating to non-political issues have been conducted
across the strait based on each side's interpretation of "one China"
since then, Chang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AMD PLEDGES US$ 1 MILLION TO HELP TAIWAN QUAKE RECONSTRUCTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,    Oct.    14    (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Silicon Valley-based
company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on Thursday pledged to donate
US$1 million to Taiwan to help finance post-earthquake rehabilitation
efforts, industrial sources from the west coast reported.</P>
      <P>The AMD donation so far is the largest cash donation by any
single company in the United States to Taiwan's cause.</P>
      <P>A check for the first US$500,000 has already been sent to the
"Silicon Valley Alliance for Taiwan Earthquake Relief," a charitable
organization established recently in the science and technology heart
of the United States, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>AMD maintains close links with semiconductor companies in the
Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park -- Taiwan's version of Silicon
Valley, located in the northern county of Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>Since the cataclysmic magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck Taiwan on
Sept. 21, firms in the Silicon Valley have expressed a high-degree of
concern by providing much assistance for the victims -- a fact
reflecting a common sense of community involvement shared by the
hi-tech corridors in the two countries, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Before AMD made the donation announcement on Thursday, a great
number of Silicon Valley-based companies, including IBM, Intel, Sisco
and AT&amp;T, vowed to contribute to the cause of helping the Taiwanese
people in the earthquake-stricken areas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Connecticut-based United Technology Corp. also
donated US$50,000 on Thursday to Taiwan to help bolster Taiwan's
post-earthquake rehabilitation efforts.</P>
      <P>Louis Chenevert, president of Pratt &amp; Whitney, one of the
offshoots of United Technology, said staff members of the
conglomerate are expected to make more cash donations in a
fund-raising drive scheduled for Oct. 18 to Nov. 19.</P>
      <P>The United Technology management will then make an additional
donation equivalent to the sum raised by the staff in order to
further beef up the donation for Taiwan's cause, said Chenevert.</P>
      <P>At a simple ceremony marking the initial donation, Chenevert said
the donations are meant to express United Technology's concern and
support for the Taiwanese people who are striving to rebuild their
homeland in the wake of the devastating earthquake that left 2,300
dead, 8,700 injured and 100,000 homeless.</P>
      <P>Chenevert added that United Technology is an active enterprise
and a partner of the world community. "Our staff is always there to
offer support when people are in need," he said.</P>
      <P>In addition to a wide range of high-technology products, United
Technology also provides services in construction systems and the
aerospace industry, with products ranging from HP aircraft engines
and Carrier air conditioning systems, to Otis elevators and Sikorsky
aircraft.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JIANG SAID TO BE GROOMING NEXT GENERATION OF LEADERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong, Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Ken Su)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Ze-min
has formed a top-level personnel committee to look at the issue of
"cross-millennium" succession, the South China Morning Post reported
today.</P>
      <P>The report quoted a party source as saying that the committee
consisted of only three people- Jiang Ze-min, Vice-President Hu
Jin-tao and alternate member of the Politburo Zeng Zing-hong.</P>
      <P>"Next year, Jiang Ze-min will devote much of his time to issues
of personnel and party construction," said the source.</P>
      <P>The report quoted other sources as saying that Jiang was grooming
proteges including Zeng zing-hong, Vice-Premier Wu Bang-guo and the
party secretaries of Guangdong, Shandong and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>For the three regional party bosses to be considered for the
Politburo standing committee, Jiang will have to transfer them to a
senior position in the capital well before the 16th Party Congress.</P>
      <P>The political fortunes of cadres not included in the selection
process are set to decline. The report quoted diplomatic sources as
saying that given the relative eclipse of Premier Zhu Ron-ji since
April, it was not surprising that he was not made a member of the
high-level personnel committee.</P>
      <P>The promotion prospects of Zhu's proteges, such as State
councilor Wu Yi, are also deemed dismal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAY AREA RED CROSS TO DONATE NEARLY ONE MILLION TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>

(By Neil Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Red Cross announced on
Thursday that a delegation of Bay Area staff members will deliver
nearly $1 million in earthquake relief aid to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The presence of the Bay Area chapter of the American Cross in
Taiwan carrying $1 million in donations will refute Mainland China's
claim that all Red Cross' assistance to Taiwan must be transferred
through the Mainland Chinese Red Cross.</P>
      <P>"The community's response, support and compassion has been
overwhelming," said Harold Brooks, Red Cross Bay Area Chapter chief
executive officer. "There is a great concern for the well-being of
the victims of this earthquake in the Bay Area."</P>
      <P>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in San Francisco has
arranged the trip. Members of the Bay Area Chapter will meet with
their Taiwanese Red Cross counterparts to determine how they can

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SIMULATES LONG-RANGE MISSILE LAUNCH: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong   Kong,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Ken Su)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China has successfully
completed laboratory simulations of a launch of its latest
multi-warhead intercontinental ballistic missile which can reach
targets in most parts of the United States, the Hong Kong standard
reported today.</P>
      <P>Computer simulations of launches of the solid-fueled Dongfeng-41
ICBM have been completed and proven to be successful, the report
quoted a mainland source as saying.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the three-stage DF-41, an improved model
of the older single-head DF- 5, can carry five to eight nuclear
warheads, greatly increasing its striking capacity.</P>
      <P>In addition to the increase in carrying capacity, the DF-41 has
much greater mobility because it uses solidified fuel.</P>
      <P>With the same 12,000 km range of the DF-5, the DF-41 can reach
Europe and many parts of the United States.</P>
      <P>The report quoted military and diplomatic sources as saying that
the acquisition of technology to manufacture missiles capable of
reaching most parts of American territory will force Washington to
adjust its defense strategy and speed up the development of
anti-missile defense systems.</P>
      <P>The new missile could be deployed in five years if the
central leadership decides to go ahead with the program, using the
DF-41 to replace the older DF-5 model, the report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian scientists have excavated the
rock-encased fossilized skull of a 112 million-year-old plesiosaur --
a five-meter long reptile that hunted in a giant inland sea on the
super continent of Gondwana, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on
Friday.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that scientists, until now, had excavated all
but the head of the plesiosaur -- similar to the mythical Loch Ness
monster -- from beside a river in the Gulf of Carpentaria.</P>
      <P>They said about 20 plesiosaur skeletons had been previously found
in Australia and it is thought that at least three different species
of the predators once inhabited the region now known as the Great
Artesian Basin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUAKE SHOWS TAIWAN NOT ALONE SAYS US REP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The silver lining to the latest
earthquake tragedy in Taiwan is that "it proves Taiwan is not alone
in the world. Taiwan has many friends here and around the world who
stand willing and ready to help," said US Rep. Lindsey Graham on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The congressman, speaking on the floor of the House of
Representatives, congratulated Taiwan on its National Day, which fell
on Oct. 10, extended his condolences to the people of Taiwan who lost
loved ones during the earthquakes, and prayed that Taiwan would soon
return to normalcy.</P>
      <P>The ROC government has been trying its very best to help all the
victims and their families with financial and psychological
assistance whenever and wherever it is needed, said Graham, adding
that he was pleased that they have received so much assistance from
around the world.</P>
      <P>The South Carolina Republican noted that the people of the United
States have been very generous with their donations of time and
materials in an effort to help Taiwan cope with the devastation
caused by the earthquake. "We hope that Taiwan will have fully
recovered in time to celebrate their next National day," he said.</P>
      <P>Rep. Solomon P. Ortiz also spoke on the House floor Wednesday to
convey his best wishes to the people of Taiwan, congratulating them
for their successes in the past and extending his sympathies to all
the earthquake victims and their families on the occasion of the ROC
National Day.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a model of success in Asia. Through hard work and
ingenuity, Taiwan has emerged as one of the strongest economies on
the Pacific Rim and is a showcase democracy in the world. The
accomplishments of Taiwan, whether economic or political, are truly
impressive," said the Texas Democrat.</P>
      <P>Despite the recent earthquake which severely damaged Taiwan's
economy and infrastructure, Rep. Ortiz said "I am confident that
Taiwan's future successes will remain impressive."</P>

    <HEADLINE>WASHINGTON, BEIJING STILL CANNOT REACH ACCORD ON BEIJING'S WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  14  (CNA)
(By Jennifer Huang and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington and Beijing still have not
reached a concrete agreement on mainland China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO), said US Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Albright made the remark during a speech at the annual meeting of
the Conference Board, a US think tank, held at the New York Palace
Restaurant in midtown New York City.</P>
      <P>Washington and Beijing failed to reach a concrete agreement on
mainland China's entry into the WTO mainly because both sides still
cannot reach a consensus on some important business issues, Albright
said.</P>
      <P>She said leading mainland China to become a member of the world
trade regulatory body is not only an important economic affair, but
also will result in the introduction of democracy, open market
economy, legal standard and peace into mainland China, thus making
members of the whole of the international community get along more
closely.</P>
      <P>She called on economists and heads of large-scale enterprises
participating in the meeting to urge the US Congress to offer
mainland China normal trade relations status.</P>
      <P>Albright told some 100 audience members that Washington is well
prepared for the WTO's ministerial-level meetings slated to be held
from late November through early December.</P>
      <P>She has actively pushed for cooperation between the US and other
WTO member economies in supporting a new round of market openings for
agricultural, service and industrial products, as well as the
increasing the transparency of government procurements.</P>
      <P>She said that in the last two years, the global trading system
has not been as transparent and open as it was in the past.</P>
      <P>She also took the opportunity to raise funds for the US State
Department from businesses, saying that, in the last five years, the
US government budget for diplomatic affairs has been cut by about 20
percent, while international affairs and the danger of these affairs
have not decreased by 20 percent.</P>
      <P>She added that the international community requires US leadership
in the fields of democracy, peace and prosperity, she added.</P>
      <P>She urged business leaders to protest the US Congress decision to
cut US$2 billion earmarked for diplomatic affairs from the
administration's budget for the fiscal year 2000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF MUM ON CHAIRMAN KOO'S FUTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The spokesman for the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) on Friday would not comment on whether Chairman Koo
Chen-fu will continue his leadership in the foundation after his
fourth term expires.</P>
      <P>Koo's tenure expiration is now a focus of attention, at a time
when a visit to Taiwan by his mainland Chinese counterpart Wang
Daohan remains up in the air, and a SEF personnel reshuffle,
scheduled for December, is approaching.</P>
      <P>Lin Chung-ping, vice chairman and acting spokesman for SEF,
declined to speculate on Koo's future, only saying that the
foundation highly respects and values Koo's contribution to
cross-strait interactions.</P>
      <P>Koo is widely and keenly expected to stay with SEF longer to
"work a little bit more and contribute a little bit more to
cross-strait negotiation efforts," Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Koo, 83, a business tycoon-turned-presidential adviser, was
appointed SEF chairman -- top Taiwan negotiator with mainland China
-- nine years ago. He has filled the SEF Chair for four terms since
SEF was founded in 1990.</P>
      <P>Koo's mainland Chinese counterpart Wang Daohan, chairman of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), was scheduled to visit Taiwan this fall to complement Koo's
mainland visit a year earlier.</P>
      <P>The visit, however, is unlikely to take place as Beijing has
expressed indignation toward President Lee Teng-hui's "special
state-to-state" theory in redefining cross-strait relations, which
Beijing considered a move promoting Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Koo on Thursday offered to travel personally to either Beijing or
Shanghai to meet with Wang in an effort to resume the shaky and
fragile cross-strait dialogue, as well as to invite Wang in person to
visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In April 1993, Koo and Wang met for the first time in Singapore
for a three-day meeting, marking a landmark rendezvous between top
negotiators appointed by governments of the two rival sides after a
nearly four-decade hiatus of formal contacts.</P>
      <P>During the historic meeting, SEF and ARATS signed four agreements
on technical issues arising from increased exchanges between people
across the Taiwan Strait, including verification of documents and
compensation for lost registered mail.</P>
      <P>The two quasi-official bodies also agreed that SEF and ARATS
officials, including Koo and Wang, would meet on a regular basis in
years to come.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOP MAINLAND NEGOTIATOR WELCOME TO VISIT TAIWAN: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   15   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with the
mainland Koo Chen-fu has displayed goodwill by saying that he would
like to visit the mainland to invite his counterpart Wang Daohan to
Taiwan, said a mainland-policy official on Friday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin was
referring to Koo's remarks on Thursday, the first anniversary of
Koo-Wang talks in Shanghai, saying that if there is such a necessity,
he is willing to visit the mainland to personally invite Wang to
visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Koo, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said that
Taipei sincerely hopes that Wang, chairman of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), could visit Taiwan as
agreed upon during their Shanghai talks.</P>
      <P>Koo said that "only by both sides of the Taiwan Strait engaging
in high-level constructive talks, can cross-strait issues be resolved
peacefully."</P>
      <P>Lin noted that Koo's offer contained "a lot of goodwill," and
that Wang is welcome to visit Taiwan, whether it is this winter or at
a later date.</P>
      <P>Lin said that Taiwan has always been active in promoting
communication and dialogue between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, and urged Beijing to look forward at the dawn of the next
millennium to reach "stable, harmonious and mutually beneficial"
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lin said he hoped that both sides of the Taiwan Strait could
continue their "ice breaking" dialogue and work for the improvement
of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Su Chi also said that communication and dialogue
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should not be affected by
political difference.</P>
      <P>Su said that President Lee Teng-hui's statement on cross-strait
relations is a description of fact, adding that cross-strait talks
should continue through the existing communication channels, meaning
SEF and ARATS, two semi-official agencies set up by their respective
governments to deal with exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China resumed high-level talks in 1998 after
a hiatus of three years, during which Koo and Wang reached a

    <HEADLINE>PORTUGAL RESUMES ACCEPTANCE OF TAIWAN IPR APPLICATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Portugal has since Wednesday re-opened its
doors to trademark registration applications from Taiwan, marking a
happy ending to a seven-month-old intellectual property right (IPR)
dispute, said a foreign affairs official on Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu Hsiang-pu, director of European affairs of Taiwan's Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), revealed the news at a regular MOFA press
conference.</P>
      <P>Liu affirmed that the Portuguese Institute of Industrial Property
has formally notified Taipei authorities that beginning Oct. 13, it
resumed acceptance of IPR-related registration applications filed by
Republic of China nationals.</P>
      <P>In early May, Portuguese authorities rejected an application
filed by Taiwan motorcycle giant San Yang Industrial Corp. to
register a trademark, on the grounds that San Yang is from a country
that lacks "legitimate status," and because there are no official
diplomatic relations between Portugal and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Citing that the Republic of China is not a signatory to the IPR
Treaty of Paris, nor is it a member of the World Trade Organization,
nor does it have diplomatic ties with Portugal, Lisbon in May closed
its doors to any Taiwan IPR-related applications.</P>
      <P>"Mutual benefits" pushed Lisbon to reopen its arms to Taiwan, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan businesses have applied for trademark rights in
Portugal because its registration fees are lower than those of other
member-states of the European Union (EU), the largest single market
in the world. A number of Portuguese companies are also endowed with
trademark rights in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If the two sides want to boost bilateral trade and economic
relations, the IPR registration dispute is the first thing to be
resolved, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan last year signed a mutually beneficial trademark priority
agreement with the 15-member EU, of which Portugal is a member. Under
the agreement, approval of a Taiwanese company's IPR registration
application by EU central authorities is binding in all EU member
states.</P>
      <P>But registering trademarks with the EU's executive body is
expensive and time-consuming, therefore some Taiwan businesses with
export outlets or manufacturing plants in certain European countries
register directly with individual EU members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>44% OF LOTTERY PROFITS TO FINANCE POST-QUAKE REHABILITATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Forty-four percent the public welfare
lottery's first three months' of profits will be used to finance "921
Earthquake" relief efforts, said officials of the Ministry of Finance
(MOF) on Friday.</P>
      <P>The number of lottery tickets to be issued will be increased by
40 percent for the first three months, with each issuance totaling 30
million tickets. The monthly issuance of tickets will begin in
December.</P>
      <P>The decision was made in a meeting, presided over by Finance
Minister Paul Chiu and attended by heads of local governments, aimed
at raising relief funds for quake victims.</P>
      <P>The National Pension program, originally scheduled to start at
the beginning of next year, has been postponed indefinitely in the
wake of the temblor.</P>
      <P>Regarding the allocation of lottery profits, it was decided
during the meeting that 1 percent of profits will be retained to fund
annuities, 50 percent will be allocated to city and county
governments, while 5 percent will support the National Health
Insurance program, and the remaining 44 percent will go toward
financing post-quake rehabilitation, noted MOF Vice Minister Yen
Ching-chang.</P>
      <P>However, said Yen, according to Article 6 of the Public Welfare
Lottery Issuance Statute, lottery profits should be allocated for the
funding of annuities. Now that only 1 percent of the profit is
earmarked for that purpose, Yen said he was afraid the change might
be against lottery establishment regulations.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, since only three months' lottery profits are to be
allocated for quake relief efforts, the move can be seen as a sort of
expediency, and may thus be acceptable.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, since additional lottery tickets will be issued for
the first three months, a total of NT$800 million can be raised from
the measure for quake relief, the MOF official observed.</P>
      <P>Procedures for allocation of the funds to quake-stricken cities
and counties will be discussed in a meeting to be convened by the MOF
and attended by all relevant parties, Yen revealed.</P>
      <P>Determination of amounts to be distributed is likely to be based
on the total numbers of casualties and collapsed houses in the
various quake-affected areas, the MOF vice minister added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC GROWTH THIS YEAR PREDICTED AT 5.07 PERCENT: CIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A research institute said Friday that due
to effects of the massive Sept. 21 earthquake, the economic growth
rate for the fourth quarter will be 1 percent lower than the previous
estimate, reaching only 5.07 percent.</P>
      <P>But the Chung-Hwa Institute for Economic Research (CIER)
predicted that the economic growth rate will reach 6.05 percent next
year due to post-quake reconstruction work.</P>
      <P>CIER predicted in July that economic growth in the fourth quarter
would be 6.01 percent. But CIER said Friday that the greatest effects
of the quake impact will emerge in the fourth quarter, and the
institute therefore adjusted its prediction downward.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, economic growth in the second quarter reached 6.54
percent, higher than the earlier prediction of 5.03 percent. This
will make up for slower economic growth in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>CIER said that the overall economic growth rate this year will
reach 5.32 percent, down from the earlier prediction of 5.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Looking forward to next year, the institute said that economic
growth in 2000 could reach 6.05 percent if reconstruction efforts go
smoothly.</P>
      <P>But as the amount to be spent on reconstruction is so huge, major
public construction projects, such as the high-speed railway, could
be affected.</P>
      <P>If domestic investment falls by NT$40 billion (US$1.26 billion)
next year, economic growth in 2000 will only reach 5.18 percent.</P>
      <P>Institute President Mai Chao-cheng said that the research body
has formed a team to study the effects of the killer quake on the
Taiwan economy.</P>
      <P>Mai said the earthquake cut this year's fourth quarter exports by
NT$3 billion. From the first quarter through the third quarter next
year, exports will decrease by US$2.5 billion per quarter.</P>

      <P>The Taoyuan prosecutors
office issued a manhunt circular Friday amid efforts to pursue a
suspect in the murder of former Taoyuan Magistrate Liu Pang-yu.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors office issued the circular to arrest Yang

recently. The office is now investigating the situation and has
entrusted Interpol to apprehend Yang.</P>
      <P>Yang was arrested by police in September. He resolutely denied he
was responsible for the Liu case, but was willing to provide police
with clues to recover guns that had been buried at various locations.</P>
      <P>He escaped from police custody on Sept. 18 while leading officers
to a site where he claimed guns had been buried.</P>
      <P>Liu was murdered on Nov. 21, 1997, at his residence. Police

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 15 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The problem of insufficient power supply to
northern Taiwan areas could be thoroughly resolved by the year 2005,
according to an assessment by the Energy Commission (EC) of the
Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>EC Executive Secretary Chen Chao-yih revealed the assessment on
Friday at a public hearing on liberalization of Taiwan's electrical
power industry. He added that the problem could not be solved until
four planned or ready-for-operation private power plants in northern
Taiwan start power generation.</P>
      <P>During this year the island has sustained two large-scale power
failures: one on July 29, and the other on Sept. 21, when a killer
earthquake devastated Taiwan, claiming more than 2,300 lives.</P>
      <P>The outage incidents revealed that northern Taiwan is not capable
of electrical power self-sufficiency. Chen pointed out that 45
percent of the island's entire power demand comes from the northern
regions, which together account for a mere 26 percent of total power
supply capacity.</P>
      <P>The North has been relying on power from the South, but the
South's support faced an extreme challenge when major power
transmission cables, erected by the state-run Taiwan Power Company
(Taipower), were damaged by heavy rains in July and later by the
earthquake that almost razed central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The magnitude-7.3 temblor also resulted in large-scale power
rationing for two weeks.</P>
      <P>Chen said that several years ago, in order to develop sufficient
power resources, the EC formed a three-stage project to encourage
private enterprises to join the power business. Since then, Chen
noted, 43 businesses have applied to establish power generating
facilities.</P>
      <P>Eleven private companies have been granted permission to build,
and Formosa Plastics Group has completed construction of a thermal
power plant in Mailiao, southwestern Taiwan, Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several members of Doctors Without Borders
(Medecins sans Frontieres, MSF) are scheduled to arrive in Taiwan
next week to pitch in with post-earthquake medical and psychological
assistance, local charity sources said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>They are expected to proceed to Nantou County's Chungliao
Township in central Taiwan, one of the hardest hit areas, to join a
Tzu Chi medical team which has been stationed there since arriving
hours after the magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck, according to Lu
Fang-chuan, a spokesman for the Buddhist Tzu Chi Compassionate Relief
Foundation.</P>
      <P>The team from MSF, a charitable group which was awarded the 1999
Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, is expected to stay for 10 days in
Chungliao, mainly to help in rehabilitative medical and psychological
efforts, Lu said.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's top health official Chan Chi-shean
offered his congratulations to the French medical aid charity group
for receiving the prestigious Nobel Prize.</P>
      <P>Chan, director-general of the Cabinet-level Department of Health,
met with MSF members, including co-founder Bernard Kouchner, when
Chan led a Taiwan medical group to the World Health Organization
meeting in Geneva in May of this year.</P>
      <P>Chan said he talked with Kouchner about Taiwan-France
collaborative efforts to provide medical aid to AIDS victims in
Vietnam.</P>
      <P>Dr. Pan Fu-shih, a local plastic surgeon who is also a member of
the international group Physicians for Peace, gave a thumbs-up to the
MSF for its unselfish contribution to the world's sick and needy.</P>
      <P>Pan said he has had contact with MSF doctors in stricken areas in
Honduras and Lithuania and knew that once members of Doctors without
Borders commit to a war-torn or natural disaster-ravaged area, they
remain for at least one year.</P>
      <P>The Luchuhuei, or the Roadside Bamboo Society, Taiwan's version
of the MSF, is considering joining the French-based group to further
expand its charitable services, said founder Liu Chi-chun.</P>
      <P>Liu said he has become familiar with MSF operations since he met
with its doctors in Macedonia where he joined in cross-border charity
medical aid efforts.</P>

(By Chung Hai tai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Panama Canal traffic and tolls revenue for
the fiscal year 1999, which ended September 30, have exceeded budget
forecasts, according canal administrator Alberto Alemen Zubieta.</P>
      <P>Tolls revenue for the fiscal period totaled $ 568.9 million, up
4.2 percent from 1998 figures.</P>
      <P>An increase in the average vessel size and in the number of
transits by full container ships, dry-bulk carriers, vehicle
carriers, and roll on/roll off vessels, contributed to the increase
in tolls revenue.</P>
      <P>The positive performance was also partly due to a five percent
transit increase in Panamax vessels, the largest vessel able to pass
through the waterway , from 3,998 in 1998 to 4,198 in 1999,
representing 31.9 percent of all oceangoing transits in 1999.</P>
      <P>The total cargo tonnage passing through the Panama canal also
rose during the fiscal year 1999, from 192.1 million long tons in
1998 to 195.8 million long tons this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA COULD ATTACK U.S. IN TAIWAN CONFLICT: PENTAGON REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  15  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Communist China is building up its
missile forces in preparation for possible attacks against Taiwan and
the United States if its military comes to Taiwan's aid, according to
a Pentagon report.</P>
      <P>The Washington Times on Friday quoted the Pentagon report as
saying that the large number of regional offensive missile systems,
backed by space-based spying systems, will be the "cornerstone of the
People's Liberation Army early in the 21st century."</P>
      <P>"Beijing's drift toward a force dominated by offensive theater
missiles could have significant implications on regional stability,"
said the report. "In the most likely scenario of any future conflict
with Taiwan, the PLA's growing arsenal of highly accurate and lethal
theater missiles, and a preemptive doctrine could give Beijing a
decisive edge."</P>
      <P>Regarding US involvement in a war between mainland China and
Taiwan, the report makes clear that Beijing won't hesitate to attack.</P>
      <P>"The PLA has indicated a willingness to use highly accurate
short-range ballistic missiles, medium-range ballistic missiles and
land attack cruise missiles against US assets, including key bases in
Japan and aircraft carriers operating in the Western Pacific," the
report said, noting that Communist Chinese weapons planners are
working hard at preparing missiles designed to attack US carriers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHARITY GROUPS FEELING PINCH IN WAKE OF QUAKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some social groups are feeling a pinch in
their budgets after most of the donations over the past three weeks
have gone to relief efforts in the wake of the Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>The extensive loss of life and property damage in the killer
quake last month has moved many people in Taiwan to generously donate
to the relief and reconstruction.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total amount of donations has reached
more than NT$16 billion (US$503.14 million) so far.</P>
      <P>Officials of some social groups noted that it was inevitable that
most social resources would go to earthquake relief efforts first,
yet they are worried that the government may cut subsidies to them
and that private donations could also decrease.</P>
      <P>Some of the groups are already feeling the pinch of dwindling
funds, with the most seriously affected being those groups which have
been devoted to low profile charity work.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Red Heart Society, established a decade ago to care
for the elderly and led by movie director Lee Hsing, is pessimistic
about meeting its goal of collecting NT$5 million in its first public
solicitation now that some enterprises that had agreed to cooperate
with the group have canceled and redirected their money to
quake-relief efforts.</P>
      <P>Society officials said their present budget can only be sustained
for three more months.</P>
      <P>Chien Huei-lan, deputy secretary general of an association
promoting the welfare of the elderly, said that charity groups will
face difficulties over the next one or two years as the government
cuts subsidies and private sector donations remain scarce.</P>
      <P>Tsai Mei-hua, a volunteer group official also predicted that it
will not be easy for her group to solicit donations over the next
three years, and that it will even have difficulties recruiting
volunteers in the wake of the quake.</P>
      <P>As the latter half of each year is conventionally the best time
to solicit donations, Tsai said that she will join forces with other
minority social groups to appeal to the public to resume their
traditional support soon.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The first batch of
Japanese-donated prefabricated houses were inaugurated on Saturday in
Tungshih, a central Taiwan mountain township noted for its fruit
production.</P>
      <P>Shintaro Yamashita, director-general of the Taipei Office
of the Japanese Interchange Association, presented the 43
newly assembled temporary housing units to ROC Vice Premier Liu
Chao-hsiuan in a ceremony marking the completion of the ready-made
houses.</P>
      <P>Liu then handed the houses over to Tungshih Township Chief Chang
Chin-hu for distribution to local residents made homeless by the
Sept. 21 devastating earthquake.</P>
      <P>The 43 prefabricated houses were shipped to Taiwan from the
Japanese port city of Kobe on Oct. 7 and the ROC military assisted
in assembling the housing units which were once used to shelter
victims of the 1995 Kobe earthquake.</P>
      <P>Tseng Wen-hui, wife of ROC President Lee Teng-hui, was also
present at the presentation ceremony. The first lady said she was
attending the ceremony on behalf of President Lee to express
gratitude for individuals and groups from home and abroad who have
devoted money or energy to helping the 921 earthquake survivors.</P>
      <P>Tseng said her heart was filled with admiration and gratitude
when she saw the completion of Hsinyuan No. 1 Community, composed of
the newly assembled Japanese prefabricated houses.</P>
      <P>"What touches me most is the quake-affected people's courage to
stand up from the ruin," an emotional Tseng said, adding that she
also deeply appreciates the assistance offered by foreign friends,
military servicemen and ordinary people around the island in
post-quake relief and resettlement work.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government has donated 1,000 prefabricated houses to
the Republic of China to help shelter homeless quake victims in
central Taiwan. The remaining 957 prefabs will be sent to Taiwan in
several shipments in the near future.</P>
      <P>The ROC Red Cross Society has donated NT$40 million (US$1.26
million) for building peripheral facilities surrounding the Hsinyuan
Community. All those facilities, including a large reading room,
public bathrooms and recreational facilities, were also inaugurated
on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Defense Minister Tang Fei said the
military will continue to build temporary housing units for
homeless quake victims.</P>
      <P>Each Japanese-donated prefab covers an area of eight pings (one
ping equals 36 square feet.) It has two rooms, a kitchen, a storage
room, a locker room and a telephone. The second batch of Japanese
prefabs will arrive on Sunday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC AIR FORCE VOWS TO DEAL WITH BIRD PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Air Force on Saturday vowed to deal
with birds that have apparently jeopardized the safety of Taiwan's
military planes, as highlighted by the latest accident in which a
Mirage jet fighter was downed by the avian menace on Friday.</P>
      <P>A French-made Mirage 2000-5 interceptor crashed off the northwest
coast of Taiwan about 15 minutes after taking off from the northern
Hsinchu Air Base. The two pilots ejected before the plane plunged
into the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to the Air Force, engine failure occurred after birds
were sucked into the jet fighter's engines, causing severe damage to
the turbo blades.</P>
      <P>In order to decrease the risk of accidents due to encounters with
birds, some warplanes have avoided taking off during high times of
bird activity except for emergency missions. In addition, a ban on
pigeon-raising in the vicinity of many air bases has also been
announced, the Air Force said.</P>
      <P>Despite these preventive measures, the Air Force sources said
nearly 100 warplanes ran into or nearly ran into birds last year,
damaging several engines.</P>
      <P>In light of the Mirage 2000-5 crash, the first of its kind since
the Air Force commissioned 60 of the high-performance fighter planes
in 1997, bird prevention efforts will be accelerated to avoid a
recurrence of similar accidents, said Defense Minister Tang Fei.</P>
      <P>Tang said the civilian sector, including the legislature, were
unaware of the genuine threat to the warplanes posed by birds.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of National Defense had proposed a plan
allocating a certain amount of the budget to curbing bird numbers and
scaring them away in an attempt to increase safety for the nation's
military planes, but he noted that it was shelved by the legislators.</P>
      <P>The bird issue also touched off debate between the Air Force and
wildlife conservationist groups. A group leader challenged the Air
Force's explanation for Friday's crash, saying that if a bird can
down such an advanced and expensive jet fighter so easily, how can
the air force defend Taiwan?</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Major General Lee Kuei-fa, in charge of discipline and
supervisory affairs in the Air Force, recognized the performance of
the two pilots during the emergency. He referred to Squadron Leader
Wu Pin-fu and Flight Lieutenant Wu Shih-feng's joint handling of the
Mirage fighter as "proper and dutiful."</P>
      <P>As part of its military modernization effort, Taiwan ordered 60
Mirage 2000-5 fighters from France in 1993 at a cost of US$3 billion.
Taiwan also purchased 150 US-built F-16 MLU (mid-life upgrade) jets
and 130 locally developed defense fighters (IDFs) to replace its
aging fleet of American F-104s and F-5Es.</P>

participating.</P>
      <P>The meeting will be jointly presided over by Vice Economic
Affairs Minister Lin Yi-fu and his Dutch counterpart F.A. Engering,
according to Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) officials.</P>
      <P>During the consultations, Taiwan will discuss ways to further
bolster cooperative ties with the Netherlands and will seek the
European country's help in its bid to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO), MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Lin's delegation will also seek the Netherlands' support for
Taiwan's joining the United Nations Chemical Weapons Prevention

      <P>This will be the fourth set of consultations between Taiwan and

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATOR CALLS HEARING OVER FRAUD INVOLVING FOREIGN BRIDES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator called a public hearing on
Saturday to call attention to cases of fraud involving foreign
smuggling rings collecting the passports of foreign brides for
illegal use.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuo Su-chun of the ruling Kuomintang called the
hearing on international fraud involving foreign brides.
Participating in the hearing were Taiwanese victims of the fraud and
government officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the
Bureau of Immigration.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuo said that such fraud has compromised the rights of
local people and threatened the social order.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuo pointed out that the smuggling rings first act as
matchmaking agencies for Indonesian brides and Taiwanese men. The
rings then collect the passports of the Indonesian brides after they
return to Indonesia within six months according to Indonesian
regulations.</P>
      <P>The rings then give the passports to others who then use the
contraband passports to enter Taiwan shortly thereafter.</P>
      <P>The legislator stated that the illegal smuggling rings might be
involved in getting jobs for the illegal immigrants after they arrive
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Indonesian brides who have handed over their
passports cannot leave their country after they have been taken away
from them and their husbands in Taiwan are left without both their
bride and the large sum of money given as a dowry.</P>
      <P>Kuo asked relevant authorities to check the whereabouts of the
brides to see if their passports have been converted for illegal use
or the women have been sent to serve in the prostitution business.</P>
      <P>A Bureau of Immigration official said the law states that foreign
brides must report the loss of their passports and reapply for entry
before they are allowed to return.</P>
      <P>Another official also said that Taiwan cracks about 350 cases of
illegal immigration every year with many more illegals entering
undetected.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The China External Trade Development
Council (CETRA) expects that more than 20,000 buyers will visit the
Taitronics '99 exhibition -- a showcase of Taiwan's electronics
industry -- at the Taipei World Trade Center between Oct. 16 and Oct.
20.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,029 electronics manufacturers from here and abroad
are presenting their innovations ranging from computers, peripherals,
and telecommunications equipment, to consumer electronics and
lighting equipment. Among them are 30 manufacturers from South Korea,
Hong Kong, Germany, the United States, India and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>The electronics industry is the leading force behind Taiwan's
trade surplus. The total export value of Taiwan's electronics
amounted to US$32 billion in 1998.</P>
      <P>A CETRA analysis indicates that the prosperity of Taiwan's
electronics industry can be attributed to its rich hi-tech human
resources and strong support from related industries. Even in times
of global recession, Taiwan's electronics industry was able to
maintain a competitive edge in innovation against the United States
and Japan.</P>
      <P>The major products of Taiwan's electronics industry are computers
and communication and consumer products. Taiwan's communication
products chiefly consist of linear circuit systems, telephones,
wireless equipment and switching equipment. Major consumer products
include radios, color TVs, VCRs, and car radios.</P>
      <P>October has been a month full of trips to East Asia for
electronics buyers from all over the world. In addition to the
five-day Taitronics exhibition in Taipei, three other electronics
shows took place in Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong in the first
half of the month.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Jason Hu said
on Saturday he will visit two of the Republic of China's diplomatic
allies -- the Dominican Republic and Panama -- next week.</P>
      <P>Hu told a news conference that he will leave for the Dominican
Republic on Oct. 23 for a four-day official visit. On his way, Hu
will make transit stops in Seattle and New York.</P>
      <P>Following his Dominican visit, Hu will then travel to Panama to
meet with the new Panamanian president and foreign minister.</P>
      <P>Hu said Dominican President Leonel Fernandez has invited him to
visit the Caribbean nation to discuss some bilateral cooperative
programs.</P>
      <P>Shortly after Taiwan was rattled by a devastating earthquake on
Sept. 21, Fernandez made a three-day state visit to the ROC to
express his concern for the well-being of people of Taiwan in the
wake of the temblor.</P>
      <P>As all senior ROC officials were busy with post-quake relief work
at that time, several proposed cooperative programs between the two
countries were not discussed during his visit. Prior to Fernandez's
departure, Hu promised to visit the Dominican Republic within a month
to discuss some topics of mutual interest.</P>
      <P>High on the agenda will be a proposal that the ROC help the
Dominican Republic build a science-based industrial park to boost its
high-tech industries. A team of experts in developing and
administering science-based industrial parks will accompany Hu on his
Dominican visit.</P>
      <P>A 10-member trade and investment mission will also visit the
Dominican Republic along with Hu to explore possible trade and
investment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu said he will travel to Panama on Oct. 27 for a
four-day visit. Hu said he originally planned to visit Panama
immediately after the new Panamanian government was formed in early
September. As he was preoccupied with preparations for an ROC-Central
America summit meeting at that time, he postponed his Panama visit.</P>
      <P>In addition to paying a courtesy call on new Panamanian President
Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, Hu said he will meet with other Panamanian
officials, including Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Aleman, for
wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Local political observers said a visit to Panama by Hu at this
time is of special significance as it has been widely speculated that
the Central American country is endeavoring to improve its relations
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hu vowed recently that he "would not allow the 921 devastating
earthquake to shake the ROC's diplomacy."</P>

      <P>Taiwan hopes Beijing will give a friendly
response to top Taiwanese negotiator with mainland China Koo
Chen-fu's willingness to make an ice-thawing tour to the mainland, a
high ranking official with Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the MAC, made the remark when
giving a speech at an academic seminar on the future of cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Saying that it is better to convert an enemy into a friend, Lin
also hopes that the cross-Taiwan Strait ties can lead to peace,
stability and cooperation.</P>
      <P>He said Koo Chen-fu, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation, on Thursday had expressed his willingness to revisit
mainland China to resume a constructive dialogue with Wang Daohan,
chairman of the mainland's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Thursday marked the first anniversary of the Koo-Wang talks in
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan has sufficiently displayed goodwill and is
waiting for a friendly response from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wang was originally scheduled to visit Taiwan in the spring of
this year but Beijing later decided to postpone the visit to the
fall.</P>
      <P>Beijing suspended its dialogue with Taiwan in early July after
ROC President Lee Teng-hui redefined the cross-strait relationship as
a "special state-to-state" one. Beijing claims that after Lee put
forward this view of cross-strait relations, the existing basis for
bilateral talks no longer exist.</P>
      <P>Lin said if Wang cannot visit Taiwan in the fall this year,
Taiwan will still welcome his visit at any time.</P>

invite Wang to Taiwan if required.</P>

      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is
drafting a white paper on the party's "China policy" with the main
points echoing DPP presidential candidate Chen Shui-bian's view of
conditioned direct contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 20, Chen announced his view of cross-strait relations.
He proposed a relaxing of restrictions on direct shipping, trade and
investment on the condition that Taiwan's national security is not
endangered.</P>
      <P>A DPP source disclosed that the white paper will be released next
month, corresponding with the DPP-sponsored "International Conference

      <P>The DPP politician, in a September announcement, summed up his

    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of people surveyed said
the massive Sept. 21 earthquake will have an effect on next year's
presidential election, according to a poll released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Public Poll Institute of the Republic of China surveyed 1,187
people over the age of 20 between Oct. 13 and 15. The results have a
margin of error of 0.029 percent.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the killer quake will have an effect on the
presidential election next year, 37.9 percent answered "yes," while
21.7 percent said the effect will be big; 25.4 percent said it will
have no effect.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that younger, more highly educated people
tend to think the quake will have a greater influence on the outcome
of the election.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the results, Professor Pao Chung-ho of National Taiwan
University said those who are younger and better educated tend to be
more idealistic and therefore may be more critical in their views.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that most respondents refused to answer
questions concerning possible effects on the election, showing that
most people are still focusing on post-quake relief and
reconstruction efforts, and that the real effect of the quake on the
election may need some time to surface.</P>
      <P>The questionnaire also asked people about their views on relief
work by the private sector and the government.</P>
      <P>Respondents were most satisfied with the performance of the
private sector, followed by those of central and local governments.</P>
      <P>The results showed that 92.9 percent of those polled had a
positive view of relief efforts by the private sector; 72.9 percent
had such views about the performance of the central government, in
contrast to the 20.3 percent who viewed it negatively.</P>
      <P>Ninety percent of those surveyed had positive views of the
government's mobilization of military personnel, police officers,
firefighters, electricians and plumbers to join quake-relief efforts.
Respondents in quake-stricken areas in central Taiwan had higher
approval ratings of the central government than those in areas not
greatly affected by the temblor.</P>
      <P>The institute said the government's approval rating in this
survey was higher than those of previous polls, showing that
government quake-relief efforts have become much more organized and
have been operating more smoothly.</P>

(CBC) Sunday showed that Taiwan has earned US$44.6 billion in
interest generated from overseas assets in eight years.</P>
      <P>According to the data, starting in 1991, profits from interest on
overseas holdings varied from year to year, with a high of US$6.23
billion in 1991 and a low of US$4.72 in 1998 due to declining
international interest rates.</P>
      <P>The data revealed that Taiwan's foreign income mainly results
from investments, accounting for more than 90 percent of total
overseas earnings, and interest on foreign exchange reserves brought
in the lion's share of those investment earnings.</P>
      <P>However, the percent of total profit being generated from
interest on foreign exchange reserves dropped considerably from 80
percent in 1991 to an average 63.5 percent in the last three years,
due to lower interest rates, the data showed.</P>
      <P>The US interest rate was down slightly from 5 percent in 1991 to
4.9 percent in 1998; that of Japan plunged to 0.5 percent in 1998
from 5.5 percent in 1991; and Germany's rate tumbled from 7.1 percent
in 1991 to 2.5 percent in 1998.</P>
      <P>Earnings from interest on Taiwan's foreign assets are expected to
grow as Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves increase and international
interest rates stop declining, said bank officials.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thailand is to produce a handbook on
earthquake precautions and relief measures for distribution to the
public, said the country's Deputy Prime Minister Trairong Suwankhiri
Saturday.</P>
      <P>A recent earthquake that killed more than 2,300 people, including
seven Thai workers, in Taiwan has caused the kingdom to be concerned
about the possibility of a strong temblor in Thailand, especially in
10 provinces in the north and northwest.</P>
      <P>Those provinces are: Mae Hong Son, Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai, Nan,
Phayao, Phrae, Lampang, Lumphun, Tak and Kanchanaburi.</P>
      <P>Trairong, who chairs the National Safety Council, ordered the
council's anti-earthquake sub-committee to draft the handbook.</P>
      <P>He also instructed the council to: focus on roles for emergency
direction and coordination; seek legal amendments to ensure safety
for amusement park visitors and lift users in high-rise buildings;
and work out standard qualifications for operators of potentially
hazardous construction machinery.</P>
      <P>The Meteorological Department is to seek cabinet approval for a
proposal to appoint representatives of the national police office and
the Public Health Ministry to the council.</P>
      <P>A command center will be set up to ensure speedy disaster relief
operations, with the Local Administration Department of the Interior

      <P>There are 433 centenarians in Taiwan,
according to a survey released by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
on Sunday, which, according to the Chinese lunar calendar, is the
Double Nine Day when people show special respect for their elders.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that of the 433 centenarians, more than 70
percent are women, and the eldest is 115 years old.</P>
      <P>The survey painted a grim picture of life for those over 65, as a
great number of them must rely on support from children or other
relatives.</P>
      <P>Only 5.6 percent of those older than 65 have full-time jobs,
while 5.3 percent work part-time; 0.7 percent engage in volunteer
activities.</P>
      <P>The results showed that the majority of those over 65 have
withdrawn from the mainstream employment force, the MOI said, adding
that it is a pity and a waste that such valuable human resources have
gone idle.</P>
      <P>One of every five, or 20.8 percent, of those seniors said they
don't have enough income to make ends meet, compared with 52.7
percent who have sufficient incomes; 26.3 percent said they relied on
savings.</P>
      <P>The results showed that most people older than 65 have economic
problems because they retired too soon.</P>
      <P>For this reason, 52.3 percent of them must depend on their

      <P>Six Taiwan-based companies made the
Forbes list of the best 200 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)
in the world beyond the United States, sources from the magazine said
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was one of 10 countries from around the world to have more

      <P>The six Taiwanese companies listed were the semiconductor
manufacturers ASE Test and Sunplus Technology; D-Link, an electronic
device producer; Microtek International, a computer peripherals
maker; China Development Industrial Bank; and Nien Hsing Textile.</P>
      <P>Forbes surveyed 12,000 SMEs in 43 countries around the world
outside the United States and then selected the best 200 to be
published in the magazine's latest issue on Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>The business magazine made their choices based on their
definition of what constitutes an SME, which is any listed firm with
an annual business turnover of less than US$500 million, and certain
credentials including a stock dividend rate of no less than 10
percent, and annual transactions and profit growth each totaling at
least a 15 percent increase over the previous year, according to
Forbes compilers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Pingtung, southern Taiwan, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A black bear standing as
tall as an average man was suspected of having ravaged a beetle nut
farm in a village in Taiwan's southernmost county early Monday
morning, the police said.</P>
      <P>Police and fire fighters were summoned to a farm located in the
Fanhua Village of Pingtung County's Changchih Township, where they
found footprints but had no luck finding the four legged suspect.</P>
      <P>According to farmer Chao Kuo-sheng, he spotted a black animal
about the height of a man tearing the bark of a beetle nut tree on
his farm at around 5:00 a.m.</P>
      <P>Before he could see it clearly, the animal which Chao believed to
be a black bear, fled at full speed upon hearing an approaching
motorbike's engine, he said.</P>
      <P>Chao's neighbors also complained to police that their farms were
damaged by some unknown animals more than 20 days earlier. Previously
thought to be dogs, they now believe that the saboteur might have
been the same black bear, judging from similar traces of damage.</P>
      <P>Lacking relevant knowledge, the Changchih Township police have
sought help from the National Pingtung Technology Institute for
apprehending the suspected animal. They also called for residents in
the area to be on alert against any further encounters with the bear.</P>
      <P>Zoologists arriving at the scene could not decide whether or not
the the suspected black bear was a Formosan black bear, which is a
rare and highly endangered species in Taiwan with an estimated
population of only between 100 to 300.</P>
      <P>According to zoological experts, Formosan black bears, Taiwan's
largest mammal, have no natural enemies other than humans. The bear,
indigenous to the island, has five-toed paws with long curbed claws
that it uses to dig in search of roots and insects.</P>
      <P>The omnivorous animal has large molars designed for grinding
vegetables. The bears do not hibernate, and their most distinctive
feature is a light-colored V-shape across their chest.</P>
      <P>Although they can grow up to 200 kilograms, the Formosan black
bears are good tree climbers and efficient predators.</P>
      <P>The last time that Formosan black bears were the topic of
discussion was shortly after the cataclysmic magnitude 7.3 earthquake
struck central Taiwan on Sept. 21. Zoologists in Yushan National Park
said that days before the devastating quake hit Taiwan, almost all
the animals in the national park evacuated.</P>
      <P>They said the national park was virtually empty as few of the
regular wildlife residents could be found in the park in the wake of
the quake.</P>
      <P>They believe that the bigger the animals were, the earlier they
left, reckoning that the Formosan black bears led the east-bound
exodus, followed by deer, Formosan serow, Formosan muntjac, wild
boar, brown wood owls, field mice, squirrels, birds and finally bees.</P>
      <P>The zoologists say it is possible that long before an earthquake
hits, certain elements are discharged from the earth that are
noticeable to animals but not to humans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US TO PLAY INCREASING ROLE IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   18   (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will play an
increasingly important role in relations across the Taiwan Strait in
the years ahead, the Republic of China's Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which charts Taiwan's policy toward mainland China,
further revealed that US Under Secretary of State Thomas R. Pickering
is scheduled to head a delegation to visit the mainland in the last
week of October.</P>
      <P>The MAC said in a report that Pickering's forthcoming visit is
aimed at resuming friendly relations between Washington and Beijing,
which were affected by NATO's mistaken bombing of mainland Chinese
embassy in Belgrade in May.</P>
      <P>The United States reportedly has paid US$4.5 million in
humanitarian compensation for the human casualties or property
damage caused by NATO bombing. However, mainland China still declined
to compensate the United States for damage caused by mainland Chinese
demonstrators to its embassy in Beijing following the NATO bombing.</P>
      <P>The MAC said Pickering's mainland visit was decided during a
September summit meeting in New Zealand between US President Bill
Clinton and mainland President Jiang Zemin. The itinerary of
Pickering's visit has not yet been formally announced.</P>
      <P>In addition to easing mainland China's animosity toward the
United States over the embassy bombing incident and discussing
worsening bilateral trade disputes, the MAC said, the Clinton
administration also hopes that Pickering's visit can help forge
rapprochement with mainland China in other fields, including
resuming dialogue on political, military and human rights issues.</P>
      <P>The MAC went on to say that as the United States wants to
prevent any escalation of tension in the Taiwan Strait, it will play
an increasingly important role in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>For instance, the Clinton administration sent Assistant
Secretary of State Stanley Roth and American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) Chairman Richard Bush to visit Beijing and Taipei,
respectively, to reiterate US stances on cross-strait ties when
tension in the Taiwan Strait escalated this summer after ROC
President Lee Teng-hui defined cross-strait ties as a "special
state-to-state relationship" in an interview with a German radio
station in July.</P>
      <P>Beijing interpreted the definition as a move to promote Taiwan
independence and launched saber-rattling against Taiwan. Beijing
continued its criticism even after Taiwan was rattled by a
devastating earthquake on September 21.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MAC report said US Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State Susan Shirk has suggested in a recent speech that Beijing
adopt a more flexible policy toward Taiwan. For example, Shirk said
Beijing can propose a "one country, three systems" formula to attract
Taiwan to the negotiation table for discussing reunification issues.</P>

      <P>The ROC military is closely monitoring the
sea lanes near the site of a jet fighter crash last week after
mainland Chinese ships were spotted in the area off the coast of
Hsinchu in northern Taiwan Monday morning.</P>
      <P>The military sent two mine sweepers to the area to beef up

mainland within six or seven nautical miles off Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>The Air Force pinpointed the location of the 2000-5 Mirage jet

      <P>The two-seated fighter crashed into the sea on a routine training
mission on Friday. The two pilots were able to eject before the
jet plunged into sea and later were rescued in good condition.</P>
      <P>The Air Force had earlier tried to salvage the advanced jet

    <HEADLINE>HK DEMOCRACY PARTY CHAIRMAN CALLS ON TAIPEI MAYOR MA YING-JEOU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Martin Lee of the Hong Kong
Democracy Party called on Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou Monday morning to
convey the concern of the people of Hong Kong following Taiwan's "921
Earthquake" that caused significant casualties.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by party Vice Chairman Yeung Sum, Lee delivered a
banner with signatures of Hong Kong people who extended their concern
for Taiwan's quake victims, and he also presented a consolation card
from his party when visiting Ma.</P>
      <P>Ma was very touched by the concern from distant Hong Kong and
stressed that Lee is well-known in Hong Kong and is a representative
figure of those struggling for democracy there. Lee's visit to Taiwan
is of great significance, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma also slammed Beijing for its politicization of Taiwan's
earthquake. He referred to Beijing's asking that the International
Red Cross indirectly provide relief assistance to Taiwan's quake
victims through the mainland Chinese Red Cross Society, an action
that displeased the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that in the past, Taiwan has provided immediate
assistance to mainland Chinese flood-stricken people, and private
organizations have also proceeded to flood-stricken zones to take
part in disaster relief work without any consideration of politics.</P>
      <P>Lee said his party began a fund-raising activity soon after
hearing news of the major temblor that rattled Taiwan on Sept. 21,
and the party has received more than HK$1 million. Hong Kong people's
support for fund raising for Taiwan quake victims has been far beyond
the party's anticipation, said Lee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAYOR OF CHIAYI SAID A FAVORITE RUNNING MATE FOR JAMES SOONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>James Soong, former governor of Taiwan
Province and a Kuomintang maverick seeking to run for the year 2000
presidential election, is said to be likely to choose a woman running
mate, and Chiayi Mayor Chang Po-ya has been seen as his favorite.</P>
      <P>Lee than six months before the presidential election, only the
KMT-nominated presidential candidate, the incumbent Vice President
Lien Chan, has announced his running mate, the incumbent Premier
Vincent Siew.</P>
      <P>Lien is facing a fierce challenge from Soong, who continues to
lead opinion polls. The Democratic Progressive Party's candidate,
former Mayor of Taipei Chen Shui-bian, is also a big threat to Lien.
Both Soong and Chen are said to be interested in having female
running mates.</P>
      <P>Chang, who holds a master's degree in public health from Johns
Hopkins University in the United States and a doctorate in the same
field from Kyorin University in Japan, has many years of
administrative experience as Chiayi mayor, director of the public
health department of Kaohsiung Medical College and director-general
of the Department of Public Health under the Executive Yuan. In 1990,
she was elected to the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>A leading figure among nonpartisans in the 1980s before new
political parties were allowed to be formed, Chang enjoyed widespread
popularity in elections. While her academic achievement and
performance in public service are highly recognized, the mayor is
also considered an ideal choice for any presidential candidate
wishing to lock in votes from women.</P>
      <P>Since Soong last visited the mayor in Chiayi City in late August,
speculation about Chang being Soong's favorite running mate has not
died down, although Chang herself categorically ruled out the
possibility.</P>
      <P>Chang previously pointed out that she once served as a
subordinate to Lien in her position as a Cabinet member; Soong was
also once her superior in his former role as Taiwan provincial
governor. As a nonpartisan, she was once Chen's comrade before the
DPP was founded. Chang said, however, she is not interested in
becoming a presidential running mate. She has also declined to make
any speeches supporting candidates at election campaign gatherings.</P>
      <P>Heated discussion about the presidential election and candidates
quieted down after Sept. 21, when a killer earthquake jolted Taiwan
and caused severe damage. When Soong's campaign personnel disclosed
recently that Soong would announce his running mate in November,
Chang's name was again mentioned in local political circles.</P>
      <P>The press failed to reach Chang for comment because she has gone
on an overseas trip. None of her subordinates sees much possibility
of Chang teaming up with Soong. One subordinate said it was hardly a
theme for the mayor in discussions with her staff.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2 MORE KNOX-CLASS FRIGATES JOIN ROC NAVY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two more Knox-class frigates leased
from the United States were commissioned on Monday to help beef up
the Republic of China's naval defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>A commissioning ceremony for the two warships, christened
the Ningyang and the Iyang, was held at a naval base in Tsoying near
the southern port city of Kaohsiung, with Navy Commander-in-Chief
Li Chieh presiding.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Li praised naval officers and enlisted
men who had traveled to the United States to take delivery of the
two frigates.</P>
      <P>Li said their diligence and good discipline have won the acclaim
of US military personnel. "Your hard work has also helped save
costs for repairing and refurbishing the two frigates," Li said,
adding that he hopes all naval servicemen will keep this good
tradition and system.</P>
      <P>Noting that naval officers and enlisted men sent to the United
States to receive the warships had been carefully selected, Li said
their main missions included integrated training and combat skills
training.</P>
      <P>After a 40-day training voyage, the two frigates arrived at the
Tsoying naval base on Oct. 4. They were the ROC Navy's seventh and
eighth Knox-class frigates.</P>
      <P>The Navy has leased a total of six Knox-class frigates from the
United States since 1992 to reinforce its anti-submarine combat
capabilities.</P>
      <P>The US Navy built Knox-class frigates in the 1970s. They formed
the backbone of the US anti-submarine fleet and also played an
important role in accompanying and protecting other warships in the
1970s-1980s.</P>
      <P>The Knox-class frigates are equipped with highly sophisticated
sonar, torpedoes, deep-sea bombs, anti-ship missiles and many other
advanced weaponry systems.</P>
      <P>In the face of mounting military threat from mainalnd China, the
commissioning of the two additional Knox-class frigates is expected
to help upgrade the ROC's defense capability and safeguard peace and
security in the Taiwan Strait, military authorities said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EDITORS'  NOTE:</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Pingtung, southern Taiwan, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A black bear standing as
tall as an average man was suspected of having ravaged a betel nut
farm in a village in Taiwan's southernmost county early Monday
morning, the police said.</P>
      <P>Police and fire fighters were summoned to a farm located in the
Fanhua Village of Pingtung County's Changchih Township, where they
found footprints but had no luck finding the four legged suspect.</P>
      <P>According to farmer Chao Kuo-sheng, he spotted a black animal
about the height of a man tearing the bark of a betel nut tree on his
farm at around 5:00 a.m.</P>
      <P>Before he could see it clearly, the animal which Chao believed to
be a black bear, fled at full speed upon hearing an approaching
motorbike's engine, he said.</P>
      <P>Chao's neighbors also complained to police that their farms were
damaged by some unknown animals more than 20 days earlier. Previously
thought to be dogs, they now believe that the saboteur might have
been the same black bear, judging from similar traces of damage.</P>
      <P>Lacking relevant knowledge, the Changchih Township police have
sought help from the National Pingtung Technology Institute for
apprehending the suspected animal. They also called for residents in
the area to be on alert against any further encounters with the bear.</P>
      <P>Zoologists arriving at the scene could not decide whether or not
the suspected black bear was a Formosan black bear, which is a
rare and highly endangered species in Taiwan with an estimated
population of only between 100 to 300.</P>
      <P>According to zoological experts, Formosan black bears, Taiwan's
largest mammal, have no natural enemies other than humans. The bear,
indigenous to the island, has five-toed paws with long curbed claws
that it uses to dig in search of roots and insects.</P>
      <P>The omnivorous animal has large molars designed for grinding
vegetables. The bears do not hibernate, and their most distinctive
feature is a light-colored V-shape across their chest.</P>
      <P>Although they can grow up to 200 kilograms, the Formosan black
bears are good tree climbers and efficient predators.</P>
      <P>The last time that Formosan black bears were the topic of
discussion was shortly after the cataclysmic magnitude 7.3 earthquake
struck central Taiwan on Sept. 21. Zoologists in Yushan National Park
said that days before the devastating quake hit Taiwan, almost all
the animals in the national park evacuated.</P>
      <P>They said the national park was virtually empty as few of the
regular wildlife residents could be found in the park in the wake of
the quake.</P>
      <P>They believe that the bigger the animals were, the earlier they
left, reckoning that the Formosan black bears led the east-bound
exodus, followed by deer, Formosan serow, Formosan muntjac, wild
boar, brown wood owls, field mice, squirrels, birds and finally bees.</P>
      <P>The zoologists say it is possible that long before an earthquake
hits, certain elements are discharged from the earth that are
noticeable to animals but not to humans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS URGE US ENDORSEMENT OF TAIWAN SECURITY ENHANCEMENT BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Vice President Rau Yin-chi
said Monday that the Taiwan Security Enhancement Bill is expected to
be passed by the US House of Representatives and that all Congress
members are concerned about the security problem between Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Rau, who just returned from a US trip with the dual purpose of
expressing gratitude for rescue and relief assistance after Taiwan's
Sept. 21 earthquake and of lobbying Congress for passage of the bill,
added, however, that the bill is not likely to be passed by the
Senate due to reservations of some Democrats.</P>
      <P>Rau made the statement during a press conference held at the
Legislative Yuan. Others who accompanied him on the trip said that
Democrats are at loggerheads with Republicans in the Senate over the
recent rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and therefore
the bill might be shelved.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator Parris Chang, who
visited the United States with Rau and was present at the press
conference, accused the ROC government of having failed to make
enough effort in lobbying for passage of the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Bill.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that some US legislators had revealed that if the
Republic of China government had devoted as much effort and resources
as it did when lobbying for President Lee Teng-hui's 1995 visit to
the United States, then the bill might have passed.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Bill,
designed to increase US arms sales to Taiwan and to construct a more
cooperative bilateral relationship in terms of armed forces and
security maintenance, is currently under review and has been opposed
by some US administrative departments on the grounds that Taiwan's
arguments for buying more weapons are not convincing and are not
specifically designed to meet the needs of national defense.</P>
      <P>Along with eight other legislators from the ruling Kuomintang and
the main opposition DPP, Rau departed for the United States on Oct.
1. During the week-long visit, they met with representatives from
both the House and Senate, as well as American Institute in Taiwan
Chairman Richard Bush, private think tanks and groups of overseas
Taiwanese.

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER ORDERS INTEGRATION OF POST-QUAKE PAYMENTS AND SUBSIDIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew ordered the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) on Monday to integrate and simplify the
government programs for "provisional work subsidies" and "work in
exchange for relief."</P>
      <P>The fifth meeting of the government Post-quake Reconstruction
Committee was held Monday morning. During the meeting, CLA Chairman
Chan Hou-sheng reported on measures to distribute provisional work
subsidies and to implement the work-for-relief program.</P>
      <P>Premier Siew gave his instructions after Chan's report.</P>
      <P>Both Chao Shou-po, chairman of the Taiwan provincial government,
and Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), conveyed many
quake-victims' feelings of confusion over government work-relief
measures, which should be integrated and simplified.</P>
      <P>There were reports that some temblor victims have worked but
still have not been paid, while others have been paid but have not
yet done any work.</P>
      <P>Siew indicated that the work-for-relief program is worthwhile for
quake survivors, being not only beneficial for their psychological
recovery, but also providing them with job opportunities. The measure
would thus function as a stabilizing force on the public's mentality
and on social order, the prime minister added.</P>
      <P>As for problems confronting implementation of the integrated
program, Siew remarked that the CLA should make the process easy for
local governments to conduct and simple enough for quake survivors to
understand.</P>
      <P>CLA officials should explain the procedures, after making the
necessary adjustments, to local governments, so that they would
assist with promotion of government post-quake reconstruction
efforts, said Siew.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dragged down by overnight Wall Street
losses and the news that the operational tax on banks will not be
lowered for the next four years, Taiwan share prices closed 1.1
percent lower Monday.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index shed
84.13 points to close at 7,745.26 on a turnover of NT$75.25 billion
(US$2.37 billion).</P>
      <P>Due to a lack of new incentives on the local bourse and a likely
interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve Board, the Taipei stock
market opened lower and closed lower.</P>
      <P>Investors rushed to sell the financial issues they had bought on
Saturday, following a Ministry of Finance (MOF) denial of reports
that it would cut the operational tax on banks.</P>
      <P>After the stock market had closed last Saturday, the MOF
announced it would not consider lowering the tax from two percent to
one percent within the next four years.</P>
      <P>Despite Monday's decline, dealers expected a boom sometime in the
future as construction shares, cement issues and construction-related
materials issues will likely be boosted by post-quake reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Some dealers predicted the market will continue to consolidate in
the short term until third-quarter corporate results are released at
the end of this month.</P>
      <P>Among the eight major stock categories, the plastics and chemical
sector took the lead, ending the day with 2.35-percent gains, while
financial issues and electronics shares closed lower, posting
2.76-percent and 2-percent losses, respectively.</P>
      <P>Declining stocks led advancing stocks 330 to 123, with 82 shares
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market rose 0.54 points to close at 183.88
on a turnover of NT$9.94 billion.</P>
      <P>Shadowed by the shoddy performance of the stock market, all TAIEX
International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index Futures)
posted losses.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for October moved down 77 points to close at

      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for December declined 36 points to close at

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 30-second commercial featuring the
Republic of China's gratitude for foreign assistance in its
post-earthquake relief work will be aired on Cable News Network (CNN)
beginning Oct. 20, a Foreign Ministry official reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>The piece, titled "Taiwan Thanks the World," is in English and
will be broadcast on CNN during prime time from Oct. 20 through Oct.
24, the official said, adding that Foreign Minister Jason Hu will
hold a news conference on Wednesday morning to introduce the
commercial.</P>
      <P>According to the official, three advertisement agencies had
presented production plans and the Foreign Ministry selected the one
which expressed Taiwan's gratitude in an abstract way.</P>
      <P>Ministry tallies show that more than 110 countries around the
world have either sent rescue teams, donated relief goods or funds,
or expressed concern via telephone or written messages after Taiwan
was rattled by a devastating earthquake on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>"We think that an abstract way will be most effective in
highlighting our theme of thanking all those who have offered help
or expressed concern for our post-earthquake situation," the
official said.</P>
      <P>After the piece was completed, the Foreign Ministry invited
some staff members, scholars, experts and foreign representatives
stationed in Taiwan to a preview. "The brief film has received a
warm response from the audience," the official said.</P>
      <P>As overseas Chinese have also made generous donations to
various post-earthquake relief and reconstruction projects, the
official said the commercial has a Chinese version, titled "Taiwan
Thanks All Overseas Chinese for Their Assistance and Concern," which
will be aired on a Los Angeles-based satellite television station

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN OFFICIALS  REJECT JIANG'S REMARKS ON REUNIFICATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan officials on Monday rejected
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's remarks that China's
unification will be achieved in the first half of the next century.</P>
      <P>"How can there be a timetable for China's unification?" asked
officials with the Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>"Jiang's statement just serves to outline Beijing's hegemonic
manner and that he totally doesn't understand the feeling of people
on Taiwan (toward the unification issue)," the officials said.</P>
      <P>Jiang said in an interview with The Times newspaper that by the
middle of the next century, mainland China will resolve the question
of Taiwan and accomplish the great cause of national reunification by
adhering to the policy of "peaceful reunification" and "one country,
two systems," after the successful return of Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Republic of China has never changed its goal
of seeking national unification, the officials that there should be
no timetable for such a goal.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's Guidelines for National Unification, China's
unification should be a gradual process and eventually be realized
when the mainland becomes a free, democratic and prosperous society.</P>
      <P>The officials said there is nothing new in Jiang's remarks, as he
merely repeated Beijing's term "one nation, two systems," while still
refusing to renounce using force against Taiwan and continuing to
press for a halt to US arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But they warned that Jiang's "50-year theory" doesn't mean that
mainand China will wait until 50 years from now to start to solve the
so-called "Taiwan problem." On the contrary, they said, Beijing will
not hesitate to try to annex Taiwan once it is capable of doing so.</P>
      <P>However, the statement also reveals Jiang himself is very clear
that cross-strait disputes could not be solved overnight and may be
left for the next one or two generations of leaders on both sides,
the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S WTO BID FACES BLOCKADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  18 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The closer Taiwan gets to the final stage
in its bid for membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), the
larger the blockade it faces, said the director-general of the Board
of Foreign Trade (BOFT) on Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ruey-long said several WTO members have never stopped
voicing opposition to the idea that Taiwan enter the world trade
regulatory body before Beijing does, and BOFT officials may not be
able to carry out their plan as expected.</P>
      <P>For months, BOFT has spared no effort in seeking the WTO's
completion of the process of multilateral review of Taiwan's
membership application before the opening of the November WTO
ministerial meeting in Seattle, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Not until the process is concluded can Taiwan's WTO bid enter the
final stage -- the WTO's pragmatic review of the case, which
represents the last hurdle facing Taiwan's membership application,
said Chen.</P>
      <P>However, now the multilateral review process is in a state of
almost complete rest, which means that Taiwan might not be able to
win WTO membership by the end of this year, as it had targeted as a
goal, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Taipei had pledged to strive for WTO membership no later than the
last day of this year, as part of its effort to boost Taiwan's
standing in a widely opening world trade community.</P>
      <P>In 1990 Taiwan applied to participate in the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), whose successor, the WTO, came into
existence in 1995 and expanded efforts to promote trade
liberalization globally.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA SEEN FUELING ARMS RACE IN NORTHEAST ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct. 18 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia will likely fuel a regional
arms race among Taiwan, mainland China, Japan, and North and South
Korea by upgrading its spy base in Pine Gap, Alice Springs, to be used
in a scaled-down version of the US Star Wars missile defense system,
experts said.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency (CNA) on Monday, Dr.
Gary Klintworth, a former strategist for the Defense Intelligence
Organization and a China-Taiwan expert at Australian National
University, said the new Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system would
become the first step in a new arms race in Northeast Asian countries
because they want to try to outdo each other in missiles and
counter-missile technology.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has already acquired Patriot missiles from the
United States, and they could serve as part of the TMD system.</P>
      <P>But if Taiwan is included in the TMD system, China is expected to
increase production of missiles, creating greater risk to the
Northeast Asian region, Klintworth said.</P>
      <P>"It will be a big challenge to all countries concerned on how to
reduce tensions as a result of such an arms race," he said, adding
that "the mutual risk is likely to increase."</P>
      <P>He said, "The TMD system will not only fuel an arms race, but also
creates instability in the region, which must be handled seriously
and carefully."</P>
      <P>He said the TMD system could proceed soon because Japan, Taiwan
and South Korea have acquired defensive missiles from the United
States, and once the TMD system is installed, it would likely be
upgraded to a National Missile Defense (NMD) system, which is a major
part of the Star Wars program.</P>
      <P>The daily newspaper The Australian on Monday also reported that in
Pine Gap, Australia could indirectly play a role in fueling the arms
race because the spy base there would play a crucial role in the new
TMD system.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted US Air Force Secretary F. Whitten Peters as
revealing that the joint US-Australian base would be more important
in the US early-warning system for detecting missile launches than
the previous base at Nurrungar near Woomera in southern Australia,
which was closed recently.</P>
      <P>The new spy base will have a new Space Based Infrared System
(SBIRS) installed and is due to begin operations in 2004, the daily
reported.</P>
      <P>"We see this as absolutely critical to the functioning of theater
missile defense and ultimately to national missile defense as well,"
Peters said.</P>
      <P>The daily also quoted other analysts as warning that TMD
would spark an arms race as China, Taiwan, Japan and both Koreas
scramble to match each other's ability to fire and defend missiles
potentially carrying nuclear warheads.</P>
      <P>"It's like Russian roulette. The Chinese will say, 'Well OK,
we'll give you a few more chambers in the revolver.' They'll just
increase their production of tactical missiles, and say, 'Guys, we
don't like this, but if you insist on trying to neutralize our
deterrent, we'll have to take appropriate steps to make sure you
don't become a base for US aggression," a senior analyst told the
daily.</P>
      <P>Klintworth said the TMD system could undermine the anti-ballistic
missile treaty, which has served as a major factor in arms control
over the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>The US Senate recently rejected the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, and that could only increase the chance of an arms race
rather than decreasing it, Klintworth told CNA.

    <HEADLINE>US EXPERT CALLS FOR  TAIWAN-QUESTION MEETING ON NEUTRAL TERRITORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To break the ongoing stalemate over
cross-strait relations, Beijing should consider another meeting
between the two side's negotiators on neutral territory, said an
American Asia-Pacific specialist.</P>
      <P>Ralph A. Cossa of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies, recently wrote that Taiwan President Lee
Teng-hui's dramatic "state-to-state relations" statement on July 9
had greatly affected regional stability.</P>
      <P>President Lee back-stepped slightly by assuring Beijing that his
comment referring to how cross-straits dialogue should be viewed
would not be embodied in the ROC's Constitution. While this has not
satisfied Beijing, it appears highly unlikely that Taipei will back
down further. This is sure to keep cross-strait tensions high between
now and Taiwan's March 2000 presidential elections, if not longer,
noted the editor of the CSIS Pacific Forum.</P>
      <P>Cossa pointed out that one consequence of Lee's remarks has been
to put future high-level cross-strait dialogue at risk. The planned
fall visit to Taiwan of Wang Daohan, the head of the PRC's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, will almost
certainly not occur.</P>
      <P>With Beijing's insistence on a retraction of the state-to-state
comment unacceptable to Taipei, one option might be a meeting on
neutral territory such as Singapore or Hong Kong to discuss the
meaning of Lee's comments and their implications for cross-strait
relations, said Cossa.</P>
      <P>"This would demonstrate Beijing's commitment to keep the dialogue
process alive without accepting Lee's position," Cossa stressed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian members of Parliament have
strongly attacked the Defense Department for giving less information
to them than to the US Congress about the Australian-US joint
intelligence base located on Australian soil.</P>
      <P>The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties complained in a report
tabled on Monday that the US Congress has been given much freer
access to information about Pine Gap- a base for detecting missile
launches and seen as a major site for the proposed Theater Missile
Defense system- than Australian MPs have.</P>
      <P>The report demanded that Defense Minister John Moore authorize
his department to provide more information to them on the purpose and
operations of Pine Gap, allow Australian MPs to visit the base, and
provide them with a copy of the secret agreement under which the spy
base operates.</P>
      <P>Under the joint agreement between the US and Australia, the Pine
Gap base is to be used up to November 2008. But Australian MPs and

    <TEXT>
      <P>To minimize Communist China's ability
to interfere with US interests in the Asia-Pacific region, Washington
should explore enhanced defense relations with the nations of
southeast Asia and possibly Taiwan, said a former staff member of the
US House Armed Services Committee Monday.</P>
      <P>Jason Bruzdzinski, in the latest issue of "Defense News" weekly
reported that Beijing's recent decision to deny US military access to
Hong Kong has complicated important planning for US naval and air
operations in the Asia-Pacific, specifically the ability of US forces
to rapidly respond to crises.</P>
      <P>Since May, at least a dozen US Navy requests for port calls in
Hong Kong reportedly have been denied.</P>
      <P>If Beijing's closure of Hong Kong to US combatants is an effort
by Communist China to complicate American defense strategy in Asia,
US policy-makers must shape a multifaceted response, noted
Bruzdzinski.</P>
      <P>The US government should explore enhanced defense diplomacy with
Thailand, Singapore, the Philippines, Vietnam and even Taiwan and
coordinate, with regional friends and allies, "the redirection of
plans and operations to minimize China's ability to interfere with US
regional security and military strategy," concluded Bruzdzinski.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHAIRMAN COMMENTS ON JIANG'S TIMETABLE FOR CHINA REUNIFICATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>None of individuals or either side of the
Taiwan Strait has the right to decide China's future, said the
chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), after mainland
China President Jiang Zemin's revelation on Monday of a timetable for
China's reunification.</P>
      <P>Su Chi made the remarks during a press interview in Taipei on
Monday evening. He stressed that the China dispute can only be
settled through bilateral negotiations between Taiwan and mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government hopes that the two sides will be
reunified in a gradual process, rather than in a situation that sees
one side swallow the other, Su stressed.</P>
      <P>Jiang said in an interview with The Times of Britain that by the
middle of next century, mainland China "will resolve the question of
Taiwan and accomplish the great cause of national reunification by
adhering to the policy of 'peaceful reunification' and 'one country,
two systems' after the successful return of Hong Kong and Macau."</P>
      <P>Su described the statement as being merely a unilateral opinion
of the Beijing authorities, saying if Beijing wants to set up any
timetables it should make one that concerns mainland China's
democratization.</P>
      <P>"We believe it's more pragmatic now for Beijing to formulate a 50
years timetable for the mainland's democratization," Su said.</P>
      <P>If Beijing can resolve its democratic problems, it will face no
difficulties on China's reunification, Su added.</P>
      <P>Jiang seemed to draw a beautiful picture of the mainland's future
in his remarks, in which, however, there were no words about the
process of mainland China's democratization, Su said, noting Taiwan
has been taking the mainland's democratization as the most important
matter in the reunification of China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite Monday's gain of 96.57 points in
the Dow Jones Industrial Index, Wall Street insiders warned that the
New York stock market could get a lot worse before it gets better.</P>
      <P>At the end of Monday's volatile trading, the Dow Jones industrial
average rose to 10116.28 points, while the NASDAQ composite index
tumbled 43 points to 2688,83. During the session, the Dow Jones
industrial average dipped below the psychologically important 10, 000
level several times.</P>
      <P>After last week's devastating 6 percent loss of value, nervous
investors and traders are apprehensive about the week ahead. They see
no end in sight for the current market downturn.</P>
      <P>One reason they pointed to was last Friday's selling pressure
which remained unabated all day, having no end-of-day rally to pare
the losses.</P>
      <P>The scheduled release Tuesday of one of the government's most
important inflation statistics--the consumer price index (CPI)--is
not expected to reduce market jitters, economists said.</P>
      <P>They now expect that the CPI will reflect an inflationary trend
in the US economy, which is bad for corporations as their costs will
go up.</P>
      <P>Higher costs cut into profits, leaving shareholders with lower
earnings than they've been accustomed to during the nine-year-long
bull market. That, too, could contribute to selling pressure this
week.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York, Oct. 18 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Senator Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) warned
Sunday that the official US response to New York's encephalitis
outbreak showed how "woefully under prepared" the country is to
defend itself against biological terrorism.</P>
      <P>While praising the overall local response in containing the
outbreak and minimizing fatalities, Schumer said the state and
federal response was fractured and had revealed "troubling flaws."</P>
      <P>Describing the virus, which is carried by mosquitoes, as a "dry
run" for a biological terrorist assault on a major American urban
center, he said the FBI believes that a biological attack against the
US is "not a matter of if but when."</P>
      <P>The virus has so far claimed six lives and has infected 55
citizens in the New York metropolitan area.</P>
      <P>Schumer disclosed that he will lobby the Feds for a $20 million
funding boost for New York City to maximize local authorities'
ability to respond to a biological or chemical outbreak.</P>
      <P>His comments follow a report in last week's New Yorker magazine
suggesting that New York's West Nile-like fever outbreak was an Iraqi
bio-terrorist attack. Federal sources have denied that.</P>
      <P>He also called on President Bill Clinton to appoint a federal
czar to coordinate all local, state and federal responses, saying
disease-control experts were not necessarily qualified to identify a
possible terrorist threat.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUPPORT FOR QUEBEC SOVEREIGNTY ON THE DECLINE, POLL FINDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  18  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new poll released Monday shows support
for sovereignty is declining in Quebec while support for federalism
is on the rise.</P>
      <P>The poll, sponsored by the Center for Research and Information on
Canada, suggests that the more that sovereignty is identified with
secession and independence, the less likely Quebecers would be to
vote "Yes" in a referendum.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 24 percent of the "yes" supporters in the
1995 referendum describe themselves as less sovereign-oriented these
days. More than 4 out of 10 would switch their vote to "no" if a
referendum were held today.</P>
      <P>The poll shows support for the "yes" side at 44 percent, with 56
percent voting "no." Also, 35 percent of those polled say Quebec
Premier Lucien Bouchard's real motive for campaigning for sovereignty
is to renew federalism.</P>
      <P>Former Ontario premier Bob Rae, a board member of the Center,
said the results indicate Ottawa's "Plan B" on Quebec separatism is
bearing fruit. The plan demands that separatists ask a clear question
if they want to hold a referendum. It also cites the Supreme Court
decision to demand a clear majority of the vote as a prerequisite for
negotiating separation.</P>
      <P>Such a tough stand has had a "sobering effect" on Quebec's public
opinion, telling them that a yes vote in a referendum is not a walk
in the park, Rae said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GUIDELINES FOR EMERGENCY DECREE TO BE SUBMITTED TO LEGISLATURE: LEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The guidelines for implementing the 921
Emergency Decree will be submitted to the Legislature for a review,
and the matter will be discussed by the Cabinet, President Lee
Teng-hui told the press on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The passage of the guidelines was aimed at doing a better job,
not at bypassing the Legislature on the matter, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Lee was on his way to visit the stricken Taichung County, and was
very concerned about the process of the post-quake rehabilitation
efforts. He said the victims' psychological recovery is more
important than material reconstruction.</P>
      <P>The 14-point guidelines were passed on Monday by the Cabinet's
Post-Quake Reconstruction Committee, headed by Premier Vincent Siew,
and scheduled to be handed to the Executive Yuan council for
ratification on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet noted that the straightforward instructions were
designed to iron out disputes over hazy areas of the Emergency
Decree, which was declared by the president on Sept. 25 to clear
financial and bureaucratic obstacles to post-quake reconstruction
efforts.</P>
      <P>The issues addressed include the bidding for construction
projects and the appropriation of civil resources, as well as the
allocation of public land to temblor victims.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers claimed, however, that the executive body was giving
itself free rein to interpret the decree as it pleases, and to dodge
parliamentary supervision by using "guidelines for implementation"
instead of the original "bylaws for implementation."</P>
      <P>The lawmakers were referring to the prime minister's former
assertion that there was no need for a legislative review, which has
sparked much controversy.</P>
      <P>Legislators from the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) insisted that all administrative instructions attached to laws
must be submitted to the Legislature as long as they involve civil
rights and responsibility.</P>
      <P>The DPP have already proposed to turn the issue over to the
Council of Grand Justice for an interpretation of the constitution,
according to reports.</P>
      <P>Although still insisting the guidelines did not surpass the scope
of the Emergency Decree, Siew has asked the justice minister to "look
into" the question of submitting them to the legislature, said a
government spokesman.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLL FINDS TAIWAN ADOLESCENTS DO NOT ADOPT CONTRACEPTION MEASURES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent global survey found that 49
percent of adolescents in Taiwan didn't adopt any safety measures the
first time they had intercourse, far higher than the world average of
28 percent.</P>
      <P>Durex Condom Co. interviewed 4,200 adolescents and young adults
aged between 16 and 21 in 14 countries about their sexual experience.
Countries covered in the survey included: Canada, France, Greece,
Poland, Spain, Taiwan, Britain, Italy, the Czech Republic, Germany,
Mexico, Singapore, Thailand and the United States.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the company has concentrated on
studying young people's sexual behavior. It was also the first time
that the annual Durex global sex survey has included samples from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Of the 19 topics researched, Taiwan ranked first in four
categories -- the average age of first sexual activity, the ratio of
those who didn't use any contraceptives the first time they had
intercourse, the ratio of those who said they lacked access to
contraceptives during their first sexual activity, and the ratio of
people who expect to wait to have sex until after marriage.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, the average age when Taiwan respondents
first had sex was 17, compared to the world average of 15.9 years.</P>
      <P>Survey results showed that 49 percent of those interviewed in
Taiwan said they didn't take any contraceptive measures the first
time they had intercourse, compared to the world average of 28
percent.</P>
      <P>As many as 62 percent said the main reason behind their failure
to adopt contraception measures was that they had difficulties
acquiring contraceptives, higher than the world average of 38
percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 43 percent said they expect to have sex only after
marriage, far higher than the world average of 16 percent.</P>
      <P>Wen Jung-kuang, president of the Republic of China Sexual
Education Association, said survey results show that Taiwan's sexual
education over the past two decades has been a failure.</P>
      <P>Wen said in many other countries, condom purchase is as
convenient as purchasing sanitary napkins. Noting that using condoms
in sexual activities is just as important as fastening safety belts
while driving or aboard airplanes, Wen said Taiwan should legalize
the installment of automatic condom vending machines as soon as
possible.</P>
      <P>The global survey also found that friends were the main source
for most young people's initial information about sexual education
and relevant information. Only 22 percent said they obtain relevant
information from school education programs.</P>
      <P>An encouraging finding was that 28 percent of the respondents
said they would prefer to receive sex-related knowledge from their
parents. Wen said parents should help their children cultivate
correct concepts and attitudes toward sex.</P>

      <P>Three members from the Nobel
Prize-winning humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders said here on
Tuesday that any person with a loving heart can assist earthquake
survivors in psychological rehabilitation.</P>
      <P>Dominique Leguiller, director of the Paris-based organization's
Far Eastern Affairs Bureau, and his two Japanese colleagues -- Moto
Imaki and Daisuke Sekiguchi -- made the remarks at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>The trio arrived in Taipei Monday evening at the invitation of
the Kaohsiung City Government in southern Taiwan, They accepted the
invitation before their organization was declared winner of the 1999
Nobel Peace Prize.</P>
      <P>Noting that the organization stresses a spirit of "without
border," Leguiller said since they are in Taiwan, they will put
themselves in Taiwan people's shoes. "We hope to help local
earthquake-affected people regain a peaceful mind," he added.</P>
      <P>Leguiller and his two Japanese colleagues traveled to Tungshih,
a mountain township in central Taiwan which was hit hard by the Sep.
21 devastating earthquake, on Tuesday afternoon to meet with local
relief workers and officials.</P>
      <P>Leguiller, who has joined psychological counseling services in
the Kobe area since the Japanese port city was rattled by a
7.1-magnitude earthquake in January 1995, said middle-aged people
were the suicide high-risk group after a natural disaster.</P>
      <P>"As people aged between 40 and 50 face more difficulties
rebuilding thier shattered lives and careers, they are most likely
to commit suicide after they lost dearest family members,
properties and even jobs in the unexpected calamity," he
explained.</P>
      <P>The trio will visit local public health bureaus, hospitals,
temporary medical service centers and schools to offer their
experience and expertise in helping quake-affected people regain
confidence and hope.</P>
      <P>In addition to Tungshih, the delegation will also visit other
hardest-stricken areas in central Taiwan which bore the brunt of the
921 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some other members of the humanitarian relief
group, whose French name is Medicins sans Frontieres, will come
to Taiwan to assist in psychological rehabilitation services later
this month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE BUDGET SHOULD ONLY INCREASE, SAYS PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Tuesday that
the national defense budget should not be cut further considering
Taiwan's situation and future development.</P>
      <P>In an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan, Siew
admitted that the annual national budget has been relatively low
compared with actual needs, but owing to increasingly heavy financial
burdens in the social welfare and other sectors, the defense budget
must remain at the current level.</P>
      <P>He personally believes that the defense budget should only be
increased rather than slashed, Siew added when answering a question
by Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Parris Chang.</P>
      <P>When asked by Chang what the administration thinks about Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu's recent offering to
travel personally again to the mainland in an attempt to resume the
cross-strait dialogue, Siew said Koo's willingness to make the trip
fully demonstrates the Republic of China's sincerity and savoir-faire
in exchanges with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Last Thursday, Koo, Taiwan's appointed top negotiator with
mainland China, offered to travel again to either Shanghai or Beijing
to meet his mainland Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, so as to
resume the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue at a time when Wang is
unlikely to come to Taiwan for a fresh round of Koo-Wang meetings.
Wang is the chairman of the quasi-official Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The two sides have agreed since last year that Wang will come to
Taiwan this autumn to return Koo's mainland visit made last October.
Wang's proposed visit, however, was killed by Beijing authorities
after President Lee Teng-hui redefined the cross-strait ties as a
"special state-to-state relationship" in July. Beijing considered the
new definition as a move promoting Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Siew gave a thumbs-up to Koo's offering, saying that it fully
reflected the fact that Taiwan remains flexible, rather than being
rigid, in cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Answering another question raised by DPP Legislator Tsai
Ming-hsien about mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin's Monday
remarks in London that China's unification will be achieved in the
first half of the next century, Siew said there is nothing new in
Jiang's remarks, as he merely repeated Beijing's "one nation, two
systems" term, while still refusing to renounce using force against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Siew stressed that Taiwan's long-observed stance -- that the ROC
is a sovereign nation seeking gradual and peaceful reunification with
the mainland -- has not changed, and never will.</P>

      <P>Beijing will not use force against Taiwan
rashly because military action would have a huge negative impact on
its plan to realize its strategic goal, said a strategy researcher
from the mainland.</P>
      <P>The researcher noted that in the wake of Taiwan's massive Sept.
21 earthquake, Beijing had toned down its vitriolic attack on
President Lee Teng-hui following President Lee's redefinition of
cross-strait ties as "state-to-state relations" in July.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing displayed a "goodwill" gesture promptly after
Taiwan's killer quake, noting that Beijing President Jiang Zemin
expressed his sympathy toward quake-affected victims.</P>
      <P>The strategist said Beijing had also cut short both its attack on
Lee for his remarks and its new round of military maneuvers slated to
take place after Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>He told the Hong Kong-based Ming Pao Daily News that all these
actions indicate that Beijing is seeking a chance to ease the tension
in cross-strait relations triggered by Lee's remarks.</P>
      <P>Beijing is doing so because it could pay an exorbitant price for
military action, which could lead to a complete moratorium on its
economic development and send military spending skyrocketing, he
said.</P>
      <P>He added that in case of war, the mainland would have to mobilize
more than 1.5 million elite troops from among its armed forces,
thousands of combat planes, hundreds of combat vessels and
submarines, and employ hi-tech equipment.</P>
      <P>The researcher said wartime military spending could surpass
US$100 billion. The cost of replacing damaged equipment and post-war
reconstruction would be huge. Existing and potential foreign
investments in the mainland could also disrupted, which he said would
deal a heavy blow to mainland China's plan to realize its strategic
goal.</P>
      <P>He noted that Beijing's military action would invite widespread
condemnation of the mainland. Beijing would be deemed as belligerent
and would face tough sanctions and blockades from other nations,
seriously jeopardizing its political standing internationally.</P>
      <P>Beijing's flexing of its military muscle and its determination
to use force would cause panic reactions among Southeast Asian
nations. They would seek support from western powers while
strengthening their solidarity.</P>
      <P>The strategist noted that the first step for mainland China to
realize its strategic goal is be to become a regional power, but that
aspiration might not be realized in the face of strong opposition
from Southeast Asian nations.</P>
      <P>He also stated that Japan would react strongly to mainland
Chinese military action, saying that Japan could strengthen its
strategic alliance with the United States, increase the number of US
armed forces stationed in Japan, move faster toward becoming a
military power, and pressure other countries to cut off sales of
much-needed advanced military technology to the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to his analysis, the strongest reaction would come from
the Untied States, which could intervene by providing information and
military assistance. US transport planes and vessels could be hit by
their mainland counterparts, triggering direct conflict between
Beijing and Washington.</P>
      <P>But the strategist also said that though the cost would be huge,
Beijing would not care about any negative impact or risks if faced
with a Taiwan declaring independence.</P>

      <P>Taiwan produced a total of 26.93 million monitors in the first
six months of 1999, representing an increase of 28.5 percent compared
with the same period last year. Of those only 5.35 million units were
assembled domestically, a decrease of 17.2 percent in comparison with
the same period a year ago; the remaining 21.58 million units were
assembled in Taiwanese factories abroad, an increase of 48.8 percent
over the previous year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan monitor makers used factories in mainland China to
assemble a total of 11.16 million monitors in the first half of the

    <HEADLINE>CETACEAN KILLER-TURNED CONSERVATIONIST GETS LENIENT PENALTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan,  northeastern  Taiwan,  Oct.  19  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Ilan-based fish
vendor who used to be a cetacean butcher has in recent years become a
wildlife conservationist who actively protects fish and other sea
animals.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court on Tuesday overruled an Ilan District Court
verdict and granted Lin Tsung-ho a jail term of eight months with a
three-year probation after considering his remorse for his crime of
butchering cetaceans, or sea mammals such as whales and dolphins.</P>
      <P>The court felt that Lin's remorse is evidenced by his aggressive
participation in conservation efforts, including the founding of the
Chung Hua Cetacean Society.</P>
      <P>Lin, the owner of a small fish shop handed down from his father
in the eastern coastal city of Ilan, was prosecuted in 1995 on
charges of killing and selling cetaceans, and was sentenced to eight
months' imprisonment by the Ilan District Court.</P>
      <P>During the trial, Lin admitted that he bought from fishermen fish
that could have included whale and dolphin and then resold the
products -- mainly fish cuts -- to other fish vendors in central and
southern Taiwan as produce for human consumption or as animal feed.</P>
      <P>Lin, however, said that he didn't know what fish were endangered
species or what were protected animals.</P>
      <P>After he was charged, Lin said he realized that he had committed
crimes of killing endangered and protected animals that he had not
considered for years, prompting him to learn more about the zone
where cetacean hunting and killing is prohibited.</P>
      <P>Lin then started to educated himself by picking up books about
cetaceans, approaching zoologists to learn more, and founding the
Chung Hua Cetacean Society.</P>
      <P>His efforts led to his becoming a cetacean conservationist in
less than four years and earned him fame as cetaceans' friend in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Lin's wife, he frequently dropped what he was doing
at work or home, day or night, in order to pitch in as a volunteer
for rescue efforts at beaches where baby whales or dolphins were
grounded.</P>
      <P>Now as a fish vendor/conservationist, Lin has called on relevant
government agencies to work out policies seeking a balance between
commercial fishing and conservation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said
Tuesday it has offered to work closely with the United Nations and
the World Bank in the reconstruction and rehabilitation of East
Timor.</P>
      <P>In a recent letter to UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and to
World Bank President James Wolfensonhn, ADB President Tadao Chino
stressed ADB's commitment to working closely with donor agencies in
providing assistance to East Timor. "We are all aware of the deep
human tragedy that has affected East Timor. And it is appropriate
that all concerned donor agencies coordinate to provide both
humanitarian as well as development assistance quickly."</P>
      <P>The remarks follow a donor's meeting on development assistance to
East Timor that was held Sept. 29 at the World Bank in Washington. A
joint donor assessment mission to East Timor is planned for later
this month.</P>
      <P>ADB will focus its assistance on rehabilitation and development,
rather than relief. It is interested in supporting governance and
public sector management, building capacity for the delivery of
essential services such as health, education, power and water, the
rehabilitation of infrastructure, and the development of community
and local government.</P>
      <P>Full-fledged ADB assistance to East Timor would only be possible
after East Timor's membership in the Bank could be arranged. In the
interim, the ADB is examining a suitable funding arrangement for
assistance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG MAYOR HEADS INSPECTION MISSION TO TUNGSHA ISLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh headed a
fact-finding mission to visit the Tungsha Islands, also known as
the Pratas, in the South China Sea on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 50-member mission, composed of municipal officials,
oceanographers, journalists and business executives, will inspect
tourist resources and facilities on the small islet as reference for
drawing up a comprehensive blueprint for Tungsha's future
development.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the city government has formed a special Pratas
Islands development task force to promote the archipelago's
development.</P>
      <P>The city hall has also asked the central government to offer
NT$29 million (US$911,950) in subsidy for conducting a feasibility
study on building a wharf and other tourist facilities on Tungsha
Island, the mayor said.</P>
      <P>This was Hsieh's second fact-finding trip to Tungsha since he
assumed the mayorship late last year.</P>
      <P>The Pratas comprise Tungsha Island and two coral reefs, but only
Tungsha is always above water. The archipelago is located in a
strategically important position some 240 nautical miles
southwest of the southern Taiwan port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>On June 30, 1989, the Republic of China government set up a
national monument on Tungsha Island to assert its sovereignty
over the archipelago and Tungsha has since been under the
jurisdiction of the Kaohsiung city hall.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the city government plans to designate special areas
for scuba-diving, underwater sighteeing, aquaculture and animal
farming. "We'll also develop ocean liner tourist service," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsieh went on to say that the city government has tentatively
decided to commission the Chinese Diving Development Association to
draft a comprehensive blueprint for developing scuba-diving and
underwater sighteeing services in the Tungsha area and National
Sin Yat-sen University and National Kaohsiung Institute of Marine
Technology to come up with a detailed plan for aquacultural
development.</P>
      <P>Noting that Tungsha not only occupies a strategically important
position but also has beautiful scenery, Hsieh said the city
government will adopt a "low density" development strategy to
preserve its natural environment.</P>
      <P>"We'll organize package tours and develop the area into a new
tourist paradise in the South China Sea," Hsieh pledged.</P>
      <P>As many mainland Chinese and Hong Kong fishing boats have
often used illegal fishing methods in the nearby region, Hsieh said
the city govenrment plans to seek the assistance of the ROC's
marine police to protect fishery resources in Tungsha area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ARMY ENGINEERING SERVICES HIGHLY COMMENDED BY JAPANESE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung  County,  central  Taiwan, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of
China Army's Engineering Services (ESA) work ethic, efficiency, and
compassion for the earthquake victims have highly impressed the
Japanese who are in Taiwan to join in post-earthquake relief efforts.</P>
      <P>A Japanese engineer who came to central Taiwan earlier this month
as part of a mission to set-up prefabricated housing units, said he
was impressed with the expertise of the ESA, describing their
efficiency as five times greater than that of their Japanese
counterparts.</P>
      <P>According to ESA Chief Chu Yu-ling, members of the Engineering
Services succeeded in building several Japanese-made prefabricated
houses located in Tungshih Township three hours before any Japanese
engineer arrived.</P>
      <P>The Japanese fabricated houses, formerly used by Japanese
citizens who were left temporarily homeless in the devastating Kobe
earthquake on Jan. 17, 1995, were donated to Taiwanese earthquake
victims by the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>The engineering service members, working in units comprised of
150 persons each, are now capable of building a house within two
hours, compared with the three-and-a-half hours it took at first, Chu
noted.</P>
      <P>Speed was not the only concern, however. The ESA members have
also encountered other problems during the building process,
including instruction literature written only in Japanese,
incompatible fastening structures and the wrong power line systems.</P>
      <P>Chu said the job could not have been achieved as quickly 20 years
ago. Thanks to the increasingly-higher level of education among new
recruits, things have become easier. For example, he said, when the
ESA recruits, many of whom majored in engineering in college,
realized that all the instructions were in Japanese, they immediately
summoned in members who had studied Japanese in college to serve as
translators.</P>
      <P>The most noteworthy aspect of the ESA team which deserves respect
is the high morale that the members have shown, said Chu. The high
morale has been reflected in the compassion the servicemen have
demonstrated to their fellow countrymen who have endured so much
physical and mental suffering in the aftermath of the quake, he
added.</P>
      <P>A total of 150 prefab housing units are expected to be completed
by the end of this month, accommodating some 600 people in the scenic
military complex of Hsinyuan near Tungshih.</P>
      <P>Some 100 more similar units are then expected to be erected at
the same complex in the days that follow, according to Chu.</P>
      <P>In addition to these batches of Kobe prefabs, other ready-made
houses have also been built elsewhere by other charitable and public
interest organizations in central Taiwan, the area that was hardest
hit in the Sept. 21 magnitude 7.3 earthquake.</P>
      <P>The Buddhist Tzu Chi Compassionate Relief Foundation is building
wooden cabins for the earthquake victims, some of whom broke into
tears of gratitude upon seeing their cozy new homes.</P>
      <P>Other prefabricated houses are also being erected under the
auspices of the Taipei-based TVBS.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan was urged Wednesday to shelve plans
to build its fourth nuclear power plant in consideration of the
island's high vulnerability to earthquakes.</P>
      <P>Ritsuya Okuno, a representative from Japan's anti-nuclear
organization, the No Nukes Asia Forum, called on Taiwan to use the
Sept. 30 uranium leakage accident in Tokaimura as a lesson to avoid
further development of nuclear power plants on the island for the
sake of people's safety.</P>
      <P>Okuno said that if a leak of lethal uranium can occur at a
processing plant in Japan, a nation widely considered to have high
safety standards on nuclear safety, this indicates that one cannot be
too careful where nuclear power is concerned. Similar accidents could
happen in Taiwan, he warned.</P>
      <P>Okuno was invited here by Taiwan's anti-nuke group, the Taiwan
Environmental Protection Union, to lobby against the Taiwan Power
Company's plans to build a fourth nuclear power plant on the island.</P>
      <P>The Society Promoting Taiwan's Sustainable Development, a sub
group at the Legislative Yuan, on Wednesday sponsored a press
conference to review Taiwan's nuclear safety standards in the wake of
the devastating earthquake which wreaked havoc on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>According to members of the supra-party group, cracks were found
on roads in the vicinity of the proposed site of Taiwan's fourth
nuclear power plant after the Sept. 21 quake. And even worse, five
fault lines have been discovered within five kilometers of the
location. If Taipower insists on going ahead with construction, the
company is risking the lives of all Taiwanese people for the sake of
questionable business interests, said members.</P>
      <P>In addition, they pointed out, Taipower has not followed nuclear
safety laws which state that nationwide nuclear safety drills must be
held at least once a year. Taipower's three current nuclear power
plants have only held a total of five nuclear disaster prevention
drills over the last nine years, they noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'CHICKEN SOUP' AUTHOR PROMOTING SPIRITUAL REHABILITATION IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The author of the best-selling book,
Chicken Soup for the Soul, is expected to arrive in Taipei on
Wednesday night to embark on a three-day effort to promote spiritual
rehabilitation in Taiwan in the wake of the devastating Sept. 21
earthquake.</P>
      <P>Mark V. Hansen, who has written an extensive series of books on
spiritual renewal -- of which Chicken Soup for the Soul is the best
known -- is expected to train some 2,000 Life Line volunteers in
Taiwan who will promote spiritual healing around the island, mainly
in earthquake-stricken areas in central Taiwan, according to
sponsors.</P>
      <P>Hansen will preside over a press conference on Thursday and a
fund-raising speech luncheon on Friday, both in Taipei for the
"Spiritual Reconstruction, Taiwan Rebuilding" Project, said a
spokesman for "Success" magazine, co-sponsor of the activity. Another
sponsor of the activity is the ROC Life Line International.</P>
      <P>Hansen, whose "chicken soup" books have sold over 55 million
copies worldwide with versions in more than 50 languages, is also
expected to meet with President Lee Teng-hui, Vice President Lien
Chan and Premier Vincent Siew during his three-day stay, the sponsors
said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices closed 0.3 percent
lower Wednesday as the local bourse was overshadowed by the recent
gloomy US NASDAQ index, resulting in continual consolidation.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index shed
26.32 points to close at 7,666.64 on a turnover of NT$71.88 billion
(US$2.26 billion).</P>
      <P>Heavy selling in stocks of microchip makers amid falling DRAM
chip prices also invited more losses in the market while the
institutional investors were the major sellers of the DRAM chip
shares, the amount of selling-off stocks totaling NT$2.2 billion,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>It was normal to see the bourse consolidating after it had failed
several times to break the 8,000-point level and investors could
expect a rebound in the near future if the index succeeded in
sustaining a 7,600-point level, dealers added.</P>
      <P>Iron and steel issues took the lead among other share categories,
posting 1.25-percent gains, while the plastics sector, textiles
sectors and the chemical issues suffered the largest losses, each
reporting losses of 2.39 percent, 1.53 percent and 1.22 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Declining stocks led advancing stocks 303 to 140, with 81 shares
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market shed 4.02 points to close at 177.33
on a turnover of NT$7.34 billion.</P>
      <P>Shadowed by the shoddy performance of the stock market, all TAIEX
International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index Futures) --
except November futures -- posted losses, among which next March
futures suffered the largest losses.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for October moved down 12 points to close at
7,678 with 841 contract transactions. Those for November climbed 1
point to finish at 7,700 with 1,821 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for December declined 15 points to close at
7,690 with 13 contract transactions, while those for next March shed
125 points to end at 7,720. Those for next June dropped 31 points to
end at 7,724 with two contract transactions.

    <HEADLINE>QUAKE HAS LITTLE IMPACT ON TAIWAN'S FOREIGN TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The devastating "921 Earthquake" resulted
in heavy damages to Taiwan; however, it has had little impact on the
island's export and import performance, said Ministry of Finance
(MOF) officials on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The island's exports and imports values in the first half of
October registered US$5.63 billion and US$5.97 billion, respectively,
or a growth of 23.5 percent and 41.9 percent, as compared with the
same period last year, according to statistics released by the MOF.</P>
      <P>The robust performance of the island's export and import sectors
indicated that the impact of the quake on Taiwan's foreign trade was
minimal, said MOF officials.</P>
      <P>The MOF officials estimated that there will be no problem in the
island's imports and exports maintaining a double-digit growth in
October as a whole, with the exports expected to register a growth of
20 percent. However, it's too soon to say whether or not a trade
surplus can be retained, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Assessing Taiwan's foreign trade performance in the first half of
October, MOF deemed that the temblor's effect has been limited. The
exports value is expected to achieve a growth of more than 6.8
percent in 1999.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, since the import sector is subject to additional
factors, its performance will be harder to predict; however, a growth
of 4 percent is likely, noted the officials. A trade surplus in 1999
would thus reach the level of over US$10 billion, the MOF officials
forecasted.</P>
      <P>The island's exports value from Jan. 1 to Oct. 16, 1999 totaled
US$92.6 billion, while its imports value totaled US$84.03 billion, or
an increase of 7.2 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively, on an
year-on-year basis, resulting in a trade surplus of US$8.57 billion.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the worst havoc occurred in the island's
agricultural areas and civilian residences in central Taiwan, the
temblor's impact on industrial manufacturing capacity as a whole was
rather limited, despite the imposition of a short period of electric
power rationing, the MOF officials pointed out.</P>
      <P>This being the case, Taiwan's foreign trade has been little
affected by the temblor.</P>
      <P>The island's foreign trade performance is likely to remain brisk
in the near future, as long as the international economic environment
maintains its resurgence and the domestic political situation remains
stable, the officials remarked.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY BACK TO NORMAL OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly one month after a killer earthquake
jolted Taiwan, Taiwan's stricken manufacturing industry is expected
to resume normal operations in the second half of October, according
to Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs conducted a questionnaire on
earthquake damage among 7,200 manufacturers after the earthquake on
Sept. 21. A survey report based on the returned questionnaire
indicates that 55.93 percent of the participating manufacturers
mentioned damage to their facilities and a considerable drop in
business turnover in September and October.</P>
      <P>Business turnover of the manufacturing industry in September and
October would be NT$69.1 billion less than expected, Wang said.</P>
      <P>While many machinery makers in central Taiwan saw their factories
damaged by the strong jolt, electronics and information industries in
northern Taiwan were not able to maintain normal operations for weeks
due to blackouts and rationed power supply following the disaster.
Taiwan Power Co.'s North-South power transmission system was severely
damaged by the earthquake.</P>
      <P>The survey report states that it took the manufacturers an
average 24 days to resume their normal operations, and by the second
half of October, most disrupted production lines would be able to run
again, according to Wang.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATOR URGED TO ADDRESS PROBLEM RESULTING FROM ID LOSS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of people who reported the loss
of their identification cards this year could hit 800,000 due to the
massive Sept. 21 earthquake, a legislator said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Independent Legislator Yeh Hsien-hsu urged the related authority
to take note of the situation, which he said could endanger social
stability and financial operations.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks in a press conference, which government
officials and people who have lost their ID cards were invited to
attend.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by Yeh, the cases of reported ID
loss numbered more than 607,000 in 1997 and 1998, respectively.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the number of ID losses is expected to reach a new
high due to the magnitude-7.3 temblor, which has claimed more than
2,300 lives and resulted in extensive property damages.</P>
      <P>Yeh asked the police, financial and other related agencies to
address the question squarely.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-an mentioned that he lost his ID last November, and
applied to get a new one in December. But in June this year, he
received a subpoena from a district court concerning frauds, which
has created great trouble for him.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he also received a letter from a cellular phone
company asking him to pay huge phone bills or face legal action --
even though he didn't own a cellular phone. His bank accounts were
also frozen because of the court cases.</P>
      <P>Tsai Tsai-feng, deputy director of the Population Administration
Department of the Ministry of the Interior, said that those who lost
their IDs should reapply and related agencies could take advantage of
the data provided by the ministry to check out the identities of the
person.</P>
      <P>Liang Yuan-ming, an official of the Investigation Division of the
Criminal Investigation Bureau, would not comment on reports that
stolen ID cards could be sold on the black market for up to
NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>He said that the missing IDs were being used to get forged
passports, credit cards, bank accounts, and vehicle licenses for
criminal activities.</P>
      <P>Liang said more careful checking of IDs could help mitigate such
incidents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S.   SCIENTISTS  DISCOVER  MORAL  COMPASS  OF  HUMAN  BRAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  20 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>American scientists have discovered the
moral compass of the brain -- which helps a person to tell right from
wrong -- through a study of two young criminals.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald quoted Professor Antonia Damasio of the
University of Iowa College of Medicine as saying that the criminals,
who suffered damage to a vital region of their brains as infants,
grew up to become irresponsible, disruptive and unsociable because
the damaged region was crucial to acquiring emotional knowledge and
to learning from mistakes.</P>
      <P>The finding raises important questions about the biological
origins of human empathy and is likely to be fodder for creative
defense lawyers, who may argue that some criminals cannot be held
responsible -- because a brain injury prevented them from learning
the normal rules of social and moral behavior, the daily reported.</P>
      <P>The vital brain region is the prefrontal cortex, just behind the
eye sockets and above the bridge of the nose, according to the
finding published in the latest issue of the journal, Nature
Neuroscience.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'TAIWAN THANKS THE WORLD' COMMERCIAL PUBLICIZED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A TV commercial produced by the Republic of
China government to express its gratitude for foreign aid to Taiwan's
earthquake relief was introduced to the press in Taipei on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Beginning with words in black and white, which convey that Taiwan
was hit by a quake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale on Sept. 21,
the commercial features a helpless boy who is assisted by other kids
from different races after his construction of toy blocks is shaken,
and collapses.</P>
      <P>The commercial ends with a single sentence: "Taiwan Thanks the
World".</P>
      <P>At the news conference, Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu
indicated that the 30-second, English-language commercial will be
broadcast on Cable News Network (CNN) from Oct. 20, at prime time.</P>
      <P>From that day through Oct. 24, the commercial, titled "Taiwan
Thanks the World," will be aired worldwide 21 times, Hu said, noting
this is the first time that the ROC government has put a commercial
on CNN.</P>
      <P>Expressing Taiwan's heartfelt gratitude for foreign assistance in
its post-quake relief works was the sole goal of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) when producing the commercial; no political
images, signs, or language were permitted, Hu stressed.</P>
      <P>The island has received much foreign-relief aid and many messages
of concern and condolence since it was rattled by the 7.6-magnitude
quake on Sept. 21, which killed over 2,400 people, and made thousands
injured and numerous homeless, Hu said.</P>
      <P>According to ministry tallies, more than 110 countries around the
world have either sent rescue teams, donated relief goods or funds,
or expressed concern via telephone or written messages in the wake of
the killer tremor's ravages.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan people who have benefited from assistance have asked
the MOFA to transmit their appreciation to the island's foreign
friends, while President Lee Teng-hui has also requested that an
official act extending publicly the ROC's gratitude for foreign aid,
Hu noted.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the MOFA decided to voice all the thanks through the
commercial, and publicize it at the one-month anniversary of the "921
Earthquake", the minister said.</P>
      <P>As overseas Chinese have also made generous donations to various
post-quake relief and reconstruction projects, the commercial has a
Chinese version, titled "Taiwan Thanks All Overseas Chinese for Their
Assistance and Concern", which will be aired on a Los Angeles-based
satellite television station in the same five-day period, according
to MOFA officials.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, French and Spanish versions of the commercial will
also be made for broadcast in Latin America, Europe and Africa, the
officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan capital investment in semiconductor
production is expected to surpass that of the United States to be
ranked No. 1 worldwide in the year 2001, according to an estimation
by the Semiconductor Producers Association of the United States.</P>
      <P>According to the association, Taiwan cast US$4.2 billion into
semiconductor production in 1999, an amount only behind those of the
United States and Japan. It was estimated that Taiwan will invest
US$12.7 billion in such production next year, to follow only US
investment. In the year 2001, Taiwan is expected to throw US$15.4
billion into related industries, surpassing the United States to
become the No.1 semiconductor investor.</P>
      <P>A meeting of 11 Taiwan semiconductor makers, organized by the
China External Trade Development Council (CETRA), was held in Silicon
Valley, California, on Oct. 19. More than 300 US business
representatives also attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>One of the meeting's organizers said the production strategy and
strong investment power of Taiwan semiconductor producers have drawn
the attention of both US and Japanese semiconductor industrialists.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan semiconductor manufacturers have played an
important role by producing wafers using the OEM (original equipment
manufacture) method. The OEM style of making wafers accounted for 54
percent of global production. It will account for 70 percent next
year.</P>

      <P>A man who had been found guilty by the
mainland Chinese Anshan City Intermediate People's Court of
kidnapping and killing a city councilwoman from Kaohsiung, Taiwan,
was executed Wednesday, according to Beijing's official Xinhua News
Agency.</P>
      <P>Yang Rongsong was executed following rejection of his appeal to
Liaoning Provincial Higher People's Court. He and three accomplices
had been found guilty of kidnapping and robbing Wei Tien-kang, a
Taiwan businessman, and of kidnapping and killing his girlfriend Lin
Ti-chuan, a Kaohsiung city councilor, in 1998.</P>
      <P>Liaoning Provincial Higher People's Court also upheld the
original ruling regarding three other offenders involved in Lin's
case.</P>
      <P>Huang Shidong, Zhao Chuang and Zhang Shifeng were sentenced to
prison terms ranging up to life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>Another man, Lee Guangzhi, who is suspected of being the
mastermind behind the crime, is still at large.</P>
      <P>Lee allegedly encouraged the four to kidnap Lin and Wei while the
two tourists were in Dalien City, Liaoning Province, in July 1998,
because Lee and Wei previously had a business dispute.</P>
      <P>The gang of five brought Wei and Lin to a nearby city and kept
the couple in their custody. Lin died during the detention from being
injected with an overdose of some kind of drug used to prevent them
from escaping.</P>
      <P>Wei escaped from the house where they were being held and
reported the case to mainland Chinese police.</P>
      <P>Anshan City Intermediate People's Court handed down the original

    <HEADLINE>POLL SHOWS LUKEWARM SUPPORT FOR US SECURITY ASSISTANCE TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  19  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opinion poll shows that just over
one-fourth of US citizens think their government should continue to
help Taiwan defend itself against possible attack from mainland
China.</P>
      <P>When asked whether the United States should continue to help
Taiwan defend itself through arms sales and other means, even if it
hurts US relations with mainland China, only 26 percent of the
American public replied "Yes."</P>
      <P>According to the survey, released Tuesday in Washington, 47
percent think the United States should keep a low profile and let the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>Twenty-one percent favor improving Washington-Beijing relations
in order to increase US leverage in influencing both sides to find a
peaceful solution.</P>
      <P>Susan Shirk, deputy assistant secretary of state for Asia and the
Pacific, said she was "struck" by what she considers "a very small
percentage of the public" supporting continued security assistance to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Yet our policy is to continue to transfer defensive articles to
Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act, and the administration remains
very strongly committed to that," she said.</P>
      <P>Richard Bush, chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, said
that while these particular survey results do not reflect the true
picture, they do show that the American public needs more education.</P>
      <P>While nearly half of the public thinks the United States should
keep a low profile on the cross-strait issue, only 17 percent of the
so-called Luce Scholars believe this is the right approach.</P>
      <P>More than half of the current or former scholars, 55 percent,
support improving relations with mainland China as a way to achieve a
peaceful solution to cross-strait differences. Each of these scholars
has spent a year working in Asia at different times since 1974.</P>
      <P>The survey, released by the Henry Luce Foundation, also shows
that 35 percent of the American public supports US defense of Taiwan
if the island comes under attack from the mainland. The majority, 52
percent, disapprove of such action.</P>
      <P>Among the Luce Scholars and the "better informed" public, 50
percent think the United States should come to Taiwan's aid. Among
the two groups, 26 percent and 40 percent, respectively, think
otherwise.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted in June, indicates that 51 percent of
Americans consider mainland China "primarily a threat that needs to
be contained.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted with telephone interviews of a national
sample of 1,200 people aged 18 and older in the United States. The
margin of error is plus or minus 2.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The foundation also sent questionnaires to 375 current and former
Luce Scholars, and 174 responded.

    <HEADLINE>JAPANESE AWARD GOES TO PRES. LEE'S BOOK ON TAIWAN STANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The book "With the People Always in My
Heart," written by President Lee Teng-hui of the Republic of China,
has been announced a winner of Nanahei Yamamoto Prize for its
presentation of Taiwan's stance to readers, the award's
screening committee said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The award, along with 3 million Japanese yen in prize money, will
be presented on Nov. 11 in Kyoto under the sponsorship of the PHP
Research Institute of Japan.</P>
      <P>A representative of the screening committee said one of the main
reasons for the book's selection was that it presented Taiwan's
stance to readers clearly. Another reason was Lee's precise, moderate
criticism of Tokyo, Beijing and Washington.</P>
      <P>The prize was established by the institute in 1991 in
commemoration of noted Japanese critic and writer Nanahei Yamamoto,
who passed away earlier that year at the age of 69.</P>
      <P>Professor Tetsuo Yamaori, rector of Hakuho Women's Junior
College, will speak at the award presentation ceremony and detail the
reasons why the book was chosen for the award.</P>
      <P>The book was translated into Japanese by the PHP Research
Institute and put on sale in June 1999. The institute also made an
English translation and introduced it in North America and Europe on
Sept. 22 of this year.</P>
      <P>Lee is the third foreigner to be honored with the prize since it
was established eight years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING RED CROSS SOCIETY SENDS ADDITIONAL US$ 500,000 FOR QUAKE RELIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By C. K. Liu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Red Cross Society of mainland China
sent an additional US$500,000 to Taiwan Wednesday for post-quake
relief, said a mainland official.</P>
      <P>Zhang Huaijun, an official of the Taiwan Affairs Office under the
State Council, said that China's Red Cross has to date received
cash and material aid worth more than 30 million renminbi, adding
that a single charity performance in Fuzhou garnered more than 20
million renminbi.</P>
      <P>The donated materials included tents, quilts and pharmaceuticals,
Zhang said.</P>
      <P>He said that if Taiwan allows shipment of the goods from the
mainland, it could mobilize people to donate more materials according
to the needs of Taiwan, included cement, timber, steel and gravel for
reconstruction projects.</P>
      <P>Zhang also refuted Taiwan media reports that Beijing has been
hindering rescue and relief efforts of foreign countries by saying
that they need prior approval before sending aid to Taiwan, saying
such reports are "untrue and distorted."</P>
      <P>Since the devastating Sept. 21 temblor, which registered a
magnitude of 7.3 on the Richter scale, the mainland China Red Cross
has sent US$800,000 altogether. The first sum of US$100,000 was sent
on Sept. 24, and the second of US$200,000 was sent Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>Taiwan accepted cash donations from the mainland but has declined

    <HEADLINE>A UNIFIED CHINA CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED WITH A DEMOCRATIZED MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  19 (CNA)
(By Kwang-chun Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One unified China can only be realized
after the People's Republic of China (PRC) becomes more democratic,
like the Republic of China (ROC), said a Taiwan official on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Yu Yuh-chao, director of the Information Division of the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in New York, said China can be unified
only after Beijing has achieved real success in political
democratization, economic liberalization and social pluralism, just
as the Republic of China on Taiwan has done.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks in a speech given at the Center of Asian
Studies of St. John's University in New York City.</P>
      <P>In his speech, titled "Towards a Democratic Unified China:
Creating a Win-Win-Win Situation for Taipei, Beijing and Washington,"
Yu analyzed cross-strait tensions and offered solutions for reaching
the ultimate goal of peaceful reunification of China.</P>
      <P>It is Beijing's hardball stance that has led to the diplomatic
isolation of 22 million people on Taiwan, has stalled reunification
talks and has caused unnecessary PRC military threats, Yu contended.</P>
      <P>"From historical, legal and political viewpoints," he pointed
out, "the ROC on Taiwan has never been a part of the PRC and still
isn't."</P>
      <P>Talking about the definition of the "one China" principle, Yu
touched on the agreement reached in 1992 by Taipei and Beijing as
"one China: with each side being entitled to its respective
interpretation."</P>
      <P>Beijing, however, has twisted this agreement around to fit its
view of the situation, sticking to the "one China, two systems"
formula that has been applied to Hong Kong and is unacceptable to
Taipei, he said.</P>
      <P>Until Beijing can acknowledge parity, that the Republic of China
is a sovereign state and not a "renegade province," Yu emphasized,
reunification talks can neither reach the next level nor the goal of
"one China."</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui's recent "special state-to-state
relations" statement when referring to the cross strait relationship
was not an attempt to declare Taiwan independence or incite Beijing,
but merely a description of a historical, legal and political
reality, he explained.</P>
      <P>Yu made it very clear that Taipei is still earnestly committed to
its National Guidelines for Reunification, but that "one unified
China" can only be realized after the People's Republic of China has
achieved real success in political democratization, economic
liberalization and social pluralism.</P>
      <P>Washington plays an important role in the Taiwan Strait issue to
help maintain stability in the region, he added.</P>
      <P>However, Washington must also be careful of potential
entanglements with its own policy. President Clinton's "three noes"
policy is moving US foreign policy closer to Beijing, Yu warned.</P>
      <P>He suggests that Washington follow a "parallel engagement policy"
that engages both Taipei and Beijing on a balanced and cordial basis
to help find a peaceful and democratic solution to this tense
situation.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Jade Mountain, the highest mountain in
Taiwan and Northeast Asia, moved 44 centimeters north-northwest
following the massive earthquake last month, said an official of the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI) on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Yuan-hsu, director of MOI's Department of Land
Administration, made the remarks after the island's deadliest temblor
this century caused the movement of earth's crust and moved
mountains.</P>
      <P>But Chang said that the height of the mountain, at 3,798 meters,
has undergone no obvious changes.</P>
      <P>Recent reports had claimed that the famous mountain grew 28
meters due to compression of the earth's surface plates during the
quake on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Chang also said the magnitude-7.3 temblor resulted in extensive
damage in Miaoli, Nantou, Taichung, Changhua and Yunlin counties,
adding that the terrain and landscape of quake-stricken areas were
seriously distorted due to the moving of mountains, landslides and
cracking.</P>
      <P>Due to the changes, the MOI has decided to reexamine the terrain
and redraw cadastral maps within one month for reference during
post-quake reconstruction and urban rejuvenation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN ROLE IN EAST TIMOR PEACEKEEPING OPERATIONS DEFENDED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The representative of the Australian
Commerce and Industry Office in Taipei, Sam Gerovich, on Wednesday
defended Australia's role in leading the International Force in East
Timor (Interfet).</P>
      <P>He dismissed as "completely baseless and untrue" some media
reports from Indonesia and elsewhere that Australian Interfet troops
have committed violations of human rights in East Timor.</P>
      <P>"Australia acted neither unilaterally nor aggressively in the
establishment of an international peacekeeping force," said Gerovich.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Interfet's operations are "helping
Indonesia in a period of difficulty" and are "aimed at the
restoration of peace and not directed at any one group."</P>
      <P>Gerovich stressed that "Australia's central objective is a
peaceful and lasting solution in East Timor," adding that "our
actions are motivated by concerns about the suffering and destruction
in East Timor, and an interest in regional stability."</P>
      <P>Regarding the accusations of human rights violations by
Australian troops, he pointed out that such rumors are "clearly part
of a disinformation campaign by certain elements aimed at
discrediting Australia and Interfet, and are patently untrue."</P>
      <P>He said "Interfet has clear rules of engagement and regulations
regarding criminal offenses by Interfet personnel, and in the event
of any such allegations being made, there are transparent and
established procedures for investigating them."</P>
      <P>Gerovich stated that Australia responded to a United Nations
request to lead the multinational force -- a request which was made
following the agreement of the Indonesian government.</P>
      <P>He said Australia's policy stance does not run counter to
Indonesian policy on East Timor, and Australia's hope is that the
current Interfet operations will be succeeded quickly by a "Blue
Helmet" UN peacekeeping force.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>To the surprise of Australia, Indonesia
and many other countries worldwide, the Indonesian People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) on Wednesday elected Abdurrahman Wahid to
the nation's top post.</P>
      <P>The near-blind Muslim leader was chosen to be president of the
world's largest Islamic country, in its first democratic election
since the nation became independent in 1945.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation on Wednesday night, Sudjati Djiwandono, a leading
political expert in Jakarta, said he believed bilateral relations
between Australia and Indonesia, which have worsened over the East
Timor crisis, will not deteriorate from their current state.</P>
      <P>He said that under Wahid, Indonesia is expected to return to
stability not only politically, but also economically.</P>
      <P>He said Wahid will be able to restore Indonesia from its current
state of chaos, and he expects the new leader will request military
reform in the next five to six years.</P>
      <P>Popularly known as Gus Dur, the 59-year-old Wahid, described as a
long-term democracy campaigner, chairs the largest Indonesian Muslim
organization -- Nahdlatul Ulama.</P>
      <P>He not only has a good relationship with other Muslim
organizations, but also is on good terms with other parties,
including the PDI-P led by Megawati Sukarnoputri.</P>
      <P>The MPR is scheduled to elect Indonesia's vice president on
Thursday, and Djiwandono expected Megawati could be elected to the
second highest post in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>But Wahid's election to the presidency sent a disturbing signal
to Australia because the he has in recent weeks emerged as a
trenchant critic and opponent of Australia.</P>
      <P>Wahid's criticism led Australian Prime Minister John Howard to
say Tuesday that he hoped Megawati would win the election so that
Canberra could mend its strained relations with Jakarta.</P>
      <P>Australian leaders, including Howard, had not commented on
Wahid's victory as of Wednesday night.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard on
Wednesday welcomed the decision by Indonesia's parliament to allow
independence for East Timor, ending 24 years of rule that culminated
in tumultuous crisis, bringing an Australian-led UN peacekeeping
force to maintain law and order.</P>
      <P>Howard told the House of Representatives that the Australian
government welcomed the decision of the People's Consultative
Assembly on Wednesday, saying all parties should look to the future
in rebuilding a new nation in East Timor.</P>
      <P>In Darwin on Wednesday, Xanana Gusmao, the independence leader
tipped to be the president of the new country, said, "I was very glad
and it has been a long wait for us on today's results."</P>
      <P>Gusmao is expected to soon leave Australia for Dili, where he
will install a civil administration under the supervision of the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>In Bangkok on Tuesday, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer told reporters that Australia's standing in Asia was being
enhanced rather than damaged by its leading role in the UN
peacekeeping force in East Timor.</P>
      <P>His comment was in response to the criticism by Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad that Indonesia had not killed thousands and
thousands of East Timorese since its military intervention in 1975.</P>
      <P>Downer met Thai leaders, including the prime minister and foreign
minister, to express Australia's willingness to relinquish its
leading role in the UN peacekeeping force in East Timor to Thailand.</P>
      <P>Howard told Parliament on Wednesday that it would cost more than
US$330 million for Australia to finance the dispatch of 4,500
soldiers to East Timor and that military experts believed the figure
could exceed US$600 million in the current fiscal year, which ends on
June 30, 2000.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 1999 Taiwan Trade Fair
opens in Port-au-Prince, Haiti on Wednesday with the products of 14
Taiwan manufacturers on display.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China ambassador to Haiti, Chiou Jong-nan,
Haitian Foreign Minister Fritz Lonchamps, and the chairman of the
Haitian Chamber of Industry and Commerce jointly presided over the
opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>The products on display included travel necessities, automobile
accessories, sports products, cellular phone accessories, textile
products, body building materials, bicycles, motorcycles,
refrigerators, air conditioners, wireless telephones and cameras.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening reception, Chiou said bilateral ties
between Haiti and the ROC have achieved great progress in recent
years, however, he added, the volume of two-way trade between the two
nations has been very small. He hopes that the trade fair can act as
a catalyst for the promotion of bilateral trade.</P>
      <P>He also hopes that the already stable Haitian-ROC relations will
be further strengthened through trade and investment.</P>
      <P>Speaking on behalf of the government of Haiti, Lonchamps wished
the trade fair success and said he believed that bilateral relations
between the two nations would surely be promoted through the trade
fair.</P>
      <P>ROC Premier Vincent Siew led a delegation of government officials
and enterprise representatives to Haiti in January, resulting in
contact between the industrial and commercial sectors of the two
nations.</P>
      <P>The ROC sponsored an international trade and travel fair in
February to invite countries it has formal diplomatic relations with,

      <P>ROC exports to Haiti in 1997 totaled US$11 million, while
Haitian exports to the ROC in the same year was zero.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taoyuan District
Court on Thursday sentenced a Malaysian man to life in prison on
charges of heroin trafficking and possession, according to local law
enforcement sources.</P>
      <P>Lee Tuck Wah, a Malaysian national, was arrested by police at
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan on July 16 for
smuggling several bricks of prime-grade heroin from Hong Kong to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee admitted that he was working as a courier for a
Malaysia-based drug pusher named "Ah Liao" in exchange for 5,000
Malaysian Ring (approximately US$1,300). Lee traveled to Hong Kong on
July 14 and there was handed the drugs by a Hong Kong man before
flying to Taiwan on July 16.</P>
      <P>The defendant was caught red handed by CKS customs officials with
heroin bricks weighing about 700 grams located in two pockets of his
blue jeans, the Taoyuan judges said.</P>
      <P>A life sentence is relatively lenient, according to the judges,
who pointed out that the maximum sentence for heroin trafficking
under ROC law is death.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESS AS USUAL ONE MONTH AFTER QUAKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  20  (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Just one month after a killer earthquake
struck central Taiwan, the manufacturing industry has returned to
normal and foreign buyers have been quick to show support for
Taiwan's industry, many announcing beefed-up procurement plans,
economics officials at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
Canada said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials said Taiwan's prudent macroeconomic management and
the flexibility and adaptability of its SMEs had helped the island
weather the 1997 Asian financial crisis. These very same traits
facilitated a return to near pre-quake production levels barely two
weeks after the quake, they added.</P>
      <P>The Taipei officials said Taiwan's key infrastructure, including
ports and highways, were largely untouched by the tremor, so it was
possible for the industries to resume shipment schedules very soon
after the quake.</P>
      <P>As to concerns that Taiwan would lose orders to overseas
competitors, they quoted a spokesman with IBM Taiwan Corp. as saying
Taiwan manufacturers' ample R&amp;D capabilities, production expertise
and close ties with foreign suppliers would assure continued support
from international procurement offices. IBM Taiwan itself has
announced it will step up procurement in the fourth quarter,
fulfilling the company's 1999 purchase projections of more than US$3
billion.</P>
      <P>Briefing local media on the post-quake economic situation in
Taiwan, the TECO officials said Taiwan's economic fundamentals remain
strong. "Industrial losses across the board have been less than
expected and have been caused by power outages rather than actual
structural or physical damage," they said.</P>
      <P>In the longer term, they said, domestic demand will be stimulated
by the expansion of the construction sector beginning next month. As
Standard and Poor's Taipei-based analyst John Bailey said, "increased
government expenditure and investment will provide an impetus for
stronger economic growth next year."</P>

Congress on Wednesday to provide more funding to establish earthquake
alert systems as effective as those in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Waverly Person, director of the US Geological Survey's National

responding to an earthquake.</P>
      <P>He cited the contrast between Turkey and Taiwan's earthquake
response, saying that "in Taiwan, relief efforts moved much more
quickly, aided significantly by the modern seismographic alert system
it had in place."</P>
      <P>Person pointed out that Taiwan maintains a network consisting of
approximately 1,000 digital seismic recording instruments - the
highest concentration of modern digital accelerographs in the world.</P>
      <P>Person concluded that only southern California's earthquake alert
system is "almost as fast and almost as good as Taiwan's." Those in
other earthquake prone areas in the US, such as the San Francisco Bay
area, Seattle, Portland, and Salt Lake City are all vulnerable.</P>
      <P>He said, "in these regions, the US network is comparable to the
Kandilli Observatory network in Turkey and is currently far inferior
to the network operating in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Person described Taiwan as a "trend setter" in the delivery of
earthquake disaster information and called upon the US Congress to
provide more funding to establish a model as effective as Taiwan's.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The New York-based group Human Rights in
China, Wednesday called on world leaders to voice their concerns over
China's human rights situation when holding talks with Chinese leader
Jiang Zemin during his six-nation tour.</P>
      <P>The human rights organization, founded in 1989 by a group of
Chinese scientists and scholars, said in a press release that
Beijing's authorities are currently conducting the most ruthless
repression of dissent since the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square
Massacre.</P>
      <P>The most visible examples of persecution include the crackdown on
Falungong members and the harsh sentencing of China Democracy Party
members and other activists for up to 13 years, the document stated.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of thousands of China's most marginalized people,
including migrants, the homeless, street children and the mentally
ill, are being arbitrarily detained in ongoing "clean-up" campaigns
to rid the streets of those deemed undesirable by urban authorities,
said the report.</P>
      <P>Jiang's current tour to the United Kingdom, France, Portugal,
Morocco, Algeria and Saudi Arabia provide a valuable opportunity for
countries to voice their concerns over China's human rights situation

    <HEADLINE>FORMER TAIWAN CONSCRIPTS TO TRAVEL TO JAPAN TO DEMAND COMPENSATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of elderly Taiwanese who were
conscripted by the Japanese during World War II will travel to Japan
Saturday to demand cash compensation for long-overdue salary
payments.</P>
      <P>The seniors, most of whom were forced to work as soldiers,
wartime engineers or assistants, were issued vouchers by the Japanese
military during the war as token payment for their labor.</P>
      <P>On the vouchers, which are all of the same denomination of 100
Japanese yen, writing clearly indicates that they can be exchanged
for an equivalent value of Japanese currency, said New Party
Legislator Chang Shih-liang, who will accompany the group to Japan.</P>
      <P>During the war, 100 yen was equivalent to three months' salary
for a primary school teacher.</P>
      <P>Chang said people from Hong Kong have demanded Japanese
ompensation for similar vouchers, based on a rate 200 times the
vouchers' wartime face value.</P>
      <P>If the former conscripts from Taiwan make the same compensation
request to the Japanese government, it would translate into a
combined cash compensation of 40 billion yen, based on holdings of
the approximately 2,000 surviving former wartime military slaves from
Taiwan, whose vouchers have a combined face value of about 200
million yen, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Tai-li, an expert in wartime Japanese credit
documents, including those of military and civilian postal deposits,
life insurance premiums and unpaid wages, the Japanese military
vouchers from the 1940s were not circulated in Taiwan, even though
Taiwan was under Japanese rule during World War II.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese conscripts received the Japanese military vouchers
elsewhere, such as mainland China, Hong Kong and areas in Southeast
Asia, where they were forced to fight for and do civil engineering
work for the Japanese Imperial Army, said Chen.</P>
      <P>Chang and the Taiwanese group are expected to meet
representatives of the Tokyo-based Japan-ROC Dietmen's Council and
other lawmakers and political heavyweights to lobby for the
compensation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EARTHQUAKE DOESN'T CAUSE IMMEDIATE EXODUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the heavy loss of human life and
property, the Sept. 21 killer earthquake did not cause a panic exodus
of Taiwan residents, according to an official of the Ministry of the
Interior.</P>
      <P>Liu Min-chien, director of the ministry's Department of
Population Administration, said that not only could political or
economic factors lead to a large number of emigrants, natural
disasters could also cause people to move away.</P>
      <P>The earthquake and fear for one's life might cause some residents
in Taiwan to emigrate. Since it takes time to review documents and
compile statistics, the number of such emigrants would not be
apparent right away, said Liu.</P>
      <P>The official said it was understandable that immediately after
the disaster, some people might have wanted to leave the island on a
temporary basis for fear of aftershocks. However, the Sept. 21
earthquake didn't seem to have caused such a panic exodus. Statistics
released by the Exit &amp; Entry Bureau indicate that between Sept. 20
and 30, the bureau registered 249,356 exits and 255,161 entries.</P>
      <P>On average, 24,000 people went abroad each day after the
earthquake, mainly for tourism. Only on Sept. 23 was the number of
exits higher -- over 30,000 -- because many people had previously
booked overseas trips for the Mid-autumn Festival holidays.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, worries about the island's political
status and social environment have caused quite a few Taiwan people
to emigrate. Statistics compiled by the Ministry of the Interior show
that between 1990 and 1998, a total of 181,976 people emigrated to
the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa,
the five most-favored destinations for emigrants from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The year 1996 registered the largest number of emigrants to the
five countries at 22,747. It is believed that Beijing's missile tests
using Taiwan as the hypothetical enemy had worried many residents. In
1997, the figure remained high at 20,017. Fear of crime was said to
be the reason for that exodus.</P>

      <P>The chief Taipei liaison officer in Los Angeles, Yuan

      <P>It was the second time that Operation USA has sent material
relief aid to Taiwan since the devastating magnitude-7.3 earthquake
struck Taiwan on Sept. 21, killing 2,300 people, injuring 8,700 and

Operation USA dispatched several hundreds of tons of medicine and
medical care items.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, Neil Frame, chief of logistics of Operation
USA, said the powdered milk, including 20,000 pounds of whole-fat
powdered milk and 24,000 pounds of skimmed, was a token of the
friendship and concern that the American people feel for the people
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Frame said an Operation USA mission will go to Taiwan next month
to visit quake-affected areas so as to acquire first-hand knowledge
about the disastrous aftermath of the devastating earthquake.</P>

Vice Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu, who is also the executive director of the Cabinet's

ready-to-be-built residences currently under construction totaled
4,900 units, which seems to indicate a slight oversupply.</P>
      <P>However, a miscalculation was made regarding distribution of
prefabricated houses in quake-stricken areas, Liu noted, adding that
the government will coordinate distribution and make readjustments so
that a better balance can be achieved.</P>
      <P>A meeting was held by the PQRC Wednesday on issues concerning the
assembly of prefabricated houses as well as their distribution.
Officials of the Council of Agriculture under the Executive Yuan also
delivered a briefing at the meeting on the situation of dangerous
slopes and measures against landslides.</P>
      <P>Liu told the press after the meeting that more than 300 units of
prefabricated homes have been finished to date by the armed forces,
who have spent a combined total of over 1 million hours working on
relief projects. The provisional residences, assembled with materials
from Japan, were deemed better than expected by those who have
already moved in.</P>
      <P>Liu further indicated that a total of 4,500 units of
prefabricated houses can be finished by mid-November. The first batch
of prefabricated houses contained some household electric appliances
that had been donated by the Red Cross Society, and the government
will encourage other groups to make similar donations for the next
set of homes, he added.</P>
      <P>Regarding preventive measures against landslides, officials of
the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau under the Council of
Agriculture pointed out in the meeting that there are 16 places where
slopes have collapsed and landslides have occurred, each measuring
over 10 hectares.</P>
      <P>Academic researchers have been working on the matter to avoid a

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down Thursday as
investors' confidence waned in the final moments of the session and
eroded solid early gains.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index dipped
11.74 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 7,654.9 on a turnover of
NT$69.29 billion (US$2.18 billion).</P>
      <P>The index opened 1.6 percent higher, boosted by an overnight Wall
Street rally, where the Dow Jones index jumped 1.84 percent and the
technology-heavy NASDAQ index bounded 3.72 percent, and by news that
the Ministry of Finance was again mulling over the feasibility of
cutting the operational tax on banks.</P>
      <P>Dealers said that Thursday's turnover was even smaller than
Wednesday's NT$71.88 billion, and it indicated that local investors
were too cautious to place much faith in the new rally on Wall
Street.</P>
      <P>In the short term the local bourse is expected to experience
consolidation or even fall further to around the 7,400-point level

suffered the largest losses, reporting 1.71-percent and 1.65-percent
losses, respectively.</P>

unchanged.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market shed 1.5 points to close at 175.83 on
a turnover of NT$9.17 billion.</P>
      <P>Shadowed by the shoddy performance of the stock market and weak
investor confidence, most TAIEX International Weighted Price Index
Futures (TAIEX Index Futures) -- except next March and next June
futures -- posted losses, among which November futures suffered the

      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for November moved down 17 points to close at

    <HEADLINE>RICE-GROWING AREA TO SHRINK BY 50,000 HECTARES AFTER WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In order to help balance the huge debt of
the Food Regulating Fund, Taiwan plans to decrease the area used for
growing rice by 50,000 hectares when Taiwan joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO), said an agriculture official on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official of the Council of Agriculture under the Executive
Yuan said rice-growing areas would be decreased by 20,000 hectares
before Taiwan enters the WTO, with a further reduction of 30,000
hectares after admission, he said.</P>
      <P>The Food Regulating Fund, which was founded to regulate the
market price of rice, has accumulated NT$10 billion in debt resulting
from repeatedly purchasing farmers' rice at much-higher-than-market
prices since it was founded in the 1960s.</P>
      <P>The reduction in rice-growing areas would help balance rice
production and the market, he said, adding that the annual volume of
rice stored in Taiwan should be kept between 280,000 and 470,000
metric tons.

    <HEADLINE>ESTRADA HAILS WAHID'S ELECTION AS INDONESIAN PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Oct.  21  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine President Joseph Ejercito
Estrada expressed confidence Thursday that the election of
Abdurrahman Wahid as Indonesia's new president will usher in
political stability in the world's fourth largest country.</P>
      <P>"On behalf of the Filipino people, I want to congratulate the
people of Indonesia for having elected a new president, President
Wahid," Estrada said in an interview with reporters after delivering
the keynote address to the 13th General Assembly of the Pacific
Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) in Makati City.</P>
      <P>"And I think this will start the political stabilization of the
nation," Estrada added.</P>
      <P>Wahid, better known by the nickname Gus Dur, meaning "teacher of
his people," was elected by Indonesia's 700-member assembly
Wednesday, replacing B.J. Habibie as president of the world's largest
Islamic country in terms of population.</P>
      <P>It was the first free and contested election for the head of
state in Indonesia's 54 years of independence.</P>
      <P>The new Indonesian leader, who was left half-blind after
suffering at least two strokes in recent years, is committed to
democracy and pledged to push for better international trade and
political relations.</P>
      <P>Indonesia's political and economic stability have been challenged
by violence, instigated by anti-independence militia at the alleged
direction of the armed forces, that erupted after the people of East
Timor voted overwhelmingly to break free from Indonesia, which had
illegally annexed and then brutally ruled the former Portuguese
territory for 24 years.</P>
      <P>Estrada had dispatched Philippine soldiers to East Timor to join
a United Nations force of peacekeepers from countries such as
Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada.</P>
      <P>Regarding a security arrangement for the Asia-Pacific region,
Estrada proposed that nations explore the options of: revitalizing
the ASEAN Regional Forum, expanding the mandate of the ASEAN Plus
Three (mainland China, Japan and South Korea) Summit, and creating a
new security mechanism altogether.</P>
      <P>Estrada emphasized that a new forum should be given the mandate
and the capability to undertake preventive diplomacy,
conflict-prevention and conflict-resolution initiatives.</P>
      <P>He noted that the new forum's function should not be limited to
responding to ongoing disputes but also preventing or resolving
conflicts peacefully before they worsen into armed confrontation.

    <HEADLINE>FORMOSA GROUP'S MERCURY-TAINTED SLUDGE ALLOWED TO STAY IN KAOHSIUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  southern  Taiwan,  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) under the Executive Yuan decided
Thursday to allow Formosa Group's notorious mercury-contaminated
sludge to remain stored in Kaohsiung Port warehouses for another year
until December 31, 2000.</P>
      <P>This was the fourth time the EPA granted such permission to
Formosa Group since the sludge was repatriated from Cambodia last
April.</P>
      <P>The last period of permitted storage expired on Oct. 19. The EPA
gave the nod to Formosa Group's request for another year of storage
after the industrial giant offered a sum of NT$50 million as
collateral and a document promising that the conglomerate is trying
to seek an import license from a third country.</P>
      <P>Officials of Kaohsiung Port have requested that Formosa Group
strengthen protection measures to prevent further contamination from
the toxic waste.</P>
      <P>Some 4,000 metric tons of mercury-contaminated sludge were
brought back to the island from Cambodia, after Formosa Group's
attempt to rid itself of the industrial by-product was foiled by
protest over the dangerous nature of the material.</P>
      <P>The toxic sludge is now stored in 357 containers at Kaohsiung
Port's Pier No. 63.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  21  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An analyst with the National Security
Council (NSC) said Thursday that Taiwan and mainland China are likely
to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO) next spring.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ying-wen, a member of the Consultation Committee under the
NSC, made the remarks while delivering a report at the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council on the WTO issue and the prospects of
cross-Taiwan Strait economic relations.</P>
      <P>It is quite difficult for Taiwan and mainand China to join the
WTO this year, because no concrete draft for protocol for mainland
entry has been completed, she said.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Tsai pointed out, mainland China is required to
engage in bilateral talks with more than 20 WTO countries before its
entry.</P>
      <P>Judging from the time required for the entry procedures and to
solve other related problems, she predicts that Taiwan and mainland
China will probably be able to enter the WTO at the same time next
spring.</P>
      <P>Regarding future development of cross-strait economic and trade
relations, Tsai said that "political judgment" will play a major
role.</P>
      <P>She noted that even after Taiwan has joined the WTO, Taipei might
not completely lift restrictions on establishing direct trade,
transportation and communication links with the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ESTRADA RENEWS CALL FOR ASIA-PACIFIC SECURITY ARRANGEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Oct.  21  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine president Joseph Ejercito
Estrada renewed his call Thursday for Asia-Pacific nations to
establish mechanisms for an effective political and security
cooperation arrangement.</P>
      <P>Estrada urged the creation of an agreement that would encompass
not only containment of potential flash-points in the region but also
non-military concerns such as stamping out transnational crime.</P>
      <P>Speaking before the 13th General Assembly of the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council held in Makati City, Estrada underscored the
importance of founding an Asia-Pacific regional security agenda to
ensure sustained economic growth and quality of life.</P>
      <P>Estrada expressed concern over the tension in the Taiwan Strait,
missile development on the Korean Peninsula, nuclear buildup in South
Asia, and recent developments in South China Sea, which he said, are
"potential flash-points" in the region.</P>
      <P>The Philippines, along with mainland China, Vietnam, Taiwan,
Malaysia and Brunei, are involved in a territorial dispute over the
Spratly Islands located in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>Regarding a security arrangement for the Asia-Pacific region,
Estrada proposed that nations explore the options of: revitalizing
the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), expanding the mandate of the ASEAN
Plus Three (mainland China, Japan and South Korea) Summit, and
creating a new security mechanism altogether.</P>
      <P>Estrada emphasized that a forum should be given the mandate and
the capability to undertake preventive diplomacy, conflict-prevention
and conflict-resolution initiatives.</P>
      <P>He said the region's security agenda should also cover
cooperation to eradicate terrorism and other transnational crimes
such as drug trafficking, money laundering, and trafficking in women
and children.</P>
      <P>Estrada stressed that governments of East Asia must strive for
greater transparency and must push for reforms to strengthen
corporate governance, including tougher bankruptcy laws and greater
corporate disclosure and accountability.</P>
      <P>He said his vision of the Asia-Pacific region in the next century
includes the following:</P>
      <P>-- A spirit of openness and partnership through ASEAN, with APEC
as the major vehicle for promoting multilateralism;</P>
      <P>-- Domestic structural reforms and international initiatives to
remodel the global financial system and prevent another financial
crisis; and</P>
      <P>-- Greater regional cooperation accompanied by a common East
Asian currency and market.

    <TEXT>
      <P>US Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.,
chairman of the House Science Committee, has canceled a planned trip
to the US-PRC Joint Science Policy Seminar next week in Beijing in
protest of China's suspected misuse of US military and nuclear
technology, and has also urged the National Science Foundation to
withdraw its support for the meeting.</P>
      <P>Sensenbrenner Jr. pointed out that Tuesday's indictments
of McDonnell Douglas Corp. and mainland China's National
Aero-Technology Import &amp; Export Corp. in the sale of equipment routed
to the Communist Chinese military was a major factor in his decision
to cancel his planned participation in the three-day seminar
scheduled to begin Sunday.</P>
      <P>He noted that a seminar involving senior White House officials
and members of the US Congress could "convey to the Chinese a
business-as-usual attitude in our relationship."</P>
      <P>"I don't intend to allow anyone to misinterpret my opposition and
outrage for the illegal efforts made by the Chinese" to obtain
sensitive US military technology, added the congressman.</P>
      <P>He also said he was angry about China's state-controlled media
using a meeting last week between members of the House International
Relations Committee and a visiting delegation of the Communist

      <P>Rising obesity and smoking among young

      <P>Cardiologist Andreas Wielgosz, a spokesman for the foundation,
said the number of deaths from heart disease, already the number one
killer of Canadians, is increasing. He cited the declining fitness of
Canadian youth as the most disturbing factor in the rise and noted
that the number of young smokers is again on the rise after declining
for decades before the 1990s.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SIEW RUSHES TO CHIAYI AFTER QUAKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew rushed to Chiayi
Friday immediately after a magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck the
southern city at 10:19 a.m. to inspect the tremor's impact on the
area.</P>
      <P>As of Friday noon, nearly 60 aftershocks, including one of a
magnitude of 6, were detected in southern and central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The quakes epicenter was 2.5 kilometers north of Chiayi City and
12.1 kilometers beneath the surface of the earth, the Seismology
Center of the Central Weather Bureau reported.</P>
      <P>According to Lu Pei-lin, deputy director of the center, the
Chiayi quake was independent of the devastating magnitude 7.3
earthquake that struck central Taiwan on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>This quake helped release energy building up underground in the
southwest region, which is believed to experience a strong quake
about every 30 years. The last time a killer jolt rattled southwest
Taiwan was in 1964, killing several hundred people and destroying
thousands of houses, Lu added.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Disaster Prevention Center, as of noon
on Friday, 38 people have been reported injured in Chiayi City, the
surrounding county and in Tainan City while 16 people have been
rescued.</P>
      <P>The center has also received 12 reports of damage to structures,
12 reports of fires, 19 reports of gas leaks and 11 reports of people
trapped in elevators.</P>
      <P>Property damage included a fire in National Chung Cheng
University's chemical laboratory and another fire in a chemical
processing plant of the Formosa Plastics Group, both in Chiayi
County, according to reports the center received.</P>
      <P>An aftershock of magnitude 6 was detected around 11:10 with its
epicenter located at 4.9 kilometers north of Chiayi City and at a
depth of 7.2 kilometers.</P>
      <P>The temblor had an intensity of 5.0 in Tainan, Mt. Ali and in
Mingchien in Nantou County, an intensity of 3.0 in the offshore
island of Penghu and the eastern city of Hualien, and an intensity of
2.0 in the central city of Taichung and the southern city of
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The seismologists are checking now to determine whether the quake
was caused by a break in the Meishan Fault Line which is located only
10 kilometers from the epicenter of Friday's quake.</P>

      <P>A ranking official in charge of the

Friday whether Taipei's liaison officer in Hong Kong will be rejected
for visa renewal when the current one expires next month.</P>
      <P>Rumors have circulated that Hong Kong authorities rejected a visa
renewal application filed by Cheng An-kuo, director of Chung Hwa

    <HEADLINE>SHARE PRICES DOWN FOR FIFTH STRAIGHT DAY, INDEX FUTURES LOWER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Affected by a strong earthquake during
Friday's trading session, Taiwan share prices closed down sharply as
investors worried about potential industrial losses and loan defaults
following the magnitude-6.4 quake and its aftershocks.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index dipped
95.27 points, or 1.24 percent, to close at 7,559.63 on a turnover of
NT$72.38 billion (US$2.28 billion). The index has fallen for five
straight sessions, shedding 3.4 percent in all.</P>
      <P>The index opened higher, but soon drifted lower as a selling
frenzy was quickly sparked after the quake due to investor fears that
more losses would be reported by microchip makers. That directly led
the technology sector to dip, ending the day posting the largest
losses among the eight major stock categories.</P>
      <P>The temblor caused several buildings to collapse, and one person
in the southern city of Chiayi was killed. The quake and a series of
aftershocks were felt in many places across Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The plastics and chemical sector as well as textile issues ended
lower amid buying interests that switched to reconstruction-related
shares, such as cement, steel and glass-making issues, which
registered gains of 3.9 percent, 2 percent and 1.68 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Without new leads, investors' concerns over the impact of the
earthquake are expected to push the index down further in the near
term, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Declining stocks led advancing stocks 371 to 110, with 55 shares
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market shed 4.99 points to close at 170.84
on a turnover of NT$7.38 billion.</P>
      <P>Discouraged by the negative performance of the stock market and
weak investor confidence, all TAIEX International Weighted Price
Index Futures (TAIEX Index Futures) posted losses, among which next
March futures suffered the largest losses.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for November moved down 86 points to close at
7,597 with 3,094 contract transactions. Those for December shed 33
points to finish at 7,655 with 64 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for next March dipped 129 points to close at
7,601 with six contract transactions, while those for next June shed
44 points to end at 7,693, with three contract transactions. Those
for next September dropped 86 points to end at 7,865.

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN LAWMAKER TO ASK BEIJING TO STOP PERSECUTING FALUNGONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct. 21 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian lawmaker on Thursday decided to
organize a signature-collecting activity to urge Beijing to stop
persecuting Falungong practitioners in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Rob Anders, a parliamentarian elected from Calgary, Alberta, made
the decision after meeting three Falungong practitioners and hearing
that others in mainland China have been persecuted by Beijing
authorities.</P>
      <P>Anders has contacted several senators and members of the House of
Commons. Most agreed that Beijing is unjustified in its treatment of
Falungong practitioners, which includes: not allowing arrested
practitioners to have defense lawyers, preventing third-party
investigations of whether practitioners were even involved in
unlawful activities, and detaining and torturing practitioners just
for being Falungong believers or for refusing to stop practicing.</P>
      <P>Anders plans to ask the Canadian government to express its
concern to Beijing and to encourage other members of parliament to
jointly sign a letter urging mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
to stop persecuting Falungong practitioners.</P>
      <P>Anders began his efforts on Oct. 1, the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the Beijing regime.</P>
      <P>Anders refused to enter Beijing's consulate in Calgary to extend
his congratulations on the occasion; instead, he stood outside the
consulate with Falungong practitioners and members of Canada's Taiwan
and Tibetan communities to protest Beijing's persecution of human
rights.</P>

Martin, another Canadian lawmaker, yelled "Butcher!" during a

southern Taiwan on Friday morning.</P>
      <P>Four Taiwanese crew members of the ship, Cheng Lung Hsing, are

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI STILL WAITING FOR BEIJING'S RESPONSE TO KOO'S OFFER: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei is still waiting for Beijing's
response to Koo Chen-fu's recent offer that he himself to go to the
mainland to invite his counterpart Wang Daohan to visit Taiwan, said
an official of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chung-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level MAC, was
referring to an assertion made by Zhang Jincheng, secretary-general
of the mainland Association for Relation Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS), that it would be inconvenient for Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo to go to mainland China again if the
"two states" theory is not retracted.</P>
      <P>Zhang made the comment when he attended a press conference held
at the mainland Consulate General in Osaka on Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, MAC's Lin dismissed Zhang's remark as not necessarily
representing Beijing's stance in regard to Koo's initiative,
especially since Zhang was currently traveling abroad.</P>
      <P>Koo, Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, took a new
initiative last week on the occasion of the first anniversary of the
Koo-Wang meeting in Shanghai. The offer was designed to break the
impasse in cross-strait relations resulting from President Lee
Teng-hui's "special state-to-state" statement in July regarding
relations between Taipei and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Wang, chairman of ARATS -- the mainland's semi-official body
which handles contacts with Taiwan -- postponed his visit to Taiwan
indefinitely after Lee's comment. Wang had also said in July that
"the basis of contact, exchange and dialogue between ARATS and SEF no
longer exists."</P>
      <P>Although Beijing has not announced the cancellation of Wang's
visit to Taiwan, originally set for October, it did say that Wang's
trip to Taiwan is impossible if Lee's "two states" theory is not
retracted.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the ARATS secretary-general answered a
similar question on Sunday when he took part in a seminar sponsored
by overseas Chinese in Japan.</P>
      <P>On that occasion, Zhang did not directly answer questions
concerning Koo's offer to meet Wang again in Shanghai; Zhang just
reiterated the old rhetoric by saying that as long as Taiwan does not
retract and continues to insist on the "two states" theory, it will
be impossible for Wang to pay a visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Taipei is still waiting patiently for Beijing's
response and hopes that Beijing authorities seriously consider Koo's
kind suggestion, said SEF Vice Chairman Lin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DEMANDS RESPECT IN TAIPEI-MANILA AVIATION TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan called for aviation negotiations
with the Philippines under the circumstance that the latter respect
the Republic of China's national dignity, a high-ranking official in
transportation affairs said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-cheng, deputy director-general of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA), made the call at a public hearing in Taipei on
the Taipei-Manila aviation rights dispute.</P>
      <P>Relevant officials and private representatives from the two sides
were invited to attend the hearing, sponsored by Taiwan's opposition
Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Eva Eastrada Kalaw, chairwoman of the Manila Economic and
Cultural Center, said the Philippines is hoping that the
misunderstanding that has led to aviation disputes between the two
countries could be resolved in no time.</P>
      <P>However, Kalaw noted, the Philippines is indeed suffering from
"fifth freedom" violations by two Taiwan air companies plying the
Taipei-Manila route in which the airlines picked up more passengers
than allowed from Manila and then flew to third-country destinations
such as the United States.</P>
      <P>She stressed that in the 1996 Taipei-Manila aviation agreement,
the Philippines had only agreed to offer Taipei "third and fourth
freedom" rights, but China Airlines and EVA Airways expanded the
rights without authorization, resulting in severe losses suffered by
the debt-ridden Philippine Airlines (PAL).</P>
      <P>The Philippines has no political motive to trigger such a dispute
by demanding reduction of Taiwan's passenger loads, Kalaw noted,
calling on the two sides to continue their aviation negotiations.</P>
      <P>Chang protested that Manila's accusation is not based on fact. He
said the Philippines has accused Taiwan of violations on flights from
Manila to Taiwan but based their punishment on operations from Manila
to Hong Kong. He called the situation "confusing."</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chang added, Manila authorities have reiterated that
their aviation accord with Taiwan is merely a "civil technologic
agreement" because there are no official diplomatic ties between the
two countries and that the "agreement" can be abolished under
domestic laws of the Philippines.</P>
      <P>If the Philippines would randomly cancel the bilateral agreement
signed with Taipei, Chang asked, "how can we proceed with the
negotiations?"</P>
      <P>The dispute began in late July when negotiations between Taiwan
and the Philippines on the four-year-old air link accord broke down,
with the latter threatening to suspend the agreement to force Taiwan
to accept its demand for a reduction in the number of passengers
allowed to be carried by Taiwan airlines.</P>

      <P>More than 320 people were injured by the
powerful earthquakes that jolted southern Taiwan Friday morning, said
the Central Disaster Prevention and Rescue Center.</P>
      <P>The earthquake, measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale, struck the
Chiayi-Tainan area in southern Taiwan at 10:19 a.m. Friday. It was
followed by a magnitude-6 aftershock at 11:10. The temblors were felt
almost islandwide.</P>
      <P>Officials of the center said that 17 residents were rescued from
the rubble after one house was completely destroyed and 13 others
were half-collapsed.</P>
      <P>The earthquake, with its epicenter pinpointed at 2.5 kilometers
northwest of Chiayi City and its focus, or underground center, at
12.1 kilometers beneath the earth's surface, also damaged several
provincial highways in the Chiayi area, officials said.</P>
      <P>Houses were found to have been damaged in Yunlin and Nantou
counties as well.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui, who was inspecting reconstruction work in
Nantou County on Friday morning, rushed to Chiayi by helicopter that
afternoon to inspect areas rocked by the quake.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC SAYS SEIZURE OF MAINLAND FISHING VESSEL LEGAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The maritime police seizure of a mainland
fishing trawler early Wednesday was legal and essential to maintain
national security as the vessel had illegally entered Taiwan's
territorial waters, said Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin of the Mainland
Affairs Council Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the statement in response to media questions on the
arrest of 18 crew members of an iron-hulled mainland Chinese fishing
vessel, who were detained five miles off the northern Taiwan coast on
suspicion of violating the Statute Governing Relations Between People
on Taiwan and the Mainland, after they approached the crash site of a
twin-seat Mirage 2000-5 jet fighter.</P>
      <P>According to the statute, relevant law enforcement organizations
are entitled to disperse any mainland Chinese vessels entering Taiwan
territorial waters without permission, confiscate their fishing
equipment and detain crew members for no longer than three months.</P>
      <P>The seized vessel, Min Chin Yu No.5318, had been previously
chased off by maritime police after approaching the northern coast of
Taiwan; it reappeared and remained for two days in the area where the
warplane had plunged into the sea.</P>
      <P>The 18 crew members had been sent to northern Hsinchu's
mainlander detention center for questioning.</P>
      <P>Sources revealed that the 18 crew members were unanimous in
denying attempts to salvage pieces of the French-made Mirage 2000-5
or to gain national defense information.</P>
      <P>However, maritime police said they had found advanced satellite
navigational aids and sonar depth-finders in their ship, and a
notebook with detailed notes on sea conditions off western Taiwan was
found in the captain's hold.</P>
      <P>After interrogating the 18 crew members separately, maritime
police said that two of them "did not behave like fishermen" and were
suspected of spying. Police added that further investigation will be
required to determine the facts of the situation.

    <DATELINE>London,  Oct.  22  (CNA)
(By Mark Chun-lin Ou &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwan students demonstrated
Thursday night outside Beijing's embassy in London while mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin gave a banquet for his British hosts.</P>
      <P>One month after Taiwan suffered the most deadliest earthquake in
a century, the Taiwan students, who are studying in Britain,
protested against what they called Beijing's attempts to achieve
political gains from the international community's aid to the island.</P>
      <P>They accused Beijing of illegally assuming sovereignty over
Taiwan by demanding that other countries ask for its approval before
offering aid or dispatching rescue teams to Taiwan, and by
shamelessly thanking them on behalf of the ROC.</P>
      <P>Ironically, the Beijing embassy where Jiang threw the banquet was
the same place where ROC founding father Sun Yat-sen was detained in
1896 by the Ching Dynasty officials.</P>
      <P>In his speech at the banquet, Jiang recalled the episode 103 year
ago as he boasted that the People's Republic of China, 50 years after
replacing the ROC in mainland China, has achieved the goals Sun
struggled for when he overthrew the Ching Dynasty in 1912 and
established the ROC.</P>
      <P>The ROC moved to Taiwan after losing a civil war with the Chinese
Communist regime in 1949.</P>
      <P>Several other groups also demonstrated outside the Beijing
embassy Thursday night, including Tibetan activists and a group of
Chinese dissents.</P>
      <P>Jiang arrived in London on Monday for an official visit and is
scheduled to leave for France on Friday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PURCHASE OF F-16 JET FIGHTERS FROM TURKEY NEVER HEARD BY JASON HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu of the Republic
of China told the local press Friday that he never heard the ROC will
purchase F-16 jet fighters from Turkey as Turkish mass media had
reported.</P>
      <P>Hu also said that relations between Taiwan and Turkey are not
close enough as to be concerned with political affairs.</P>
      <P>According to a Friday news release by the Turkish Trade Office in
Taipei, Taiwan placed an order with Turkey to buy F-16 jet fighters.
A Turkish official told the Central News Agency that the press
release quoted Turkish mass media as reporting the purchase.</P>
      <P>Officials at that office said they did not know when the order
was made, the quantity of aircraft, or the amount of money involved,
since the transaction was not realized through them.</P>
      <P>Hu answered related questions raised by the local press after he
presided over an award presentation ceremony at the ministry on
Friday afternoon.</P>
      <P>"Our relations with Turkey are very common. We just held talks
with them on the relief work, and no political affairs were involved.
I never heard that the ROC will purchase F-16 jet fighters from
Turkey," said Hu.</P>
      <P>In related news, Replica of China Air Force officers denied the
Turkish media reports of the purchase.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the ROC Air Force Command Headquarters said that
by seeing its purchasing budget, one could understand that the Air
Force has no plan at present to procure more F-16 jet fighters.</P>
      <P>"We, the Air Force, purchased F-16 jet fighters directly from the
US aircraft manufacturing company," he said, adding that the US
company might purchase some spare parts and components from Turkey to
be used for F-16 jet fighters Taiwan had ordered.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has purchased 150 F-16 jet fighters from the United
States, but delivery of those jets has not yet been completed, he
added.</P>

(By H. M. Huang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan basketball player Cheng Chih-lung
is expected to sign a contract with a mainland basketball team by the
end of the month.</P>
      <P>Cheng will be the first Taiwan basketball player to join a
mainland team after he officially signs the contract with the
Oriental Sharks, a Shanghai team.</P>
      <P>Cheng passed physical tests Thursday in Beijing, running 3,000
meters in 12 minutes and 50 seconds; the standard time is 13 minutes
and 30 seconds.</P>
      <P>The ace player wore the jersey and sneakers of his new team and
began training with other team members in a Shanghai stadium Friday.</P>
      <P>The mainland team's head coach Li Quioping said that he hopes the
addition of Cheng will increase the team's offensive power.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's professional basketball association will begin
its new season on Nov. 21, and Li is hoping that the team can make it
to the final four this season.</P>
      <P>Cheng's contract with the Sharks will be for only one season.
Cheng is expected to play at least 25 games before the season ends
next March or April.</P>
      <P>All members of the mainland team are under 22 years old, except
for two players, aged 25 and 26. The 30-year-old Cheng will be the
oldest player on the team.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that to play in the mainland will be challenging and
that he hopes to make good marks with the Sharks.</P>
      <P>Cheng also said the team had agreed that he return to Taiwan to
play in a charity game at the end of the month.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who belonged to the Hungkuo team in Taiwan, said
previously that as the Taiwan professional basketball alliance has
suspended games since March, he has to play in the mainland to
maintain his form.</P>
      <P>Cheng, 190 centimeters and 85 kilograms, is a forward, and was
twice elected as the league's most-valuable player. His team Hungkuo
won three consecutive pennants of the Chinese Basketball Alliance

    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a recent US opinion poll
inspired Taiwan to consider strengthening efforts to promote
understanding in the United States, said a Foreign Ministry official
on Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu Chih-kung, director of the Foreign Ministry's North American
Affairs Department, told the media that Taiwan would learn from the
survey.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that only 26 percent of the American people
replied "yes" when asked whether the United States should continue to
help defend Taiwan through arms sales and other means, even if it
hurts US relations with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted last June by the Henry Luce Foundation and
released in Washington on Tuesday, also indicated that only 35
percent of the American public supported US defense of Taiwan if the
island comes under attack from mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Washington,
Susan Shirk, deputy assistant secretary of state for Asia and the
Pacific, said she was "struck" by what she considers "a very small
percentage of the public" supporting continued security assistance to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the results of the survey, Liu said that US
intellectuals usually favor more support for Taiwan than the average
US citizen.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, Taiwan should in the future step up its
efforts in communicating with the American public so as to improve
understanding about Taiwan and the development of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations.</P>
      <P>Liu stated that US foreign policy is normally influenced by the
president, the administrative branch, Congress, opinion leaders and
public opinion.</P>
      <P>He said the survey reflected the current views of the American
public on the Taiwan issue, and it would inspire Taiwan to review its

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippine government is planning to
send more troops to augment rehabilitation efforts in East Timor,
following reports that Philippine soldiers have been receiving praise
for their "excellent" performance.</P>
      <P>"There are 240 Philippine troops there now. Perhaps that number
would increase to 600 in November," Secretary Orlando Mercado of the
Department of National Defense said in a radio interview.</P>
      <P>He said reports of the Filipinos' performance in East Timor have
been encouraging, with their superiors describing their work as
"excellent."</P>
      <P>The Filipinos there, Mercado pointed out, are assigned to
locations away from the border, and they basically engage in
rehabilitation, medical and social work.</P>
      <P>"The feedback is that it's really hard work for our soldiers, who
are engaged in humanitarian work there," he said.</P>
      <P>Mercado added that the Philippines has received assurances that
the government would be reimbursed for allowances and other expenses
of Filipinos stationed there.</P>
      <P>"Don't worry about reimbursement. The Philippines is on top of
the reimbursement agenda. What we want is more Philippine troops be
sent to East Timor," he quoted the officials concerned as saying.</P>
      <P>President Joseph Ejercito Estrada has so far ordered the
deployment of 247 Philippine troops to East Timor in response to a
call by the United Nations and Indonesia for the international
community to help restore normalcy and peace to the area.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Noting that violence has been renounced as
a way to solve disputes in the post-Cold War world, a Taipei official
expressed regret Friday that Beijing has stuck to an outdated mindset
in believing military strength is a panacea for any problem.</P>
      <P>The increasing integration of the world's economies has made it
almost impossible for any state to use force against another without
hurting its own economy, said Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>Instead of force, dialogue and negotiation are the order of the
day during the post-Cold War era, said Lin.</P>
      <P>He also alerted Washington to the subtle shift in Beijing's
stance toward Taiwan, from considering the island as an inalienable
part of its territory to seeing it as a vital post in its universal
strategy.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks after being asked to comment on reports that
Beijing could resort to force in its desperate efforts to bring
Taiwan into its fold.</P>
      <P>The reports quoted a Pentagon study as predicting that Beijing,
if it were to attack Taiwan, could use half of its newly built-up
missile arsenal to knock out the island's air defense system and
command-and-control chain, while keeping the other half to deter
Washington from coming to the island's aid.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of cross-Taiwan Strait relations as a "special
state-to-state relationship" will not be retracted, said Mainland

      <P>Beijing leaders have pressed Taiwan to retract the statement Lee
made in July, as a condition for resuming cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>In an interview with TVBS television station, Su stated that it
is impossible for Taipei to retract the "state-to-state" statement,
because the 22 million people on Taiwan will not accept Beijing's
view that the ROC is not a sovereign country.</P>
      <P>He said if Beijing disagrees with Lee's statement, both sides can
sit down for talks, and even if the talks hit a snag, both sides can
still maintain different views of the definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>Regarding China's future unification, Su noted that Beijing

distribution. However, this number will still represent an 18 percent
increase over the same period last year.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan-made computer memory chip exports account for
12 percent of the global total. However, analysts worry that the fact
that the machines which produce "logic chips" were damaged in the
"921 Earthquake" and will require a long time to be repaired will
have a major impact on the market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN VESSELS ASKED TO HELP SEARCH FOR MISSING TAIWANESE CREW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Maritime police on Saturday enlisted the
assistance of foreign ships to help search for four missing Taiwanese
crewmen after their ship capsized on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Three mainland Chinese crewmen on the ship, "Cheng Lung Hsing,"
have been rescued while four Taiwanese crewmen remain missing
despite a 72-hour search by Maritime police patrol boats.</P>
      <P>Maritime police officer Kuo Chi-tsai said that the families of
the missing crew members suspect there may have been a fight on the
boat and that the three mainlanders might have killed the Taiwanese
crew members and thrown their bodies into the sea.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that the most urgent task now is to locate the missing
Taiwanese crew members so as to help clear up the case.</P>
      <P>He said that the maritime police have asked fishing boats
operating in the Tungsha (Pratas) island group to help in the search
effort. In addition, it is contacting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
to ask for Philippine and other foreign ships to join the search.</P>
      <P>The Tungsha island group is located 240 nautical miles southwest
of Taiwan's southern port city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Cheng Lung Shing, a 19.35-ton tuna boat, was registered in
Tungkang, Pingtung County. It went out to sea on Oct. 11, but was
reported capsized northeast of the Tungsha island group on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese captain Lee Tsai-fa and the other three Taiwanese crew
members went missing, while the three mainland crew members were
rescued by a Kaohsiung fishing boat and later picked up by a maritime
police patrol boat Friday.</P>
      <P>Maritime police said the three mainland crew members were only
slightly injured. The wound didn't appear linked to the possible
scuffle on the boat, they added.</P>
      <P>To ease the misgivings of the families of the Taiwanese crew
members, maritime police are continuing their investigation.</P>
      <P>The three mainland crew members will not be moved to a detention

    <HEADLINE>CHIAYI QUAKE CAUSED BY MEISHAN FAULT SEPARATE FROM "921 QUAKE"</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  23  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The earthquake that hit Chiayi Friday
morning was a separate quake and and neither an aftershock from the
one that rattled central Taiwan on Sept. 21 nor a precursor to
another major earthquake, said an official at the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) on Saturday.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to allay public fears that another major shock is
on the cards, Shin Tzai-chyn, deputy director-general of the CWB,
said that the Friday quake, measuring 6.4 on the Richter scale,
stemmed from the movement of the Meishan fault which runs
from north to east through Chiayi.</P>
      <P>This was substantiated by the fact that the compression wave
detected by the CWB in Chiayi during the quake was in the same
direction as the slip movement of the two blocks along the Meishan
fault line.</P>
      <P>He disputed the claims by some private seismologists that
Friday's earthquake was an aftershock of the magnitude 7.6 earthquake
of Sept. 21 which was triggered by the collision of blocks divided by
the Chejungpu fault.</P>
      <P>Hsin said that Friday's quake was the main shock rather than a
minor precursor to a larger quake.</P>
      <P>Hsin cited the fact that the temblor was followed by more than
thirty minor shocks, at an average frequency of less than 10 per
hour, measuring only between magnitude 3 and 4 on Richter scale, as
proof that the movement of the blocks was subsiding quite rapidly.</P>
      <P>Warning that spreading false information is punishable by a fine,
Hsin urged the so-called private seismologists who have been active
since the Sept. 21 quake not to cause public panic by issuing
unsubstantiated tremor warnings.</P>

      <P>Abnormal phenomena were
witnessed in the days prior to the magnitude 6.4 earthquake that
struck Chiayi county Friday, injuring 250 people and damaging dozens
of structures, according to local sources.</P>
      <P>A hunter in Shanmeitsun near Mt. Ali said he caught 13 pangolins
without making any effort in the two days before the earthquake. The
scaly ant eaters, which are usually seldom seen, were wandering about
in the open by the roadside making them easy targets for the hunter.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a farmer in Meishan County said he saw wild eels
jumping out of a small brook when he was on his way to his rice paddy
after dawn on Thursday, a phenomenon not seen in decades.</P>
      <P>In Chiayi County's Chungpu Township, clear spring water has been
seen coming from a normally black mud pool since early Friday
morning.</P>
      <P>The thick, slow flowing 120 square meter pond began springing
forth black mud in July 1998 at the time when a magnitude 6
earthquake struck in nearby Meishan Township.</P>
      <P>Residents in the neighborhood never realized how deep the pond
was until a buffalo accidentally stepped into it, got stuck, and
began sinking deeper until it disappeared under the surface.</P>
      <P>In neighboring Tainan County's Houpi Township, a rice paddy was
found to have water and fine black sand springing from it after the
magnitude 6.4 earthquake hit Chiayi Friday. Several holes also
appeared on a patch of dried and deserted land, sprouting out black
water and mud, some to the height of an average man.</P>
      <P>A senior villager said he saw a similar phenomenon in 1964 prior
to and after a devastating quake hit Paiho, Tainan County. Some 200
people were killed and while numerous houses collapsed in that quake.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is developing "one of
the most daunting conventional theater missile challenges in the
world which could have significant implications on regional
stability," says a new Pentagon report.</P>
      <P>The 40-page report, dealing mainly with the implications of
mainland China's military modernization, has much discussion on the
threat to Taiwan posed by the PRC's missile buildup. This includes a
Beijing, having acquired an overwhelming offensive advantage, being
more inclined to use force even if Taiwan does not declare de jure
independence.</P>
      <P>This in turn could lead Taiwan to seek stronger deterrents,
including renewed efforts to develop a nuclear device.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the PLA currently has deployed 150 to 200
short-range ballistic missiles opposite Taiwan and Western sources
believe the number will increase to 650 over the next several years.</P>
      <P>Conscious of likely US intervention, the PLA has indicated a
willingness to use missiles against US targets, including key bases
in Japan and aircraft carriers operating in the Western Pacific, the
report says.</P>
      <P>The report also says that ballistic missiles are emerging as the
backbone of conventional PLA theater operations and that mainland
China is concentrating on three systems- the short-range DF-15 (M-9),
DF-11 (M-11) and the medium-range DF-21.</P>
      <P>Currently the PLA is working on terminal guidance and missile
defense countermeasures to improve the accuracy and lethality of
these systems.</P>

      <P>Mainland China's campaign for "one country,
two systems" has no market in Taiwan, and the overwhelming majority
of its citizens will not accept the model, said Su Chi, chairman of
the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), on Saturday.</P>
      <P>He said that although mainland China is trying hard to promote
the "one country, two systems" formula to the world, it has had
little effect.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks when mainland China's President Jiang Zemin
again presented the formula during his present European trip.</P>
      <P>Su urged the international community to understand that communist
rule is the cause of separate rule on the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait over the past five decades.</P>
      <P>Beijing has campaigned on a "one country, two systems" model to
facilitate the takeover of Hong Kong and Macau mainly because the
people of those places are not in favor of communism, said Su.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned that the world is now aware that the Republic
of China on Taiwan is crucially different from Hong Kong, having its
own constitution, army, and foreign relations.</P>
      <P>Su stressed that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait must unite
under the principles of democracy, freedom and prosperity, saying

      <P>A majority of the Taiwanese public does not
approve of a postponement of the next presidential election scheduled
for March 2000, an opinion poll showed.</P>
      <P>The poll, designed to gauge public opinion in the "921
Earthquake's" aftermath, found that 58.3 percent of Taiwanese adults
don't want the election postponed despite the fact that the quake
dealt a heavy blow to Taiwan socially and financially.</P>
      <P>Slightly more than 27 percent of the respondents said they think
the election should be postponed to give the island time to heal.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by National Sun Yat-sen University, also
found that former Taiwan Governor James Soong still led four other
hopefuls, with the support of 24.8 percent of respondents.</P>
      <P>Soong was followed by the ruling Kuomintang's presidential
candidate Vice President Lien Chan, backed by 20.9 percent of those
interviewed. Trailing Lien was Chen Shui-bian, the candidate of the
main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), supported by 16.8
percent of interviewees.</P>
      <P>Two other hopefuls, independents Li Ao and Hsu Hsin-liang, had a
support rate of only 0.9 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Thirty-six percent of the respondents said they were either
undecided or had no comment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the poll found that Vice President Lien Chan is
considered most likely to be elected as the next president of the
Republic of China, with 39.1 percent of the respondents agreeing.</P>
      <P>Lien was followed by Soong, with 27.2 percent of respondents and
Chen with 6.3 percent. Twenty-seven point three percent of
respondents gave no answer to this question.</P>
      <P>The island-wide poll was conducted by telephone between Oct. 16

    <HEADLINE>FRENCH SEISMOLOGIST SUGGESTS TAIWAN ENHANCE BUILDING CONSTRUCTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Oct.  22 (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seismologist Jacques Angelier of France on
Friday suggested Taiwan should list "solidity" as its top priority in
its reconstruction of school buildings which collapsed during the
killer earthquake that devastated the island on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Angelier came to Taiwan in the wake of the quake to inspect
tremor-stricken areas and to study the phenomenon of aftershocks.</P>
      <P>During his three-week stay in central Taiwan, the area which
sustained the heaviest quake damage, the seismologist said, he has
found most buildings were actually endowed with certified anti-quake
capability, except those that were jerry-built.</P>
      <P>The bottom floors of many buildings constructed on a fault line
either caved in or bulged out during the magnitude 7.6 earthquake,
but they did not entirely collapse, Angelier said. He also noted that
the fact that many school buildings in quake-devastated areas were
severely damaged doesn't mean they were poorly constructed.</P>
      <P>That the buildings were designed with large classrooms and wide
corridors to allow sunlight to provide most of the lighting light
sources was the reason for the reduction of their anti-quake
capability, he postulated.</P>
      <P>Because of this, he thinks "solidity" should be the major
consideration as Taiwan begins its post-quake reconstruction,
Angelier said.</P>
      <P>In his analysis of the "921 Earthquake," the French seismologist
said that the tremor was a movement of massive energy release by the
"Tse Lung Pu" fault line, situated west of Taiwan's largest Central
Range that extends from Suao in the north to Oluanpi in the south.</P>
      <P>The energy had been accumulating below the Central Range for some
100 years, produced by a steady westward movement of the lower
Philippine Sea plate into the thicker Eurasian plate, to which Taiwan
is attached.</P>
      <P>Angelier said he believes that the 100-kilometer-long Tse Lung Pu
fault line will not produce any more devastating earthquakes in the
wake of the one on Sep. 21, but the fault lines in the Miaoli and the
Chianan plane possibly might in the future.</P>
      <P>In fact, by being situated in the midst of tectonic plate
movement, Taiwan can never be entirely safe from earthquake activity,
the expert said, suggesting Taiwan make significant efforts to erect
strong and solid structures with anti-quake capabilities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Angelier revealed that France will cooperate with the
Taipei-based Academia Sinica in researching earthquakes on the island
by providing advanced equipment and technology.</P>
      <P>The destructive Sep. 21 temblor was recorded as Taiwan's largest
of the century, claiming more than 2,300 lives and injuring over
100,000 people islandwide. Thousands buildings were either damaged or
destroyed, leaving numerous people temporarily homeless.</P>
      <P>On Friday another powerful earthquake of magnitude 6.4 jolted
Chiayi, in southern Taiwan, resulting in more than 300 injuries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine Foreign Undersecretary Franklin
Abdalin is currently in Taipei trying to restart talks on resolving
an air dispute which has halted direct flights between the two
countries since early October.</P>
      <P>Sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said that
Abdalin, who flew into Taipei Thursday, has met with officials from
the MOFA, the Civil Aeronautics Administration and Taiwan's two
international carriers China Airlines and EVA Airways, for talks on a
new air service agreement.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA officials, representatives on the Taiwan side
did not turn a cold shoulder to Abdalin, but they stressed that what
Taiwan insists on would not be changed.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan-Philippine air dispute began in late July when
negotiations between the two sides on the 1996 air link accord broke
down, with the latter threatening to suspend the agreement to force
Taiwan to accept its demand for a reduction in the number of
passengers allowed to be carried by Taiwan airlines.</P>
      <P>Manila authorities also termed the Philippines' aviation accord
with Taiwan as merely a "civil technical agreement" because of the
absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries and
that the "agreement" could be abolished under Philippine domestic
law.</P>
      <P>Manila wanted China Airlines and EVA Airways to restrict
passengers to 3,000 per week, down from 9,600 during the pact.</P>
      <P>Taipei responded by suspending quotas for Philippine laborers who
could legally work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The suspension has dealt a heavy blow to the Philippine
government which has sustained widespread criticism from the
Philippine private sector for its handling of the affair.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said a turnaround in the new-round of talks is
possible if Manila puts forth proposals that could serve as a basis
for further negotiations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO ADOPT MEASURES TO HELP TOURISM INDUSTRY: LIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan said the
government will adopt several measures to assist the domestic tourism
industry in the wake of the devastating Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks Sunday when he attended a seminar sponsored
by the domestic tourism industry to seek methods for revitalization
following the deadly temblor. Tourism Bureau officials were also
invited to the seminar.</P>
      <P>Tourism industry officials noted that the killer quake has dealt
a serious blow to the industry -- not only did the number of foreign
visitors coming to Taiwan plummet, but domestic and outbound tourism
also suffered.</P>
      <P>They said the hotel, entertainment, restaurant and bus tour
industries have all been in the throes of business decline, which
they said has threatened the livelihood of those in the tourism
industry.</P>
      <P>Stanley C. Yen, president of the Taiwan Tourism Association, said
that though the epicenter of the deadly temblor was located in
central Taiwan, its effect has been felt islandwide, and the
subsequent downturn in tourism was inevitable.</P>
      <P>Yen noted that more than 90 percent of foreign tour groups
abandoned plans to travel to Taiwan after the quake. Up to 210,000
air travelers canceled their bookings, and the occupancy rate of
domestic hotels plunged from the usual 90 percent to between 30 and
40 percent.</P>
      <P>Yen expressed the hope that the government will help the domestic
industry get back on its feet.</P>
      <P>Lien, after listening to the concerns of the tourism industry,
noted that he was struck by the extent of damage caused by the
massive quake, saying that he had visited more than 200
quake-stricken areas since the deadly temblor last month.</P>
      <P>But he also said that many of the collapsed houses in the
stricken areas have been demolished, and the assembly of
prefabricated housing units and the distribution of relief payments
are now nearly complete, which he believed is quite a remarkable feat
by the government.</P>
      <P>Lien said people should not dwell on the gloomy shadow of the
jolt, which claimed the lives of more than 2,400 and caused extensive
damages, but should look to the future and rebuild.</P>
      <P>Lien said he would ask the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Government
Information Office to jointly promote tourism, targeting the United
States, Japan and Europe, the traditional sources of Taiwan's tourist
market.</P>
      <P>As the sight of collapsed houses and rubble left by the quake is
no longer visible, Lien said that domestic tourism should be put back
on track gradually and that residents of the island should be
encouraged to again visit scenic spots in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien also mentioned Sun Moon Lake, saying that few other places
can match the breathtaking beauty of the mountain lake, adding that
the Tourism Bureau should make an overall plan for the area.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will offer NT$50
billion (US$1.57 billion) in long-term low-interest loans to small-
and medium-sized industries, Lien said he will suggest that the
government also provide such loans to the tourism industry to help it
tide over during this difficult period.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RELATIONS BETWEEN ROC AND PANAMA ARE VERY STABLE: JASON HU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, Oct. 23 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister of the Republic of China
Jason Hu flew to New York Saturday night for a one-day stopover
before continuing on to the Dominican Republic for a three-day
official visit.</P>
      <P>At a press conference held at Newark Airport, Hu told the media
that relations between Panama and the Republic of China were very
stable.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that Beijing's intention to hurt the diplomatic
relations that the ROC has maintained with foreign countries has
remained unchanged. "We, the ROC, can not relax our efforts and
should sincerely and substantially enhance our relations with our
friendly countries," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions raised by the press over why the ROC
government has still not decided what kind of high-ranking official
to send to the Panama Canal Transition Ceremony scheduled for Dec. 14
in Panama, Hu said that the Panamanian government has not yet
extended its invitation.</P>
      <P>Some Americans have expressed deep concern over Beijing's
influence regarding the Panama Canal, following the US transfer of
canal administration to Panama after the Hong Kong-based Hutchison
Group won administrative rights over Baboa Port at the canal's
Pacific-entry end and Colon Port on the Atlantic side.</P>
      <P>Hu said that Beijing should conduct a self-examination and review
why everyone has shown a lack of confidence in Beijing when
approaching the mainland government. The free world has expressed
concern over rights for using the Panama Canal, with the hope that
the canal would not be contaminated by political interests, Hu noted.</P>
      <P>He said his upcoming trip to the Dominican Republic is to return
an ROC visit that President Leonel Fernandez made last month after
the massive earthquake to personally express deep concern from the
government and people of the Dominican Republic to victims of the
Sept. 21 temblor.</P>
      <P>The earthquake had an impact on several ROC-Dominican Republic
cooperative projects, Hu said, adding that the ROC government decided
to send him and experts to the Dominican Republic to help realize a
proposed science technology park in that Caribbean country.</P>
      <P>Hu, accompanied by a group of 20 entrepreneurs, will leave New
York for Santo Domingo on Monday. From the Dominican Republic he will
proceed to Panama on Wednesday for a three-day official visit.

    <HEADLINE>FOREST WORKER HAS BRIEF ENCOUNTER WITH BLACK BEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A man who works for a central Taiwan forest
recreation area was reported in good condition in hospital on Sunday,
one day after he was attacked by a black bear.</P>
      <P>Cheng Chen-chung, a lanky 48-year-old of medium height who
belongs to the Ami tribe of Taitung County, said, "I thought I would
definitely die when I saw the huge animal charging at me with its
mouth open and fangs glistening with saliva." He spoke to the press
from his hospital bed at a medical facility in Tunghsih, Taichung
County.</P>
      <P>Cheng, currently employed by Tahsueshan (Great Snow Mountain)
Forest Recreation Area in Taichung County, recalled the frightening
experience of his brief encounter with the black bear.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that he was on his way down the mountain after he and
his partner had finished cutting weeds near Tienchi (Lake in the Sky)
Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he was walking far behind his partner when he heard a
noise that sounded like animals in the brush drinking from a pond. He
didn't pay much attention, as he was trying to catch up with his
partner. But then he heard some footsteps in the bushes behind him,
and, thinking it was a wild dog lurking about, he turned around to
find the large black animal right in front of him.</P>
      <P>He instinctively used the weed-cutting machine he was carrying to
strike the bear, which was standing erect at about 160 cm in height.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the black bear charged directly at him and pushed him
to the ground by the pond. With the animal's two large paws clutching
his shoulders, and bear biting at his jaw, Cheng thought he would
die, but somehow managed to summon all his strength and punch the
bear in the face, which frightened it off, along with a small cub
that was nearby.</P>
      <P>Cheng's jaw was ripped open, and he suffered injury to his left
calf, requiring three hours of surgery.</P>
      <P>Doctors said Cheng was very fortunate -- if the wound at his jaw
had been two centimeters deeper, it would have reached an artery, and
his life would have been in grave danger.</P>
      <P>Officials of the forest recreation area pointed out that the
attack, which took place near the famous scenic spot of Tienchi,
2,300 meters above sea level, was unusual because black bears have
not been seen there since the opening of Tahsueshan recreation area.</P>
      <P>They noted that they were surprised to learn of black bears in
the area, saying that after the magnitude-7.3 earthquake on Sept. 21,
traffic to the recreation area had been disrupted for three weeks,
and roads only became clear more than a week ago.</P>
      <P>Black bears may have tried to move to lower elevations because of
the recent lack of visitors, they said.</P>
      <P>They noted that black bears are very sensitive animals that
usually stay in the high mountainous areas. The officials would not
rule out the possibility that the bears might have come down because
their living environment changed or because they feel uneasy in the
wake of the earthquake.</P>
      <P>They said a group of experts will go the area for a field study
to learn more about the ecological situation of the area.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ninety-seven percent of small- and
medium-sized industries in quake-stricken areas in central Taiwan
have resumed production one month after the devastating earthquake, a
survey conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) showed on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said that the figure showed the resilience of
small- and medium-sized industries in Taichung and Nantou counties,
two of the counties hit hardest by the magnitude-7.3 earthquake on
Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>The survey found that about 40 percent of the manufacturers
suffered varying degrees of losses during the massive temblor, but 83
percent of them resumed production within two weeks, and 97 percent
resumed production in a month.</P>
      <P>Losses of machinery equipment and inventory in central Taiwan are
slight, the survey found, with initial losses estimated at US$300
million.</P>
      <P>The areas that suffered severe damages during the temblor are the
Nankang Industrial District Administrative Center in Nantou County,
the Tali Industrial Administrative Station and the Taiping Industrial
Zone. The majority of manufacturers suffered losses ranging up to
US$30,000.</P>
      <P>The survey found that only 28 buildings in the Nankang Industrial
District Administrative Center and a mere three buildings in the Tali
Industrial Administrative Station require demolition, adding that
they have now resumed full production to avoid the losses of orders
to other countries.</P>
      <P>The survey said that though export manufacturers have seen some
delay in meeting delivery dates in the wake of the temblor, the
delays, usually between two and four weeks, have not caused the
losses of orders.</P>

Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said that, Taiwan has developed into a full democracy, while
mainland China has been in a quagmire of socialism. "In fact,
communist China is trying to save socialism at the expense of its
people and society," he said, adding that the government in Beijing
is afraid of free elections.</P>
      <P>"A political party, which is unable to lead in peaceful
evolution, will have to face the danger of violent change," Chang
stressed.</P>
      <P>The Democratization of mainland China is important to the
maintenance of peace in both the Taiwan Strait area and the Asian
Pacific area, and is conducive to national unification between Taiwan
and the mainland, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>127 FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PASS Y2K COMPUTER TEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  24  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 127 financial institutions
islandwide on Sunday completed Y2K inter-banking computer systems
tests, the results of which satisfied Finance Minister Paul Chiu and
assured those taking part in the tests that Taiwanese financial
institutions are able to get through the Y2K challenge.</P>
      <P>Chiu visited the headquarters of the Bank of Taiwan and Land Bank
of Taiwan on Sunday morning to supervise inter-branch and inter-bank
computer systems trial tests. He personally tested computer
connection functions using an Automatic Teller Machine (ATM), and
supervised use of tellers' computers to conduct transactions relating
to savings, cash withdrawals and wiring money. All of the functions
worked well.</P>
      <P>Chiu, while hailing the positive results of the tests, attributed
the success to long-term efforts by the banking industry and urged
the industry to continue to engage in relevant work to prevent any
Y2K computer failure.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance has demanded that all financial
institutions complete a set of emergency measures to combat Y2K
problems by the end of November.</P>
      <P>The final trial tests of inter-branch and inter-bank computer
systems must be finished by Dec. 26, Chiu added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's financial institutions started working on potential Y2K
problems with inter-banking systems in 1997, and the systems have
passed tests and have been recognized internationally.

      <P>More than 13,000 practitioners of the
banned Falungong sect in mainland China jointly sent an open letter
to mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongqi last
week, a human rights group said here Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said that, in the letter they asked the
government to lift the ban on Falungong and on the books authored by
its founder Li Hongzi. They also asked the government to allow them
to practice Falungong in public places.</P>
      <P>They also said in the letter that Falungong is not a "pernicious
cult" as government propaganda has characterized it. It is a kind of
traditional Chinese qigong, which combines meditation and breathing
techniques together for daily practice. It is estimated that there
are millions of Falungong practitioners on the Chinese mainland.
Falungong is also the name of the organization founded by Li.</P>
      <P>The government banned Falungong in July, believing that the huge

    <HEADLINE>PENTAGON WARNS OF PLA MISSILE BUILDUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is developing "one of
the most daunting conventional theater missile challenges in the
world... which could have significant implications for regional
stability", according to a Pentagon report completed in September.</P>
      <P>The report, titled "The PLA's Strategic War Fighting in the 21st
Century: Space and Theater Missile Development," deals mainly with
the implications of mainland China's theater missile development as a
major focus of the PLA's modernization.</P>
      <P>The 40-page report contains a lot of discussion on the threat to
Taiwan posed by the mainland's missile buildup and possible
countermeasures.</P>
      <P>"In the most likely scenario for their use," the report says,
"the PLA's (People's Liberation Army's) growing arsenal of highly
accurate and lethal theater missiles, and a preemptive doctrine could
give Beijing a decisive edge in any future conflict with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The danger of this is that the Beijing leadership, having
acquired an overwhelming offensive advantage, might be more inclined
to use force even if Taiwan does not declare de jure independence.
This in turn could lead Taiwan to seek stronger deterrents, including
renewed efforts to develop a nuclear device, says the report.</P>
      <P>The report also points out that, as Taiwan's national security
community debates the need for a stronger deterrent, there may be
increased domestic pressure for tactically offensive counter force
operations, to include preemptive strikes.</P>
      <P>In the section which details operational concepts associated with
a possible PLA theater missile campaign, the report says that
mainland China would seek to quickly strip Taiwan of its war fighting
capability.</P>
      <P>The PLA would try to achieve air superiority, sea superiority and
information dominance by large-scale, preemptive missile strikes
carried out in conjunction with air strikes and special operations.</P>
      <P>The report quoted PLA writings as saying that half of its theater
missile inventory would be used in the initial strike phase.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the PLA currently has deployed 150 to 200
short-range ballistic missiles opposite Taiwan and Western sources
believe the number would increase to 650 over the next several years.</P>
      <P>Conscious of likely US intervention, the PLA has indicated a
willingness to use missiles against US targets, including key bases
in Japan and aircraft carriers operating in the Western Pacific, the
report says.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan to counter a large-scale theater missile threat, the
report says, the only effective way is "through jointness and
innovative war fighting concepts" associated with the Revolution in
Military Affairs.</P>
      <P>The report says that ballistic missiles are emerging as the
backbone of conventional PLA theater operations and mainland China is
concentrating on three particular systems, namely the short-range
DF-15 (M-9), DF-11 (M-11) and the medium-range DF-21.</P>
      <P>Currently the PLA is working on terminal guidance and missile
defense countermeasures to improve the accuracy and lethality of
these systems.</P>
      <P>Also, the PLA's first-generation land attack cruise missiles
could be operational early in the next century. These missiles,
probably air-launched, will be more accurate, more difficult to
defend and less costly to make than ballistic missiles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD MAKE ITS OWN DECISIONS, SAYS WEINBERGER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US Defense Secretary Caspar W.
Weinberger said Monday in Taipei that Taiwan should make its own
decisions and the United States has the obligation to help Taiwan
with its defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>Weinberger, in his capacity as chairman of the biweekly business
magazine Forbes, is currently on a two-day visit to Taipei. In a
meeting with the local press, he voiced his concern about Taiwan's
status and also made an appraisal of Taiwan's ability to weather a
crisis.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing America's commitment to Taiwan's self defense,
Weinberger said that during the missile crisis in the Taiwan Straits
in 1996 President Clinton was right to deploy two air-craft carriers.
In line with the spirit and letter of the Taiwan Relations Act, "we
would not tolerate any attack against Taiwan," said the former
defense secretary, who served as chairman of the board of the USA-ROC
Economic Council between 1991 and 1994.</P>
      <P>Weinberger, together with 22 other leading US conservatives and
foreign policy experts, in late August signed a statement calling on
the US government "to deter any form of Chinese intimidation of the
Republic of China on Taiwan and declare unambiguously that it will
come to Taiwan's defense in the event of an attack or blockade
against Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In Taipei, the military and foreign affairs expert again stressed
the importance of the US government clarifying the situation
regarding supplying the ROC with defensive weapons and fulfilling its
obligations to Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>While some observers of international affairs have suggested that
the American administration has applied ambiguity in its China policy
to maintain the cross-strait status quo, Weinberger said that
President Clinton during his 1998 trip to mainland China broke that
ambiguity and adopted mainland China's position.</P>
      <P>Describing Clinton's concessions to Beijing as a "disaster,"
Weinberger said that after June 1998, the Clinton administration's
policy of "ambiguity" has been favorable to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Weinberger has been visiting Taiwan as publisher and business
executive of Forbes almost once a year and has constantly
familiarized himself with Taiwan's various developments.</P>
      <P>When asked to comment on the controversial "state-to-state"
theory, Weinberger said that it only stated a fact and was nothing
new. "It is a restatement, not an outcry," as he sees it.</P>
      <P>Believing that the will of the people of Taiwan should be
honored, Weinberger said "I hope the situation in Taiwan will change
when the people want it to change."</P>
      <P>The publisher and columnist was also concerned about the Sept. 21
killer earthquake's impact on Taiwan's economy. Recognizing Taiwan's
restoration capabilities, Weinberger expressed his optimism that
Taiwan would accomplish its reconstruction very quickly.</P>
      <P>Weinberger arrived for his two-day visit Monday morning
accompanied by Forbes Vice Chairman Christopher Forbes and Managing
Director for Asia William P. Adamopoulos.</P>
      <P>During his stay, he will call on President Lee Teng-hui and
Premier Vincent Siew, Director-general Chen Chien-jen of the
Government Information Office and Vice Chairman Wu Kuan-hsiung of the
China External Trade Development Council.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate is expected to
set a record high of more than 2.91 percent for the whole of 1999,
the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>As the island's joblessness rate already averaged at around 2.92
percent during the first nine months of this year, the figure for the
whole year is likely to surpass the previous record high of 2.91 set
in 1985, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate maintained its high level in September
following the Sept. 21 earthquake, the worst to hit the island in one
hundred years, according to the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>It added that the number of employed workers declined by 53,000
from August to 9.37 million in September, while the number of jobless
workers hit around 298,000 at the end of last month.</P>
      <P>In the short term, the jobs of around 125,000 workers will be
negatively affected by the earthquake, the DGBAS analyzed, noting
that and an additional 43,000 people were already forced to
temporarily leave their workplaces last month due to the disastrous
results of the massive temblor.</P>
      <P>Since the country's economic situation will still be the leading
factor in job creation in the coming three months, the DGBAS said
Taiwan's 1999 employment rate is very likely to break the 1985
record.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Monday presided
over the inauguration of a memorial monument in downtown Taipei to
mark the 54th anniversary of the Republic of China's victory over
Japan and the return of Taiwan to its fold.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Retrocession Day, falling on Oct. 25, marks the return
of the island to the ROC after 50 years of Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>The monument is located in front of Chungshan Hall, right on the
spot where the Japanese army officially surrendered control of the
island to the ROC army in 1945.</P>
      <P>Delivering an emotional speech during the dedication ceremony,
Lien said that people tend to forget too easily their shared history,
and that if such shared experiences and memories are lost, the
feelings that connect the people of this land will also be lost.</P>
      <P>Lien said that this was the reason why he actively promoted the
building of the memorial monument four years ago when he served
concurrently as Premier. He hopes that it will evoke shared memories
about the land among citizens, whether they came here earlier or
later.</P>
      <P>The vice president also said that over the past month, the people
of Taiwan have experienced unprecedented trauma due to the massive
earthquake that struck Sep. 21, but he noted that the killer jolt has
rekindled a brotherly feeling among the people, which he said had
been fast disappearing from this land.</P>
      <P>Lien expressed the hope that in the long reconstruction period
ahead, the local people will continue to display the "Taiwanese
spirit," which is characterized by resilience, confidence and
solidarity, just like their forebears did.</P>
      <P>Lien's speech received an enthusiast response from the audience.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-chih, chairman of the cabinet-level Council for
Cultural Affairs, said Lien's speech was significant in that he used
the post-quake suffering and the history of Taiwan's retrocession to
invoke brotherly feelings among the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LABOR FORCE DECREASED BY ALMOST 70,000 IN SEPTEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 25 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's labor force decreased by 69,000 to
9,674,000 in September compared with that of the previous month, said
officials of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) on Monday.</P>
      <P>The island's unemployment figure for September still remained
high at 298,000, while the number of those employed decreased to
9,376,000, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Due to the impact of the 921 earthquake, a total of 125,000
workers have been affected; about 42,000 workers were affected in
September alone, according to officials of the DGBAS under the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Among those affected workers, some have become unemployed, while
most left their jobs temporarily but have not yet found new jobs,
mainly due to continuous aftershocks or having been busy with
reconstruction of their homes.</P>
      <P>With the beginning of reconstruction efforts, those who left
their jobs temporarily will soon rejoin the labor market, said the
DGBAS officials. And, in view of the fact that about 50,000 quake
victims have applied for "work in exchange for relief" offered by the
Council of Labor Affairs, the unemployment situation on the whole
should not have been affected much by last month's devastating
temblor, the officials added.</P>
      <P>According to a human-resources survey conducted by the DGBAS, for
the month of September, employed people totaled 9,376,000, or 53,000
fewer than in August; the number unemployed totaled 298,000, which
was 15,000 fewer that the previous month. The figure translates into
an unemployment rate of 3.08 percent for September, 0.14 percent
lower than that of August, a drop that was not as large as expected.</P>
      <P>The decline in unemployment for September is mainly because the
number of those seeking first jobs was down 11,000 from that of
August, the DGBAS officials disclosed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA UNAWARE OF TAIPEI-MANILA AVIATION TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Clarifying foreign wire service reports
that Taiwan and the Philippines have reopened talks on a new
bilateral air agreement, the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Monday it had not heard of such a situation and is currently
trying to verify the reports.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China Airlines and EVA Airways Corporation, Taiwan's
two leading airlines which operated flights between Taipei and Manila
before the suspension of direct air links on Oct. 1, said they, too,
were unaware of such developments.</P>
      <P>Citing a Manila-dispatched story, AFP reported that Taipei and
Manila have resumed negotiations on a new bilateral air pact and that
the two sides will reach a new agreement on Monday afternoon or
Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>According to the AFP report, Philippine Transportation and
Communications Secretary Vicente Rivera said that Taiwan's demand to
increase its weekly passenger load was "not a problem."</P>
      <P>CAL and EVA Airways suspended flights to Manila on Oct. 2 after
rejecting the Philippine government's demand that they reduce their
combined weekly passenger load from 9,600 to 3,000.</P>
      <P>Chang Kuo-cheng, deputy director-general of the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA), stressed that the precondition to
resume bilateral aviation negotiations is that the Philippine side be
sincere in doing so.</P>
      <P>MOFA had demanded last week that the Philippine Foreign Ministry
first correct its "inadequate remarks" made early this month toward
Taiwan, before the two sides resume bilateral negotiations.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the Philippines has not shown sincerity since
July when two-way talks on renewing direct air links broke up.</P>
      <P>Taipei had originally agreed to reduce its combined weekly
passenger number from 9,600 to 7,800, then to 6,500, but Manila
required that the number be lowered to 4,000, and then to 3,000, he
noted, adding that passengers flying between the two cities must now
change carriers in Hong Kong or elsewhere, which costs them double
the time and money.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US MUST REMAIN RESOLUTE IN DEFENSE OF TAIWAN: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 25 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States must remain resolute
concerning Taiwan's defense needs to minimize the threat to its
national security interests in the Asia-Pacific region and prevent
conflict with Communist China over Taiwan, Peter Brookes, principal
adviser on East Asia with the US House International Relations
Committee, stressed Monday.</P>
      <P>A theater missile defense should be employed in East Asia as soon
as practicable in order to persuade Communist China of the futility
of building a large ballistic missile arsenal, said the former
director of the Asian Studies Center at the Washington-based Heritage
Foundation wrote in the latest issue of Defense News weekly</P>
      <P>"Should China continue to expand its deployment of missiles
arrayed against Taiwan, the United States should provide theater
missile defense to Taipei," said Brookes.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, he pointed out, Communist China continues to
refuse to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, and Premier Zhu
Rongji's recent comments that sooner or later the future of Taiwan
will have to be resolved militarily make that threat all the more
ominous.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the United States should continue to meet its security
commitments to Taipei under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. "A failure
to meet Taiwan's legitimate defense needs will make China's military
dominance of the Taiwan Straits a reality," noted the senior policy
analyst.</P>
      <P>Brookes wrote that Beijing's perceptions of Taiwan's growing
defense vulnerability could increase the likelihood of them taking
military action against the island. Enhancing Taiwan's ability to
defend itself promotes US security interests in the region and may
convince Communist China that a peaceful resolution to the Taiwan
question is the prudent route.</P>
      <P>The military technology that Beijing acquired from the United
States through espionage or US companies poses an increased threat to
US national security and that of America's allies and friends,
including Taiwan. It is clearly not in the interest of the United
States to assist in Communist China's military modernization, and a
strong People's Liberation Army with significant power projection
capabilities could be a highly destabilizing force in Asia, he said.</P>
      <P>Consequently, Brookes added, it is appropriate for the United
States to reauthorize the lapsed Export Administration Act and
ensure that American technology is not going to improve the military
capability of the Communist Chinese military.</P>
      <P>He stressed that national security interests must remain
paramount in American foreign policy and how to deal with a rising
Communist China is central to a successful American security policy
in Asia.</P>
      <P>The Beijing government must be left with no doubt that America
will resist any attempts by any power to dominate Asia or resolve
Taiwan's future militarily. But it must also be made to feel that,
within limits, the United States is prepared to engage in a
constructive relationship with mainland China and to integrate
Beijing increasingly into the current international order, wrote
Brookes.</P>
      <P>He noted that the greatest challenge for America's policy-makers
will be to manage mutually acceptable approaches to regional
security, especially with regards to Taiwan. But until that strategic
understanding comes to pass, the United States must clearly define
red lines for Beijing, maintain the security system that has created
stability in the region, remain resolute on Taiwan's defense needs,
and revive export controls.</P>
      <P>"Only then will the United States successfully minimize the
threat to its national security interests in the Asia-Pacific region
and prevent conflict with Beijing over Taiwan," concluded Brookes.

    <HEADLINE>JINSA ASKS US GOV'T TO CLARIFY COMMITMENT TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  25  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Jewish Institute for National
Security Affairs (JINSA) passed a resolution Monday asking the
Clinton administration to clarify the US commitment to defend Taiwan
in the event of Communist Chinese aggression and provide Taiwan with
defense weaponry, including anti-missile systems to offset the
Chinese missile threat.</P>
      <P>The "China Resolution" passed unanimously by its Board of
Directors at its autumn meeting said that the US Congress passing the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act would be a strong first step.</P>
      <P>Before putting the resolution to a vote, Harvey Feldman, a former
State Department official in charge of ROC affairs, told the board
meeting that the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act is a necessary
upgrade of the Taiwan Relations Act, because the Clinton
administration has not properly implemented the American law.</P>
      <P>JINSA pointed out in the resolution that the Beijing government
continues to engage in behavior which threatens the security of
Taiwan, and the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 requires that US arms
sales to Taiwan be determined solely by Taiwanese defense needs.</P>
      <P>The JINSA board added that it is in full agreement with former
CIA Director R. James Woolsey's statement, "I believe that clear, not
ambiguous, American support for Taiwan's right to be protected from
the use of force by Beijing is an essential part of maintaining peace
in the Taiwan Straits."</P>
      <P>Therefore, the institute resolved that the US government should
clarify US commitment to defend Taiwan if the mainland attacks,
increase surveillance of it's military activities to reduce the
chances of a surprise attack, maintain a strong US military presence
in Asia, and provide Taiwan with defense weaponry, including
anti-missile systems capable of offsetting the Communist Chinese
missile threat.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TANG: PLA MAY ACHIEVE COMBAT SUPERIORITY IN THREE TO FIVE YEARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Oct.   26  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China may achieve combat
superiority over Taiwan in three to five years if it continues to
beef up its war fighting preparedness while the Republic of China
does not do the same, Defense Minister Tang Fei said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a US assessment that the People's Liberation Army
(PLA) is now capable of achieving air superiority, sea superiority,
and information dominance, as well as paralyzing Taiwan in 45
minutes, Tang said the ROC armed forces are not that fragile, but the
scenario could become fact if Taiwan fails to upgrade its
preparedness as fast as mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks during an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon, in a recent report on the PLA's strategic war
fighting in the 21st Century said that the PLA's growing arsenal of
highly accurate and lethal theater missiles and a preemptive doctrine
could give Beijing a decisive edge in any future conflict with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The danger of this is that the Beijing leadership, having
acquired an overwhelming offensive advantage, might be more inclined
to use force even if Taiwan does not declare de jure independence,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>Citing other American allies as having said that if Taiwan does
not strengthen its defensive capabilities, the PLA would acquire an
overwhelming offensive advantage over Taiwan sometime between 2005
and 2010, Tang stressed that a military balance across the Taiwan
Strait can be achieved if Taiwan increases its war fighting
capabilities.</P>
      <P>Above all, however, Tang said, the key to victory is solid esprit
de corps and high morale. Without a strong psychological preparedness
for war, like the people of Israel possess, all its advanced military
equipment would only be superficial, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tang made an appeal to legislators that current
wildlife conservation laws be revised to allow military bases to use
eagles to help in the Air Force's efforts to scare away birds that
have proven to be one of the major causes of jet fighter accidents, a
problem not confined to Taiwan alone.</P>
      <P>He added that the real causes behind one of the Air Force's
Mirage 2000-5 crashing into the Taiwan Strait on Oct. 15 remained to
be investigated, although it has been confirmed that a bird was
sucked into its engines, damaging its turbo blades, within 15 minutes
after taking off.</P>
      <P>If the military bases are allowed to keep eagles, the feathered
animals will help the Air Force control the number of wandering
migratory birds and racing pigeons, substantially lowering the
chances of the further downing of expensive war planes, Tang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Motorists and motorcyclists will soon be
prohibited from talking over cellular phones while driving, under a
new government initiative to improve traffic safety.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) on
Monday revised the current road safety law to prevent motorists from
talking on cell phones behind the wheel. Violators could face a fine
of NT$3,000 (US$94).</P>
      <P>However, a motorist who talks on a cell phone without holding a
handset will not be penalized, according to MOTC officials.</P>
      <P>Motorcyclists and drivers of motor scooters will be prohibited
from using any kind of cell phone, whether or not handset-free, while
driving. Violators will be fined NT$1,000 (US$31.44).</P>

by the Legislature, said MOTC officials.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOTC is also considering prohibition of VCD (video
compact disc) use, as more and more automobiles are expected to be

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-AUSTRALIAN TIES IMPROVING: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,   Oct.   26  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The year 1999 marked a gradual
improvement in bilateral relations between Taiwan and Australia, an
official said here Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, Liu Polun, Taiwan's representative 
in Australia, said bilateral trade between the two countries is
expected to rise steadily.</P>
      <P>He estimated the two-way trade at well over A$7 (US$4.6) billion
in 1999, up slightly from last year's US$4.5 billion. In the first 9
months of 1999, the volume was US$3.58 billion, up from US$3.41
billion in the same 1998 period, according to official figures.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's trade deficit with Australia fell to US$834 million in
the January-September period from US$956 million a year earlier. Liu
believed the trade deficit will drop to about US$1.2 billion by the
end of this year from last year's US$1.33 billion.</P>
      <P>He attributed the decline in the trade deficit to rising exports
from Taiwan to Australia this year. Australia's exports also rose in
the 9 month period, he said.</P>
      <P>Liu said that there is more room for expansion in trade between
the two countries and that this would depend on whether Australia
could sell more products, particularly its liquefied natural gas, to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Prospects are bright for cooperation among academics and schools
of the two countries, Liu pointed out.</P>
      <P>Australia's TAFE schools are successful in producing skilled
people and such achievements are attractive to many Taiwanese
students, he added.</P>
      <P>Currently there are 6000 Taiwanese students doing long-term and
short-term studies in Australia. If the number of children of
Taiwanese immigrants is added, the figure rises to about 9000, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Liu said cultural ties are important and should be strengthened
because people-to-people contact can better serve the interests of
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Liu said the overall prospects of bilateral relations between
Australia and Taiwan are encouraging.</P>
      <P>The economies of Taiwan and Australia complement to each other.
"By working together cooperatively, we can mutually benefit because
Australia and Taiwan have their common ground -- a free market system
and democracy," Liu said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 26 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices closed slightly higher
on Tuesday as booming buying sentiment in the financial sector,
electronics shares and paper-making issues buoyed the index up.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index climbed
19.42 points to close at 7,700.29.</P>
      <P>A total of 1.74 billion shares changed hands on a slowing
turnover of NT$68.7 billion (US$2.16 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened higher on early trading boosted by financial
stocks, technology shares and paper-making issues. The broader market
index once shot up 106.51 points to the session's high of 7,787.38,
but later profit-taking by short covering eroded most of the earlier
gains and sent the index back down to finish with only small gains.</P>
      <P>A sell-off in late trading was also triggered by concerns over
third-quarter performance results of electronics companies.</P>
      <P>All listed firms are required to release their third-quarter
results by the end of October.</P>
      <P>Among the eight major stock categories, the paper-making sector
took the lead, ending the day with 1.6-percent gains, while financial
shares rose 0.7 percent following Monday's upward momentum with news
of possible mergers among local banks.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Paul Chiu has pledged to forge at least one
major bank union by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks 239 to 189, with
106 shares unchanged.</P>
      <P>The over-the-counter market dropped 0.54 points to close at
172.97 on a turnover of NT$5.75 billion.</P>
      <P>TAIEX International Weighted Price Index Futures (TAIEX Index
Futures) posted solid gains despite the limited advances in the stock
market.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for November moved up 48 points to close at
7,736 with 2,695 contract transactions. Those for December rose 54
points to finish at 7,730 with 44 contract transactions.</P>
      <P>TAIEX Index Futures for next March advanced 60 points to close at
7,760 with three contract transactions while those for next June
climbed 66 points to end at 7,796 with six contract transactions.
Those for next September had no transaction records.</P>
      <P>Reference levels provided by the Taiwan International Mercantile
Exchange for TAIEX Index Futures trading on Wednesday were 7,688
points for November, 7,676 points for December, 7,700 points for next
March, 7,730 points for next June, and 7,700 points for next
September.</P>
      <P>Electronics futures and financial futures, which are sub-index
futures and based on Taiwan Stock Exchange-listed electronics shares
(TE) and financial shares (TF), both reported gains.</P>
      <P>November TE futures gained 0.3 point to close at 364.6 with 233
contract transactions; December TE futures climbed 2.8 points to end
at 366.8 with nine contract transactions.</P>
      <P>There were no transaction records for March, June or September TE
futures.</P>
      <P>November TF futures moved up one point to close at 1,000.5 with
184 contract transactions, while TF futures for other months had no
transaction records.

    <HEADLINE>BOY MAKES 5,000 ROTATIONS A DAY AFTER NOSE INJURY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A nine-year-old boy who hurt himself in the
nose while playing at an after-school nursery six months ago now
cannot eat nor speak, and makes 5,000 rotations a day if not stopped.</P>
      <P>The boy's parents told the sad story at a press conference
Tuesday, hoping the owner of the nursery would take responsibility
for healing the boy, if there is any such chance.</P>
      <P>According to Mrs. Chia, she was on a visit abroad while her son
was injured. Upon her return three days later, she was not greeted by
the healthy, cheerful son she had before, but by a boy whose injured
face was so swollen that he could not open his eyes.</P>
      <P>Nursery authorities said the boy was taken to Yangming Municipal
Hospital for treatment right after the accident. He received several
stitches on his nose, and doctors X-rayed his brain. He was dismissed
after a one-hour observation period, according to a spokesman for the
nursery.</P>
      <P>The boy's condition, however, did not improve. He took a turn for
the worse as time went by, said Mrs. Chia.</P>
      <P>First he suffered from a phobic disorder, accompanied by
urination difficulties. Later, he was unable to walk, speak or eat.</P>
      <P>He was sent to Veterans General Hospital and National Taiwan
University Hospital for further checks. Doctors said the boy's brain
was damaged.</P>
      <P>After two months of treatment and rehabilitation at the
hospitals, the boy could walk again, and returned home in August.
Now, he still cannot speak, but has developed a new habit: standing
up and using both feet, he spins around -- about 5,000 times per day
if he is not stopped.</P>
      <P>While the parents accused the nursery of neglecting its duties,
the nursery argued that it did all it could and should not have to
shoulder any responsibility for the boy's recovery.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMIC GROWTH IN 1999 TO BE OVER 5.5%: TIER PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth in 1999 will be
between 5.5 percent and 6 percent, and its estimated economic
performance next year will be better still, said the head of the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>TIER President Wu Rong-I said the impact of the devastating 921
earthquake on the island's economy was limited to just a short period
resulting from temporary electric power rationing, and Taiwan's
economic prospects for next year are likely to be robust.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's composite economic indicator for September, made public
by TIER, is 106.65 points, an index figure which marks the second
high since January -- second only to July's 106.71 points. The
economic indicator's rise despite the killer quake seems very
optimistic for the island's economic prospects, said Wu.</P>
      <P>TIER researchers deemed that although the island's third- and
fourth-quarter economic growth in the wake of the temblor will not be
as good as expected, the trend of improving economic prospects
remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Judging from various economic indicators, the negative effects of
the tremor on the island's economic growth have not been very strong,
the researchers added.</P>
      <P>However, the quake is likely to negatively affect Taiwan's
economic growth in 1999 by 0.5 percent, which is much higher than the
previous assessment of 0.1 to 0.5 percent following an on-the-spot
survey conducted by some TIER members.</P>
      <P>The on-the-spot survey, conducted in early October, showed that
damage caused by the tremor was heavier than expected, with losses
worth NT$360 billion in the manufacturing sector, accounting for
about 4 percent of the gross domestic product.</P>
      <P>According to the team's initial assessment, the island's economic
growth in 1999 would not be able to achieve the 5.5 percentage goal
set by the government; the group estimated a 5.4 percentage growth
would be more likely. However, that figure was dismissed by Wu as too
pessimistic.</P>
      <P>A revised edition of the domestic economic growth forecast for
the fourth quarter will be released by TIER on Nov. 10, and it is
expected to provide complete data for the island's economic
performance in 1999.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RADAR DOME OF CRASHED FIGHTER JET RETRIEVED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Divers have retrieved the largely intact
radar dome of a crashed French-made jet fighter, said an official at
Hsinchu Air Force Base Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Colonel Lei Yu-chi, deputy base commander, said during a press
conference that a dummy missile used for training was pressed down
into the seabed by the plane's fuselage, and that the aircraft was
largely intact.</P>
      <P>Lei said the Navy retrieval team will dive as long as sea
conditions permit.</P>
      <P>The Air Force General Headquarters released an underwater video
recorded off Chiting, Hsinchu County, on Tuesday -- the tape shows
that the Mirage 2000-5 fighter was largely intact, except for a
clipped right wing.</P>
      <P>Colonel Lei said fishing boats and hoisting equipment will be
used to tow the crashed plane, noting that due to tidal variations,
it is not feasible to use Navy vessels for the operation.</P>
      <P>He said that after the crashed plane is salvaged, and the
airborne video tape recorder and flight data recorder are retrieved,
investigation into the real cause of the incident could proceed.</P>
      <P>Though an initial investigation attributed the cause of the crash
to birds being sucked into the engine, it was noted that the engine
had temporarily lost power before the incident, so further
examination of the damaged engine will be required.</P>
      <P>Lei said that after the airborne video tape recorder and flight
data recorder are recovered, analyzed and compared, assessments can
then be made regarding the fighter's speed and altitude, pilots'
telecommunications and other factors, in order to determine the true
cause of the accident.</P>
      <P>The Mirage 2000-5 crashed into the sea off Hsinchu during a
routine training mission on Oct. 15. Two pilots ejected in
time and later saved in satisfactory condition. It was the first time
an advanced fighter of that type crashed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Air Force has lost four US-made F-16 fighter jets in less
than two years.

DPP TO STAGE RALLY TO SUPPORT COUNTY MAGISTRATE CANDIDATE</P>
      <P>Taipei, Oct. 26 (CNA) The main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) will stage a rally through the coastal towns of Yunlin
County, southern Taiwan, on Saturday to drum up support for the
party's candidate for Yunlin County magistrate.</P>
      <P>Former Yunlin County Magistrate Su Wen-hsiung died of liver
disease in August, and the by-election to replace him is scheduled to
be held on Nov. 6. Campaigning will formally begin on Wednesday for a
race which is being widely seen as a warm-up for the 2000
presidential election.</P>
      <P>At present, three candidates are vying for the magistrateship --
DPP-nominated Lin Chung-li, the ruling Kuomintang-nominated Chang
Cheng-hsiung, and Chang Jung-wei, who is running as an independent.</P>
      <P>The DPP is urging some 400,000 supporters hailing from Yunlin
County and now living in other counties and cities to return to their
home county to work together to put their man in office.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian, the DPP's presidential candidate for the 2000
presidential election, will also go to Yunlin to stump for Lin.</P>
      <P>Lin had the highest support rate from Yunlin County citizens in a

    <HEADLINE>NO TAX HIKE PLANNED FOR NEXT FISCAL YEAR: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew
reassured the Legislative Yuan Tuesday that there is currently no
plan for a tax hike, as this year's financial situation will
definitely allow government financing of post-quake reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Siew made the statement in response to questioning by opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator Lian Mu-yang at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lian demanded that Siew clarify whether his Monday declaration of
"no tax hike for the moment" meant taxes would not be raised until
after the presidential election next March.</P>
      <P>Lian went on to say that if the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) overturns
its own decision and starts to levy more taxes after the election,
the KMT would be cheating people out of their money.</P>
      <P>In response, Siew said the government can only assess the current
financial situation, and therefore it makes no sense for him to make
a long-term promise. Any tax hike would be subject to government
policy changes aimed for national development, Siew added.</P>
      <P>The NT$140 billion designated for post-quake reconstruction has
already been secured, since the emergency decree following the
devastating Sept. 21 earthquake empowered the government to issue
public bonds worth NT$80 billion and make other allocations, Siew
noted.</P>
      <P>The government taxation plan is based on the financial situation
of one fiscal year and has nothing to do with politics, Siew said. He
therefore asked legislators not to politicize a simple issue.

women at very high risk for the disease.</P>
      <P>Announcing the trial, slated to begin within five months,
Professor John Forbes, head of the Australia-New Zealand Breast

      <P>Twenty five women aged between 35 and 45 will be asked to take
two drugs for six to 12 months, he said.</P>
      <P>"I feel, for the first time in 25 years, some cautious optimism
about the events that are occurring in breast cancer," he said. He
said the trial is open to women with an abnormality in the gene
BRCAI, which gives them a 50 percent of getting breast cancer by the
age of 50, and an 80 percent chance by the age of 70.</P>
      <P>It is also open to women with a very strong family history, such

    <HEADLINE>FOREST FIRE ON KINMEN EXTINGUISHED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Firefighters on Tuesday extinguished a
forest fire which they had battled for nearly 10 hours on the
Taiwan-controlled offshore island stronghold of Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The firefighters reported that the fire broke out at around 7
p.m. on Monday in a forested region between Lungko and Kuanyin
Mountain where communist Chinese and Republic of China troops fought
fiercely during the famous Kuningtou Battle half a century ago.</P>
      <P>The raging fire twice threatened to engulf two nearby ammunition
depots, and actually reached one of them, forcing the army to defuse
or evacuate the ammunition stored there, along with personnel.</P>
      <P>Up to 70 firefighting vehicles were mobilized at the height of
the blaze, and around 200 soldiers were put on standby to provide
additional assistance. The shrieking of ambulance sirens wound the
island into a mood of high tension.</P>
      <P>Firefighters finally brought the fire under control at around 1
a.m. For safety reasons, the military ordered troops stationed at an
anti-airborne attack watchtower near the site of the fire to
withdraw, while all military personnel and ammunition, including a
number of artillery pieces developed by the army and installed

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI WILL MATCH MANILA'S GESTURE IN AVIATION TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  26  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
was quoted as saying on Tuesday that Taipei will match Manila's
gesture in offering to reopen aviation talks between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Lee said he will ask the Foreign Ministry as well as Ministry of
Transportation and Telecommunications to contact their Philippine
counterparts with the hope of restoring suspended air links between
Taipei and Manila, according to ROC Ambassador-at-Large Jeffrey Koo,
who relayed the offer from Philippine President Joseph Estrada to
Lee.</P>
      <P>As to the weekly passenger load assigned to carriers of each
country, this "should be worked out by the airlines themselves," Lee
was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Koo, who is a business tycoon with good connections with the
Manila authorities, said Estrada made the offer to him in mid-October
when the two met at a gathering of the Pacific Economic Cooperation
Council.</P>
      <P>The Manila authorities are said to be eager to reopen the talks
because they have come under great pressure since a 1996 aviation
pact between the two countries was scrapped by Manila on Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>Since then, about 120,000 Filipinos working in Taiwan have had to
travel via Hong Kong on their way to and from Manila.</P>

      <P>Taiwan exported US$1.92 billion worth of
commodities to mainland China in August, up 18.1 percent over the
same month last year, the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) reported on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>August exports to mainland China constituted 17.9 percent of
Taiwan's total exports for the month, the highest monthly total this
year, according to BOFT officials.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's two-way trade with mainland China totaled US$16 billion
in the first eight months of this year, up 7.8 percent over last
year's level. The amount was 10.8 percent of Taiwan's entire foreign
trade in the eight-month period, BOFT tallies showed.</P>
      <P>Between Jan. 1 and Aug. 31, Taiwan's exports to the mainland
amounted to US$13.17 billion, up 8.7 percent over last year and
constituting 16.9 percent of Taiwan's total exports in the period.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed increased Taiwan exports to the mainland
over the past eight months to mainland China's increased domestic
demands, its increasing export trade and to the economic recovery in
the United States and other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan imported US$2.83 billion worth of goods from
mainland China in the first eight months of this year, up 3.9 percent
over the same period a year ago. The figure was 4 percent of Taiwan's
total imports registered in that period.</P>
      <P>In August alone, Taiwan's imports from the mainland totaled
US$397 million, up 21.1 percent over the same month in 1998, marking

      <P>The amended bill, put forth by the committee's Republican

      <P>Nearly 40 representatives of the 49-member committee took part in
the heated debate before voting for the amendment and passage of the

      <P>Although most of the members stressed the commitment to Taiwan's

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE INSISTS ON PARITY IN CROSS-STRAIT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang Chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Lee Teng-hui called on the
international community and Beijing to recognize the reality of the
ROC on Taiwan and insisted cross-strait talks be conducted on the
basis of parity.</P>
      <P>Lee wrote in an article in the New York bimonthly magazine
"Foreign Affairs" that if peace and stability are to be maintained in
the Taiwan Strait area, the perceptions underpinning policies
involving Taipei and Beijing must be more firmly grounded in reality
than in ideological wishful thinking.</P>
      <P>Lee's article, titled "Understanding Taiwan: Bridging the
Perception Gap," stated that sustained economic growth, unprecedented
prosperity, and the evolution into a full democracy have outstripped
prevailing perceptions of what Taiwan is and how it should fit into
the global order, he indicated.</P>
      <P>The ROC has been a sovereign state since 1912, he stressed,
adding that both sides of the Taiwan Strait have been separately
ruled in the last 50 years since the "People's Republic of China" was
founded, with neither subordinate to the other.</P>
      <P>The facts have been distorted by Beijing and overlooked by the
international community for many years, the president stated.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait ties now form a "special state-to-state
relationship" because Taiwan and the Chinese mainland share the same
culture, historical origins and ethnic bonds, he explained.</P>
      <P>What is most important is that the two sides are willing to work
in concert and consult on an equal basis to pursue the future
reunification of China, President Lee emphasized.</P>
      <P>If the two sides can recognize and appreciate this special
relationship, they can transcend political differences and jointly
develop a relationship conducive to the peaceful and democratic
reunification of the Chinese nation one day, he affirmed.</P>
      <P>However, President Lee said some obstacles must be overcome if
cross-strait relations are to flourish in the years ahead. These
include the lack of mutual trust between Taipei and Beijing, the
Beijing authorities' refusal to renounce the use of force as a means
to solve the Taiwan Strait issue, and the vast differences between
the political, social and economic systems of the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait caused by five decades of separate rule.</P>
      <P>Beijing's refusal to renounce the use of force against Taiwan
presents a large, insurmountable obstacle to improving relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, and the authoritarian
nature of the communist regime is the key factor alienating the
people of Taiwan from the Chinese mainland, President Lee pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Taipei and Beijing can cooperate to maintain peace in the Taiwan
Strait and promote the welfare of all Chinese, he suggested.</P>
      <P>During the past few years, Taipei has made numerous concrete
proposals, providing the Chinese mainland with the know-how to fight
floods, assisting agricultural improvements on the Chinese mainland,
exchanging ideas about reorganizing state-owned enterprises, and
cooperating to find ways of coping with the after-effects of the
Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>These proposals are aimed at creating a win-win situation for
both sides of the Taiwan Strait, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Taipei does not rule out discussing political issues once
meetings with Beijing resume on a basis of parity, but priority
should be given to outstanding issues that affect people's everyday
lives, he added.</P>
      <P>What Taiwan has done in the past decade is remarkable for the
speed and scope of its economic and political changes and for the
peaceful way in which such changes have been achieved, President Lee
said.</P>
      <P>It is in the best interest of regional and even global peace and
stability for Beijing to embrace democracy rather than try to contain
it, Lee concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ETHNIC  CHINESE  APPOINTED INDONESIAN ECONOMIC MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The appointment of an ethnic Chinese at
the Cabinet level in the new Indonesian government of Abdurrahman
Wahid is a key factor in luring foreign investors, especially wealthy
Chinese businessmen back to the world's largest Islamic country, says
an Australian expert.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA on Wednesday, Dr. George Quinn of
the Australian National University said the appointment of Kwik Kian
Kie "represents a symbolic reconciliation between the mainstream and
the minority groups in Indonesia," a relationship strained since the
riots in May of 1998.</P>
      <P>Kwik is a reformer whose name will reassure the markets and
international institutions, including the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank, other experts said.</P>
      <P>Experts believe the new government under Wahid is trying to make
a clean break with past corrupt regimes and is trying to convince
wealthy Chinese to return to Indonesia and continue doing business.</P>
      <P>Kwik is the second ethnic Chinese to hold a ministerial position
in an Indonesian government. The first was Bob Hassan who was
appointed by Suharto in early 1998 to head the finance ministry, but
his term was short-lived due to the downfall of Suharto.</P>
      <P>There are only about 7 million ethnic Chinese in a country with a
population of 210 million. But they hold significant economic power
and their wealth has been estimated to be at least 40 percent of the
national wealth.</P>

at the Washington-based Heritage Foundation, wrote in an analysis
titled "Why Taiwan's Security Needs To Be Enhanced," that Taiwan's
security is still threatened by communist China's escalating military
modernization and buildup across the Taiwan Strait because America is
failing to faithfully implement the legislative intent of the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act,
cosponsored by Senators Jesse Helms (R-NC) and Robert Torricelli
(D-NJ), calls on the US government to recognize Taiwan's changing
defense needs in light of mainland China's determined military
modernization and the more general revolution in military affairs
from which Taiwan is diplomatically isolated.</P>
      <P>The TRA instructs the US government to enable Taiwan to maintain
a sufficient self-defense capability, but today Taiwan clearly is at
a military disadvantage, noted Yates. Beijing has a 65 to 4 advantage
in submarines and a 4,500 to 400 numerical advantage in aircraft, an
edge increased by its acquisition of advanced foreign technology
primarily from Russia, but also from Israel and the United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will never be communist China's military equal, but parity
with communist China is not Taiwan's objective and it should not be
the objective of the United States. Nevertheless, "the US remains
obliged under the Taiwan Relations Act to sell Taiwan defense
articles and systems based solely on Taiwan's defense needs," Yates
wrote.</P>
      <P>He added that because of Beijing's overwhelming hardware
advantage, emphasis on missile modernization, and a willingness to
use missiles to intimidate Taiwan, "Taiwan needs to increase its
reliance on high technology, including missile defense. The
alternative is near total vulnerability or total reliance on US
intervention."</P>
      <P>Yates said American policy-makers should discount arguments
warning that enhancing Taiwan's security will encourage it to move
toward independence and a regional arms race. In his opinion, such
alarmist views ignore the history of cross-strait dialogue which has
progressed at times when Taiwan has felt secure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAUER CHALLENGES BUSH TO STATE HIS CHINA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 26 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Republican presidential hopeful Gary
Bauer Tuesday criticized former President George Bush for his
erroneous assessment of Communist China's military threat and
challenged Texas Governor George W. Bush to tell the American people
whether he shares his father's dangerous view of Beijing's military
intentions.</P>
      <P>Former President Bush the other day told Fox Sunday News that
"China is not seeking hegemony. I see no evidence, and I'd like one
person who's a critic of China on the Republican right or the
Democratic left to tell me why they think they are seeking hegemony?"</P>
      <P>Bauer responded Tuesday by asking if President Bush had forgotten
that China conducted missile tests off the coast of Taiwan in 1995
and 1996 and whether he was aware that their military held missile
attack exercises against mock US troops within the past year.</P>
      <P>"I am appalled that former President Bush would adopt the mantra
of the Clinton-Gore administration, which can only encourage military
aggression by the repressive government of China," said the
conservative Republican leader.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that a Pentagon report completed in September
concluded that Communist China is developing "one of the most
daunting conventional theater missile challenges in the world...which
could have significant implications for regional stability.</P>
      <P>"I am very concerned that this misguided view of China's
intentions is shared by Bush's son, George W. Bush," said Bauer.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Gov. Bush's recent call for a relaxation of US
supercomputer export controls, Bauer stated that "at a time when
China is using such technology to design and test nuclear weapons, it
is shocking that a Republican presidential candidate would advocate a
policy that shows less regard for our national security than the
current irresponsible policies of the Clinton-Gore administration."</P>
      <P>Bauer added that "Gov. Bush needs to immediately tell the
American people whether he shares his father's misguided and
dangerous view of China's military intentions."</P>

      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
recently gave new instructions that all challenges to the government
be "nipped in the bud", the South China Morning Post reported today.</P>
      <P>The dictum, which Jiang laid down before he left for his
multi-nation tour, has been issued to party, government and PLA
units, the report said.</P>
      <P>"All cadres must maintain a vigorous fighting spirit in the
political, social and military fields," it quoted diplomatic sources
in Beijing as saying.</P>
      <P>The sources also said that on another occasion, Jiang decried the
"new threat" posed by cults and quasi-religious units such as the
Falun Gong. Following Jiang's orders, security forces have in the
past week adopted extra tough tactics against Falun Gong affiliates
as well as members of underground political parties, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>It noted that authorities were disturbed by the rise of rioting
and demonstrations, particularly in the northwest and southwest.</P>
      <P>"While some protests were led by laid-off workers and over-taxed
farmers, a surprisingly large number of instances of disorder were
caused by underground religious units," it quoted another source as
saying.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there are about 100 Qi Gong sects in
mainland China, and most of them claim at least several thousand

      <P>Prime Minister John Howard, a strong

his own government, arguing that Australia doesn't need to change its
political system and the present constitutional system would be

sacking of the Whitlam government as proof that the governor-general
was the "effective head of state of Australia because he does not

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN 1999 ECONOMIC GROWTH TO DROP FROM ORIGINAL PREDICTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth rate will slide to
5.3 percent this year from the 5.5 percent quoted in an earlier
assessment, the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>C.Y. Hu, director of CEPD Economic Research Department, indicated
that the downward modification resulted from the Sept. 21 earthquake
that devastated several townships on the island and claimed more than
2,300 lives.</P>
      <P>However, Hu said, post-quake reconstruction efforts are expected
to cause the island's general economic performance next year to
bounce back from its current sluggishness caused by the quake, to a
predicted 6.1 percent.</P>
      <P>At the same time, both the CEPD and the official Chung-Hua
Institute for Economic Research assessed that the economic growth in
the upcoming fourth quarter of this year will show a drop to about 5
percent, in contrast to previous figures which reflected an economy
recovering from the global recession brought about by the 1997 Asian
financial storm.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in a separate report, the CEPD announced that the
earthquake and the temporary power rationing which followed caused
the economy to flash a "yellow-blue" light, signaling a slowdown in
economic development, for September.</P>
      <P>In the CEPD-devised five-color rating system, a "green" light
marking steady growth was seen in June, July and August. September's
change should serve as a warning that efficient government measures
should be taken to prevent further deterioration of the economy, the
report said.</P>
      <P>September's overall economic performance received a score of 20
points, down three points from the August level, according to the
CEPD report which indicated that the drop was mainly caused by an
immense decline in export value. The minimum score for a healthy
green rating is 23 points.</P>
      <P>Despite that, a monthly CEPD survey of local manufacturers
conducted in September found that 36 percent of respondents expected
the business climate to take a turn for the better in the next three
months, up from the 27 percent who held that opinion in an August
poll.</P>
      <P>Forty-eight percent of those surveyed expected the business
climate to remain unchanged, down from 57 percent in August; and 10
percent thought it will deteriorate, the same figure as that polled
in August.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Wednesday welcomed the passing of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act
(TSEA) 32-6 by the International Relations Committee of the US House
of Representatives.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said
that if the act can win bipartisan support in the US Congress and if
it can gain backing from the US executive branch, "we will be glad to
see it succeed."</P>
      <P>Attention is focused on whether the act will be passed by the US
House of Representatives next week, as it faces opposition from the
Clinton administration and strong protest from Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration opposes the TSEA on the grounds that
the United States has been keeping its promise to provide Taiwan with
defensive weapons since the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act in
1979, and that the promulgation of the TSEA would probably bring
about an adverse effect on stability across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The altered bill removes the original version's mention of
specific arms which the president could transfer to Taiwan under the
bill, but it reserves provisions calling for the establishment of a
direct communications channel between high-ranking military officers
of both countries, as well as the sponsoring of joint military
drills.</P>

      <P>Dr. Carl Djerassi, long noted as the
world's "father of the birth control pill" and a prolific writer,
arrived in Taipei recently to publicize the Chinese-language edition
of his latest novel.</P>
      <P>A chemistry professor at Stanford University, Djerassi
synthesized the world's first oral birth control pills in 1950, when
he was just 26.</P>
      <P>Nearly five decades later, Djerassi confirmed the contribution to
society of oral contraceptive pills, saying they allow women to be in
control of their bodies and to plan their families according to their
means and desire.</P>
      <P>Djerassi stressed, however, that people today need more than
pills prescribed by a doctor, and that there is a great need for more
diverse birth control choices which should be available like
commodities displayed on supermarket shelves.</P>
      <P>Most of all, he said, people should have a mentality that is
tolerant towards diversified birth control options.</P>
      <P>Djerassi was chosen one of the 30 most influential people of the
millennium by Britain's "Times Weekly" in September for his
contribution to mankind. The 76-year-old professor was the only
living nominee on the prestigious list, which also included Karl
Marx, Albert Einstein, William Shakespeare, Martin Luther and
Napoleon I.</P>
      <P>Although he is a scientist by profession, Djerassi is also a
writer, having completed five science fiction novels and two plays.
This is the third visit to Taiwan by Djerassi and his wife. They were

    <HEADLINE>PHILIPPINE GOVERNMENT URGED TO RECOGNIZE TAIPEI-MANILA AIR AGREEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Philippine Airlines (PAL) on Wednesday
urged the Foreign Ministry of the Philippines to immediately
recognize the air agreement signed in 1996 between Taipei and Manila.</P>
      <P>PAL's move was seen as being aimed at re-establishing air-links
suspended on Oct. 1 following a dispute over passenger quotas for air
carriers of the two sides.</P>
      <P>The 1996 Air Service Agreement, signed by the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office (TECO) and the Manila Economic and Cultural Office
(MECO), was terminated by the Philippine's Civil Aeronautics Board
(PCAB) in late September when the dispute reached an impasse.</P>
      <P>However, Leo Li-ming Sung, PAL's adviser in Taipei, on Wednesday
re-interpreted PCAB's previous decision, saying that only the
sub-contract involving passenger quotas was terminated, rather than
the main agreement which is therefore still in effect.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Republic of China's Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) said that Taipei's stance has not changed, and
that Taipei has always stressed its respect to the spirit of the
agreement. Negotiations can be resumed only if the Philippines takes
concrete action to remedy the situation, the officials added.</P>
      <P>Passenger quotas remains the most contentious point at issue.
Under the 1996 agreement, each side is allowed to transport up to
9,600 passengers per week, but Manila demanded that this number be
slashed to just 3,000. Taipei agreed to a lowering to 6,500, a figure
which was not accepted by Manila.</P>
      <P>The dispute has affected 32 flights shared by China Airlines and
EVA Airways of Taiwan, and nine PAL flights. Filipino travel agents
reportedly have warned that the dispute could cost the Philippines up
to US$146 million in lost annual tourism revenue.</P>
      <P>In addition, since the termination of direct airlinks, travelers
between Taipei and Manila currently have to travel via a third
destination, doubling both travel time and cost.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed marginally
higher on Wednesday as late profit-taking set in and triggered
selling pressure across the broader market to erase limited earlier
gains.</P>
      <P>The benchmark Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted Price Index climbed
0.93 point to close at 7,701.22.</P>
      <P>A total of 1.58 billion shares changed hands on a continually
slowing turnover of NT$61.99 billion (US$1.95 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened 33.88 points higher and reached a high of
7,780.21, a 1.04-percent intra-day rise boosted by purchases in
financial and technology shares. But in late trading, the index
dipped 0.4 percent before buying resumed to pull it back slightly
above the break-even point.</P>
      <P>Brokers said the market's unusually slow turnover in recent days
triggered caution. The daily turnover, which in recent months had
averaged between NT$110 billion and NT$120 billion (US$3.4 billion to
3.7 billion), has languished below NT$80 billion in the past nine
sessions and once dropped to NT$54 billion.</P>
      <P>According to brokers, investors' mood will hinge in coming days
on the release of key companies' third-quarter corporate results, as
the investors are waiting to see the actual impact of the devastating
Sept. 21 earthquake on key firms' results.</P>
      <P>All listed firms are required to release their third-quarter
results by the end of October.</P>
      <P>Among the eight major stock categories, only electronics shares
and financial shares posted gains, ending the day with 0.6-percent
and 0.1-percent gains, respectively.</P>
      <P>The rest all reported losses, among which construction shares
suffered the largest losses of 2.1 percent, followed by cement issues
and plastics and chemical issues, both of which ending with
1.4-percent losses.</P>
      <P>Declining stocks outnumbered advancing stocks 320 to 130, with 86

      <P>The over-the-counter market rose 0.71 points to close at 173.68

    <HEADLINE>ENTHUSIASM WANES FOR TAIWAN VISIT BY ARATS HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of Taiwan seem to be less
enthusiastic about a planned visit by mainland China's top negotiator
with Taiwan, according to the results of a survey released on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by National Chung Cheng University and
commissioned by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC),
shows that 61.6 percent of those surveyed still welcome a delayed
visit by Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>But the figure was down 25.3 percent from a similar survey
conducted in August, with some 69 percent of the respondents saying
that it is unreasonable for the mainland to set preconditions for the
visit.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chong-pin said the main reason behind the
waning support for Wang's visit is probably linked to Beijing's
stalling and setting of preconditions to the visit.</P>
      <P>Beijing demands that Taiwan retract President Lee Teng-hui's
redefinition of cross-strait ties as "a state-to-state relationship,"
and that Lee must meet Wang in his capacity as chairman of the ruling
Kuomintang and not as president of the country.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 57.2 percent of those polled believe
that mainland China's assistance in the wake of the Sept. 21
earthquake was politically motivated, and that 54.9 percent said they
do not think mainland China's donation of US$100,000 in the wake
of the Sept. 21 killer jolt was a goodwill gesture at all.</P>
      <P>Up to 85 percent said that it was unreasonable for the mainland
to ask foreign countries to seek prior approval from Beijing before
sending specialized rescue teams to search for quake survivors.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that only 10.1 percent polled consider
themselves Chinese, down 3 percent from the August survey. Some 39.7
percent said they consider themselves Taiwanese, and some 45.7
percent said they are both Taiwanese and Chinese.</P>
      <P>The university conducted the survey among people over the age of
20 between Oct. 13 and 17, and obtained 1,119 valid replies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CRITICIZED FOR MISHANDLING PIRACY CASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Oct. 27 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Singapore owner of the tanker Petro
Ranger, which was found in the South China Sea after a hijacking, has
strongly criticized mainland Chinese authorities over this and other
piracy incidents, reported The Business Times Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Malaysian-registered tanker was hijacked off the east coast
of peninsular Malaysia on April 16 of last year.</P>
      <P>The tanker was intercepted off the island of Haikou by mainland
Chinese authorities while transferring its cargo of diesel and
kerosene to another ship, 10 days after it had gone missing. The
authorities detained the ship's crew and 12 suspected Indonesian
pirates found aboard the vessel and also confiscated the cargo.</P>
      <P>"These seem to be a pattern of expediently slapping a label of
smuggling in order to confiscate cargo," said Alan Chan, chairman of
Petroships, in a strongly worded keynote speech at a piracy seminar
organized by the Singapore Shipping Association (SSA) last week.</P>
      <P>Mainland officials have previously charged that the Petro Ranger
and some crew members were involved in smuggling.</P>
      <P>"Despite the murky picture, it can be surmised that a plot is
hatched in Southern China for cargo to be 'obtained' and delivered.
In those cases where the hijackers get caught, the cargo is too good
to be returned to its rightful owners," alleged Chan.</P>
      <P>The tanker was carrying a cargo of 10,000 tons of diesel and
kerosene estimated to be worth US$1.5 million. "Our stand is that the
cargo or its auction proceeds belongs to the rightful cargo owners in
Vietnam," he said.</P>
      <P>Another speaker, Jayant Abhyankar, deputy director of the
International Maritime Bureau (IMB), also repeated statements he made
last month that Southern China had "safe ports" where hijacked ships
could berth and unload cargo without any questions being asked.</P>
      <P>Despite the accusations leveled by Chan at mainland Chinese
authorities, there are signs that the mainland is acting to clamp
down on cases of hijacked ships found in the country's waters.</P>
      <P>Thawatchai Simaroj, managing director of Siam Monkol Marine, told
the conference that the mainland returned its hijacked cargo ship the
Siam Xan Xan on Oct. 19, along with US$1 million in cash, proceeds
from the sale of the ship's cargo.</P>
      <P>The 12 suspected Indonesian pirates have been charged with
smuggling and could face the death penalty if found guilty.</P>
      <P>Abhyankar told reporters that the news that mainland Chinese
authorities had charged the suspected hijackers was a "very welcome
move".</P>
      <P>He added that they hoped to see a decline in incidents as a
direct result of such tough action by the mainland authorities.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fifteen people were indicted Wednesday on
charges which included accidental killing, after nearly 40 people
died in the rubble of the collapsed "Doctors' Home" residential
building when a devastating earthquake hit Taiwan on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Chen Ming-hsiang of the district prosecutor's office in Panchiao
filed the indictment after an investigation into the deadly incident
implied that it was mainly caused by the building's fragile structure
as a result of builders cutting corners on construction.</P>
      <P>In the rubble of the collapsed condominium, located in Hsinchuang
in suburban Taipei, rescuers had found metal cooking-oil containers
in major pillars of the jerry-built structure.</P>
      <P>Chen said the 15 people, including the architect Lien Chih-chien
and several co-owners of the construction company that built the
ill-fated condominium, should each be punished with the maximum

      <P>Private sector consumption will decrease by
NT$26 billion, and the real growth rate will be set at 5.2 percent, a
new low since 1981, according to an estimate released on Wednesday by

0.4 percent to 5.3 percent as a result of the earthquake which jolted
Taiwan on Sept. 21, claiming more than 2,400 lives. Taiwan's trade
surplus is expected to exceed US$10 billion as of the end of 1999, as
the earthquake has affected domestic demand more than foreign demand.</P>
      <P>Public sector consumption will show negative growth of 3.7
percent.</P>
      <P>Private sector capital investment will also decrease by NT$9.4

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE RECEIVES OKLAHOMA GOVERNOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui received Governor
Frank Keating of the US state of Oklahoma at the presidential office
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee first expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Keating for the
condolences and concern for Taiwan's "921 Earthquake" victims that he
had communicated immediately following the quake and for his visit to
Taiwan to personally express his sympathy.</P>
      <P>Lee said that shortly after the occurrence of the 921 Earthquake,
Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau detected the epicenter within two
minutes, and the army rushed to quake-stricken zones to proceed with
the rescue work within two hours.</P>
      <P>Lee said the top priority of quake relief work was to rescue
people trapped under the rubble. It took four to five days to
complete that most difficult task. The rescue work was followed by
the promulgation of an emergence decree to expedite resettlement of
quake victims and reconstruction of quake-stricken zones.</P>
      <P>He said he believed that under joint efforts made by the
government and the people of Taiwan, the island's post-quake
reconstruction will be completed soon.</P>
      <P>Keating said that soon after he took the post of Oklahoma state
governor, the massive explosion at an Oklahoma office building
occurred, resulting in significant casualties.</P>
      <P>This year, his state suffered from a powerful tornado that caused
heavy losses of life and property, Keating said, adding that he is
willing to share his experience in dealing with natural and
human-made disasters for the Taiwan government's reference in
post-quake reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Before their discussion, Keating presented Lee with a check for
US$30,000 that had been donated by overseas Chinese in Oklahoma for
quake relief. Lee extended his gratitude and said he will send the
check to the Cabinet's post-921 quake reconstruction foundation.</P>
      <P>Keating was accompanied by Vice Foreign Minister David Lee and
Director Raymond Burghardt of the American Institute in Taiwan while
meeting with Lee. Also present were Ding Mou-shih, senior adviser to
the president, and Lin Pi-chao, deputy secretary general to the

Jason Hu, leading a business delegation, arrived in the Dominican
Republic Monday for a three-day visit, according to a Wednesday press
release from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The press release said that Hu called on Dominican Republic
Foreign Minister Eduardo Latorre, and both sides discussed the

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI CITY HOPES TO RAISE MAXIMUM FINE FOR DRUNK DRIVING TO US$ 2,830</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday
that city representatives will consult with the central government to
raise the maximum fine for drunk driving to NT$90,000 (US$2,830).</P>
      <P>Ma said raising the maximum fine is not aimed at confrontation,
explaining that the city's intention is the same as that of the
central government -- to curb drunk driving by imposing a stiff fine.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in a radio interview during which he
explained the intention to raise the fine for drunk driving and to
regulate places that serve alcohol.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) had
proposed that the fine be raised from the present NT$15,000 (US$472)
to NT$45,000 (US$1,415). But Ma has proposed that the fine be set
between NT$30,000 and NT$90,000 because Taipei is a city with high
per-capita income, compared with the rest of the island, and if the
fine is kept too low, then it will have no intimidating effect.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the city is not trying to confront the central
government, adding that city officials have held discussions with the
MOTC to set the fine at between NT$15,000 and NT$90,000, so that
Taipei City can adopt the maximum standard.</P>
      <P>Ma also explained about regulating places that provide alcoholic
drinks, saying that several states in the United States, such as New
York, California, Indiana and Michigan, have laws stating that bars
which provide alcohol must shoulder some social responsibility for
drunk driving.</P>
      <P>Ma said that raising the maximum fine for drunk driving is one
option being mulled by the city, and another is extending the period
for suspension of driver's licenses from six months to a year.</P>
      <P>The government is considering raising the fine for drunk driving
in the wake of several fatal accidents in recent days that involved
drunk driving.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Defense Minister Tang Fei
said on Wednesday that the ROC government welcomes any foreign action
that is helpful for the island's security.</P>
      <P>Tang made the remarks to legislators while commenting on the
passage of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA) by the US House
International Relations Committee on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The defense minister was visiting the caucuses of all political
parties at the Legislative Yuan to seek their support for bills on
the national defense organizational law and the coast guard law.</P>
      <P>When asked to comment on the TSEA by the legislators, Tang said
the Ministry of National Defense welcomes all bills and actions that
will help strengthen Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>However, he told the lawmakers that "advanced weapons are
important, but high morale is more important," and urged his
countrymen to be determined to defend the country with their own
strength.</P>
      <P>Regarding the recent evaluation by a US research institute that
mainland China is capable of gaining supremacy in the air over the
Taiwan Strait in 45 minutes, Tang described that as "somewhat
exaggerated."</P>
      <P>He said that international military analysts have radically
contradicting opinions on mainland China's military strength, and
Taiwan's view is that over-estimate and under-estimate should be
avoided.</P>
      <P>Tang disclosed that in the coming three to five years, Beijing
will spend over NT$300 billion (US$9.4 billion) to continue improving
mainland military equipment.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan becomes satisfied with the existing defense
establishment, he said, it may lose its bargaining power with the
mainland in the future.</P>
      <P>When asked about the possibility of mainland Chinese military
action against Taiwan before next March's presidential election, Tang
said that judging from the domestic and international situations, it
seems unlikely that the mainland would attack Taiwan during this

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE URGES  WORLD TO GIVE TAIWAN ITS DUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Saying Taiwan's rapid developments in
democracy, economy and prosperity have outstripped prevailing
perceptions of what Taiwan is, President Lee Teng-hui urged the world
to update its view of the island and fit it properly into the global
order.</P>
      <P>In an article published in the US-based bimonthly Foreign Affairs
on Wednesday, Lee regretted that his idea of the "new Taiwanese" --
referring to those who live in Taiwan and are willing to fight for
their country's prosperity and survival -- has not been fully
understood by the world, especially by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Dismissing as a "straw man" Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a
"renegade province," Lee said Being has never exercised jurisdiction
over the island and has no legal claim to the island under
international law.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out in his article that the Republic of China (ROC)
in Taiwan has remained a sovereign state since 1912, and it is the
world's 19th-largest economy and the 15th-largest trading country.</P>
      <P>In the 50 years since the People's Republic of China was founded,
both sides of the Taiwan Strait have been ruled separately, with
neither subordinate to the other, said Lee.</P>
      <P>He regretted that these facts have been distorted by Beijing and
overlooked by the international community.</P>
      <P>Defending his claim regarding Taiwan's state-status, Lee said
Taiwan would place itself in an unequal position in negotiations with
Beijing by calling itself -- as it did before -- a "political
entity," which is not in accordance with reality.</P>
      <P>When any two states conduct a dialogue, they do so on an equal
basis, and there is no reason for the cross-strait dialogue to be any
different, said Lee.</P>
      <P>Besides Beijing's reluctance to engage with Taiwan on the basis
of parity, Lee said there are three remaining obstacles to be
overcome before cross-strait relations can flourish, namely:</P>
      <P>-- the lack of mutual trust between Taipei and Beijing: people in
Taiwan remain highly suspicious of the Chinese communists;</P>
      <P>--mainland authorities' refusal to renounce the use of force as a
means to solve the Taiwan Strait issue, which has intensified calls
in Taiwan for declaring independence; and</P>
      <P>-- the vast differences between the two sides of Taiwan Strait
caused by five decades of separate rule, especially the authoritarian
nature of the communist regime, which has alienated the people of
Taiwan from the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is not in anyone's interest to aggravate
cross-strait tensions, Lee reiterated that the ROC government is
willing to take a pragmatic approach toward improving relations with
Beijing, and will not rule out discussing political issues once
meetings with Beijing resume on a basis of parity.</P>
      <P>That is where the international community has a crucial role to
play, first by updating its perceptions of what has taken place on
Taiwan, and according Taiwan the international status it deserves,
said Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee is the first ROC President ever to write for the magazine,
which is published by the US Council on Foreign Relations.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese American physicist and Nobel
laureate Chen-ning Yang is currently visiting Taipei, mainly to lobby
for upgrading the functions of Taiwan's sole theoretical science
center.</P>
      <P>Yang, Nobel Prize co-winner with another Chinese American
Tsung-dao Lee for physics in 1957, attended a meeting at the National
Science Council (NSC) to push for efforts to upgrade the National
Center for Theoretical Sciences (NCTS), a "virtual" research center
temporarily located at National Tsinghua University, into a formally
standing science organization.</P>
      <P>If the NCTS, currently under the auspices of the NSC, is
transformed into a real research center with regular staff and
budget, it could become an important hub for scientific research in
Asia, with Taiwan's solid scientific and technological research
background, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>He added that in Asia, the countries of Japan, South Korea and
mainland China have similar establishments.</P>
      <P>Yang, who became the top adviser to the NCTS when the center was
established three years ago, retired from his professorship at the
State University of New York at Stone Brook in May.</P>
      <P>Yang was chosen by South Korea in 1996 to head the Seoul-based
Asia Pacific Center for Theoretical Physics because of his past
contributions to scientific development in the region and his
towering stature in physics.</P>

    <HEADLINE>"ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS" SAID GOOD FOR TIBET, XINJIANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct.  27 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If Beijing claims that what it learned
in Hong Kong ensures the success of the "one country, two systems"
formula in Taiwan, then perhaps what Communist China learns in Macao
in adopting the same formula can also be applied in Tibet and
Xinjiang, argued an American Asia specialist Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mark Moore, a research associate at the Washington-based Center
for Strategic and International Studies recently wrote that because
of certain similarities to minority communities on the mainland,
Macao's return to Chinese sovereignty on Dec. 20 might prove a
unique lens through which to foresee how Beijing could someday apply
a "one country, two systems" policy to Tibet and Xinjiang.</P>
      <P>In his article in the recent issue of "Hong Kong Update," Moore
said the two unique religious and cultural groups found on the
mainland, Buddhist Tibetans and Muslim Uighers, have been a constant
source of irritation to the Communist Chinese government. Separatist
movements have arisen in Tibet and Xinjiang and the regions are
usually mentioned as the most likely dominoes that could fall should
Taiwan succeed in its claims for independence.</P>
      <P>The Tibetan's and Uigher's long-standing disagreement is based on
the limitations on freedom of language and religion imposed by
Beijing. An interesting contradiction emerges when one compares
Macao's Basic Law with long-standing language policies in Tibet and
Xinjiang, pointed out Moore.</P>
      <P>Macao's Basic Law states that both Portuguese and Chinese will be
official languages even though less than ten percent of the
population of 450,000 is Portuguese. And of the estimated 88,000
students enrolled in secondary and primary schools there, more than
40,000 are attending and will continue to attend Catholic schools,
resulting in Catholicism retaining some measure of social
significance, wrote the specialist</P>
      <P>Moore stressed that if Beijing boasts Macao is a second testament
to the "one country, two systems" formula's success, then perhaps
Tibet and Xinjiang can view language and religious tolerance in Macao
with hope.</P>
      <P>"The argument can be made that if Beijing claims what it learned
in Hong Kong ensures success in Taiwan, then perhaps what it learns
in Macao can also be applied in Tibet and Xinjiang," Moore concluded.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City government is calling for
twins from all over Taiwan to join its "big tree-building" event,
aimed at focusing public attention on parent-child relations.</P>
      <P>The city government and co-sponsor Taipei Twins Association hope
at least 3,500 sets of twins will gather on the square in front of
City Hall on Nov. 12 to be positioned in formation to create a
record-breaking "big tree" signaling "hope," said city officials
Thursday.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Taiwan's oldest twins, nicknamed A-Shun
and A-Jou, were invited to speak about their life experience. The
twin grandmothers are now over 80 years old, and both are in good
shape.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's famous show business twins, Lee Chih-hsi and Chih-chi,
also took part in the press conference to help publicize the call for
event participants and to support the association's attempt to build
a twins data bank for the island.</P>
      <P>In hosting the Nov. 12 event, the association hopes the
anticipated number of 3,500 sets of twins will help Taiwan achieve a
new Guinness world record for gathering the most twins. The current
record is held by the United States for bringing together 2,900 sets
of twins.</P>
      <P>According to the Taichung-based Guinness Museum of World Records,
existing world records related to twins include one that was set by
Peggy Lynn of Pennsylvania in the United States. On Nov. 11, 1995,
Lynn gave birth to a girl, whose twin brother was not born until 84
days later.</P>
      <P>The world's oldest twins are Kin-san and Gin-san of Japan, aged

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SAVINGS RATE STILL DECLINING: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's saving rate has continued to
decline over the past 10 years, signaling a possible change in the
government's approach to securing financial backup, said Taiwan's top
official in charge of economic planning Thursday.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD), said Taiwan's annual savings rate
declined to 23.5 percent in 1998 from 38.5 percent in 1987.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's average annual savings rate, 27.7 percent between 1988
and 1998, is much lower than Japan's 31.5 percent, South Korea's 33.6
percent and Singapore's 46 percent, Chiang noted.</P>
      <P>Chiang attributed Taiwan's declining savings rate to rising
household spending, expanded government spending coupled with slow
growth of government revenue, and declining savings in the private
business and industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>Citing the fact that abundant cash savings in the private sector
had been one of the most important sources of government financing in
the past, Chiang said the reduction of savings is now having an
indirect impact on Taiwan's out-bound investment and government
ability to maintain mid-level economic growth.</P>

      <P>Mainland China distillers have been
prohibited from taking part in rice wine bidding sponsored by the
Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau, said a bureau official
Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to regulations stipulated by the Board of Foreign Trade

import of wine or related products from mainland China, and it is
therefore impossible for mainland distillers to bid, according to the

      <P>Other foreign distillers interested in bidding should submit rice
wine samples along with certificates of product originality for
approval, the official said.</P>
      <P>The official made the statements in response to news reports that
mainland distillers were planning to take part in the bidding via
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The bureau has planned to import 15 million bottles of rice wine
through the international bidding process, which is to be conducted

    <HEADLINE>REESTABLISHMENT OF TAIPEI-MANILA AIR LINKS STILL FAR FROM REACH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new turn in talks between Taiwan and the
Philippines over reestablishment of air links between the two sides
has made resolution of the issue intangible once again, said
government officials on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Philippine government reportedly earlier agreed to officially
recognize the air agreement signed in 1996 between Taipei and Manila,
probably due to the fact that Philippine Airlines (PAL) on Wednesday
urged the Philippine Foreign Ministry to immediately recognize the
agreement.</P>
      <P>The 1996 Air Service Agreement, signed by the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Office (TECO) and its counterpart the Manila Economic and
Cultural Office (MECO), was terminated by the Philippine Civil
Aeronautics Board (PCAB) in late September when the dispute reached
an impasse.</P>
      <P>Leo Li-ming Sung, PAL's adviser in Taipei, on Wednesday
reinterpreted the PCAB's previous decision by saying that only the
subcontract involving passenger quotas was terminated, rather than
the main agreement, which is therefore still in effect.</P>
      <P>The development was reportedly seen by Taipei as a "nice
gesture."</P>
      <P>However, Sung changed his tune on Thursday by saying that no
written recognition of the 1996 air agreement by the government is
necessary, since members of the Philippine aviation panel appeared
last week before the Legislative Yuan explaining Manila's position on
the air talks, and inviting Taipei to restart direct flights while
they are working on a new air agreement.</P>
      <P>In response to the capricious attitude of the Philippines,
officials of the Republic of China Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) said that negotiations can be resumed only if the Philippines
notifies Taipei officially in written form that the 1996 air
agreement is still in effect and immediately resumes the original
quota of 9,600 passengers allowed to be transported per week.</P>
      <P>This being the case, another stalemate has thus resulted. The
issue between Taipei and Manila has come back to where it started.</P>
      <P>Under the 1996 agreement, each side is allowed to transport up to
9,600 passengers per week, but Manila demanded that this number be
slashed to just 3,000. Taipei previously agreed to lower it to 6,500,
a figure that was not accepted by Manila.</P>
      <P>Franklin Ebdalin, Philippine foreign assistant secretary and a
member of Manila's Civil Aeronautics Board, visited Taipei earlier
this month for talks on passenger quotas. Weekly passenger volumes
remain the most contentious point at issue, and no concrete solution
has been in sight to date.</P>
      <P>In addition, it has been confirmed by Sung that Taiwan will not
send a delegation to Manila for air links negotiations next week.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan's performance in
dealing with post-quake relief and reconstruction affairs has won the
public's praise, according to survey results released Thursday.</P>
      <P>Researchers from Shih Hsin University in Taipei contacted
qualified voters around Taiwan on Oct. 23 and 24. A total of 1,093
effective responses were collected, and the margin of error was 3.03
percent.</P>
      <P>The results show that more than 70 percent of respondents thought
Lien has dealt "well" or "OK" with relief and reconstruction affairs
in the aftermath of the Sept. 21 earthquake, in which 2,400 people
died and many thousands were injured or made homeless.</P>
      <P>Fifty-five percent of those surveyed said they believed Lien's
performance in the relief effort will benefit his campaign for
presidency in the 2000 election.</P>
      <P>When asked who they would support if the presidential election
were held the following day, 24.8 percent of those polled answered
that they would vote for former Taiwan Provincial Governor James
Soong, 22.9 percent would select Lien, and 14.4 percent would cast
their votes for former Taipei Mayor and opposition Democrative
Progressive Party candidate Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The margin between Soong and Lien has become smaller, compared
with polls held before the "921 Earthquake," according to researchers
with Shih Hsin's polling center.</P>
      <P>As for the performance of the central and local governments in
quake relief work one month after the temblor, the survey showed that
63.1 percent of those polled expressed satisfaction with the central
government's relief efforts; 53.1 percent of respondents seemed
satisfied with local governments' performance.</P>
      <P>However, 60 percent of those polled said they are not familiar
with the government's post-quake relief policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE PREDICTED TO BECOME CANADA'S 2ND LANGUAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  Oct.  27  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese may have become Canada's second
language by early next century, an expert has predicted.</P>
      <P>Basing his study on the 1996 census results, Jack Jedwab,
executive director of the Montreal Association of Canadian Studies,
forecast in his new book -- Ethnic Identification and Heritage
Languages in Canada -- that Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese) will
replace French as the second leading language in the whole of Canada
except Quebec by 2001 when the Canadian government conducts its next
census.</P>
      <P>French was still the second-most common language in the so-called
"English Canada" when the most recent census was held in 1996.</P>
      <P>Around 86 percent of the population of "English Canada" speak
English at home, while some 589,000, or 2.9 percent of the total,
speak French at home, according to the book. At the same time, about
553,000 people speak Chinese, and the small difference between the
Chinese- and French-speaking populations -- 36,000 -- will disappear
by 2001, it claimed.</P>
      <P>Ontario, the most multilingual and multi-ethnic province in
Canada, will be the first province where Chinese will surpass French
as the most-spoken second language, Jedwab predicted, as the 1996
census results show that the French-speaking population was only
13,000 greater than those speaking Chinese.</P>
      <P>According to Jedwab, the upward trend in the popularity of
Chinese is based on national trends, as the country's
Chinese-speaking population is mainly scattered throughout Ontario
and British Columbia.</P>
      <P>Some 25 years ago, Italian was the third-most popular language in
the country, while German and Ukrainian were also more popular than
Chinese.</P>
      <P>However, the rising number of ethnic Chinese immigrants from
Taiwan, Hong Kong, mainland China and Southeast Asian countries since
the 1980s means that Chinese is becoming increasingly popular in
Canada.</P>
      <P>During the period from 1991 to 1996, the number of ethnic Chinese
in Canada increased by 42 percent, totaling 736,000. Currently, it
totals more than 900,000.</P>
      <P>Jedwab attributed the ability of ethnic Chinese to preserve their
mother tongue in Canada to less integration into local mainstream
society, and to the existence of their own Chinese-language media.
For instance, in Toronto alone, there are three major
Chinese-language newspapers, in addition to radio and television
stations.</P>
      <P>Charles Castonguay, a mathematics professor at Toronto
University, however, was reserved about Jedwab's viewpoints, claiming
that "the outcome of which language will become Canada's second
language must wait until 2001 after the next census has been
conducted."</P>
      <P>Castonguay said he does not think that Chinese will replace
French as Canada's second language, explaining that while the
question of whether Chinese will become Canada's second language may
only be a matter of time, the situation may also change as the
sources of new immigrants into Canada changes.</P>

    <DATELINE>New  York,  Oct.  28  (CNA)
(By Romulo Huang &amp; Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Evergreen Group will soon build 25
container ships, half to be managed by Lloyd Triestino Co., an
Italian shipping company acquired by the Taiwan industry giant last
October, according to a Wednesday report by the Journal of Commerce.</P>
      <P>The New York-based daily quoted Evergreen Group President Chang
Jung-fa as reporting that Evergreen was planning to build up Lloyd
Triestino with its 42 Panamanian-registered container ships and by
adding new ships and hiring new staff.</P>
      <P>Of the 25 new vessels, 20 will have capacities of 3,000 TEU
(twenty-foot-equivalent unit) and five will be 6,000-TEU capacity
ships.</P>
      <P>Evergreen Group acquired Lloyd Triestino for US$35 million and
shouldered its US$100 million in debts last October, while permitting
the Italian company to retain its name and operate as a sister
company to Evergreen.</P>
      <P>Lloyd Triestino will develop new services, including expanded
service to mainland China. The company recently started weekly
service linking mainland China, the Mediterranean and Northern
Europe.</P>
      <P>Chang was quoted as saying that Evergreen Group was also planning
to merge Evergreen Marine Corp. (Taiwan) Ltd., the world's second
largest container carrier, with Uniglory Marine Corp., an Evergreen
subsidiary.</P>
      <P>If the merger is approved by the government of the Republic of
China, Uniglory would become an intra-Asia trade department within
Evergreen Marine, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang was also quoted as saying that Evergreen will further
strengthen its cooperation with mainland China's state-run China
Ocean Shipping Co. (COSCO), with which it operates joint service in
the Far East, South Africa and South America. Uniglory operates joint
service with COSCO between the Far East and the Middle East.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The members of Falun Gong are determined to
challenge Beijing's decision to outlaw their exercise and meditation,
despite the full force of the state being pitted against them,
Canada's The Globe and Mail reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The newspaper described Falun Gong as "a New Age sect that has
sent jitters through China's communist regime," whose security forces
fanned out on Tiananmen Square on Wednesday in an attempt to further
crack down on practitioners there.</P>
      <P>Protests at Tiananmen Square have escalated in the past few days
because mainland China's rulers, meeting in the Great Hall of the
People just beside the square, are currently discussing how to make
the sect illegal, the paper said in a dispatch from Beijing.</P>
      <P>"The seven-year-old sect's influence on Chinese society is deeper
than Beijing thought," the report said, noting that Falun Gong
members have been found in the military, police apparatus, students
and society at large.</P>
      <P>The Ottawa Citizen, another major Canadian daily, said the
escalation of the conflict over religious freedom has become an
embarrassment for the communist Chinese leadership, which had claimed
victory over the banned group after a crackdown this summer.</P>
      <P>In Canada, Falun Gong practitioners from Montreal and other
eastern Canada cities are set to gather in Montreal on Saturday "to
bring attention to the Falun Gong situation in China and to call for
immediate international assistance," organizers said.</P>
      <P>The Canadian followers plan to provide information about
"inhumane treatment and torture deaths of Falun Gong practitioners
and the current crisis in China." They will march through downtown
Montreal before pausing at Philips Square to an exercise exhibition.</P>
      <P>Over 100 Falun Gong practitioners have gathered in Ottawa twice
in the past month to call for international attention to mainland
China's persecution of religious freedom and civil liberties. At
least one member of parliament has agreed to support them by
collecting the signatures of other MPs in a petition.</P>

    <DATELINE>Manila, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Timothy Sun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippines on Wednesday filed a second
diplomatic protest with Vietnam after Manila confirmed the ongoing
expansion of Vietnamese facilities on a reef in the disputed Spratly
island group in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>The protest also concerned the firing of shots at a Philippine
military aircraft that flew over the atoll.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon Jr. said Vietnam was
upgrading facilities at Tennent Reef, and that on Oct. 13, a
Philippine Air Force reconnaissance aircraft sent to confirm the
sighting was fired upon by Vietnamese troops, although it was not
hit.</P>
      <P>The protest came two weeks after the Philippines issued a similar
protest over the expansion by the Vietnamese of facilities at Osmena
Reef and De Jesus Reef in the Kalayaan island group.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Under-secretary Benjamin Domingo summoned
Vietnamese Ambassador Nguyen Thac Dinh on Wednesday to officially
express the Philippine government's grave concern over the latest
developments in the area.</P>
      <P>"We view with greatest concern these recent acts of Vietnam,
coming as they have only a day after the Philippines had expressed
its concern over the improvement of structures by Vietnam on Osmena
Reef and De Jesus Reef," Siazon said.</P>
      <P>He added: "These acts, particularly the firing of shots at
Philippine aircraft, are a clear assault on the letter and spirit of
various regional, multilateral and bilateral agreements and
declarations entered into by both the Philippine and Vietnamese
governments."</P>
      <P>Siazon stressed that Tennent Reef "forms part of Philippines
territory and is within the country's exclusive economic zone."</P>
      <P>Based on reconnaissance photographs, Siazon said the Vietnamese
are erecting a three-story octagonal-shaped concrete building similar
to other structures that have already been established in other
Vietnamese-held reefs in the Spratlys.</P>
      <P>"In the spirit of preserving close bilateral ties and ASEAN
solidarity and cooperation, the Philippines earnestly requests the
government of Vietnam to reconsider its most recent action in Tennent
Reef," Siazon said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Oct. 27 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former US Assistant Secretary of State
for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord said on Wednesday
that Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's "state-to-state"
relationship theory is a description of "objective reality."</P>
      <P>Lord made the remarks at a Senate confirmation hearing called by
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, for new US Ambassador to China Joseph Prueher.</P>
      <P>"What you have now, Mr. Chairman, is de facto two separate
entities. And when President Lee spoke out recently, he was
describing what is objective reality," Lord said while responding to
questions raised by Helms on whether "one China" is going to happen,
and under what circumstances.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has done very well with a de facto separation from the
mainland. There should be no pressure on it. It should be able to
determine its own future dealings with China," Lord said.</P>
      <P>"But to make this de jure without consulting with the (US)
administration I think did blindside the administration, did not
serve Taiwan's interest," he added.</P>
      <P>"There will not be `one China' completely until the mainland
looks more like Taiwan; namely, freer. And Taiwan has no interest in
joining up with it (the mainland) until that happens," he continued.</P>
      <P>Lord also said that it is important for Washington to warn
Beijing not to use force while seeking to solve its dispute with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lord and several US congressmen present at the hearing also urged
the US administration to be more consistent in asking mainland China
to improve its human rights record.</P>
      <P>Lord said that the United States should not adopt double
standards while dealing with mainland China on the human rights
issue, and should not remain silent on Beijing's arrest of the mother
of leading mainland dissident Wang Dan.</P>
      <P>Lord, who once also served as US ambassador to mainland China,
said that the United States should again propose at the annual
meeting of the United Nation's Human Rights Committee that mainland
China improve its human rights protection if dialogue between
Washington and Beijing on the issue cannot be conducted smoothly.</P>

      <P>The US government on Wednesday
continued to voice its opposition to the Taiwan Security Enforcement
Act that was approved by the House International Relations Committee
on Tuesday with minor modifications.</P>
      <P>A White House spokesman described the bill as "not acceptable" to
the Clinton administration, and said "it might destabilize the
region."</P>
      <P>At the same time, a State Department official said the bill
"would diminish prospects for cross-(Taiwan) strait dialogue and
peaceful resolution of differences" between mainland China and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Some sources predicted that the bill may not be enacted because
it remains uncertain whether or not the Senate will approve it, and
even if approved by the Senate, the bill may be vetoed by President
Bill Clinton.</P>
      <P>The State Department official stated that the legislation would
erode the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA)'s commitment to an unofficial
US-Taiwan relationship by formalizing military relations.</P>
      <P>"This could have the serious, unintended negative consequence of
weakening both Taiwan's security and our own security interest in the
region," he said.</P>
      <P>The official acknowledged that "we believe the bill is predicated
on the incorrect assumption that the TRA is not working and needs a
fix."</P>
      <P>In fact, he pointed out, "the TRA is working well. It's not
necessary to amend, strengthen or supplement the TRA." He also
stressed that the US government "has steadfastly honored the TRA's
mandates and helped ensure the security of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We have successfully helped Taiwan to satisfy its legitimate
defense needs in accordance with the security and arms sales
provisions of the TRA, and we will continue to do so," he went on.</P>
      <P>The official also said that the US government believes that
certain sections of the bill would unconstitutionally interfere with
the president's authority and with his ability to carry out his
responsibilities regarding the conduct of US foreign relations.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is scheduled to begin introducing
workers from Vietnam on Nov. 1 to help alleviate the persistent labor
shortage, said Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Chairman Chan Hou-sheng
on Friday.</P>
      <P>Initially, there will be no cap on the number of Taiwan-bound
Vietnamese laborers, whom may be employed at construction sites,
manufacturing plants, or work as household maids and nurses, Chan
noted.</P>
      <P>The introduction of Vietnamese workers here is expected to have
its biggest impact on the Philippines, which is facing a freeze of
laborer exports to Taiwan in the wake of a recent diplomatic dispute
triggered by a bilateral aviation row between the two countries.</P>
      <P>With the admittance of Vietnamese workers, the number of
countries from which Taiwan imports laborers has increased to five,
including Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>The local brokerage agencies of foreign workers welcomed the
opening of Taiwan to Vietnamese laborers, saying that the
introduction increases potential Taiwanese employers' options. The
opening will also help correct the over-priced brokerage fees and
disputes between employers and employees, they said.</P>

      <P>A Republic of China official in charge of
policies on mainland China Friday urged Hong Kong authorities to be
rational over Taiwan representative Cheng An-kuo's visa renewal so as
to help bolster bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Lin Chung-ping, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), said the MAC is paying close attention to Hong
Kong's decision on Cheng's visa renewal as his work visa is due to
expire at the end of November.</P>
      <P>Rumors have circulated that Hong Kong authorities rejected a visa
renewal application filed by Cheng, director of Chung Hwa Travel
Service Hong Kong, the de facto representative of Taipei in the
former British colony, because of a political grudge Beijing harbors
toward him.</P>
      <P>Cheng was allegedly denied a visa renewal because Beijing was
angry about Cheng's remarks during a Hong Kong radio interview in
July amplifying President Lee Teng-hui's "special state-to-state
relations" theory defining cross-strait relations, the rumors said.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taipei has up until today still not heard any word from
Hong Kong authorities about the prospects of Cheng's visa renewal.</P>
      <P>He added that the MAC has been highly satisfied with Cheng's
performance in Hong Kong, particularly with efforts to facilitate
mutual exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who speaks flawless Cantonese, the most common language
spoken in Hong Kong, assumed his post there nearly four years ago.</P>

      <P>Canadian ethicists said Thursday auctioning
the eggs of beautiful women is the ugly face of a biotechnology
explosion in a society that believes money really can buy everything.</P>
      <P>"People seem to believe that anything is possible and if anything

a University of Calgary physician and immediate past president of the
Canadian Bioethics Society.</P>
      <P>"I think it's a big mistake to be commodifying the materials of
human reproduction," agreed Dr. Susan Sherwin, a leading
international ethicist from Dalhousie University in Halifax. "It's
not far from selling eggs to selling children."</P>
      <P>Both spoke at the society's annual conference which runs through
Sunday in Edmonton. Topics include genetic testing, artificially
modified food, euthanasia and human eggs for sale.</P>
      <P>The controversy over the sale of human eggs made front-page
headlines this week when eggs of beautiful models were offered up for
auction at a Internet site.</P>
      <P>Sherwin said it is imperative that some kind of legislation be
developed soon, not only to restrict questionable technologies, but
to send a moral signal about our attitudes toward human life.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US-JAPAN-PRC COOPERATION AFFECTED BY TAIWAN, HISTORY SAYS EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Oct. 28 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The unresolved status of Taiwan and the
deep, historic animosity between China and Japan are the greatest
obstacles to improved trilateral cooperation between the mainland,
Japan and the US, said an American Asia expert Thursday.</P>
      <P>These were the conclusions reached by the assistant director of
the Nixon Center in Washington, Greg May, after a week of meetings
with foreign policy experts, politicians, and incumbent and former
officials in Shanghai, Beijing and Tokyo in mid-October.</P>
      <P>In his report titled "The future of China-Japan-US Trilateral
Relations," May said that events in Taiwan have actually helped
repair Washington-Beijing ties. He noted that several mainland
Chinese experts praised the Clinton administration's response to
Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui's attempt to redefine cross-strait
relations as a "special state-to-state" relationship.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration's quick reiteration of its "one China"
policy, US opposition to Taiwan's UN membership, and opposition to
the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act were all cited as examples of
Washington's "correct" handling of the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>May also noted that there appears to be an almost universal
belief in mainland China that cross-strait relations will improve
after Taiwan elects a new president next March, particularly if James
Soong, an independent who advocates a more accommodating approach to
the mainland, wins the election.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that discussions with Japan's Diet members and
foreign ministry officials in Tokyo indicated that, over the long
term, Beijing-Tokyo relations will continue to be strained. One of
the reasons he mentioned was rising pro-Taiwan sentiment due to
President Lee's popularity among Japanese politicians and the public
at large.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan and the "history problem" remain the largest and
most immediate obstacles to closer PRC-Japan relations, the argument
over these two issues masks more fundamental tensions, including
Communist China's fears of a remilitarized Japan and the latent
competition between Beijing and Tokyo over the future leadership of
the East Asia region, noted May.</P>

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Friday expressed
gratitude on behalf of the Republic of China government and people
for Japan's generous donations, support and care to victims of the
massive earthquake that rattled Taiwan on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>Lee offered his thanks during a meeting at the Presidential
Office with visiting Japanese writer Ayako Sono, who is also the
chairwoman of the Nippon Foundation, a charity organization founded
in 1962 to strive for world peace and social welfare.</P>
      <P>Lee told his guest that although the devastating quake resulted
in a great deal of loss and damage, "we have the faith to pick
ourselves up and stand tall again."</P>
      <P>Sono told the president of the concern among Japan's business
sector over the harm caused by the quake, and on behalf of the Nippon
Foundation, read a statement of condolence announcing a further
donation of 300 million yen (US$2.88 million) to boost post-quake
rehabilitation efforts in central Taiwan, the worst-hit area.</P>
      <P>Sono said Japan benefited from support and aid from many
countries and international organizations, including the ROC, after a
destructive earthquake jolted the city of Kobe in January 1995,
killing nearly 5,300 people.</P>
      <P>She blessed the thousands of Taiwanese victims of the Sept. 21

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 14-year-old boy who
is about to lose a battle with cancer appeared in a concert in his
honor at Kaohsiung Veteran General Hospital on Friday, reducing many
to tears with his courage and the cruelty of life.</P>
      <P>Wu Kuan-yi, a talented poet, writer and painter whose greatest
wish is to receive a Nobel Prize, is displaying more than 100
paintings and poems, as well as essays, in the hospital's main hall,
to a background of orchestral music played by young musicians from
Kaohsiung's Tong Kuang primary school, of which Wu is a former pupil.</P>
      <P>Wu, who weighs only around 30 kg because of a brain tumor, was
present at the concert, lying weak and drowsy on his sick bed.</P>
      <P>His teary mother kept talking to him about the occasion during
his on-and-off consciousness. Wu managed to murmur a few words
expressing gratitude for the concern and support that society has
shown him.</P>
      <P>Among the paintings was a self-portrait that Wu painted at the
age of 12. The painting depicts a handsome young man looking cool and
self-confident.</P>
      <P>His paintings, poems and essays, all of which are considered to
be of the standard of professional adult artists, will be collected
and printed in the form of a book which is scheduled to roll off the
presses at the end of November titled "A Major Jolt of Life," said
Chou Ching-hua, founder the Chou Ta-kun Cultural and Educational
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Chou went on to describe Wu's work, saying the artist is telling
us that despite his "concentrated" life, he can still bring light and
warmth to people, even though he is dying.</P>
      <P>Tong Kuang school principal, Hung Fang-lan, said Wu brings her
new insight that life's value is not how much power you have but how
much influence you have on other people.</P>
      <P>Wu checked into Kaohsiung Veteran General Hospital last October
because of weakness and fatigue. He was later diagnosed as having
developed pineal gland leiomyosarcoma, a form of brain cancer. The
tumor has now spread to his spine and his days are numbered,

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Students of many schools demolished by the
Sept. 21 earthquake may be able to return to their classrooms and
schoolyards by September 2000, as Taiwan's private sector has pledged
support to rebuild the schools.</P>
      <P>Education Minister Yang Chaur-shin said on Friday that more than
800 schools, mostly in Taichung and Nantou counties in central
Taiwan, have suffered damage to varying degrees, and that the cost of
rebuilding and repairing has been estimated at NT$40 billion. The
government on its own would have difficulty raising such a huge sum
within a short time, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Among the total, 138 primary and secondary schools were almost
totally demolished, and the private sector, including religious
groups, educational foundations, benevolent institutions, media
establishments, and enterprises, has pledged support with
reconstruction by "adopting" the schools in question.</P>
      <P>Several legislators convened a meeting on Friday with the
participation of the education and finance ministries, and
representatives from the construction industry, to discuss how to
proceed with the reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Yang reported that the private sector has so far adopted 79 of
the schools, with the Tzu Chi Buddhist Compassionate Relief
Association, for instance, having agreed to single-handedly raise
funds for rebuilding 26 of the schools.</P>
      <P>By adopting the schools, the private establishments can either
proceed with the reconstruction work themselves, or donate the
required sum for reconstruction and entrust the authorities to carry
out the work.</P>
      <P>The Education Ministry expects that more schools will be adopted
over the next few weeks, and that an overall reconstruction plan can
be finalized by the end of November.</P>
      <P>If the reconstruction work can start in March 2000 as scheduled,
the students will be able to attend their rebuilt schools after next
summer's vacation, according to Yang.</P>

      <P>The criminals then stage elaborate "contract signing" ceremonies
where the Taiwan businessmen are duped into paying out money, Liu
said. He noted that the ROC Embassy in Burkina Faso has been notified
of three such cases since August.</P>
      <P>Although two of the scams failed when embassy officials

    <HEADLINE>MANILA URGED TO RECOGNIZE AIR AGREEMENT WITH TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Manila,  Oct. 29 (CNA)
(By Sun Ting-wu and Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in
the Philippines (TECO) sent a letter on Friday to its Philippines
counterpart urging the Philippine government to confirm its respect
for the air agreement signed in 1996 between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The letter, in which Taipei's stance regarding the
re-establishment of air links was stated, was sent on the
instructions of Republic of China Premier Vincent Siew, who outlined
the following three principles for handling the aviation agreement:</P>
      <P>-- The Philippines must issue an official announcement indicating
its respect for the 1996 Taipei-Manila Air Service Agreement which
was signed between TECO and its Philippine counterpart, the Manila
Economic and Cultural Office (MECO);</P>
      <P>-- Manila must respond with goodwill, and the negotiation cannot
continue if Manila insists that Taipei reduce its combined weekly
passenger quota on the Taiwan-Philippines route to 3,000 from the
previous 9,600; and</P>
      <P>-- Manila must accept that the air agreement is a legal document
between the two countries, so that it has adequate legal weight.</P>
      <P>TECO officials noted that an immediate response is not expected
since the Philippines is embarking on a four-day long weekend, and an
anonymous senior TECO official remained pessimistic over a goodwill
response, accusing the Philippines of being capricious and "always
using empty words without following up with concrete actions."</P>
      <P>Since direct airlinks between Taipei and Manila were terminated
on Oct. 2 by Manila, the Philippines has expressed its hope of
resuming bilateral talks and re-establishing the links as soon as
possible.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ICELAND URGED TO CONSIDER SETTING UP TRADE OFFICE IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is necessary for Iceland to establish a
trade office in Taiwan as business and trade exchanges between the
two countries have begun to boom, said the visiting mayor of the
capital and largest city in Iceland, Reykjavik, on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Reykjavik Mayor Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir and Secretary
General Ricky Kao of the China External Trade Development Council
(CETRA) jointly presided over the Iceland Seminar &amp; Trade Meeting at
the CETRA headquarters Friday, mainly to promote Iceland's
commodities and solicit Taiwanese businesses to invest in the
Scandinavian country.</P>
      <P>This is the first time that a large-scale Icelandic trade mission
led by the capital's mayor has visited here to seek to become trade
partners with Taiwan, according to CETRA sources.</P>
      <P>The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is also attaching
great importance to the visit by Gisladottir, who is presently one of
the most promising hopefuls to become the next prime minister.</P>
      <P>Gisladottir's visit is considered by MOFA as a goodwill gesture
after Vice President Lien Chan's visit to Iceland in 1998, which he
called a "fruitful" and "ice-breaking" trip.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the seminar, CETRA chief executive Kao
said Iceland, located in the North Atlantic, has rich resources of
fish, inexpensive natural energy and commendable manufactured
products, including down-filled garments.</P>
      <P>During the seminar, Iceland's largest mineral water manufacturer,
ThorSpring, solicited Taiwanese partners to jointly tap Taiwan's
bottled water market.</P>
      <P>ThorSpring, of which Coca Cola holds 40 percent of corporate
shares, Hof Holding 40 percent and the Reykjavik city government 20
percent, has maintained distribution centers in Asia, including
Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Icelandic firm Pedup forged an agreement with a Taipei
software company to jointly promote Taiwan-developed children's
software packages to Scandinavia and Europe.</P>
      <P>Other members of the Icelandic trade mission included marketing
executives from companies in the frozen fish industry, shark bone
processing, investment consultation services, fish catch
telecommunications and the down processing industry.</P>

      <P>Organizers of the 2000 Sydney Olympic

      <P>Olympic Minister Michael Knight of New South Wales on Friday told

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN STILL PUSHING FOR WTO ACCESSION, SAYS COA HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is still pushing for accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) despite the fact that its
prospects and those of mainland China for entry this year have become
increasingly gloomy, top agriculture official Peng Tso-kwei said on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Peng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA),
said the COA is presently reviewing Taiwan's granting of preferential
"down payment" treatment to the United States and other WTO member
countries, but he insisted that the top priority should be on
continued efforts to gain WTO membership rather than canceling any
preferential treatment.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, he added, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Lin
Yi-fu has left for the United States to meet with US officials to
discuss bilateral issues concerning Taiwan's WTO bid. Lin hopes to
reach further consensus with Washington beneficial to Taiwan's cause
in the upcoming WTO ministerial meeting slated to open in Seattle on
Nov. 30.</P>
      <P>During the WTO talks with the United States last year, Taiwan
promised "down payment" -- allowing the US to export to Taiwan 10,000
tons of chicken, 5,000 tons of pork and 7,500 tons of pork offal
every year even before Taiwan's entry into the WTO -- so as to
facilitate its bid to enter the trade body.</P>
      <P>In May this year, other WTO members followed suit asking Taiwan
for the same treatment. Taiwan has therefore agreed to provide global
quotas to WTO members other than the United States, allowing imports
of 1,600 tons of pork, 9,163 tons of chicken, 5,000 tons of pork
offal and 2,500 tons of beef offal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan previously expected to enter the WTO before the end of
this year at about the same time as mainland China was to have
entered. However, this dream seems to have almost faded as there has
yet been no breakthrough in WTO talks between Beijing and Washington
and between Beijing and the European Union.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS, LEGISLATORS URGE RECONSTRUCTION OF CULTURAL RELICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scholars on cultural heritage, architecture
and community development and several legislators on Saturday jointly
pleaded for the proper renovation of many cultural establishments and
relics damaged by the Sept. 21 earthquake.</P>
      <P>The scholars earlier formed an ad hoc group dedicated to rescue
of damaged cultural assets. They had suggested that the Executive
Yuan should include cultural assets in the reconstruction list and
allocate funds for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The post-disaster reconstruction , concentrating on housing
units, schools, industrial establishments and basic infrastructure,
has already gotten under way. But the ad hoc group worries that in
the process of rebuilding, many earthquake-damaged cultural
establishments and relics will be forgotten.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the group organized specialists and college
students in related subjects to conduct an island-wide survey after
the earthquake. The first-stage survey report indicated that 50
cultural relics and historical landmarks were known to have suffered
damage of varying degrees.</P>
      <P>In addition to the damaged cultural relics, many old buildings
with historical significance also experienced natural as well as
human catastrophe as owners have tended to tear the
earthquake-damaged structures down to make way for new projects.</P>
      <P>The specialists urged the Council for Cultural Affairs under the
Executive Yuan to conduct a survey of damaged historical buildings
and make a list of those that should be preserved. In the meantime,
they asked the government to find ways to keep the cultural relics
from being demolished, such as by providing incentives to the owners.</P>
      <P>The council adopted an emergency measure in late October to
provide special funding for the reinforcing of historical buildings.
The government will provide a total of NT$10 million for this
purpose.</P>
      <P>Stating that the amount of government funding is definitely
insufficient, the specialists called on the private sector to
contribute to saving the cultural relics by participating in
restoration work or by making donations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF TO SPONSOR CROSS-STRAIT SEMINAR ON SEISMOLOGY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) will
sponsor a seminar on seismology with the participation of scholars
from both sides of the Taiwan Strait, SEF Deputy Secretary-General
Jan Jyh-horng said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Jan made the announcement after a meeting with a group of
mainland Chinese seismologists who are currently on a weeklong visit
here.</P>
      <P>Jan said SEF, a semi-official intermediary body authorized by the
Republic of China government to handle exchanges with mainland China
in the absence of official ties, will join forces with local
professional academic institutes in organizing the seminar.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Jan said, SEF will invite its mainland counterpart
-- the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) --
to assist in organizing the symposium.</P>
      <P>Jan expressed regret over media reports that Taiwan had rejected
mainland China's offer for help shortly after a devastating
earthquake hit the central part of the island on Sept. 21.</P>
      <P>"Such reports were misleading," Jan said, adding that Taiwan has
never rejected any offer for help from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Several visiting mainland scholars also said that while some
mainland seismologists had expressed concern about Taiwan's
post-earthquake situation, none of them really applied for visits to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jan said he had discussed with visiting mainland academics some
details regarding the planned cross-strait seismological seminar,
including key issues to be put on the agenda.</P>
      <P>"The seminar will offer a forum for local and mainland scholars
to exchange views and data concerning seismic observations,
forecasts, engineering and research.</P>
      <P>He added that SEF will present a detailed plan for the seminar to
the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) for approval in the
near future.</P>
      <P>The seminar is tentatively scheduled to take place in late
November, Jan said, adding that the symposium will provide
opportunities for seismologists from the two sides to exchange
information and data concerning major earthquakes that occurred in
Taiwan and mainland China over past years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC OFFICIAL INTERVIEWED BY SANKEI SHINBUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is continuing its verbal
attacks and military intimidation of Taiwan, Wu An-chia, vice
chairman of the cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said in
an interview published by Sankei Shinbum on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that currently there are two camps in mainland China
holding differing views on the timing of Taiwan visit of iWang
Daohan, mainland China's top negotiator with Taiwan. One camp
maintains that Wang should visit Taiwan as soon as possible to resume
high-level cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>The other view is that Wang should wait to visit Taiwan
until after the island's presidential election next March, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wang and his ROC counterpart Koo Chen-fu had agreed during their
talks on the mainland last year that Wang would visit Taiwan in the
fall of 1999.</P>
      <P>The mainland, however, reacted angrily after President Lee
Teng-hui in early July redefined cross-strait ties as a "special
state-to-state relationship" and insisted that Taiwan must retract the
statement before Wang could visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu said that those who think Wang should visit Taiwan earlier
believe the "state-to-state relationship" rhetoric was only a
statement of facts, and that it has not changed Taiwan's policy
toward the mainland.</P>
      <P>Those who are opposed to Wang's visit now believe that the trip
is equivalent to a recognition of a "state-to-state relationship," Wu
said, adding that those who oppose the visit have now gained the
upper hand.</P>
      <P>On the issue of President Lee Teng-hui's official status when
receiving Wang, Wu said that Lee would not insist on seeing Wang in
his capacity as the president.</P>
      <P>On the prospect of cross-strait relations, Wu said that mainland
China's policy toward Taiwan hasn't undergone any basic changes and
that its military intimidation has remained.</P>
      <P>Although the mainland did tone down its saber-rattling a little
after Taiwan's devastating Sept. 21 earthquake and suspended its
military exercises, these moves were aimed at avoiding the incitement
of Taiwanese people's revulsion, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He believes that mainland China's policy is basically to get
Taiwan to rely more and more on the mainland's economy, and then to
get it to rely more on the mainland politically, so as to woo Taiwan
people and expand its influence over the island.</P>

      <P>An international seminar on Madame Chiang
Kai-shek and her contribution to contemporary China is scheduled to
be held in Taipei Nov. 1-3 under the auspices of the Kuomintang's
Department of Party History.</P>
      <P>The seminar, the first of its kind ever to be held in Taiwan, is
expected to have 230 scholars, historians, and political figures from
home and abroad take part, with 21 papers to be presented, said Chen
Peng-jen, director general of the KMT Department of Party History.</P>
      <P>Participating specialists from Canada, Japan, Russia and the
United States are expected to bring invaluable historical archive
materials regarding Mme. Chiang or Mayling Soong, and about China,
particularly before and during World War II, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>A total of 10 workshops are scheduled for the three-day seminar,
which will include the thoughts of Mme. Chiang, her military
perceptions as the wife of the wartime leader of China, her diplomacy
philosophy towards the United States, women's movement in China at
the time, Taiwan's charity activities initiated by Mme. Chiang, her
love life, and her being the focus of attention by the world media
and political observers.</P>

Chiang at the closing session of the seminar, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Madame Chiang, hailed by historians as "the only remaining major
figure of World War II," is now sound and healthy at the age of 101
and will turn 102 in March. In two months she will witness her third
century when the year 2000 kicks off.</P>
      <P>Chen said Mme. Chiang is not only a living national treasure of
the Republic of China, but also a source of pride for all Chinese
people.</P>
      <P>Mme. Chiang spoke before the US Congress in 1943, when World War
II was at its peak and China's war against Japan was in high gear.
Mme. Chiang, a graduate of Wellesley College in Massachusetts,
addressed a joint session of Congress at the invitation of President
Franklin Roosevelt, calling for a concerted effort from the US in
fighting against the Japanese militants.</P>
      <P>The former ROC first lady than went on a 46-state speech tour
around the United States between February and April of the same year,
winning the hearts and support of US citizens with her eloquence and
unique charisma.</P>
      <P>Of all the Allied leaders and their wives during World War II,
only Madame Chiang is still alive.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou on Saturday urged
people suffering from disabilities to learn from Hirotada Ototake, a
after meeting with the popular writer on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Ototake, born without limbs, is a senior at Waseda University.

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO CREATE BASIC LAW ON POST-DISASTER RECONSTRUCTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several female legislators of the ruling
Kuomintang on Saturday urged the government to constitute a basic law
on measures to cope with disasters and on measures to conduct
post-disaster reconstruction as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers made the proposal at a press conference held at
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The legislators went to Osaka and Kobe, Japan on Oct. 24-26 to
study the post-quake reconstruction work in the area. A magnitude 6.9
earthquake struck Osaka and Kobe in January 1995, claiming more than
5,000 lives.</P>
      <P>Upon their return to Taiwan, they conveyed to the ROC government
the four principles of reconstruction work proposed by the Japanese
side. The four stated principles were government courage in tackling
big problems, clarification of responsibility, prevention and control
of infectious diseases, and psychological rebuilding.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Chao-shun, a member of the study mission,
indicated the main reasons why Japan's post-quake reconstruction had
been so effective were the integration of ideas from the local and
central governments, the establishment of community organizations,
and the incorporation of volunteer and professional manpower.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that Japan's handling of reconstruction provides a
good reference for the ROC government, pointing to the Japanese
parliament's quick passage of relief bills enabling the government to
quickly begin reconstruction efforts.</P>
      <P>During their visit, the legislators called on Kobe's mayor and
related officials and also officials of Hyogo Prefecture to exchange
views on rehabilitation efforts.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers also, on behalf of the people and government of the
ROC, extended their heartfelt gratitude for the assistance and
concerns of Japanese from all walks of life after the "921
Earthquake" hit Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO NATIONAL UNIFICATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui reiterated on
Saturday that the Republic of China has never forsaken its goal of
promoting eventual unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee made the reaffirmation during a ceremony marking Veterans
Day, which falls on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The president told recipients of this year's model veterans
awards that the ROC government's efforts to establish a free,
democratic system in Taiwan is by no means aimed at promoting Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>"We have never abandoned our ultimate national goal of promoting
China's unification under freedom and democracy," Lee said, adding
that he believes Taiwan's democratization can help push mainland
China's political reform.</P>
      <P>Lee further stressed that national unification can be realized
only after mainland China democratizes its political system.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Lee also lauded retired servicemen for their
contribution to local society, saying their contribution has been a
driving force behind national development.</P>
      <P>"You had dedicated yourselves to safeguarding national security
during your service in the military and continued working hard at
various positions after retiring from the military. I deeply admire
your loyalty to our country and support for our government," Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has attached great importance to
improve retired servicemen's quality of life, Lee said a package of
constitutional amendments passed earlier this year has included a
provision that requires the government to fully protect retired
servicemen's rights and interests.</P>
      <P>"With concerted efforts of various government agencies, I
believe that all retired servicemen will be able to receive better
care in the future," Lee added.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, President Lee also presided over a ceremony
marking the anniversary of the late President Chiang Kai-shek's
birthday, which also falls on Sunday.</P>
      <P>More than 500 government officials, military officers,
parliamentarians and overseas Chinese representatives attended the
ceremony held at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan President Fredrick Chien delivered a report on the
late president's political concepts and contribution to the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE DECIDES TO EXPEL SU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  30  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang's disciplinary
committee Saturday unanimously supported the Central Standing
Committee's decision in early September to expel former National
Assembly (NA) Speaker Su Nan-cheng from the KMT and consequently his
status as an at-large member of the NA will be revoked.</P>
      <P>The decision was made after the KMT disciplinary committee held a
meeting focusing on Su's 20,000-word petition filed early last week
in defense of his role in the tenure-extension amendment.</P>
      <P>The KMT's Dept. of Organization Affairs sent a notice to the
Central Election Commission, the island's highest authority
overseeing election matters, immediately after the meeting to ask the
commission to revoke Su's at-large membership in the NA.</P>
      <P>The whole case will be submitted next Wednesday to the KMT's
Central Standing Committee for reference.</P>
      <P>The KMT has charged Su with violating the party line and public
opinion by forcing through the passage of a bill allowing the
incumbent National Assembly deputies to extend their tenures for two
years to May 2002.</P>
      <P>The passage of the self-serving tenure-extension amendment to the
constitution immediately aroused public indignation with many blaming
the KMT for its failure to influence its deputies, most of whom voted
to support the term-extension.</P>
      <P>Su was disciplined by the KMT afterwards by being expelled from
the party. Su, an appointed NA deputy, was automatically deprived of
office upon revocation of his party membership.</P>
      <P>However, nearly two months after his dismissal, Su was found to
be still conducting business at the Speaker's office, arousing public
outrage once again.</P>
      <P>According to Central Election Commission regulations, the KMT had
informed the commission of Su's expulsion from the party on Sept. 9
but later withdrew the document. This was seen as the reason why the
former Speaker continued showing up in his NA office through October.
The devastating quake also played a role by temporarily diverting the
public's attention away from Su's case.</P>
      <P>Faced with the refocusing of public attention on Su, the KMT
disciplinary committee took immediate action and unanimously upheld
his expulsion.</P>
      <P>KMT Spokesman Huang Hwei-chen pointed out that the whole KMT
leadership, from Chairman Lee Teng-hui and Vice Chairman Lien Chan to
Secretary-General John Chang, has been consistently and adamantly
opposed to the tenure-extension proposal.</P>
      <P>Former Taiwan Governor James Soong, who is an independent
presidential candidate, doubted the KMT's punishment of Su was aimed
at finding a scapegoat for the party's leadership.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HP WON'T CHANGE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY IN TAIWAN DESPITE EARTHQUAKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 30 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hewlett Packard (HP) will not withdraw the
effort and resources it has injected in the Taiwan market despite the
effect of the Sept. 21 earthquake on the island's economy, the
company's CEO and President Carly S. Fiorina said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Although the massive earthquake ended with tragedy in Taiwan, its
impact on the island's industrial development and economic growth is
expected to be only temporary, Fiorina said at a press conference
prior to her departure after a two-day whirlwind visit in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She also said that although the operational performance of HP's
Taiwan affiliate during the latest season has been disappointing, the
company will maintain its development strategies for the local
market, believing that Taiwan will soon recover and stand on its own
feet again.</P>
      <P>Citing that the number of Internet users in Asia is dramatically
increasing, and that the popularity in the use and application of
computer devices and Internet services in Taiwan has led those in
other Asian economies, Fiorina indicated HP will put resources toward
the ROC government's efforts to promote the globalization of local
businesses in order to help them catch up with the global E-commerce
era in time.</P>
      <P>The chief executive also announced that HP has forged a strategic
alliance with the Koo's Group in order to make inroads into the local
E-commerce services market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, HP has also formed cooperation ties with Tatung Co. to
assist the giant local electronic manufacturer in the development and
establishment of a planned Internet service system, designed to offer
household sales and delivery services through computer ordering, the
CEO noted.</P>
      <P>However, Fiorina declined to disclose how much money is involved
in the two mentioned partnerships or how much worth of Taiwanese
products HP intends to purchase in the upcoming year. Instead, the
CEO mentioned that HP had bought nearly US$3 billion-worth of goods
in Taiwan in 1998.</P>
      <P>HP has confidence in Taiwan, Fiorina stressed, noting her company
will continue to increase its purchases from Taiwanese businesses.</P>
      <P>This is Fiorina's first visit to Taiwan, and is part of her Asian
tour undertaken along with HP Chairman of the Board Lewis E. Platt.
She took over her present post in July after quitting a position with
Lucent Technology Co.</P>
      <P>Fiorina, 44, was named by the US-based Fortune magazine last year
as the most influential female executive in the United States.</P>
      <P>Following the less than 90-minute press conference in Taipei, the
renown CEO left with Platt for Japan, the last stop on their Asian
tour.</P>
      <P>After their arrival in Taiwan on Friday, Fiorina and Platt called
on Premier Vincent Siew and visited HP's key clients and partners in
Taiwan, including Morris Chang of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
and Stan Shih of the Acer Group.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THREAT FROM BEIJING HAS BECOME MORE SERIOUS: MND REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The threat from mainland China has
increased since President Lee Teng-hui redefined cross-strait
relations in July, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) said in a
report.</P>
      <P>The report, which analyzes recent mainland troop movements and
military exercises and their effect on Taiwan's security in the wake
of President Lee's "state-to-state" statement on July 9, is scheduled
to be delivered to the Legislative Yuan on Monday.</P>
      <P>The report said that the MND believes that Beijing's recent
defense budget increase , its purchase and production of advanced
Sukhoi-27 and Sukhoi-30 fighter jets, K-class submarines and battle
ships, and the beefing up of its artillery forces have all led to
increased pressure on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report noted that between July 13 and the end of September,
mainland fighter jets have been frequently conducting exercises,
adding that its planes twice crossed the mid-line in the Taiwan
strait on July 25 and July 30.</P>
      <P>The MND said that the planes were on patrol and reconnaissance
missions, adding that they crossed over the mid-line of the strait
in an attempt to put pressure on Taiwan, though there have been no
drastic increases in the size of its air force.</P>
      <P>With respect to the navy, the report said vessels from the
mainland's East China Sea Fleet conducted anti-submarine and
strategic exercises 90 nautical miles northeast off the coast of
Keelung between Aug. 4 and Aug. 7.</P>
      <P>Between Sept. 1 and Sept. 5, more than 30 vessels, in conjunction
with the Nanking military region also conducted amphibious landing
exercises off Zhejiang province in southeastern China. Between Aug.
10 and Aug. 12, vessels from its Nanhai Fleet conducted live missile
firing exercises off the coast of Guangdong province, only some 500
nautical miles from Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report said mainland ground forces had also heightened combat
readiness between July 13 and Sept. 25, though there were no unusual
troop movements.</P>
      <P>The Nanjing and Guangdong military regions have also conducted
amphibious landing exercises in Zhejiang and Guangdong provinces.</P>
      <P>Beijing has also flexed its military muscle by test firing its
long-range strategic Dongfeng missiles on Aug. 2 so as to establish
its status as a military power in the Asia and Pacific region and to
intimidate Taiwan, according to the report.</P>
      <P>In addition to military intimidation, the report said Beijing has
actively incited anti-Lee fever within its military, and added that
Taiwan should guard against Beijing's attempts to incite antagonism
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Faced with this verbal and military intimidation, the MND urged
Taiwan to heighten its guard so that Beijing doesn't dare begin a
war.</P>
      <P>But the MND also said that in the past decade, the budget for
national defense has registered negative growth, representing a
greater decrease in defense spending than that of advanced countries
that face no immediate military threat.</P>
      <P>He said that the situation has become more serious with the
expansion of Beijing's military might, adding that the gap between
the two sides has widened.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Financial and psychological problems are
the major concerns of the people in quake-stricken areas, a poll
released on Sunday showed.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the National Poll Center at the
Commission of the Television Society of the ROC, also showed that
except for the handling of damaged houses, the people in the
quake-stricken areas have been generally satisfied with the
quake-relief efforts in resettlement, day-to-day care, epidemic
prevention and emergency medical assistance.</P>
      <P>Chu Yun-han, a researcher at Academia Sinica, the top academic
body in Taiwan, said this shows that the government's efficiency in
assessing and handling damaged houses in quake-stricken areas during
the massive Sept. 21 earthquake have not met the expectations of the
quake-stricken people.</P>
      <P>Some 56 percent of those polled also said that the government
should take the major responsibility in post-quake reconstruction,
with private groups only playing a complementary role.</P>
      <P>Chu also said that reviving the manufacturing industry and
helping take care of quake-stricken people pose the greatest
difficulties at present and require the most support.</P>
      <P>As post-quake reconstruction efforts will require a lot of money,
nearly 70 percent of the people polled also favored a delay in the
implementation of the proposed national annuity project and the
issuance of a public lottery.</P>
      <P>Most of those polled also said they hoped the reconstruction
works could be completed within two or three years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T SHOULD ENCOURAGE POTENTIAL WORKERS TO JOIN WORK FORCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  31  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There were up to 5.25 million idle
potential workers in Taiwan last year, a sign that human resources
have not been used to the fullest extent, a report by the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) showed on Sunday.</P>
      <P>CEPD Chairman Schive Chi said that in light of the huge number of
potential workers, scholars have suggested that the government should
step up its campaign to encourage enterprises to provide flexible
working hours to lure more people, especially women, into the work
force.</P>
      <P>The CEPD report said that most of the potential workers are women
between the age of 25 and 49 with an education level of junior high
school or lower.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said the willingness of women to join the work
force has been increasing every year and that the government should
strengthen its regulations governing equal pay for the two sexes in
order to encourage more women to participate in the work force.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said the definition of a potential worker is someone who
has the ability to work but is not employed. In 1998, the number of
potential workers totaled 5.24 million, accounting for 70 percent of
the non-working population. Of that number, those who said they
didn't work because they had to take care of their home accounted for
38 percent of the total, or 2.64 million potential workers.</P>
      <P>The report said that although more women are entering the work
force, there is still ample room for more growth, and the CEPD
suggested a revision of labor policies to encourage more women to
begin working.</P>
      <P>The report also suggested an adjustment in the government's
foreign labor policies to prevent an excessive number of foreign
laborers from taking over basic jobs. Except in the case of major
public construction projects or in areas of special concern, the
government should reconsider the number of foreign laborers it allows
into the labor market.</P>
      <P>The CEPD also said that the government should set an example by
providing alternative working hours for its own employees to
encourage local enterprises to follow suit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRMO TO HELP AFRICAN COUNTRY WITH MEDICAL CARE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei  County,  Oct. 31 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation from the Taiwan Roots
Medical Organization (TRMO) left for a visit to four African
countries to evaluate the possibility of providing medical care to
one of them.</P>
      <P>The TRMO, a famous civil medical organization that offers its
medical services to Taiwan's aboriginal people, sent a team to offer
its services to refugees from Kosovo in Macedonia last April.</P>
      <P>The TRMO delegation will also call on the Paris-based Doctors
without Borders, a non-government organization which won the 1999
Nobel Peace Prize to join the mission. The two medical organizations
also worked together in Macedonia last April.</P>
      <P>Liu Ming-chun, president of TRMO, said that Taiwan has received
medical and humanitarian help from world religious organizations and
other international organizations in the past years and that it is
now time for Taiwan to give something back to the international
community.</P>
      <P>During its visit to Africa, the delegation will select one of the
four countries to receive medical service from the TRMO next year.</P>
      <P>The TRMO had also sent a delegation to visit Mongolia and India
last July, resulting in the beginning of medical cooperation between
Mongolia and Taiwan in the near future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CANVASSES FOR KMT CANDIDATE IN YUNLIN BY-ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Yunlin, central Taiwan, Oct.31, (CNA)
(By Amanda Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President
Lee Teng-hui on Sunday morning personally went to Yunlin County to
canvass for the ruling Kuomintang's magistrate candidate Chang
Cheng-hsiung.</P>
      <P>Lee and a considerable number of supporters mobilized by the KMT
took part in the campaign activity dubbed "Love and Support President
Lee, Vote for Chang", demonstrating the mobilization capabilities of
the KMT's party machine.</P>
      <P>In a bid to help Chang win the difficult by-election, Lee not
only promoted the KMT candidate as the most competent of the three
contenders, but openly promised to actively build the county,
presently poor in tax revenue, into Taiwan's No.1 economic and
industrial center within 10 years.</P>
      <P>During the activity, the KMT candidate, in his bid to gain public
support, theatrically pulled out a giant check to the Yunlin County
Government signed by himself to dramatically illustrate his proposed
county construction plans.</P>
      <P>President Lee then endorsed the back of the check to demonstrate
his full support for Chang's county construction plans while the
audience taking part in the activity cheered on. Other central
government officials also unanimously expressed their support for
Chang and his plans.</P>
      <P>The participants included high-ranking government officials such
as Finance Minister Paul Chiu, Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang and
Secretary-General to the President Huang Kun-huei, and KMT
Secretary-General John Chang.</P>
      <P>The situation in the lead up to the Yunlin County by-election on
Nov.6 is becoming complicated as rumors of vote-buying, election
violence, and libel suits filed by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party candidate Lin Chung-li against the KMT candidate
Chang circulated in the media.</P>
      <P>Chang, whose campaign aides reportedly said they received threats
over the telephone and had their cars damaged by unknown people,
signed an "Anti-violence announcement" and urged voters not to cast
their ballots for any candidates connected to underworld crime
syndicates.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County Magistrate Su Wen-hsiung died of liver cancer
three months ago.</P>

reconstruction, Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen said in the report.</P>
      <P>Huang, who will make a special report on the 921 earthquake to
the Legislative Yuan's Home and Border Affairs on Monday, pointed out
that the 5,000 conscripts will be used mainly to maintain public
order and sanitation and offer services to residents in disaster
areas hit by the 921 earthquake, the worst to jolt Taiwan in a
century.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the Social Affairs Department under the
Interior Ministry has been working on drawing up relevant regulations
to effectively govern the use of cash donations which have poured into
all sorts of organizations following the 921 quake, said Huang.</P>
      <P>Currently, donations from citizens from all walks of life for the
wide-ranging reconstruction task have totaled more than NT$18
billion, he noted, adding that more than 393,197 police, military
serviceman, medical personnel and private-sector volunteers have been
mobilized to date for the rebuilding task.</P>
      <P>The interior ministry also pointed out that it will be necessary
to elaborate a law on disaster prevention and to establish special
units in both the central and local governments in order to provide
victims in disaster areas with swift assistance.</P>

      <P>About 10 practitioners of the Falun Gong
sect have staged a sit-in demonstration since Saturday evening in
front of the Xinhua News Agency office in Hong Kong in protest
against the passing of an anti-cult law by the legislature of China
Saturday.</P>

said they were afraid that it may pave the way for further government
crackdown on Falun Gong. They said it is not a cult, and is not
politically oriented.</P>

practitioners in the world, combines traditional Chinese meditation,
slow breathing techniques, and the teachings of Buddhism and Taoism
for daily practice.</P>
