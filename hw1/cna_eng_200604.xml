serve, but difficult to please. If you go beyond your duty to please
him, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he always
takes into consideration their capacity. A fool, on the other hand,
is easy to please, but difficult to serve. If you go beyond your duty
to please him, he will be pleased. But in his employment of men, he
expects them to be able to do everything."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>COA REFUSES TO ALLOW CHINA'S GIFT PANDAS TO ENTER TAIWAN(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, March 31 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A task force of the Council of Agriculture
(COA) rejected on Friday applications by two civic groups to import a
pair of giant pandas offered by China to Taiwan as a gift.</P>
      <P>The task force said after a meeting -- its third deliberation on
the issue -- that its members had formed a consensus whereby under
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES), they cannot issue certificates at present to
permit the two pandas to enter Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two civic groups requesting permission to host the pandas are
the Taipei City Zoo and the Leofoo Village Theme Park in Hsinchu
County.</P>
      <P>While a closure is under construction at the Taipei City Zoo to
house the pandas, the zoo in Taichung City, central Taiwan, is also
building a closure in its bid to host the pandas.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who was in eastern Taiwan to stump for
a candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in a by-election
for Taitung County magistrate in his capacity as KMT chairman, said
he was unsurprised by the COA's decision because there were
indications beforehand the DPP government would not permit the pandas
to enter.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has described the panda offer as part of
China's "united front" tactics against Taiwan, while COA Vice
Chairman Lee Chien-chuan also said recently that Taiwan would accept
the pandas only if China recognized Taiwan as a country.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he believed political forces had intervened in the
decision, Ma said it was "obvious to everyone."</P>
      <P>Noting the two pandas China offered to Taiwan are not wild
animals but were raised in a closure, Ma said in this case the
wildlife conservation law does not apply.</P>
      <P>He said he will meet with city officials and executives at the
Taipei City Zoo to see whether there is a solution to the issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said the Taichung City
Government will try to obtain China's permission to let the city's
zoo host the pandas and then file an application with the COA for
permission for their entry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO REGRET OVER RETIRING FROM FOREIGN SERVICE: E.U. REP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,   March   31   (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Outgoing Republic of China
Representative to the European Union Chen Chien-jen said Friday he
feels no regret that he will soon retire from his 40-year diplomatic
career, a plan that has been postponed for several years.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang confirmed a few days
ago that Chen will retire from his post soon but did not disclose the
name of his successor. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael
Ying-mao Kau has been designated as Chen's replacement, according to
media reports.</P>
      <P>Chen told the Central News Agency that he had planned to retire
in 2000 and 2004 but opted to prioritize national interests over his
personal plans after President Chen Shui-bian asked him to stay on.</P>
      <P>"There was a feeling of regret in my heart that I could not live
a carefree life. This feeling will be made up for now that my public
service career will soon come to an end, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>The diplomat, a member of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) who
previously served as minister of foreign affairs when the party was
in power, was appointed by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government as the country's representative to the United States in
2000. He had intended to retire when he stepped down from that post
in 2004 but later accepted the appointment of E.U. representative.</P>
      <P>On the most unforgettable event of his foreign service career,
Chen said it is hard for him to forget the process of bilateral talks
with the U. S. government after the severance of diplomatic relations
between the ROC and the United States.</P>
      <P>However, being able to participate in the establishment of
diplomatic relations with Nicaragua and Palau were pleasant
experiences, he went on.</P>
      <P>As to the government's bids to participate in the World Health
Organization, Chen noted that the idea was put forward 10 years ago
when he was vice minister of foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen said he and then-Minister of Foreign Affairs John Chang,
considering the difficulties involving Taiwan's bid to join the
United Nations, decided to promote the WHO bid, in the belief that
WHO participation carries less political sensitivity.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's efforts over the past 10 years and the importance
of including Taiwan in the WHO having been highlighted by the
outbreaks of SARS and bird flu, there should be progress this year in
promoting the bid, Chen predicted.</P>
      <P>On his plans after retiring, Chen said he is thinking about
writing his memoirs and releasing a CD that he recorded in the 1990s
of him singing Mandarin, Taiwanese and English songs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMY CANNOT BE DEPENDENT ON CHINA: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday it
is bad that Taiwan's economy is growing over-dependent on China and
that management of Taiwan's investment in China cannot be neglected,
as China is trying to annex Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, China is not a "normal" country and wants to
annex Taiwan, so Taiwan has to be careful when making contacts with
China.</P>
      <P>"It is not that we cannot go to China to do business, but we have
to manage the political and commercial risks. Be it proactive
management, effective management, or risk management, we cannot
neglect it," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a ceremony marking the third anniversary
of the Ketagalan Institute, which Chen established in 2003 to nurture
the country's future leaders.</P>
      <P>He said people should not interpret his New Year's Day message of
"active management, effective opening" as simply tightening
cross-strait economic policies, and that the policies are not simply
a black-and-white issue of opening up or restricting.</P>
      <P>"If some people must go to China to do business, then we should
come up with management methods that do not pose a threat to national
security and do not hurt the country's overall interests, " he said.
He also urged the public to offer feasible ideas to the government
for reference.</P>
      <P>Chen said there is a "blind spot" in some people's thinking for
Taiwan's economic growth as they feel China is the ultimate and only
solution for Taiwan's economy and consider it vital for Taiwan to
consent to direct cross-strait links and do business in China.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan must insist on its economic independence and added
that China is not the only option. He said that according to a recent
U.S. congressional investigation, Taiwan has invested US$280 billion
in China, 50 percent of the US$560 billion the whole world has
invested in China.</P>
      <P>"Isn't this a bit too much? Isn't this over the top?" Chen asked.
"Taiwan's economy being so heavily dependent on China is not a good
thing. It is risky and worrying. China wants to annex us and we are
dependent on it for our economy. Are we not aware that we are leaning
toward China too much?," he asked.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian urged the public
to be prepared and to cooperate with the government in the event of a
bird flu outbreak.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that experts have said bird flu will definitely

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday that
he has a dream to turn Taiwan into a normal and great country and
that he believes democracy will defeat the authoritarian regime in
China.</P>
      <P>"I have a dream... of insisting on turning Taiwan into a normal,
complete, developed, beautiful and great country. This is also a
common dream shared by everyone. It is not impossible for Taiwan to
become such a country," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although many people have made sacrifices and paid
a high price for Taiwan's democracy, "we did not withdraw and we did
not give up."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during the anniversary of the opening of
the Ketagalan Institute, which Chen established in 2003 to nurture
the country's future leaders.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan is not against China or its people, but against
the Communist Party of China's authoritarian regime. He added that
the regime oppresses democracy, freedom, human rights, and peace, and
is the greatest threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait
and the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"I believe democracy can defeat authoritarianism and we need to
have faith, no matter what happens," he said.</P>
      <P>He further said that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) should focus on China, which is Taiwan's real opponent.</P>
      <P>He said the Taiwanese people need to be aware of China's
hostility and he also praised the Taiwanese people for carrying out
the spirit of "sons of Taiwan" to keep pressing forward and not
withdrawing from challenges. Chen was described by his supporters as
a "son of Taiwan" when he was first elected President.</P>
      <P>"I am not competing with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and the DPP is
not competing with the KMT. Our opponent is on the other side of the

every party member is indispensable to the party, yet no-one is so
great that the party will die without him, referring to ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lin Wuei-chou, who
resigned his party membership earlier this week.</P>

instead take part in party affairs to change, transform and elevate
the party,</P>
      <P>"Everyone is important, and every member is indispensable for

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thai workers hired by the Kaohsiung Rapid
Transit Corp. (KRTC) returned to work Saturday after going on strike
the previous day complaining about poor quality food, increased
medical insurance payments and various other problems.</P>
      <P>The return to work of the 600 striking laborers living in a
dormitory in Kangshan, Kaohsiung County, followed a mediation session
with KRTC officials, who also agreed to treat the Thai workers'
absence from work as a day off instead of docking their pay.</P>
      <P>But the officials also warned them that if they went on strike
again or failed to report to work for three consecutive days, they
would be fired and repatriated according to the terms of their
contracts.</P>
      <P>Other KRTC Thai workers living in two dormitories in different
locations did not take part in the strike.</P>
      <P>Thai workers get seven days off per month and receive a basic
salary of NT$15,840 (US$486), with additional overtime pay.</P>
      <P>Thai workers also rioted last August in protest against what they
called harsh treatment at the hands of a management firm
commissioned by the KRTC. the riot led to a probe that revealed a
suspected network of graft and corruption that implicated several
high-ranking officials, including a former close aide of President
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The KRTC has since taken over the management of its more-than
1,700 Thai laborers and has improved their living conditions
considerably.</P>
      <P>The meals have also been improved, with the Thai laborers being
allowed to form a committee to map out their weekly menus.</P>

      <P> Taipei, April 1 (CAN) Premier Su Tseng-chang reiterated Saturday
his resolve to improve social order and urged cooperation between
central and local governments to achieve this end.</P>
      <P>The premier made the call on the sidelines of a ceremony to honor
police officers who had just helped crack a heist in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Su reaffirmed his determination in the face of the latest poll
results that show 40 percent of the respondents are satisfied with
his performance against 36 percent who are dissatisfied, and that 33
percent are confident about his pledge to improve law and order
against 60 percent who have no confidence.</P>
      <P>Su, a two-time Taipei county magistrate, cited his own experience
in his first term when he said that the dirty and chaotic situation
of one county thoroughfare was improved within three months, with 12
major roads improved in a year. With resolve, all differences can be
overcome, Su said, adding that he had to fire an environmental 
protection chief at the time.</P>
      <P>Su, who has put his political career on the line by vowing to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Most ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) factions agreed Saturday with President Chen Shui-bian's call
earlier in the day for party members to serve as "gardeners of the
party."</P>
      <P>Chen issued the call at a ceremony to mark the third anniversary
of the opening of the Ketagalan Institute, which Chen established in
2003 to nurture the country's future leaders.</P>
      <P>Chen said democracy is "representative politics " and "party
politics." In a political party, no-one is dispensable, but neither
is anyone so great that his withdrawal from the party would cause it
to collapse.</P>
      <P>He urged DPP members to serve as "frontline soldiers" defending
Taiwan's democracy, while trying to regain their confidence in the
party.</P>
      <P>Political observers regarded the remarks as Chen's response to
Legislator Lin Wei-chou, who quit the DPP on Thursday, leaving the
DPP as only the second-largest party in the legislature with 87 seats
compared to the opposition Kuomintang's 88.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chen's call, Legislator Lee Wen-chung of the DPP's New
Tide Faction suggested that those who are disappointed with the party
make efforts to promote party reforms. Leaving the party ranks to be
an independent will not help anything, he said.</P>
      <P>However, Lee also suggested that Chen, who is a former chairman
of the DPP, should conduct some self-examination and heart-searching
now that so many people doubt the party's ability to run the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung of the DPP's Welfare State
Alliance said that DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun has decided to hold a
party meeting in April to discuss party reforms.</P>
      <P>There are reforms ongoing in the party, Hsu said, criticizing Lin
for quitting without first contributing to the reforms.</P>

      <P>A legislator of the main opposition
Kuomintang said Saturday that the Ministry of Education (MOE) should
promote smaller classes in elementary and junior high schools to deal
with the problem of an over-supply of teachers.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-an made the remark at a news conference in Taipei on
how to cope with the problem. Also on hand was Wu Chung-tai, managing
director of the National Teachers' Association.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the problem is the result of a gradually
decreasing number of students every year, due to Taiwan's declining
birth rate.</P>
      <P>Quoting MOE tallies, Lee said that in 2005, the number of
licensed teachers reached more than 18,000 but only some 2,000 of
them, or 10.9 percent, were hired. The 2005 figures were far lower
than the 37.7 percent in 1994 and the 78.9 percent in 1997.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WANTS TO SIGN FTA WITH U.S. BY NEXT JUNE: DEPUTY ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, March 31 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan looks forward to signing a free
trade agreement (FTA) with the United States before the expiration of
the U.S. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) next June, Taiwan's deputy
representative in Washington, D.C. said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on Capitol Hill, Stanley Kao said a
Taiwan-U.S. FTA would bring enormous benefits to both countries and
that Taiwan is always ready to negotiate relevant terms with the
United States.</P>
      <P>Hopefully, Kao said, an FTA can be fleshed out before the TPA --
an act that authorizes the U.S. administration to sign bilateral and
multilateral agreements with foreign governments to promote free
trade without prior congressional approval -- expires in June 2007.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that Taiwan has ever explicitly spelled
out a desired timetable for signing an FTA with the United States.</P>
      <P>The seminar was organized by the Association on Third World
Affairs, a non-governmental organization, to discuss issues regarding
free and fair trade. Participants at the seminar included Angelos
Pangratis, European Union deputy ambassador to the U.S., Roberto
Abdenur, Brazilian ambassador to the U.S., and diplomatic mission
chiefs of many other countries stationed in Washington.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that an FTA is critical to both sides, Kao said the
United States would see a more-than 100 percent growth in its auto,
rice, fish and other foodstuff exports to Taiwan after the signing of
such an accord.</P>
      <P>On the whole, Kao said, the annual U.S. exports to Taiwan would
post an estimated 16 percent growth from the present level should an
FTA take effect. In dollar terms, he added, annual U.S.
exports to Taiwan would increase by US$6.6 billion.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, Kao said, the FTA would have a "locomotive effect"
that might prompt other countries to follow suit. Because of China's
diplomatic embargo against Taiwan, Kao went on, Taiwan is facing the
threat of being marginalized in the Asia-Pacific region and having a
hard time forging bilateral ties with major countries around the
world.</P>
      <P>Describing the signing of FTAs with major countries around the
world as being imperative to sustain Taiwan's competitiveness, Kao
said Taiwan is well-prepared for FTA talks with the United States at
any time.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  1  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuang Li-Chen, the main opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT's) candidate and ex-wife of former Taitung County
Magistrate Wu Chun-li, won the Taitung county magistrate by-election
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kuang, who was pitted against three independent candidates,
expressed her appreciation to her supporters and said she will do her
best to live up to their expectations.</P>
      <P>She also pledged to develop Taitung into a "tourism and cultural
county."</P>
      <P>Kuang won 42,578 votes, far ahead of her nearest rival, who
managed to garner only 19,228 ballots. </P>
      <P>The result dealt a further blow to the beleaguered Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , which lost a legislative by-election in
Chiayi County last month.</P>
      <P>A DPP official expressed "regret and disappointment" over the
result, saying that it is "the re-election of the corrupt Wu." The
KMT now controls 15 out of Taiwan's 23 cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, director of the DPP's Department of Culture and
Information Affairs, said KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who campaigned 
for Kuang, should be held responsible for the failure of an "anti-
corruption" campaign in the by-election.</P>
      <P>The by-election was made necessary after Wu tendered his
resignation to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) in January.</P>
      <P>Wu won the Dec. 3 magistrate election but was barred from taking
office because he had been sentenced to a jail term in a second court
trial on corruption charges. Wu appealed the MOI's decision to the
Taipei Administrative Court but was turned down.</P>
      <P>Wu, who was warned by the MOI that he could not serve in the post
even if elected during his campaigning prior to the Dec. 3 election,
tried to keep his post at first by appointing Kuang as his deputy. He
even divorced Kuang to sidestep the restriction against a magistrate
selecting a relative or spouse as deputy.</P>
      <P>The Taitung county government was turned into a farce at one
point, with dual leaders -- Kuang and another deputy sent by the MOI
-- serving the vacancy left by Wu.</P>

      <P>The magnitude-6.4 earthquake, which struck around 6 p.m., was

afterward, the bureau added.</P>
      <P>The quake caused cracks to some houses and gas leaks in the

      <P>For fine art lovers in Taiwan, Max Liu
never left. A memorial exhibition and a underway animation are trying
to make the legacy of the famous Taiwanese painter who passed away
four years ago live on for many more years to come.</P>
      <P>A total of 30 never-before-seen color paintings are being
displayed in a month-long memorial exhibition starting Saturday in
Capital Art Center (CAC) to commemorate Max Liu, one of the most
celebrated painters in Taiwan modern art.</P>
      <P>An animation which features an adventure of Liu and animal
figures, his favorite painting theme, are also under way. The film
that reflects Liu's love of animal and adventure is due to be
released in 2008.</P>
      <P>"As passionate as he has always been for painting, Liu was even
more dedicated to giving lectures. He said that a painting can only
be owned by one person, but a good speech can make much more impact
to people, " CAC President York Hsiao recollected in the opening
ceremony.</P>
      <P>"He has never been an artist who looks for making money from his
works. What he cares is what art can do and impact people's life, "
said Hsiao.</P>
      <P>Lin Ding-san, Liu's student at Chung-yuan Christian University
and an architect, decided to remember his mentor in a different way,
launching an animation project in 2002.</P>
      <P>"It's a story that talks about Mr. Liu and all these animals he
painted go on to a journey and save an island from environmental
crisis. This is a best way to remember him and carry on his legacy to
the next generation, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>Max Liu (1912-2002) was an engineer throughout the first 38 years
of his life. Picking up his paint and brush at 39 years-old, Liu's
career as an artist boomed in the next 50 years. An adventurous and
open-minded man, Liu spent a large part of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s
traveling around the world, learning cultures and studying the art.</P>

      <P>During the two-day Paris meeting, the participants also presented
and discussed 32 papers on a broad range of Taiwan-related subjects
in political, economic, social, cultural, literary, folk music and
anthropological fields.</P>
      <P>The papers were selected from more than 140 entries, said Chang

    <DATELINE>Paris,  March 31 (CNA)
(By Lo Yuan-shaw and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academics from major European countries,
including Britain, Germany, Finland, Sweden, France and the
Netherlands, have formed a new association dedicated to promoting
research on subjects related to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Association members met in Paris Thursday and Friday to discuss
the new organization's charter, membership qualifications and
operational rules.</P>
      <P>The decision to form the new association was inspired by a Taiwan
study project at the University of London's School of Oriental and
African Studies (SOAS).</P>
      <P>It was decided at the inaugural meeting that the association will
hold its second meeting in Stockholm, Sweden next year.</P>
      <P>During the two-day Paris meeting, the participants also presented
and discussed 32 papers on a broad range of Taiwan-related subjects
in political, economic, social, cultural, literary, folk music and
anthropological fields.</P>
      <P>The papers were selected from more than 140 entries, said Chang
Mao-kuei, a researcher at Taiwan's most prestigious academic body
Academia Sinica and a sociology professor at National Taiwan
University who traveled to Paris to attend the seminar.</P>
      <P>Chang said the themes and viewpoints presented in all those
papers were relevant, updated and insightful. Chang said he was
impressed by European scholars' emphasis on research quality.</P>
      <P>During the seminar, the participants also exchanged information
on Taiwan-related study projects in major European countries. In
Britain, the SOAS launched its Taiwan study project in 2000 and the
school now offers master's study program. The London School of
Economics and Political Science has offered Taiwan culture courses
for five years.</P>
      <P>In France, there has been an interdisciplinary research team
composed of academics from major French universities. The team now
focuses its research on two directions -- legacy/memory as well as
Taiwan's localization and globalization. There is also a newly
launched Taiwan study project at University Lyon. Germany's Bochum
University and Ruhr University have installed Taiwan research
projects specializing in literary and cultural studies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>37 INDIVIDUALS SUSTAIN MILD INJURIES IN TAITUNG EARTHQUAKE(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirty-seven people were mildly injured
when a strong earthquake jolted Taitung in southeastern Taiwan
Saturday evening, officials at a central emergency response center
said.</P>
      <P>Only one injury occurred in the southern port city of Kaohsiung
where a wall at an unused military barracks collapsed, while all the
other injured people resided in Taitung. Only one of the injured was
hospitalized for treatment of bone fractures.</P>
      <P>The magnitude-6.4 earthquake, which struck at 6: 02 p.m., was
centered 5.5 kilometers east of Peinan, Taitung County, at a depth of
10 kilometers, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said. A total of 36
aftershocks were recorded in the Taitung area within four hours after
the first earthquake. Eight of the aftershocks, including one
measuring 4.8 on the Richter scale, were felt in the Taitung region.</P>
      <P>The central government immediately set up an emergency response
center to assist the Taitung County Government in post-quake
rehabilitation work. The center was staffed by officials from the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior's airborne
fire squadron, the Department of Health and the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications.</P>
      <P>The quake caused cracks to some houses and 10 gas leaks were
reported in the Taitung area. Some motorcyclists sustained minor
injuries as their vehicles crashed because of the tremor.</P>
      <P>A total of 7,200 households suffered a blackout, but power supply
was resumed eight minutes after the earthquake. Many panicked people
ran out their houses and were reluctant to enter their homes even
nearly an hour after the shock.</P>
      <P>The earthquake was felt in most of the island because it was
centered relatively close to the surface, CWB officials said.</P>
      <P>Earthquakes occurred frequently in Taiwan, which lies on a
seismically active stretch of the Pacific basin. One of Taiwan's
worst-recorded quakes occurred Sept. 21, 1999. The 9-21 temblor,
measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale, killed more than 2,400 people and
left tens of thousands homeless.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency under
the Executive Yuan urged the public Sunday not to burn too much paper
"ghost money" or incense, and to set off as few firecrackers as
possible while honoring ancestors for the sake of environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>With the April 4 Tomb Sweeping Day drawing near, the agency
said in a press release that burning ghost money which represents
cash in the afterworld, incense sticks and firecrackers all cause
significant air and noise pollution, not to mention the fire hazards
they present.</P>
      <P>This problem is especially serious in densely-populated areas and
on Tomb Sweeping Day when Taiwanese visit family graves to honor
their ancestors or go to temples where funeral urns are stored.</P>
      <P>The agency appeals to the public to change the way in which they
remember their ancestors by using less ghost money, incense sticks
and firecrackers, preferably refraining from their use altogether or
calling in garbage collectors to burn them at incinerators.</P>
      <P>The agency said local garbage collectors around the island had
burned more than 1,500 tons of paper ghost money on behalf of temples
and individuals last year.</P>
      <P>Noting what matters in worshipping past ancestors is sincerity,
the press release encouraged people to burn virtual spirit money,
incense and firecrackers online which does not contribute toward air
pollution.</P>

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou encouraged a party youth corps led by Legislator Lin
Yi-shih Sunday to possess vision, innovation, passion and action in
order to best serve the country and its people.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comment at a ceremony marking Lin's inauguration as
leader of the KMT youth corps, who was publicly elected among party
members last week. Lin will automatically become of the party's vice
chairman for a year -- the youngest in KMT history.</P>
      <P>Urging KMT youth corps members to put "moral standards" high on
their political agenda, Ma said that political figures must insist on
having some moral principles when engaging in political activities.</P>
      <P>"That is something that political players should never touch from
the very beginning, " he noted, adding that "a party without morals
will soon step down even if it is in power."</P>
      <P>"Political figures must bear in mind the notions of clean
politics, administrative efficiency and people's needs right from the
first day of their career, " Ma said, pointing out that non-KMT
members are also welcome to take part in the youth corps which aims
to provide young men and women a platform to develop their abilities
through service, sharing and contribution.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT is in power in 15 of Taiwan's cities and
counties out of a total of 23 and therefore governs 70 percent of the
country's population and 68 percent of its territory, Ma called on
all party members to be more humble, responsible and prudent when

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou should seek common
ground on Taiwan's sustainable development and national identity when
they meet for talks Monday, opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
Chairman Su Ching-chiang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Su urged the two men to mend their differences and build a
consensus on those two key fronts, and to immediately put their
agreements into action for the sake of the national interest.</P>
      <P>Chen and Ma should sincerely exchange opinions on issues of major
national concern and refrain from merely staging "a show of political
idols," he said.</P>
      <P>Su expressed the hope that the Chen-Ma meeting would help thaw
the political impasse between the "pan green" and "pan blue" camps
and said that his party is happy that the two would be meeting.</P>
      <P>Ma returned Wednesday from a 10-day, five-city tour of the United
States, where he was accorded a high-profile reception and met with
senior U.S. officials, including Deputy Secretary of State Robert
Zoellick. The KMT chairman has widely been viewed as a strong
contender to win in the 2008 presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Su criticized Ma as failing to speak up for Taiwan's people
against China during his U. S. visit.</P>
      <P>Su claimed that Ma "made a fool of himself and the rest of the
world" when he said that "one China" refers to the Republic of China
and argued that he did not point out that China has more than 800
missiles pointing at Taiwan on his U.S. visit.</P>
      <P>Su also asked Ma to provide a clear explanation of his policy in
handling the KMT's ill-gotten property assets, arguing the KMT
incumbent has been selling off the party's assets at a quicker pace
than his predecessor Lien Chan, who is now KMT honorary chairman.</P>
      <P>Ma took over the KMT chairmanship in August last year in the
party's first direct vote among party members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN-MA MEETING 'NORMAL IN A DEMOCRACY': PRESIDENTIAL AIDE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou is scheduled to meet with President Chen Shui-bian Monday,
a presidential senior aide said Sunday that such meetings are just a
normal part of communications in a democracy.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen, Presidential Office secretary -general, said the
president was delighted to have the chance to meet with Ma, who
claimed he would like to make some "conscientious suggestions" to the
president following Ma's high-profile visit to the United States,
Taiwan's chief ally.</P>
      <P>As to what topics the two leaders would discuss, Tan Sun Chen
said he did not know.</P>
      <P>"We will all know as the meeting will be made public from
beginning to end," he added.</P>
      <P>He advised political pundits not to show excessive concern over
the meeting as it might "make things look unnatural."</P>
      <P>Ma reiterated that he will be making "suggestions, " not
"reporting" to the president about his U.S. tour. He also denied that
he was seeking "endorsements" from People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong or Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng prior to meeting
with the president.</P>
      <P>Ma said he was meeting with Soong Sunday because Soong had asked
him to get answers to some questions, answers he said he would
forward to Soong.</P>
      <P>As his meeting with Chen will be broadcast, Ma said there was no
need to spend too much time or energy "rehearsing" for it.</P>
      <P>Still, some PFP stalwarts reminded Ma that he must use caution
when dealing with Chen Shui-bian, whom they said had not acted in
good faith in previous meetings with Ma's predecessor Lien Chan and
the PFP's Soong.</P>
      <P>Lien claimed he felt cheated after Chen's Democratic Progressive
Party government announced the suspension of a fourth nuclear power
plant's construction in Kungliao, Taipei County, soon after their
meeting in 2000, during which Lien urged Chen to demonstrate
continuity in government policy.</P>
      <P>Soong has filed a slander suit against Chen, accusing him of
alleging and failing to show evidence to support the allegation that
Soong met with a senior Chinese official in the U.S. in early 2005,
in advance of a much-reported meeting between Chen and Soong.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, convener of the PFP's legislative caucus, urged
Ma to achieve "some results" from the meeting with Chen with regard
to cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>For instance, Lu suggested, the president's "five-noes" policy
pledging not to change the status quo across the Strait could be
implemented through a PFP-initiated bill for maintaining the status
quo and promoting cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, a PFP lawmaker, said he expected little to be
achieved in the upcoming Ma-Chen meeting as "Ma is not as
knowledgeable as Soong," whose meeting with Chen produced nothing but
a lawsuit.</P>

      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
lawmaker Chang Hsien-yao, who also serves as head of the party's
central policy center, led a group of PFP-affiliated Kaohsiung City
councilors Sunday on a trip to Shanghai in an effort to open
discussions for cross-strait links between the two cities.</P>
      <P>Chang and five other Kaohsiung City councilors are scheduled to
meet with Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng to observe the host city's
infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation, which returns on Thursday, will propose
a draft bill on direct links between Kaohsiung and Shanghai in order
to boost the port city's economy.</P>
      <P>Chang said in a previous interview that this visit to Shanghai is
an implementation of one of the agreements reached during a meeting
in Beijing last year between PFP Chairman James Soong and Chinese
President Hu Jintao to step up regular trade and economic exchanges
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, direct transport links between both cities
should be implemented in three stages.</P>
      <P>First, direct shipping links between ports in Kaohsiung and
Yangshan and direct air links between Kaohsiung International Airport
and Pudung Airport should be implemented for a trial period of a
year.</P>
      <P>Second, direct air links should be established between Kaohsiung
International Airport and five Chinese airports, and direct shipping
services linking Kaohsiung port to five Chinese ports for a year
trial; and third, both air and shipping links between Kaohsiung and
China should be set up.</P>
      <P>Chang also said a referendum must be held during the the year-end
Kaohsiung mayoral election in order to determine public opinion on
whether to establish air and sea direct links with Shanghai.</P>
      <P>However, in reference to Chang's planned trip to Shanghai,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman W.F. Huang said last
Friday at a news conference that any political party or private
sector group must abide by the Republic of China's laws while
engaging in cross-strait activities that require government
authorization.</P>
      <P>With regard to the PFP group's visit to Shanghai, Huang said that
any agreement reached between unauthorized private groups from Taiwan
and the Chinese side regarding the Taiwan people's rights or
government power are invalid.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>"As long as you are alive there is hope, "
Premier Su Tseng-chang said while reading a story to a group of
children Sunday.</P>
      <P>Acting as a teacher at a local Sunday school, the premier urged
the country's parents to "live and let live," urging them to "persist
to subsist" when faced with hardship and not to take their children's
lives in the event they take their own.</P>
      <P>Parents should not consider their children as possessions, Su
said, adding that children once born are entitled to live, a right
which should not be stolen from them by anyone, even their parents,
the premier said.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of the Interior will work together with
local governments to offer financial aid to needy families and
individuals in hopes that no one will commit suicide simply because
they cannot afford to live.</P>
      <P>The Sunday school was organized by a local children's rights
organization to mark the group's publication of an illustrated book,
"Don't Take Me Away, " written to raise public awareness about
children's right to live.</P>
      <P>The organizers said suicide became one of Taiwan's top ten causes
of death last year, and the incidence of parents who kill their
children before taking their own lives is widespread in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More than 70 percent of child victims in these cases are under
the age of 10 and apparently forced to die along with their parents,
the organizers said.</P>
      <P>As recently as Sunday, a grandmother in Anting, Tainan county,
attempted suicide along with her two grandchildren by burning
charcoal in her room.</P>
      <P>One of her grandchildren died from asphyxiation, the other who
did not suffocate was killed by the grandmother, who cut an artery in
his wrist.</P>
      <P>The grandmother, who was rescued, said afterward she was tired of
living in poverty and with two grandchildren, one of whom 
was mentally retarded and the other "very intractable."</P>

      <P>News media in Taiwan devoted widespread coverage to the return of
Liang Po-hsun because he vowed at a press conference in Shanghai
March 27 that when he returned to Taiwan, he would reveal evidence to
prove that in 2002, Chen Che-nan, then deputy secretary-general of
the Presidential Office, took NT$6 million from him but failed to
fulfill a promise to get him off the legal hook.</P>
      <P>Chen denied in a statement a week ago that he had ever taken any
money from Liang and called Liang's allegation "absurd."</P>
      <P>Liang, 50, a former vice chairman of the Bank of Overseas
Chinese, was convicted in November 2002 for using his influence to
borrow NT$5.3 billion illegally from several branches of the bank
through dummy accounts in 1996-97. While applying for a deferred
prison sentence in March 2003, he absconded abroad and has remained
at large in China, Hong Kong, Japan and South Africa.</P>
      <P>He was also sentenced to one year and two months in a separate
case for committing forgery in real estate deals while he was chairman
of the Hsinchiehchung Construction Co.</P>
      <P>Agents from the Bureau of Investigation, who handcuffed Liang and
whisked him off from the airport, indicated that Liang will begin
serving his prison terms Monday after being questioned.</P>
      <P>Liang is also wanted for questioning by the public prosecutors
offices in Taipei, Taichung, Changhua and Tainan in relation to 11
alleged offenses.</P>
      <P>During his brief encounter with the media at the airport, Liang
said he had returned to Taiwan mainly because he wanted to "face the
law." He stressed he was not using his return to help any political
parties with their election campaigns, nor was he trying to deal a
blow to Chen. He added, however, he has "absolutely strong" evidence
against Chen.</P>
      <P>Prior to the 2004 presidential election, Liang made the same
allegation that Chen took NT$6 million from him in two separate
checks but failed to help him settle his legal cases as promised. The
Taipei Public Prosecutors Office investigating the case questioned
several witnesses, including Liang's father and secretary, and closed
the case after concluding there was no direct evidence to prove Chen
had taken the bribes.</P>
      <P>The bureau's agents said they would not rule out the possibility
of reopening the case if Liang could produce new, concrete evidence.</P>

      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, lawmaker and head of the
opposition People First Party's central policy center, urged the
president Sunday to release some of his power to the Executive Yuan
and to loosen his control over it.</P>
      <P>Chang made the statement at a news conference upon his departure

President Chen Shui-bian and Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Chang said he doubted that existing confrontation between ruling
and opposition parties could be resolved through just a single
meeting. However, he said he expected the president to lend an ear to
the people's wishes on reform and to opposition parties' desire that
he adopt a milder approach in his policies.</P>
      <P>The meeting between Chen and Ma on Monday would be meaningful if
the president could release some of his power to the Executive Yuan

    <HEADLINE>WHAT TO EXPECT FROM CHEN-MA MEETING?By S.C. ChangCNA Staff Writer</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> If history is any guide, not much can be expected from a
much-anticipated meeting scheduled for Monday between Taiwan's
president and the chairman of its largest opposition party, the
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>In October 2000, then KMT Chairman Lien Chan met with President
Chen Shui-bian at the Presidential Office in a gesture to articulate
the KMT's concerns about Taiwan. During that public meeting, Lien
urged Chen to demonstrate continuity in government policy, including
the building of the nation's fourth nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>But soon after the meeting, Chen's Cabinet announced the
suspension of the construction project, leaving a befuddled Lien to
complain that he had been cheated. Distrust between the nation's
"pan-blue alliance" and "pan-green camp" has since been on the rise.</P>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong's meetings with
Chen, which began Oct. 19, 2000, produced even worse results, ranging
from jeers at Soong for "seeking a government office" to Soong's
filing a slander suit against Chen, charging him with alleging and
failing to produce evidence to support the allegation that Soong met
in secret with a senior Chinese official in the U.S. in early 2005.</P>
      <P>The last meeting between Chen and Soong, in Feb. 2005, produced a
ten-point agreement, none of which has served as a bridge to narrow
the gap between ruling and opposition parties. A striking irony was
that the meeting was conducted with the all-too-obvious background of
two Chinese characters, Cheng Hsin -- roughly translated as "good
faith" or "honesty and integrity."</P>
      <P>With this backdrop, several scenarios may occur in the meeting
between President Chen Shui-bian and Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who
claimed upon returning from a high-profile visit to the U.S. last
week that he would make "conscientious suggestions" for the president
to "pursue good fortune and avoid disaster" for the country.</P>
      <P>In the first scenario, Chen would make all efforts to demonstrate
statesmanship, "accepting" Ma's honest suggestions -- at the urging
of his U.S. hosts -- about stabilizing cross-Taiwan Strait relations
and not giving Taiwan the negative international image of
"troublemaker" in the region's strategic affairs.</P>
      <P>But as history shows, the meeting may ultimately turn out to be a
slap in the face for Ma as Chen may deny he had accepted Ma's "peace
promotion" proposals with regard to Taiwan's China policy.</P>
      <P>As Ma could not possibly be short-sighted enough not to have
learned a lesson from his predecessor Lien Chan and the PFP's James
Soong, the first scenario is unlikely to occur Monday.</P>
      <P>A second scenario would be Ma going out of his way to "present"
to Chen the KMT's best policy proposals, not only about managing
cross-strait ties but about managing the economy as well. It is
commonly believed the KMT has more know-how about managing the
economy than the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Again, Ma cannot be so "magnanimous" as to share with his
political rival the KMT's "ace card" for winning back power of the
government in 2008.</P>
      <P>On the practical side, the scheduled meeting may not last long
enough to cover "non-essential" topics like the economy and social
issues such as health care and education. Therefore, the second
scenario is also quite unlikely to happen.</P>
      <P>The public is left with a third and most likely scenario: Little
will be achieved through the meeting at the Presidential Office, with
Chen and Ma greeting each other with seemingly warm handshakes,
shoulder patting and all the other standard protocols, with little
else substantive beyond that.</P>
      <P>The DPP hoped the meeting will mark the beginning of cooperation
among Taiwan's political parties. And yet, as distrust between the
ruling and opposition remains deep, even Ma himself has publicly said
no one should expect much from Monday's meeting.</P>
      <P>Ma plans to make "polite" suggestions to Chen; indeed, they are
suggestions he already enumerated whilst visiting the U.S. and
earlier in Europe -- proposals with which Chen is already quite
familiar. Ma might repeat to Chen U.S. warnings against "pushing the
envelope" too far by going ahead with a DPP plan to write a new
Constitution for Taiwan, which may be perceived as changing the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen might "humbly" listen to Ma's polite suggestions and honest
warnings, without agreeing with Ma on the issues being raised, much
less doing anything about them. Instead, Chen will most likely push
ahead with his "constitutional re-engineering" project.</P>
      <P>Besides, in Taiwan's "color only" politics, a "pan-green" camp
leader cannot possibly change his ideological stance to that of the
"pan-blues." If he did, he would become the DPP's bete noire, and it
would be tantamount to committing political suicide.</P>
      <P>So Taiwan will continue to be plagued by a clash of two vastly
different visions of its future -- one calling for independence from
China, the other trying to make peace with its giant neighbor while
seeking possible "eventual unification" with it. Chen and Ma will
return to their respective camps, preparing for a duel in 2008 under
the battle cry of "let the people decide."</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUTHORITIES WARY OF FAKE TIBETAN LAMAS IN TAIWANBy   Flor   WangCNA staff writer</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 2 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of fake Tibetan lamas from China
applying to enter Taiwan using forged documents is on the rise,
prompting the attention of Taiwan's law enforcement and national
security authorities.</P>
      <P>Police and security authorities suspect that a number of unlawful
organizations in Taiwan have been providing assistance to fake
Tibetan lamas in entering Taiwan, taking advantage of a loophole in
Taiwan's law enforcement.</P>
      <P>Although a majority of Tibetan monks in Taiwan are sincerely
devoted to preaching and behaving well, many have been arrested on
charges of illegal activities related to fraud, human or drug
trafficking and sex offenses, government officials said.</P>
      <P>Some lamas conceal their true identity as Chinese agents and
engage in subversion here by luring influential figures from the
political and business sectors, posing a threat to national security,
a national security official pointed out.</P>
      <P>Tibetan Buddhism is widespread in Taiwan and the government
offers handsome incentives for Tibetan lamas to preach here,
coinciding with the trend of more Tibetan or Chinese people seeking
to enter Taiwan and reside in the country through all possible means.</P>
      <P>It was reported that 140 Tibetans were invited by the Mongolian
and Tibetan Affairs Commission to visit Taiwan in September 2001 but
overstayed their visa, and were allowed by Taiwan's government to
reside here on a case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>After the news was leaked, the incidence of Tibetans seeking to
enter Taiwan on a doctored Nepalese passport has seen a marked
increase.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, some 300 Tibetan monks or people who
had overstayed their entry visa in Taiwan were waiting for amnesty by
the government to obtain a resident permit, government statistics
showed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some overseas ROC representative offices also found
that more and more Tibetans and Chinese from western Qinghai province
-- under the guise of being Tibetan lamas -- have been attempting to
apply for a visa to "preach" in Taiwan by using a counterfeit
Nepalese passport, which is easily obtained.</P>
      <P>Since Macau, India and Singapore allow visitors from Nepal to
enter without a visa, many people from China first get a residence
permit in Nepal and then acquire a passport before applying for a
visa to enter Taiwan as a lama with ROC outposts in Macau, India and
Singapore, Taiwanese diplomats said.</P>
      <P>According to the ROC representative office in Singapore, it has
received more than 210 such applications since November last year,
with some 10 percent found to have been forged.</P>
      <P>In an effort to prevent illegal elements from entering Taiwan,
the ROC representative office in Singapore has created a standard
process for verifying visa applications, requiring applicants to
submit certificates issued by temples and recommendation letters by
Tibetan Buddhist priests, as well as religious identity documents and
oral exams in spoken Tibetan or Nepalese languages.</P>
      <P>Despite all these measures, the screening mechanisms have been
far from effective, the Taiwanese diplomats said, urging the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, National Police Agency, National Security Bureau
and immigration authorities to step up inter-agency communications
and set up an inter-ministerial fast response databank.</P>
      <P>They also proposed the government follow the example of Hong Kong
by denying visa applications by passport holders from countries like
Nepal where fake passports are easy to get.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong stopped issuing entry visas to Nepalese passport
holders in June 2005 for the same reason -- after a noticeable number
of Chinese attempting to enter Hong Kong with a counterfeit Nepalese
passport were detected, they noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Sunday she
hoped the meeting of the nation's two "most powerful" political
leaders Monday would "create a new situation" for Taiwan, but she
also urged the opposition leader to "tell the president everything"
about his recent visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>Addressing a seminar at Taichung's Chung Hsing University, Lu
urged Ma to tell President Chen Shui-bian everything about his
"meetings behind closed doors" with U.S. officials, from which even
Taiwan's top envoy in Washington was barred.</P>
      <P>This would be a chance for all people in Taiwan to check Ma's
credibility and competency as a presidential candidate for 2008,
including his knowledge of the impending crisis between Taiwan and
China, she said.</P>
      <P>"Was he [Ma] speaking for Taiwan? While abroad, did he show any
respect toward the leader of Taiwan? These are democratic practices
commonly respected by all here in Taiwan," she said.</P>
      <P>She gave an "overall positive" score of Ma's performance during
his 10-day visit, urging people not to "look negatively" upon Ma's
U.S. tour, during which she said Ma had raised Taiwan's profile
internationally.</P>
      <P>However, Lu said Ma talked a lot about peace while acting "too
cautiously" and failed to promote Taiwan's democratic achievements
for fear of offending China and scuttling his possible meetings with
U.S. officials.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the spokesman for the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party expressed hope the Chen-Ma meeting would mark the beginning of
cooperation among political parties after the two leaders exchanged
views on major issues involving the nation's development.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang said the DPP expects the two leaders to create a
positive atmosphere for reconciliation and exchanging views on arms
purchase, Control Yuan members' nominations and other major issues.</P>

      <P>The government has drawn up a plan to

according to a report by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The council said a "bio-economy" will soon develop when

      <P>Agricultural and animal waste, such as plants, animal manure and
food leftovers can be converted into a biogas that is an inflammable

      <P>By turning waste into electricity, the council said the
technology cleans the environment by disposing of waste while

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) is
planning to extend the annual educational training period for reserve
soldiers by one day to three-and-a-half days to meet actual needs,
MND officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Reporting at the Legislative Yuan on the progress in the
separation of the active forces' and reserves forces' systems, which
is part of the ongoing reform of the armed forces, the MND officials
said that the annual educational training period for reserve soldiers
will be increased to three-and-a-half days while that for reserve
officers will remain at three-and-a-half days to five days.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in a planned revision to the Military Service Act, the
maximum draft age for reserve service will be lowered from 40 to 35,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>If this revision is passed and implemented, the number of reserve
soldiers will be reduced to some 2.9 million from the current level
of 3.4 million, substantially lessening the MND's management burden,
the officials claimed.</P>
      <P>According to the MND officials, there are currently about 410,000
men listed as the reserve forces, mostly Army infantry officers and
soldiers responsible for combat, combat support or logistics support
missions in the event of war.</P>
      <P>Noting that the weapon systems and related equipment for the
reserve forces are not on par with those for active forces, the MND
officials said more funds will need to be allotted in the ministry's
annual budget toward replacing old weapons and equipment and training
reserve soldiers and officers in how to use the new equipment in
order to upgrade the reserve forces' preparedness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY SUBSIDY TO POOR CHILDREN: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Monday the
government will provide an emergency monthly subsidy of NT$3,000
(US$92) to children in impoverished families.</P>
      <P>Premier Su made the remarks while attending an activity related
to children protection sponsored by the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Su said that if a family is listed as impoverished, the MOI will
provide each child in the family with a monthly subsidy of NT$3,000
for six months. The government will provide the subsidy for up to one
year at most, he added.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that 15,000 children will benefit from the
program, Su said.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that rapid social changes have brought many
problems, adding that he felt "saddened" to learn about a spate of
cases involving abused children and parents in financial
distress taking their own lives as well as their children's.</P>
      <P>The MOI will start to screen high-risk families with the aim of
preventing such tragic incidents in the future, he said, adding that
the ministry is expected to appropriate NT$135 million for the
screening.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that people will extend their love and
care to impoverished families in their community.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Lee Yi-yang said that 30 percent of the funding
for the emergency subsidy program for poor children will be provided
by local governments, with the central government shouldering the
remaining 70 percent. The ministry will also help local governments
add more social workers to their staff, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Taiwan currently has 189 social workers and that he
hopes the number can be boosted by 323. He said that it has been
tentatively planned that the central government will provide 40
percent of the funds needed to employ the additional social workers,
with the local governments shouldering the remaining 60 percent.</P>
      <P>He said that as long as the local governments agree, the
emergency subsidy program and the plan to hire more social workers
can kick off immediately.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN UNDER DIRECT CHINESE AVIAN FLU THREAT: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
Taiwan is under direct threat of avian flu spreading from China,
which is the largest "hot zone" of avian flu risk in the world.</P>
      <P>Aided by the seasonal travel of migratory birds, Chen said, bird
flu has spread across continents and has affected nearly 50 countries
so far, with over 100 people having perished as the result of the
virulent H5N1 strain of the virus.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which is separated from China by only the narrow Taiwan
Strait and which maintains close private exchanges with that country,
will bear the full brunt of a possible pandemic of bird flu
originating from China, where cases of H5N1 infection in humans and
even deaths have been reported over the past two years, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, he went on, China has spared no effort to obstruct
Taiwan's bids to join the World Health Organization and has boycotted
Taiwan's cooperation with other countries in bird flu-fighting
efforts -- moves that run counter to the universal value of "health
care knows no borders" and cause incalculable damage to Taiwan's 23
million people.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he addressed the opening of the 2006
Asian Pacific Regional Conference of the International Hospital
Federation (IHF) at the Taipei International Convention Center.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that over the past five decades, Taiwan has
achieved an economic miracle, carried out democratization, raised the
people's standard of living and promoted the development of health
care systems and related business.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's health care domain is of an internationally recognized
high standard and the country has been assessed by the Economist
Intelligence Unit as the "second most healthy country" in the world,
Chen added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has contributed significantly to the world's health care
efforts by taking part in numerous international disaster rescue and
relief work efforts and medical aid missions, he said, adding that
Taiwan is able and willing to make bigger contributions to the world
with its commendable medical expertise and skills plus compassion for
all the peoples around the globe.</P>
      <P>In the future, he said, Taiwan will continue to demonstrate its
medicare strength and try to win greater international recognition in
the hope that leaders and pioneers in the world's medical sector will
speak for Taiwan so as to prevent Taiwan from being shut out of the
world's disease-prevention network.</P>
      <P>Nearly 800 hospital representatives and medical leaders from
20-odd countries are taking part in the pan-regional meeting of the
world's second-largest unofficial medical organization.</P>
      <P>Discussions at the April 2-5 meeting will cover topics including
applications of information technology, which when appropriately
applied has great potential in medicine, nursing and management;
medical assistance to poor communities and countries; and how
hospitals and health services can better prepare for facing
catastrophes caused by natural forces such as tsunami, epidemics and
pandemics, according to IHF Director-General Per-Gunnar Svensson.</P>
      <P>Issues such as Taiwan's health insurance system, its experience
in fighting severe acute respiratory syndrome, and its work and
accomplishments in overseas medical aid will also be discussed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Recreation therapy" has proved successful
in helping young brain tumor patients at Taipei Veterans General
Hospital (TVGH) find an outlet for the unease and fear they face in
the process of receiving medical treatment, a physician at the
hospital said Monday.</P>
      <P>Children suffering from brain tumors usually have to endure a
great deal of physical and psychological stress in the long-term
treatment process, including surgery and follow-up radiotherapy that
normally lasts between five and seven weeks, said Chen Yi-wei, a
doctor in the hospital's Cancer Center.</P>
      <P>"It's impossible for young patients under the age of 12 not to
have feelings of fear and unease after staying in hospital for such a
long period of time, " Chen said, noting that most of the patients
have to be given tranquilizers or sleeping pills before facing the
traumatic experience of undergoing radiotherapy.</P>
      <P>Over time, patients build up a resistance to such drugs, thus
making them feel more uncomfortable during the treatment process, he
said.</P>
      <P>To help the sick children, the hospital introduced recreational
therapy six months ago. With the cooperation of the National Science
Council and Taipei Physical Education College, physicians at the
cancer center prescribed recreational activities, such as painting or
playing computer games, to their young patients.</P>
      <P>Chen said that a total of 13 brain tumor patients aged between 3
and 12 accepted the recreational therapy treatment on an experimental
basis. Doctors found that nearly half of the patients did not require
tranquilizers to calm them down before undergoing radiotherapy.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that each of the patients in the recreational therapy
program were first given a professional assessment on the degrees of
their fear and anxiety, with the results being used in prescribing a
suitable form of recreational therapy for each patient.</P>

(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Huang
Chih-fang said Monday that while the public sees that diplomats are
paid well, the difficulties and pressures diplomats face overseas
have been ignored.</P>
      <P>"Is there another government agency that needs to be responsible
for Taiwan's official diplomatic relations with other countries? "
Huang asked.</P>
      <P>"If there are any changes in the country's diplomatic relations,
the amount of pressure on our diplomats is tremendous. Some
ambassadors even cannot sleep well at night because of the
pressures," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks while taking questions from the press
during the reception for new MOFA Vice Minister Chang Siao-yue.
Huang's statement served as a response to a local media report that
diplomats are being paid more for doing the same thing as the
employees that the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)
has sent overseas. TAITRA is a semi-official non-profit organization
promoting foreign trade.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the report was "unfair" to diplomats, noting that
the public only sees how well diplomats are paid but that the tasks
diplomats face overseas are unimaginably difficult, adding that the
public should consider the price diplomats pay for their high
salaries.</P>
      <P>"In Africa, for example, diplomats and their families face the
threat of malaria, while in South America, they could get robbed or
shot, or their residences, located near the presidential office and
the ministry of the interior, could be affected if their is a coup,"
he said.</P>
      <P>When asked whether Taiwan's diplomats in the United States and
Europe are enjoying better lives than their colleagues in Africa and
South America, Huang said that there are still major problems, such
as children's education issues.</P>
      <P>"After diplomats' children start education in a certain country,
when the parents are being transferred to another culture and another
education system, it becomes a torture for both parents and
children," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he has seen that diplomats sent to the United
States have had to leave their children behind in the U.S. for
education when (they get transferred to another post) and their
children are too old to adopt another education system. "Very often,
the whole family can only get together during Christmas," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET DENIES REPORTS ABOUT NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BUDGET SNUB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has not rejected a
supplementary budget request for the continued construction of the
country's fourth nuclear power plant, Government Information Office
Minister Cheng Wen-tsang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheng was responding to media reports that under the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) policy of a nuclear-free
Taiwan, the progress of construction of the nuclear power plant at
Kungliao, Taipei County, has not been running smoothly because
related budget failed to get sufficient support from the Executive
Yuan.</P>
      <P>State-owned Taiwan Power Company (Taipower), which is in charge
of construction of the plant, requested the Executive Yuan to
appropriate a supplementary budget of NT$54.3 billion in January, but
the request was rejected in February, the reports claimed. With money
fast running out, construction could come to a halt next month at the
earliest, according to the reports.</P>
      <P>Cheng termed the reports erroneous, saying that a financial
advisory group under the Executive Yuan is still reviewing whether
the supplementary budget is reasonable, as well as looking at the
safety aspects of nuclear power and of the actual construction.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has also asked Taipower and the Ministry of
Economic Affairs to review the country's energy policy, Cheng said.
In the event that the completion of the fourth nuclear power plant
lags behind schedule, causing power shortages, Taipower should also
map out middle- and long-term alternative plans, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan originally approved a budget of NT$169.7
billion for the plant, but it suspended construction work in October
2000, leading to billions of dollars of losses. </P>
      <P>After months of political turbulence, the work resumed after a
suspension of 110 days. The delay, coupled with the increased
generation capacity of the two units in the power plant, could cause
the investment to balloon to NT$243 billion, making it the most
expensive nuclear power plant in the world, according to the reports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT OFFERS SETTLEMENT TO PFP HEAD OVER LIBEL SUIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  March 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Ten-hui is willing to
reach a settlement with opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong over a lawsuit Soong filed last year against Lee for
defamation, Lee's attorney said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wellington Ku made the offer on behalf of Lee at the Taiwan High
Court, which opened a second trial of the case that day. The Taiwan 
High Court first opened the trial March 2, with the judge suggesting 
a settlement between the two parties concerned. </P>
      <P>According Ku, Lee said that he is willing to accept the judge's
settlement proposal and will publish a statement in a newspaper to
clarify his alleged remarks about Soong and make public his terms for
a settlement. Ku said that he had submitted the statement to the
judge and will wait for Soong's response.</P>
      <P>Lee lost the suit to Soong after the Taipei District ruled in
November last year that Lee must pay NT$10 million to Soong and make
an apology in nine local newspapers in compensation for damaging
Soong's reputation by alleging in public that the PFP chairman played
mahjong the night of April 10, 2004, ignoring opposition "pan blue"
supporters who were protesting in the streets against what they
called an unfair presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lee argued that he did not identify Soong in the remarks and said
that he would appeal.</P>
      <P>Soong, served as then Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan's running
mate in the March 20, 2004 presidential election. They lost by a
narrow margin to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party ticket of

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO STEP UP FOREIGN TALENT RECRUITMENT EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers from the ruling and opposition
parties demanded Monday that the government step up its efforts to
recruit hi-tech talent from overseas in view of fierce competition
from neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers Hung Wei-cher and Kuo Chun-ming of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, as well as Lee Jih-chu and Tsao
Shou-min of the main opposition Kuomintang, issued the call during an
interpellation session at the legislative Technology and Information
Committee after officials from the National Science Council (NSC) ,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and
the Mainland Affairs Council reported on the issue.</P>
      <P>Citing the successes enjoyed by Singapore and South Korea, the
lawmakers said that the government should offer more handsome
incentives to lure foreign talent, including providing residence
permits and education for their children, along with Taiwan's other
advantages.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is interested in exploring ties with India, the
government could consider opening offices there to assit Taiwan
companies in hunting for Indian hi-tech elite, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Lee also urged the government to further delve into the
possibility of introducing hi-tech and other professional foreign
nationals. Taiwan lags well behind South Korea in this field, she
pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, South Korea, where the average per-capita
income is at about the same level as Taiwan, has so far attracted
more than 10,000 foreign hi-tech workers, far ahead of Taiwan's
1,000.</P>
      <P>She said that the government should conduct a study on foreign
white-collar workers' conditions and the ease with which they adapt
to life in Taiwan, to serve as a reference for future government
policy making.</P>
      <P>Citing earlier surveys carried out by the NSC, NSC Vice Minister
Yang Tuen-her said that young hi-tech professionals care about most
career development prospects in the workplace, while senior
executives pay greatest attention to their children's education.</P>
      <P>While South Korea focuses its efforts on wooing talent from
China, India, Southeast Asian countries and Russia based on a
recruitment program initiated in 2003, Singapore grants tax
reductions for companies' spending on foreign manpower recruitment
and offers housing, high salaries and training programs for foreign
workers, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are about 300 Indian hi-tech workers employed in
Taiwan, while Singapore hires a much larger number of professionals
from India due to the country's high per-capita income, Vice Minister
of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said, noting that this is a real
problem for the government when trying to lure hi-tech talent from
abroad.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KRTC TO STOP HIRING THAI WORKERS AFTER JULY 2007</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After the planned partial launch of the
Kaohsiung mass rapid transit system in southern Taiwan in July 2007,
the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) will not hire any more Thai
laborers, KRTC officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The KRTC started to bring in Thai laborers in June 2003 to help
build the system, with their numbers currently estimated at 1,511,
compared with 1,717 in August 2005, when they rioted against what
they called harsh and inhumane treatment by a management firm
commissioned by the KRTC.</P>
      <P>The riot led to a substantial improvement in the living
conditions of the Thai workers, as well as an extensive corruption
probe that has implicated officials right up to a former senior aide 
of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>KRTC officials said the present focus of the MRT work is laying
the rails, which relies heavily on the Thai laborers. With the
partial launch of the MRT system, the number of Thai laborers
required will continue to decrease.</P>
      <P>They said the number of Thai laborers will be decreased by 200
per month starting late this year or early next year. After
rail-laying work is completed in July, the number will be lowered
further, they added.</P>
      <P>Unless repairs to a tunnel that caved in last December have not
been completed by July 2007, the KRTC will stop hiring Thai laborers
altogether.</P>
      <P>The officials said that after the completion of the rail-laying
work, the focus will shift to plumbing and renovation of the train
stations, which will require local laborers and technicians as the
main workforce.</P>
      <P>Two hundred aboriginal people are also employed by the KRTC, the
officials added, which they said conforms to the requirement by the
Kaohsiung city government that the KRTC hire a certain ratio of
aboriginal people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT GOADS KMT TO SNATCH 'ONE CHINA' INTERPRETATION FROM PRC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian challenged the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Monday to reach an agreement with Beijing
on what the KMT claims is a "1992 consensus" under which Taiwan can
interpret "one China" as "the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>During a two-hour dialogue with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou at the
Presidential Office, Chen urged Ma to ask KMT Honorary Chairman Lien
Chan to "snatch that right to interpret the meaning of 'one China'"
from Chinese President Hu Jintao when Lien visits Beijing later this
month.</P>
      <P>If the KMT can achieve that, and the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait agree on one China, with each side free to interpret its
meaning, "I will absolutely respect it," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In response, Ma said he would ask Lien to forward Chen's message
to the Chinese leadership in an attempt to "seek a breakthrough" in
Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>"One China, " cross-strait ties, the government's arms purchase
bill and other "ideological" issues -- in the form of the necessity
of changing the Constitution rather than economic and social issues
-- were the focus of the rare debate between the nation's two most
powerful political leaders.</P>
      <P>Chen's challenge originated from Ma's suggestion that the Chen
administration initiate a dialogue with China based on the so-called
"1992 consensus" reached in Hong Kong by delegates from Taipei and
Beijing, to reach a deal on practical matters such as allowing
Chinese tourists into Taiwan and setting up direct transportation
links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen chided Ma for asking him to base a formal negotiation on
"something that simply does not exit." Chen cited what he claimed
were "authoritative" sources to prove his point that there is no such
thing as the "1992 consensus, " a phrase that KMT Legislator Su Chi,
who once served as Mainland Affairs Council chairman, has admitted to
coining.</P>
      <P>But Chen said he does not deny that talks did take place in Hong
Kong between Taiwan and China in late 1992, in which China insisted
that the so-called "one China" refers to the People's Republic of
China, while the KMT keeps fooling itself -- and the world -- that it
has won an "oral agreement" from China that the two sides are free to
interpret what "one China" means in their own ways.</P>
      <P>Ma told Chen not to be too "technical" with regard to terminology
and assured him that China will likely accept the principle of "one
China, with each side free to interpret its meaning."</P>
      <P>"If China does not accept that, it will be its own fault, " Ma
said, noting that only when neither side denies the other's existence
can dialogue begin. He called on Chen to at least "give it a try" to
seize the opportunity to launch a dialogue with China.</P>
      <P>An unimpressed Chen urged Ma not to be naive about China, which
he claimed will never change its "one China" position of looking at
Taiwan as part of the PRC because its Constitution says so.</P>
      <P>Ma called on the president to talk with China on a wide range of
topics, including the possibility of signing what he called a "modus
vivendi" on Taiwan's international participation and a 30- to 50-year
interim agreement on cross-strait peace and cooperation, ideas that
he broached during a recent visit he made to the United States.</P>
      <P>Again, Chen was not convinced, claiming that as China is not
trustworthy and will not honor its agreements, Taiwan must be "very
cautious" in dealing with the Chinese leaders.</P>
      <P>Ma responded by saying that if such an agreement can be signed,
"we certainly must figure out ways to bind China to it. If one party
to an agreement fails to honor it, so can the other party," he added.</P>
      <P>When Ma challenged Chen to tell the people of Taiwan whether the
National Unification Council (NUC), whose function has been "ceased"
-- although the U.S. thinks it has just been put in abeyance -- is
still there or not.</P>
      <P>Chen for his part called on Ma not to be too "literal" with the
meaning of words. "I wanted to abolish the NUC, " Chen stressed,
adding that after to-and-froing with the U.S., "we finally decided to
cease its function, not suspend or terminate it, just cease its
function."</P>
      <P>Chen said the council no longer has any budget, its staff have
been sent back to their original units and that therefore, the NUC no
longer exists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERT URGES WEST NOT TO `MISINTERPRET' DPP'S ELECTION DEFEATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Executive Yuan Secretary-General
Liu Shih-fang urged China and the West not to "misinterpret" the
major setback Taiwan's ruling party suffered in the 2005 local
elections as a sign that Taiwan will move towards unification with
China or renounce independence.</P>
      <P>Liu made the call Sunday while delivering a speech at the Chinese
Cultural Center of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New
York. Liu, who heads a private society on cross-Taiwan Strait
economic and political research, took a one-year fellowship at the
Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C. in 2004.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed the defeat of the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), which won only six out of 23 city and county government posts
in the "three-in-one" elections Dec. 3, 2005, to several factors,
including the series of corruption scandals that has tarnished the
ruling party's image, the efforts of the opposition Kuomintang and
the People First Party -- both of which form the "pan-blue alliance"
-- to seek consolidation, and frequent Cabinet personnel changes that
have led to poor administrative efficiency.</P>
      <P>Liu suggested that the DPP take immediate steps to address the
problems lest they endanger the party's ability to survive. However,
she also said that the victory of the "pan-blue alliance" in the
local elections does not mean Taiwan supports unification.</P>
      <P>Talking about China's military threat against Taiwan, the former
government official said Taiwan has to defend itself, but added that
the true meaning of self-defense is not "just to enhance defensive
power."</P>
      <P>"The most important thing is that Taiwan has to maintain
democracy, " Liu said, explaining that democracy is the pride of
Taiwan and claiming that it is the reason Taiwan enjoys support from
the United States.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian claimed Monday
that main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's proposal to
sign a cross-Taiwan Strait peace agreement is similar to one proposed
by a former U.S. official that received no support from the
administration of former U.S. President Bill Clinton.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a high-profile meeting with Ma at
the Presidential Office. The meeting was proposed by Ma after his
return from a 10-day visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen described Ma's proposal under the model of "modus
vivendi" -- a temporary agreement between contending parties prior to
a final settlement -- as being similar to that of an interim
agreement proposed by former U.S. National Security Council (NSC)
official Kenneth Lieberthal, who suggested a 30-year cross-strait
agreement in which Taiwan would not seek independence and China would
not use force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Chen said Lieberthal's proposal had prerequisites and
envisioned the eventual unification of the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"Even so, Beijing opposed such a proposal," Chen said, adding
that he doubted if China would accept Ma's proposal, which also has
the existence of the Republic of China as a premise.</P>
      <P>Chen said he asked James B. Steinberg, a former deputy national
security adviser under Clinton administration as well as Lieberthal's
superior, about the latter's proposal, but learned that
then-U.S.President Bill Clinton had not supported Lieberthal's ideas,
because "China is unreliable, and who can guarantee that it will
honor its promise for 30 or 50 years?"</P>
      <P>The president also said that during Clinton's visit to Taiwan in
February 2005, Clinton reiterated his opinion.</P>
      <P>Clinton was quoted as having suggested that Taiwan should be
itself and should not accept an interim agreement that would be
unfavorable to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Ma pointed out that times have changed and he suggested
that Chen look at things "from a new perspective." </P>
      <P>Ma noted that former KMT Chairman Lien Chan signed a five-point
agreement with Chinese President Hu Jintao during his visit to China
last May in which both sides expressed willingness to sign a
peace agreement without mentioning eventual unification.</P>
      <P>Ma said that if the conditions for a cross-strait peace agreement
are good, it will be helpful to Taiwan's security. If the other side
does not abide by the agreement, the agreement will not exist and the
situation will return to the present.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Jaw-pyng Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If Chinese leader Hu Jintao accepts the
principle of "one China, with each side of the Taiwan Strait free to
interpret its meaning, " President Chen Shui-bian said Monday he will
"absolutely respect it" during a televised meeting with opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou during which few points of consensus
were reached.</P>
      <P>The meeting took place after Ma's recent U.S. visit, and was
expected to be dominated by a controversial multi-billion dollar arms
deal with the U.S.</P>
      <P>During the two-hour meeting at the Presidential Office, Chen and
Ma spent much of the time communicating their points of view about
Taiwanese identity, cross-strait affairs, the "one China" policy, the
"1992 consensus, " Chinese missiles targeting Taiwan and arms
procurement.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan should reach a consensus about foreign and
mainland affairs and that the common enemy of both parties is
Communist China. Ma put forth suggestions about improving
cross-strait relations, discussing Chen's "Five Noes" commitment and
Ma's own "Five Do's."</P>
      <P>At a swearing-in ceremony six years ago, President Chen made five
promises, among them that he would not declare independence or change
the nation's title.</P>
      <P>Chen said, "As long as the Chinese Communist regime does not
intend to use force against Taiwan, I promise that during my term I
will not declare independence, will not change the name of the
country, will not push for the incorporation of a special state-
to-state model of cross-strait relations in the Constitution and will
not push for a referendum on the independence-unification issue that
will change the status quo. Nor will there be any question of
abolishing the National Unification Guidelines or the National
Unification Council."</P>
      <P>Instead of "Five Noes, " Ma proposed "Five Do's" during his U.S.
trip. He said the measures would help improve relations between
Taiwan and China by resuming cross-strait dialogue and establishing a
tentative peace framework or "modus vivendi" if his party wins the
presidency in 2008.</P>
      <P>Other steps to be taken by the KMT include enhancing cross-strait
economic and trade ties, negotiating with Beijing on issues involving
Taiwan's international participation and promoting cross-strait
cultural and educational exchanges, said Ma.</P>
      <P>The meeting between the two leaders was their first since Ma won
the chairmanship of the Kuomintang (KMT) last August. Ma requested
the meeting after returning from the U.S. March 29.</P>
      <P>Although both claimed they were looking forward to an opportunity
to share views and experiences, they emerged from the meeting with
widely disparate positions about cross-strait relations and China
policy.</P>

      <P>The so-called "organic pork" or "organic
fishery products" circulating in the local market are all
self-proclaimed with no official certification, the Council of
Agriculture (COA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council has so far not certified any fishery or
aquacultural products or livestock products as organic, COA officials
said, adding that all so-called "organic pork" or "organic fish"
available on the local market are self-proclaimed.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the COA has authorized four organic
agriculture promotion organizations to certify some farm produce as
"organic products, " but the operations have not covered any fishery
or animal husbandry items.</P>
      <P>At present, the officials said, the four authorized foundations
are responsible for monitor and certify a total of 1,335 hectares of
farmland specializing in organic agricultural production, including
rice, vegetables, fruits and tea. Only qualified "organic products"
are allowed to carry the COA-certified "CAS"</P>
      <P>The COA has conducted regular field surveys and spot market
inspections to ensure that all "CAS"-labeled organic products meet
its standards and requirements.</P>
      <P>Three sets of regulations have been put into force to govern
production and management of organic farm produce and CAS certifying
operations, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT: PRESIDENT FAILS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN 'CPC' AND 'CHINA'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian does not seem to
realize that although the Communist Party of China (CPC) poses a
threat to Taiwan, mainland China presents an opportunity for Taiwan,
an opposition Kuomintang (KMT) legislator said Monday.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, who once served as chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council, made the comment after Chen's live, televised meeting with
KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>On Chen's rejecting Ma's suggestion to reopen cross-Taiwan Strait
dialogue on the basis of the "1992 consensus" on grounds that such a
consensus simply does not exist, Su said the president had failed to
grasp the "delicate points" of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>When it comes to cross-strait relations, a critical point is that
many things can be done when both sides do not "deny the existence of
the other, " said Su, who has previously admitted he coined the term
"1992 consensus" so that both sides would continue dialogue after
Chen became Taiwan's president in 2000.</P>
      <P>Because Chen's government has not realized the difference between
"the Communist Party of China" and "mainland China," the government's
policy over the past six years has led to "growing threats posed by
the CPC" and "growing opportunities offered by mainland China, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Because the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government led by
Chen has only perceived the CPC's threats while failing to see
mainland China's opportunities and has adopted a confrontational
policy toward China, its policy has led to a deadlock in cross-strait
relations, angering the U.S. and making the world uneasy, Su said.</P>
      <P>He said if the DPP government were competent, it would have
helped the Taiwanese people "resist Communist threats" on one hand
while "seizing opportunities in China" on the other.</P>
      <P>Instead, he noted, the Chen administration has created tensions
in cross-strait relations and caused Taiwanese people to lose
opportunities in China, resulting in Taiwan's marginalization and the
suffering of its people.</P>
      <P>Su said when China and Taiwan agreed on "one China," neither side
was forcing the other to accept its own definition of the term, and
the key was in "not denying the existence of the other side."</P>
      <P>As long as China does not deny or challenge Taiwan's claim to be
"one China" or remains silent over this, things will be okay, he
said, regretting that the president "still has not come to realize
the delicate points in the cross-strait relationship."</P>
      <P>Shuai Hua-min, another KMT lawmaker, said Ma has proposed a
step-by-step policy toward peace between Taiwan and China, while Chen
has proposed a disorderly policy toward war, causing Taiwan to waste
too much of its time and energy on unproductive political debate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT, KMT CHAIRMAN DIFFER ON HOW TO AVOID DISASTER FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  March  3  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou agreed during their
meeting at the Presidential Office Monday that Taiwan's interests
should always come first in whatever the ruling and opposition
parties do, but disagreed on how to "seek good fortune and avoid
disaster" for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In his first meeting with the president since he became KMT
chairman in August last year, Ma, who also serves as Taipei mayor,
said the KMT's way of seeking good fortune and avoiding disaster for
Taiwan is to lay out an "open, pragmatic" policy toward mainland
China by sticking to the "five noes" pledge -- made by President Chen
in his inaugural speech in 2000 and reaffirmed by him in 2004 when he
began to serve a second term -- plus the KMT's "five do's."</P>
      <P>In his May 2000 inaugural speech, Chen said that as long as China
promises not to use military force against Taiwan, he will not
declare Taiwan independence, will not change the official name of the
country, will not include the"state-to-state"theory in the
Constitution, will not promote a referendum to change the
cross-Taiwan Strait status quo, and will not abolish the Guidelines
for National Unification and the National Unification Council (NUC).</P>
      <P>As for the "five do's," Ma suggested the government resume talks
with the Chinese mainland; work toward a peace accord under which
both sides of the Taiwan Strait agree that neither will move toward
independence or unification for 30-50 years; set up military
confidence building mechamisms; try to achieve a modus vivendi on
Taiwan's participation in international organizations; and step up
cross-strait cultural and educational exchanges.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the issue of Taiwan independence versus
unification with China should be set aside, and that both the
government and the opposition parties should instead focus on
improving people's livelihood and finding a way out of Taiwan's
isolation in the international arena, and creating a "win-win"
situation for both Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>While agreeing with Ma that Taiwan should "seek good fortune and
avoid disaster," Chen charted a different course of achieving that
goal.</P>
      <P>He explained that he was not moving toward Taiwan independence,
and that measures adopted by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government were all intended to protect Taiwan's democratic way of
life -- measures such as insisting on giving the people the right to
determine important issues through a referendum, allowing the NUC and
the National Unification Guidelines to cease functioning, and pushing
for constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that no political parties should determine
the future for Taiwan's 23 million people, and that it is up to the
people to decide what they want.</P>
      <P>The two-hour meeting, televised live, was held at Ma's request
because he wanted to make some suggestions to the president after his
recent visit to the United States. Their discussion also touched on
such issues as the gridlock in the legislature concerning military
procurement from the United States and whether it was necessary to
end the NUC and its guidelines.</P>
      <P>Although their dialogue was conducted in a congenial atmosphere,
the meeting apparently ended with neither side bending to the other
on any given issues. The president and the KMT chairman, however,
agreed that whenever necessary, they will hold similar discussions
again in future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian told main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Monday that with
the public's support, he will consider taking further steps to amend
the Constitution or even draft a new Constitution.</P>
      <P>At their two-hour meeting at the Presidential Office televised
live to the nation, the president said the current Constitution is
based on the premise hat the Republic of China's territory covers the
whole of China, and an no longer reflect the reality in Taiwan.</P>
      <P> He explained that Taiwan's people now choose their own president
through direct elections, while in the past, presidents of the
Republic of China on Taiwan were chosen indirectly by a National
Assembly that would also represent the Chinese people across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Noting the Constitution has been amended seven times -- once in
2005 after Chen began to serve his second term and six times when Lee
Teng-hui was president and KMT chairman -- Chen said he will take
further steps for constitutional reform when conditions in Taiwan are
ripe.</P>
      <P> Urging the president to safeguard the Constitution, Ma reminded
Chen that he had pledged his allegiance to the Constitution twice in
his 2000 and 2004 presidential inaugural addresses.</P>
      <P>"The people are really not interested in any more constitutional
reform," Ma said, adding that the government should now focus on
improving the people's livelihood.</P>
      <P>The meeting was the first between the president and Ma since Ma,
who also serves as Taipei mayor, became KMT chairman in August last
year. The meeting was held at Ma's request because he wanted to make
some suggestions to the president after coming back last week from a
10-day visit to the United States.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,   April   3   (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two pro-Taiwan independence
organizations in the United States issued a joint statement Monday to
express indignation at main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou's recent remarks regarding the United States' obligation to
help defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese military attack.</P>
      <P>In an interview with United Press International on March 28,
2006, Ma said that U.S. officials had told him during his visit to
Washington, D.C. that the United States would have no obligation to
intervene in a military conflict between Taiwan and China if Taiwan's
government did anything to spark the conflict.</P>
      <P>Ma, who doubles as Taipei mayor, recently concluded a 10-day
visit to the United States.</P>
      <P>Terri Giles, executive director of the Los Angeles-based Formosa
Foundation, said that he found it "curious that a United States 
official confided in the Taipei mayor and leader of Taiwan opposition
party that the United States considers Taiwan to be the problem,
since it is China who has undermined the status quo."</P>
      <P>He said that China has deployed almost 800 missiles aimed at
Taiwan and has repeatedly threatened to use force against the
democratic and sovereign island.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese Communist leadership has systematically isolated
Taiwan from the rest of the international community, passed an
anti-secession law and continued a rapid military buildup in recent
years that is largely focused on intimidating Taiwan and seizing the
island if intimidation fails," he said.</P>
      <P>"China's provocative actions represent a major change in the
status quo and a serious military threat to Taiwan," he continued.</P>
      <P>C.T. Lee, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Formosan
Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) , said that the association
condemns Ma's statement, adding that his "reckless assertion must be
music to the ears of the Chinese government."</P>
      <P>It could be used as justification for China to declare a
democratic act by the Taiwanese government as the spark for war, Lee
continued.</P>
      <P>"We are gravely concerned that the Mayor's statement will only
embolden China to believe that the United States has severely
curtailed any commitment to defend Taiwan," said Giles.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Foundation and FAPA each call upon the U.S. to
confirm its adherence to the letter and spirit of the Taiwan
Relations Act of 1979, which forms the foundation for the
U.S. commitment to help defend Taiwan in the event of an attack by
China, Lee said.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the United States government will reinforce its
commitment to support Taiwan and its democracy and expressly condemn
any statements that suggest otherwise," he continued.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Hong Kong Chinese-language
newspapers expressed different views Tuesday on the historic meeting
between the two most influential politicians in Taiwan -- President
Chen Shui-bian and opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou,
held a day earlier in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Ming Pao Daily News said in a commentary that the two
politicians didn't arrive at any consensus on the issues they talked
about during their meeting, claiming the two-hour "Chen-Ma" dialogue
wouldn't have any impact on the current politic situation in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The daily said the two political leaders seemed about even during
their debates on various issues, including the "one-China" principle,
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, and the arms procurement bill that has
been stalled in the legislature for over a year.</P>
      <P>The Ming Pao indicated that the "Ma Ying-jeou phenomenon" emerged
on the political stage in Taiwan after the KMT chief, who also serves
as Taipei mayor, concluded a high-profile visit to the United States
last week. Most members of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) seem to believe "no one in the DPP can compete with Ma in
the presidential election in 2008," the newspaper said</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Oriental Daily News described in its commentary
the meeting as a "high-level show of democracy, " which might be able
to inspire the leadership on the other side of the strait.</P>
      <P>However, the newspaper also commented that the Chen-Ma meeting
turned into a television debate between Taiwan's two major political
parties, which built a "mirage" of inter-party cooperation. It said
that both sides took advantage of the meeting to build up support for
their respective parties' candidates in the year-end mayoral
elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung as well as for their parties ahead
of the 2008 presidential election.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  4  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is dedicated to developing
sustainable relations with its diplomatic allies in the South Pacific
with the aim of creating a "win-win situation, " a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu made the remarks in response to a recent report
by the Australian Senate claiming that the diplomatic battle between
Taiwan and China in the South Pacific has contributed to corruption
in countries in the region.</P>
      <P>Lu said that Taiwan's diplomatic relations with South Pacific
states have mainly focused on the sustainable development of
bilateral relations. Taiwan has, based on its experience, engaged in
cooperation in human resources, public construction, and agricultural
and fishery technology, Lu added.</P>
      <P>"All the projects we are promoting can be subject to public
scrutiny," he added.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's allies in the South Pacific envy Taiwan's
achievements over the past five decades and that they realize that
Taiwan is sincere in having long-term and sustainable relations with
them.</P>
      <P>However, China's approach has been different, Lu said. Beijing
has pulled out all the stops in trying to deter South Pacific
countries from establishing or maintaining diplomatic ties with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu's words came as Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao arrived in Fiji the
same day to attend an economic forum -- the first China-Pacific
Island Countries Economic Development and Cooperation Forum -- slated
for April 5-6.</P>
      <P>The conference, co-sponsored by China and Fiji, is aimed at
boosting bilateral cooperation between China and Pacific island
nations in travel, environmental protection, education, fisheries,
public health and legal affairs.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said that China provided Fiji with some US$1.17
million in funds to help organize the conference. Since early this
year, China has offered more than US$13 million in aid to Fiji as
part of its "checkbook diplomacy," they said.</P>
      <P>Despite China's efforts to woo Taiwan's six diplomatic allies in
the region -- namely Nauru, Palau, the Marshall Islands, the Solomon
Islands, Kiribati and Tuvalu -- all six countries have said that they
will not take part in the conference.</P>

      <P>A civic group urged the government,
Internet content providers and parents Tuesday to take action to
protect children who use the Internet, in the wake of a survey
showing that 51 percent of Taiwan parents have no idea what the
Internet content rating system is.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Cyber Angel's Pick, an affiliated

      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou called Tuesday for the president to pay greater
attention to people's livelihoods, saying that he met President Chen
Shui-bian Monday out of concern for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is also mayor of Taipei, made the remarks while fielding
questions from Taipei city councilors during an interpellation
session at the Taipei City Council.</P>
      <P>Although many of the opposition "pan blue alliance" supporters
were not content with his meeting with Chen, Ma said that he had done
so in hopes of pushing the president to focus more on economic issues
that would improve people's lives by building better relations with
China.</P>
      <P>Even if his meeting with Chen failed to produce concrete results,
it was good that they had met in a cordial atmosphere, Ma said,
pointing out that he would not mind if his public approval ratings
declined following the meeting.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that the United States was not behind his
decision to meet with the president and that the United States had
not asked him to relay any messages to Chen.</P>
      <P>The KMT's legislative caucus Tuesday praised Chairman Ma's moral
courage for holding a meeting with President Chen in defiance of
supporters' opinions.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, a KMT legislative caucus whip, made the comment at

met with Chen by any means, Pan said that she still wanted to praise
Ma for doing so. Ma did a good job in highlighting the KMT's and his
own stance on issues related to Taiwan-China relations and people's

      <P>KMT Legislator Chiu I also lauded Ma's performance as an

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei District Court heard a debate
Tuesday over a lawsuit filed by broadcaster Jaw Shau-kong against
President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Su Tseng-chang for having
insinuated that Jaw was "a ghost" in October 2004. The court is
scheduled to hand down a decision on April 18.</P>
      <P>The suit was filed after Chen quoted a poem, lamenting "How
desolate are we humans as ghosts abound!" to express displeasure over
Jaw's news commentary charging him with wasting taxpayer money on
consolidating diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Then Presidential Office Secretary General Su Tseng-chang also
chided Jaw as "the black sheep of the media."</P>
      <P>Jaw told the court that Chen and Su were highly placed
politicians who should have shown greater tolerance to media
criticism than other people, and yet they had used stern language to
attack his character. He also complained that the two were showing
contempt for the law by being absent from Tuesday's debate.</P>
      <P>Ku Li-hsiung, Chen's legal council, said Su had to use strong
language to counter charges that had damaged the president's dignity
and the country's foreign relations. Still, in his press releases, Su
didn't use the term "the black sheep of the media," Ku said.</P>
      <P>As for the president citing what Jaw claimed was an "insinuating"
poem, Ku said the president was merely airing his personal grievances
about being misunderstood in spite of his hard work to promote
Taiwan's foreign relations.</P>
      <P>Ku also explained that according to law, defendants can request
that a lawyer attend a court hearing on their behalf, and that the
defendant's absence does not signify disrespect for the court.</P>
      <P>Ku hoped that Jaw would withdraw his suit to match President
Chen's decision not to appeal an earlier court ruling on Chen's suit
against Jaw. Jaw said he will not drop his suit until Chen apologizes
publicly in the newspapers.</P>
      <P>Chen sued Jaw, People First Party Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung and
former lawmaker Tsai Chung-han for defamation by alleging that he
gave a cash gift to Panama's President Mireya Moscoso.</P>
      <P>The court in January ruled that Liu and Tsai must run a newspaper

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday extended
his personal sympathies by paying a visit to a terminally ill mother
in a hospice at Chung Shan Medical University Hospital in the central

      <P>A story published by media last month about five impoverished

one daughter and four sons, with the eldest a fourth grader in
elementary school and the youngest aged four.</P>
      <P>Chen also presented Wu with a "red envelope" as a gift and a

    <HEADLINE>TSU PROMISES TO DISCIPLINE LAWMAKER OVER DISCRIMINATORY REMARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
caucus whip said Tuesday that a TSU legislator had made improper
remarks about Vietnamese brides of Taiwanese residents, and that the
party "will discipline him for sure."</P>
      <P>David Huang made the remarks after several women and human
rights groups, including the Alliance for Human Rights
Legislation for Immigrants and Migrants, the Awakening Foundation and
Taiwan Association for Human Rights, went to the TSU headquarters to
lodge a protest against TSU Legislator Liao Pen-yen's remarks.
</P>
      <P>Liao alleged that U.S. forces launched biochemical warfare
during the Vietnam War, leading to the births of many deformed
children, and that the government should physically examine Vietnamese
brides of Taiwanese citizens to determine if they had "residual
biochemical agents in them."</P>
      <P>Faced with charges by outraged civic groups of Liao being
"a racist" and "a fascist," the TSU issued a statement to say Liao's
remarks were indeed "inappropriate," and that they had led to
widespread misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>"These are Liao's personal remarks, but the TSU will openly
apologize to all foreign spouses of Taiwanese citizens and to the
general public," the statement said.</P>
      <P>Huang also said the party's stance remains in line with
that of the immigrants' alliance and that the party will now study the
matter before meting out discipline.</P>
      <P>"We will probably suspend his rights for two months, and there
may also be other options for recourse," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang expressed the hope the public would not misinterpret one
individual's remarks as representing the party, adding that the
"legislative caucus will do some serious self-examination and pledge
an anti-discriminatory stance."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education will carry out
measures such as providing school lockers to reduce the physical
burden on primary school children from carrying heavy schoolbags,
Deputy Education Minister Wu Tsai-shun said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while briefing a group of Taiwan Solidarity
Union legislators, who raised the issue of overweight schoolbags.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the legislators measured a schoolbag on site
and found that it was as heavy as 15 kilograms. In addition to
necessities such as a water canteen, a pencil case, coloring pencils
and textbooks, the bag was stuffed with reference books handed out by
cram schools, which most Taiwanese students attend after school.</P>
      <P>Wu said to address the problem, the ministry has ordered
education authorities in 25 counties and cities around the country to
install lockers in primary schools and demanded that teachers follow
their class schedules so that students would not have to bring
unnecessary textbooks to school.</P>
      <P>Also, the ministry will promote a book loan program starting in
the 2006-2007 academic year, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He urged parents and teachers to examine children's schoolbags on
a daily basis and to ask them to take out unnecessary materials in
order to reduce the burden.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Navy warship which was damaged on a
training mission near Palau March 20 has been towed back to the
Tsoying Navy base in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, a spokesman for the
Ministry of National Defense said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liu chih-chien said the warship, Cheng-Ho, has been towed back
all the way from the South Pacific state by two Navy tugboats under
the escort of one of the country's Lafayette class missile frigates.</P>
      <P>As much as it was a successful rescue mission, Liu said, the
voyage is an invaluable experience for the Navy, which rarely tugs
back a vessel the size of Cheng-Ho from a country as distant as
Palau.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Liu said, the Navy went out of its way to
find cable capable of pulling the 4,100-ton warship.</P>
      <P>Cheng-Ho is one of a fleet of warships that departed from
Kaohsiung, early March for a training mission to Palau. It arrived in
Palau March 20, but struck an unknown object underwater while being
led into Malakal harbor by a local pilot.</P>
      <P>A survey afterward revealed the blades of its propeller were
damaged and could only sail at 5 miles per hour after some repairs
were made on the spot.</P>
      <P>The cause of the accident is still under investigation.</P>
      <P>As a scene of heavy naval battles during the World War II, the
sea floor around Palau is littered with the wrecks of warships, which
present risks to passing ships.</P>
      <P>Cheng-Ho is one of eight guided missile frigates built by Taiwan
on the pattern of US Perry-class frigates in 1990s. Its claim to fame
was in 1998 when it rammed into another warship at the Tsoying Navy
Base, seriously damaging its own bow.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou said Tuesday whether there will be another meeting with
President Chen Shui-bian would "hinge on the agenda as well as
timing."</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks one day after his high-profile, 130-minute
meeting with the president at the Presidential Office
focusing on cross-strait relations and political issues.</P>
      <P>Ma said he and the president had clearly expressed their
views in Monday's talks, and that if the two couldn't communicate on
certain points, there was "no need for more talks."</P>
      <P>But a legislative caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party expressed hope for another meeting, and that the
focus of the next meeting should be on discussing issues related
to economic development.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun said the DPP legislative caucus hopes
a new Chen-Ma meeting would discuss economic policies so as to
stabilize the political situation and assuage animosity between the
two rival parties.</P>
      <P>"If both parties can forge a consensus on the development of the
nation's economy, finances and sustainable development, then ruling
and opposition parties can work together to formulate related
economic development bills," Chen Chin-jun said.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun noted that during Monday's Chen-Ma meeting, both
expressed stances on many issues while little consensus was reached.</P>
      <P>After all, most of the issues depend on how Chinese 
President Hu Jintao will respond, Chen Chin-jun said.
</P>
      <P>The legislator was referring to Ma's request that cross-strait
talks resume based on the "1992 consensus," -- or a tacit agreement
on "one China, different interpretations" between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait. The president said he would only respect the
so-called "1992 consensus" if Hu publicly announces that Beijing
accepts the agreement of one China with each side having
different interpretations of what 'one China" means.</P>

      <P>The Vatican and China did not engage in any
official talks on establishing diplomatic relations during their
latest contact, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Wang Yu-yuan, director-general of the MOFA's
Department of European Affairs, high-ranking Vatican officials have
promised to inform Taiwan if the Holy See starts talks on
establishing diplomatic ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Vatican -- the only European country to maintain diplomatic
relations with Taiwan -- has been trying to improve its relations
with China and has maintained on-and-off contact with Beijing, Wang
noted.</P>
      <P>Wang said freedom of religion has been the main problem hampering
the establishment of Vatican-China diplomatic relations because the
Vatican is concerned about the rights of Catholics in China, which
does not recognize the authority of bishops and other officials
appointed by the Catholic church.</P>
      <P>Wang said that since 1992, the Vatican has mentioned plans to
"move its embassy" from Taipei to Beijing and that China has put
forth several conditions on the establishment of diplomatic ties with
the Vatican, including that it must not interfere with China's
internal affairs and must sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The matter is at a standstill because the Vatican has refused to
compromise on some of these conditions, Wang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>If Beijing "were to recognize us as the
Republic of China, it would be great, " Premier Su Tseng-chang said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Replying to a question from opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Chu Feng-chih at the legislature, Su said that if China
agreed to what Taiwan calls "one China, with both sides of the Taiwan
Strait free to interpret its meaning, " that would be "a major
breakthrough" and the government would support it.</P>
      <P>However, Su went on, it is unfortunate that the People's Republic
of China has never recognized Taiwan's definition of "one China" as
"the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>If Beijing were to recognize the principle of "one China, with
each side free to interpret its meaning, " that would mean the two
sides of the strait are equal and that Taiwan and China could get
along with each other on an equal footing, "and that is the greatest
expectation of the government," said the premier.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou a day earlier,
President Chen Shui-bian challenged the opposition party to urge
Chinese President Hu Jintao to declare that his government recognizes
the principle of "one China, with both sides of the strait free to
interpret its meaning."</P>
      <P>As KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan is to visit China and will
likely meet with Hu later this month, Chen called on Ma to request
that Lien forward the message to Hu, to which Ma agreed.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed confidence that if asked, Hu will never declare
that Beijing's "one China" -- the PRC, which governs China and claims
sovereignty over Taiwan -- could be interpreted as the ROC governing
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If Hu agrees to the principle of "one China, with both sides of
the strait free to interpret its meaning, I will absolutely respect
it," said Chen.</P>
      <P>However, Chang Jung-kung, deputy executive director of the KMT's
Central Policy Committee, said Chen himself does not believe in that
principle and has even tried to deny the ROC version of "one China."
That being the case, he questioned how Lien could possibly forward
such an insincere message to Hu.</P>
      <P>Since Chen is not sincere about "one China, " much less so about
"one China, with both sides free to interpret its meaning, " he is in
no position to ask Lien to do something that even Chen himself does
not believe in, Chang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHILD'S MIND  GREATEST NATURAL ASSET ON EARTH: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday feels
great pain when he hears of child abuse or cases in which parents
murder their children before taking their own lives, because the mind
of a child is the greatest asset on earth.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during an inspection tour of the Nantou
Education and Nursing Institute under the Ministry of the Interior in
central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that 9,897 child abuse cases were reported around
Taiwan in 2005, Chen said he has always been saddened by the plight
of abused or maltreated children and that it is especially painful to
learn about incidents involving parents in financial straits taking
their own lives along with those of their children.</P>
      <P>Chen said parents should love and treasure their kids because
their inquisitive minds are the greatest natural assets in the world.
He exhorted parents, particularly those in financial distress, to
have the courage to persist and not give up.</P>
      <P>As Tuesday marked the nation's Children's Day, Chen said his
administration is determined to offer better welfare services for
disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>He said the Interior Ministry has activated a high-risk family
screening mechanism to protect young children from abuse and
maltreatment. A total of 2,843 children and adolescents have
benefited from this domestic violence and abuse prevention mechanism,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The government has also decided to earmark NT$135 million for an
emergency subsidy program for abused children and teenagers this
year, marking a three-fold growth from last year's funding. Under the
project, the government will offer NT$3,000 in subsidies to each
abused child, a move that will benefit 15,000 disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>The Nantou institute, which provides shelter, rehabilitation,
education, job training and supportive work opportunities for
seriously mentally challenged children, was seriously damaged in the
devastating 9-21 earthquake of 1999 but has been rebuilt from ruins.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed delight to see the children living enriched lives
in the newly rebuilt compound, which boasts beautiful gardens and
courtyards, and humane and family-style living quarters, as well as
modern rehabilitation and education facilities.</P>
      <P>A group of mentally challenged children living at the institute

(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Yu-yuan, the director of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs' (MOFA) Department of European Affairs said
Tuesday that the European Union's (E.U.) attitude toward Taiwan's bid
to join the World Health Organization (WHO) this year should be
better than last year.</P>
      <P>Wang said the E.U. is going to hold a meeting on East Asian
affairs Wednesday and that the issue of Taiwan's WHO bid could be on
the agenda for discussion.</P>
      <P>Wang explained that this year, the E.U. should be more positive
about the issue of Taiwan's bid to enter the WHO because Taiwan has
been tirelessly lobbying E.U. countries on the issue, and both sides
understand each other's position quite well. Wang added that
the E.U. is supportive of Taiwan playing a more concrete role in the
global fight against avian flu.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the E.U. seems to be positive about Taiwan's
WHO bid, but the final results are still unknown.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is poised to initiate a
constitutional reform drive despite anticipating difficulties, Ng
Chiau-tong, executive director of the Hand-in-Hand To Protect Taiwan
Alliance, quoted Presidential Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen as
saying Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ng made the remarks at a news conference following a meeting held
by the alliance earlier the same day in which Chen and Lee Chun-i,
head of a constitutional reform task force under the Presidential
Office, attempted to explain the government's stance regarding the
issue -- one of the promises made by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) before it came to power in 2000.</P>
      <P>According to Ng, Chen made it clear that the government will
still launch its constitutional reform drive, although it is a highly
difficult task that needs to be approved by three-quarters of
lawmakers and endorsed by the public in a referendum.</P>
      <P>Chen was quoted by Ng as saying that the government is determined
to carry out the mission and that it is achievable as long as people
throw their support behind the government.</P>
      <P>Lee said during the meeting that he is hopeful that a draft
version of new constitutional provisions can be referred to the
Legislative Yuan in September this year to allow the legislature to
vote on the draft in the first half of the next year.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers would have time to discuss the draft -- two legislative
sessions -- before voting on it, Lee said, adding that should the
draft gain legislative approval, it could be put forth in a
referendum for the public to vote on by the end of 2007 following a
six-month period of publicity by the government.</P>
      <P>In addition to the DPP, Lee said, the Taiwan Solidarity Union and
the academic sector will also put forward their own draft versions of
new constitutional provisions.</P>

      <P>The government is planning to hold a
sustainable economic development conference that political party and

Tuesday.</P>
      <P>If the opposition parties do not participate, "we will be

Premier Tsai Ing-wen said.</P>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said he would like to meet with main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to extend an
invitation and discuss economic and social issues with him. "But he
has just met with the president. If I invite him now, I could be
accused of trying to stage a show," Su added.</P>
      <P>Responding to Su's remarks, Ma said that if the premier has an
idea, he should "just do it."</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the conference will be held in stages, with
the preparatory stage lasting from April 17 to May 5 and panel
discussions scheduled for May 5 through June 9.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's economy is affected by a number of regional factors,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two pro-independence activists criticized
President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday for telling opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou at a meeting the previous day that the
Constitution of the Republic of China has been "indigenized" and
deals with only "one Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Huang Chao-tang, chairman of the World United Formosans for
Independence, noted that in his two-hour meeting with Ma, the
president said that the nation's Constitution, which has been amended
seven times, has already been "indigenized or Taiwanized."</P>
      <P>Huang said that it is "a bit too far-fetched" for the president
to claim that the Constitution now deals with only "one Taiwan,"
instead of "one China."</P>
      <P>Liu Yi-teh, deputy secretary-general of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union -- an ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party in the "pan-green camp" -- said the president's remarks show
that either he does not understand the Constitution, or he was trying
to win support from members of the "pan-green camp."</P>

      <P>U.S. Congressman Henry Hyde said
Tuesday that Taiwan's democracy is a model for the rest of the world
to follow.</P>
      <P>Hyde, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives'

presented with the Order of the Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon by
David Ta-wei Lee, Taiwan's top envoy to the U.S., on behalf of
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has experienced the peaceful transition of
power from one party to another, Hyde said this proves that democracy
is applicable everywhere in the world. He added that the example of
Taiwan is of great help to the rest of the world on the path toward
democratization.</P>
      <P>Hyde, who has publicly announced that he will not seek another
term, also said he supports the signing of a free trade agreement
between the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said that Hyde, who played an instrumental role in

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus on Wednesday expressed the
hope that opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma Ying-jeou will meet
President Chen Shui-bian again before long to facilitate the
formation of consensus on Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative party whip Chen Ching-chun said he hopes that Ma
will accept invitations either to a second "Chen-Ma meeting" or a
supra-party sustainable economic development conference that the
administration is planning aimed at settling differences and working
out new economic policies.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun said that in the face of increasing globalization
and China's rise, it is imperative for Taiwan's ruling and opposition
parties to work in concert so that consensus on economic development
policies can be reached.</P>
      <P>He said the first "Chen-Ma meeting, " held at the Presidential
Office Monday, marked "the beginning of a constructive competition
between rival parties." He called for Ma to meet Chen again or take
part in the economic development conference under planning to "seek
remedial measures to help rev up Taiwan's economy."</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun also said he hopes that Ma will present the
Kuomintang's own version on how to reinvigorate Taiwan's economy in
the shortest possible period to pave the way for the convening of a
sustainable economic development conference in mid-June with party
delegates and business and trade leaders participating.</P>
      <P>He urged Ma to respond without delay, saying that "Ma may not be
in a hurry because of considerations of the 2008 presidential
election, but the country cannot wait any longer."</P>
      <P>President Chen met with Ma Monday for an unprecedented meeting
during which the two leaders talked about a wide range of topics,
including the definition of the controversial "one China" policy and
the cessation of the National Unification Council and its guidelines.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, Chen's approval ratings soared by 11
percentage points, while Ma's dropped by nine percentage points,
according to a local television poll.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More Taiwan businesses are relying on
personality tests than on professional tests in screening
inexperienced job candidates, according to the results of a recent
survey.</P>
      <P>Thirteen percent of businesses responding to the survey give
personality tests to fresh graduates during job interviews, compared
with 5.4 percent which give professional tests.</P>
      <P>By industry, personality tests and presentation are more commonly
used by the financial industry than other industries, while the
technological industry prefers thesis review, written tests on
professional subjects and onsite work.</P>
      <P>Mass interviews are most commonly used in the service industry.
Intelligence tests and foreign language tests are preferred by the
manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the magazine Career between March
8-17 on 260 human resource officers from the top 1,000 businesses in
the country.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that compared with last year, 50 percent of the
businesses will recruit a similar number of fresh graduates this
year.</P>
      <P>While 40 percent of the businesses in the service industry will
increase their job openings for fresh graduates this year, businesses
in the financial industry see the most significant decrease in their
job openings.</P>
      <P>Seventy-seven percent of the businesses said the starting
salaries they offer for fresh graduates this year are similar to the
year-earlier levels. The ratio of businesses that will raise their
starting salaries is the highest in the technological industry, and
the ratio of businesses that will lower their starting salaries is
the highest in the financial sector.</P>
      <P>On the educational background of the job candidates, 69 percent
of the businesses said they are hiring more fresh graduates with a
master's degree.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 22 percent of the businesses said they will hire fresh
graduates in the form of temporary employment this year, with the

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Angry at what they call a "deluge of
"shoddy, counterfeit and low-priced" Chinese furniture into Taiwan,
furniture makers in the Kaohsiung area will launch a series of
protests and form their own "trust" against what they claim to be
dumping by China.</P>
      <P>Wang Kun-hsiang, chairman of the Kaohsiung Furniture Industrial
Association, said Chinese furniture and home accessories have been
flooding into the Taiwan market and have grabbed a more than 50
percent share of the market, posing a great threat to Taiwan's
furniture industry.</P>
      <P>Wang said the "made in China" furniture and home accessories are
denounced particularly because they are sold at lower-than-normal
prices and most of the Chinese exports are "copycat" products.</P>
      <P>He said that in addition to launching a series of protests
against the Chinese dumping, the Kaohsiung Furniture Industrial
Association will organize all of its member companies into an
alliance to promote sales of domestically-produced "high-quality"
furniture.</P>
      <P>This marks the second time in less than one month that a Taiwan
industry has accused China of dumping. Taiwan towel makers, mostly
from the central county of Yunlin, took to the streets in March to
denounce the deluge of cheap Chinese products entering Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP SHOULD UNVEIL DISCOURSE ON PARTY POLICY, DIRECTION: DPP CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) should unveil a discourse on the party's policy and direction,
a whip of the DPP in the Legislative Yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun made the remarks amid reports that the DPP, in
order to reverse the impression of its lackluster performance over
the years, is preparing to unveil the party's first discourse in six
years.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, since the DPP first took over the helm of the
nation in 2000, its performance and the results of reforms have been
far better than that of the previous Kuomintang administration.</P>
      <P>"But since the DPP has had no comprehensive discourse to defend
its policy, it has been misunderstood by the people," he claimed.</P>
      <P>He noted that the DPP has faced an opposition-dominated
legislature and repeated boycotts over the past six years, so much
so, he claimed, that its administrative achievements have been
"deliberately smeared."</P>
      <P>"Under such circumstances, the public harbors misunderstandings
about the party, causing the party's popularity to slip to a new
low," he said.</P>
      <P>"We should sort out the results achieved by the DPP so as to
clearly explain them to the public, " Chen said, adding that "the
matter is too important to procrastinate over any longer."</P>
      <P>The DPP, the Executive Yuan and the DPP legislative caucus should
use plain language to let the public understand what the party has
done over the years, he added.</P>
      <P>The discourse will become the major reference of the party in
coming elections, DPP sources said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Leaders of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) should first try to forge common ground
within the party on major national polices before seeking to hold
meetings with opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, KMT
spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the DPP's predicament lies in President Chen
Shui-bian's "reckless" approach in dealing with major issues, leaving
no room for full discussion among the party elite, Cheng said that
the DPP should build consensus on issues of major concern in the
first place before reaching out to other parties.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun and Premier Su Tseng-chang have
displayed an interest in meeting the KMT chairman after Ma met the
president Monday.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the hopes of Yu and Su to hold meetings with the
KMT chairman is a clear reflection of the DPP's worry about the
future, Cheng said that Ma met Chen mainly to share his experiences
from his recent U.S. visit with the aim of helping amend sharp
differences between the ruling and opposition camps and preventing
the government from being crippled.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Ma will attend a national conference on sustainable
economic growth to be convened by the Executive Yuan, Cheng quoted Ma
as stressing that the government should "just do it" instead of
merely playing lip service to the issue.</P>
      <P>"It is unnecessary to hold a KMT-DPP summit for the time being, "
Cheng said, suggesting that the DPP implement the outcome of the
first national economic development conference in its efforts to
revive Taiwan's economy. The KMT has no plans to take part in a
KMT-DPP summit, she added.</P>
      <P>Cheng called a recent drop in Ma's public approval rating
following the Chen-Ma meeting a "short-term phenomenon " and
described it as a "natural development" because many "pan blue
alliance" supporters were opposed to the idea of Ma meeting Chen.</P>
      <P>Following the April 3 Chen-Ma meeting, the KMT chairman's public
approval ratings fell to 58 percent from a peak of 67 percent in
recent months after he returned from the United States March 29,
according to the results of a recent public opinion survey.
Meanwhile, Chen's public approval rating has been hovering at around
just 20 percent, but his disapproval rating fell after the Chen-Ma
meeting.</P>

his campaign platform on environmentally friendly funeral services
that include tree burials, ash-spreading burials and sea burials.</P>

      <P>Bones from existing cemeteries will be placed in the two

said.</P>
      <P>He also proposed building what are known in Taiwan as "five-star
funeral homes" that offer professional funeral services so that the
bereaved do not have to make the arrangements themselves.</P>
      <P>"We're not encouraging luxurious and extravagant funeral
services. Rather, we would like to see such services rendered in good
order and in a dignified manner," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>These two proposals are aimed at "modernizing" Taiwan's funeral
and burial traditions, bringing them more into conformity with
"green" concepts that include respecting the dignity of life, he
added.</P>
      <P>With regard to reports that some funeral homes are competing so
furiously with each other for business that they are damaging the
interests of bereaved families, Yeh said he will put forth a reform
program centered on improving the business environment.</P>

      <P>Taiwan exported US$1.02 billion-worth of
products and services to South Korea between Jan. 1 and Feb. 28 this
year, up 27 percent over the year-earlier level, the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the latest MOEA tallies, the amount of Taiwan's

to US$30.59 billion, representing a growth of 14 percent and 15.3
percent, respectively, over the figures posted in the same period of
2005.</P>
      <P>As a result, the country secured a trade surplus of US$1.73
billion in the first two months of this year, marking a decline of
US$90 million from the year-earlier level, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>As the result of spiraling crude oil prices and Taiwan's soaring
imports, Taiwan's two-way trade posted a deficit of US$600 million in
February -- the first of its kind in 13 months, the officials said.</P>
      <P>China and Hong Kong as a whole remained the largest export outlet
for Taiwan in the two-month period, accounting for 38.9 percent of
Taiwan's exports, while Japan was the largest import source for
Taiwan in the same period, supplying 23.1 percent of Taiwan's
imports.</P>
      <P>While the exports to South Korea marked the greatest growth in
Taiwan's export trade to the world, the imports from the six
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries --
Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam
-- marked the greatest growth in all imports from around the world in
the period.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imported US$3.516 billion-worth of products and services

    <HEADLINE>STATE PROSECUTOR-GENERAL NOMINEE SHOULD BE CONFIRMED: DPP CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  5  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The state public prosecutor-general
nominated by President Chen Shui-bian should be approved by the
Legislative Yuan next week, a caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming said Hsieh Wen-ting has excellent capability,
integrity and credentials and that he is sure the nominee will get
support from legislators across the party spectrum when the
legislature meets to screen his nomination next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the DPP,
said the party's legislative caucus "currently supports Hsieh's
nomination."</P>
      <P>David Huang, a TSU legislative whip, said Hsieh has every
qualification needed by a state public prosecutor-general, citing his
integrity, professionalism, credentials, administrative neutrality
and resolve.</P>
      <P>Hsieh is "impeccable" in every aspect, Huang said, adding that
the TSU legislative caucus will give him full support but will
continue to monitor him.</P>
      <P>But the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party were not so
affirmative in their endorsements.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, a KMT whip in the legislature, said the legislative
caucus will meet next Monday to discuss Hsieh's confirmation.</P>
      <P>Pan noted that society has high expectations of the first state
public prosecutor-general to be appointed under new
regulations to independently exercise his power to probe
possible corruption of high-ranking officials, including the
president and heads of the five branches of the government. The
legislative caucus has to discuss the matter cautiously, she added.</P>
      <P>Pan agreed that Hsieh's qualifications are good, but added that
whether he can resist partisan or political pressure remains to be
seen.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, a legislative caucus whip of the People First
Party, said the party will have to discuss Hsieh's confirmation prior
to the screening next Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lu said the party has no problem with Hsieh's "qualifications or
integrity, " but will have to listen to the views of the caucus
members before making a final decision.</P>
      <P>The legislature passed a revised law early this year that offers
legislators a say in the appointment of the state public
prosecutor-general and allows for the establishment of a special
investigation division under the Supreme Prosecutors Office to look
into corruption cases involving high-ranking officials.</P>
      <P>Prior to the revisions, the president had full authority to
appoint the nation's top prosecutor. Under the revised law, the
president's nomination now requires the legislature's confirmation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A "u-Taiwan" project, aimed at developing a
ubiquitous network society, is expected to boost the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) to more than NT$16 trillion (US$492.76
billion) by 2010, the Institute for Information Industry (III) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the III, the "u-Taiwan" project is built upon the
framework established under the "e-Taiwan" and "m-Taiwan" projects.</P>
      <P>Under the "u-Taiwan" project, the government will increase its
investment in public infrastructure to advance the development of new
hardware such as second-generation handheld devices and telematics,
which will sustain the growth of the country's information and
communications industry, the III said.</P>
      <P>The institute pointed out that similar projects are also being
carried out in Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government has predicted that its "u-Japan" project
will help expand the Japan market for network-related products to
NT$26.3 trillion in 2010 and will create a combined production value
of NT$36.2 trillion for the home electrical appliance, ubiquitous
network, manufacturing, transportation, financial and insurance
industries, according to the III.</P>
      <P>By 2010, the "u-Japan" project is expected to have created direct
production valued at NT$134.7 trillion and indirect production valued
at NT$183.3 trillion, it added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The cost of Taiwan's crude oil imports,
worth some US$4.049 billion between Jan. 1 and Feb. 28 this year, saw
a whopping increase of 119.6 percent over the year-earlier level as a
result of spiraling crude oil prices, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Crude oil imports constituted 13.2 percent of Taiwan's import
trade in the January-February period as the second-largest import
item, second only to the import of electronic products, which
accounted for 19.3 percent of Taiwan's import trade in the two-month
period with a value of US$5.905 billion, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's imports of capital goods as a whole, including machinery
and aircraft, amounted to US$5.041 billion in the first two months,
marking a decline of 9.5 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to the latest MOEA tallies, Taiwan exported
US$8.792 billion-worth of electronic products in the January-February
period, marking growth of 26.6 percent over the figure posted in the
same period of 2005. The figure also constituted 27.2 percent of
Taiwan's export trade in the period, making electronic products the
country's major foreign exchange earner.</P>
      <P>Exports of optoelectronic products totaled US$2.816 billion in
the first two months, up 87.6 percent over the year-earlier level,
while exports of electrical machinery amounted to US$1.782 billion,
up 36.8 percent, MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, they added, exports of information technology and
telecommunications products, iron, steel and related products
declined in the January-February period compared with the figures
posted in the same period of 2005.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA tallies, the amount of Taiwan's foreign
trade stood at US$62.9 billion in the January-February period, with
exports totaling US$32.31 billion and imports amounting to US$30.59
billion, representing growth of 14 percent and 15.3 percent,
respectively, over the figures posted in the same period of 2005.</P>
      <P>As a result, the country secured a trade surplus of US$1.73
billion in the first two months of this year, which was a decline of
US$90 million from the year-earlier level, MOEA officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO RUSH TO ACCEPT 'RESPECTIVE EXPLANATIONS' OF 'ONE CHINA': DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  5  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) might "respect" and "acknowledge" the "1992
consensus" broached by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), but this
does not mean that it will "accept" it until the DPP has made a final
decision on the issue, DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks during a meeting with local reporters who
questioned him about a claim made by President Chen Shui-bian during
an April 3 meeting with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou that he would
respect the so-called "1992 consensus, with respective
interpretations of 'one China, '" if the Communist Party of China
(CPC) proclaims that it also recognizes the "respective
interpretations" attached to the "one China" precondition.</P>
      <P>Demanding that the KMT first check with the CPC to make sure that
the "separate interpretations of one China" agreement really did
exist in the so-called "1992 consensus" and whether the CPC accepts
it, Tsai said that the KMT has the responsibility to verify the issue
-- the conclusion of a 1992 meeting that then ruling KMT government
officials said that they had reached with their Chinese counterparts
in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Tsai argued that there is no need for the DPP to decide whether
to accept the "separate interpretations of 'one China, '" as China
has yet to recognize the agreement.</P>
      <P>Chen's clarification of his stance toward the "separate
interpretations of 'one China'" statement during his Monday meeting
with Ma has touched a delicate nerve within the pro-independence DPP.</P>
      <P>It was reported that leaders from the DPP's various factions
asked DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun during a Tuesday meeting what the
president meant by using the word "respect" in that context.</P>
      <P>According to a Beijing dispatched story published Wednesday by
the Singapore-based Lianhe Zaobao, Chinese academics familiar with
cross-Taiwan Strait relations said that Beijing had already given
tacit consent to the "respective explanations of 'one China'"
agreement -- which they claimed is the so-called "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>A 1993 meeting between the leaders of the Taipei-based Straits
Exchange Foundation and the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait was held in Singapore upon the basis of that
agreement, the Chinese scholars said, adding that Chinese President
Hu Jintao's meetings last year in Beijing with then KMT Chairman Lien
Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong were also conducted
based on that agreement.</P>
      <P>But they predicted that Beijing will not respond to Chen's most
recent challenge.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-SOUTH KOREA ECONOMIC RACE TAKES NEW TWIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The economic race between Taiwan and South
Korea took a new twist in 2005, with South Korea overtaking Taiwan in
per capita gross domestic product (GDP) for the first time.</P>
      <P>While government officials hastily attributed the change mainly
to a greater appreciation of the Korean won against the U.S. dollar
compared to the rise in the new Taiwan dollar's exchange rate with
the greenback during the year, local economists said the government
should not overlook South Korea's rapid economic growth and should
instead work out effective strategies to catch up.</P>
      <P>According to a recent statistical report issued by the Bank of
Korea (BOK), South Korea's economic growth rate was roughly estimated
at 4 percent for 2005, slightly lower than the 4.7 percent registered
in 2004. Nevertheless, its per capita GDP reached US$16,291, marking
an impressive 14.8 percent year-on-year increase.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Taiwan's per capita GDP amounted to US$15,271 in
2005, up 7 percent from the previous year's level but going from
about US$100 ahead of South Korea in terms of per capita GDP in 2004
to falling behind by US$1,020.</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, said a major reason for the reversal lies in the
fluctuation of currency exchange rates. In 2005, the Korean won
appreciated 11.8 percent against the greenback, while the new Taiwan
dollar rose a mere 3.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Hu said currency exchange rate changes have nothing to do with a
country's competitiveness and only reflect international capital
movement during a specific period. Therefore, he said, it might be
too soon to conclude that Taiwan has lost its economic race with
South Korea based solely on figures for a single year.</P>
      <P>"We need to have a broader perspective when making a judgment, "
he argued.</P>
      <P>Nonetheless, Hu acknowledged that South Korea is a respectable
competitor judging from its shinning economic development and trade
performance.</P>
      <P>Noting that major international economic institutions tend to use
purchasing power parity (PPP) to measure a country's per capita GDP,
Hu said such a measurement, which excludes inflation and currency
fluctuation rates, can more accurately gauge per capita national
income and general living standards.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics compiled by the Swiss International Institute
of Management and Development (IMD) , Hu said Taiwan's PPP-based per
capita GDP reached US$24,676 in 2004, far higher than South Korea's
US$18,686.</P>
      <P>In 2005, Hu said, Taiwan's economic growth rate was slightly
higher than South Korea's while its 2.3 percent inflation rate was
lower than South Korea's 2.8 percent. Against this backdrop, Hu said
he believes Taiwan will continue to lead South Korea in terms of
PPP-based per capita GDP, indicating that Taiwanese people enjoy a
higher living standard than South Koreans.</P>
      <P>Liang Kuo-yuan, director of the private think tank Polaris
Research Institute, said the won's appreciation was only one of the
reasons behind South Korea's overtaking Taiwan in per capita GDP in
2005.</P>
      <P>"We cannot ignore South Korea's robust economic growth potential.
In the wake of the 1997-98 Asian economic fiasco, South Korea's per
capita GDP once dropped to US$7,400, but the country has managed to
regain momentum and emerge as a new economic power and even surpass
Taiwan following a series of sweeping economic reforms. It's true
that within the South Korean economy lurks some problems, such as
unbalanced development. But we cannot afford to overlook the vitality
of its growth," Liang said.</P>
      <P>Judging from the growth in Taiwan's labor force and labor
productivity, Liang said Taiwan's annual economic growth rate should
have been able to reach 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>"However, we were unable to attain that level of growth because
of our failure to catch some good growth opportunities, " Liang
lamented, ascribing Taiwan's slower-than-expected economic growth
rates in recent years to a number of factors, including policy
vacillation, the political standoff between ruling and opposition
camps and a conservative policy toward cross-Taiwan Strait commercial
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chu Yun-peng, head of National Central University's Taiwan
Economic Development Research Center, echoed Liang's view, saying
that South Korea has scored enormous success in product branding,
global marketing and control of key components.</P>
      <P>"South Korea has emerged as the second largest source of Taiwan's
trade deficit after Japan. I'm not surprised by its overtaking Taiwan
in terms of per capita GDP in 2005. With South Korea's towering
ambition, I think that country is likely to surpass Taiwan even in
terms of PPP-based per capita GDP in the near future, " Chu said,
adding that the government should not be complacent with a moderate
growth and should map out forward-looking economic development policy
to accelerate growth.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BETEL NUT TAX SHOULD BE AT LEAST NT$0.1 PER NUT: ACADEMIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the government is to impose a betel nut
tax, it should be at least NT$0.1 per nut, an academic said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chou-lun, an associate professor at China Medical University,
gave the figure in his report, "An estimate on a reasonable tax
on betel nuts based on medical losses."</P>
      <P>Concerned by the fact that the habit of betel nut chewing has
been identified as a major factor behind the development of oral
cancer, the DOH is mulling levying a tax on betel nuts. The DOH's
Bureau of Health Promotion commissioned Lee for the study.</P>
      <P>If the DOH has its way, it is estimated an additional tax revenue
of NT$3.5 billion will go into the nation's coffers, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Lee's study compared 3,000 people, including those who chew 
betel nuts but have not developed cancer and those who do not chew
them. The in- and out-patient records between 1998 and 2004 showed
that for every betel nut chewed, medical expenditures
increase NT$0.1.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that his estimate was based on those who chew betel
nuts but have not developed cancer. For those who have already
developed cancer, the medical expenditures must be even higher, he
said. For this reason, the betel nut tax should be at least
NT$0.1.</P>
      <P>Judging from the fact that on average, people chew betel
nuts for 15 years, during which they consume around 130,000 betel
nuts based on an estimate of 24 per day. So betel nut chewers will
have to pay an extra NT$72 per month on average, he said.</P>
      <P>He said that if a betel nut tax is imposed, it could generate an
additional NT$3.54 billion in tax revenue, or one percent of
national health insurance spending.</P>
      <P>If national health insurance spending of around NT$986 million
over five years on oral, larynx and esophageal cancers -- which are
all related to betel nut chewing -- are also included, it will ease
the financial burden on the national health insurance system.</P>
      <P>In addition, after levying betel nut tax for one year, Lee
estimated that it would cut down the incidence of betel nut chewing
by 1.33 percent, saving around NT$600 million in medical costs.</P>
      <P>Although Lee has proposed an estimate of NT$0.1 in tax
per betel nut, the Bureau of Health Promotion said it has not
yet set a date for imposing the tax.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said they will first focus on regulating betel
nut marketing, formulating legislation, conducting inter-agency
coordination as well as stepping up a public awareness campaign on
the dangers of betel nut chewing before talking about imposing a
betel nut tax.</P>

Wednesday.</P>
      <P>But the direct links issue cannot be resolved in only one
conference, the official said, adding that it will require
negotiations with China.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the conference on Taiwan's sustainable

social security system, enhancing its long-term economic
competitiveness and outlining its global marketing and cross-strait
trade strategies.</P>
      <P>The conference will discuss Taiwan's economic development within
a structure of globalization and considering the influence of the
China factor.</P>
      <P>According to the official, preparations for the conference will

passengers, Ting said the government should focus on preparations for
opening scheduled flights across the Taiwan Strait to benefit a large
number of Taiwan people with business interests in China.</P>
      <P>Ting also suggested that the Cabinet unveil a timetable for
opening direct cross-strait air links to speed up the realization of
that goal.</P>
      <P>"The business sector has long been pushing for opening regular
direct cross-strait flight services to facilitate a revamp of the
local economy. The government should not drag its foot for
ideological cause. Otherwise, Taiwan might lose its chips in
negotiations with China and been marginalized eventually amid the
current wave of global economic integration," Ting said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang denied reports that
the Cabinet would discuss a plan for "opening frequent direct
cross-strait chartered flights" at the planned economic
"sustainability" conference.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the issue regarding cross-strait chartered flights
cannot be decided unilaterally by Taiwan. "We must first forge a
cross-party consensus and then negotiate with China, " Cheng said,
adding that it's premature to go into any detail about the
cross-strait chartered flight plan.</P>

      <P>A conference on Taiwan's sustainable
economic growth to be held between May and June this year will
discuss the issue of direct trade, mail and transportation links with
China -- commonly known as "three links, " a government official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>But the direct links issue cannot be resolved in only one
conference, the official said, adding that it will require
negotiations with China.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the conference on Taiwan's sustainable

social security system, enhancing its long-term economic
competitiveness and outlining its global marketing and cross-strait
trade strategies.</P>
      <P>The conference will discuss Taiwan's economic development within
a structure of globalization and considering the influence of the
China factor.</P>
      <P>According to the official, preparations for the conference will
be divided into several stages. The first part will take place April
6-17, in which government departments will discuss amongst themselves
the issues that will be brought up at the conference.</P>
      <P>In the second stage, scheduled for April 17-May 5, preparations
will focus on mapping out conference operational rules and the roster

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although there may be some delays in
progress toward the holding of talks between Taiwan and the United
States on the establishment of a free trade agreement (FTA) , the
government will continue to do its best to push for the holding of
such talks, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Local media reported Thursday the United States will not hold FTA
talks with Taiwan in the near future and quoted Assistant U.S. Trade
Representative for China Affairs Timothy P. Stratford as saying that
the U.S. business community is not actively pushing the government to
discuss a free trade pact with Taiwan and that the U.S. government
does not have extra staff to deal with this issue at the moment.</P>
      <P>"Negotiations on a major issue may slow down or may have some
delays at some stage, but there is no reason that we should give up
after encountering some difficulties if we are very clear about what
our goal is," ministry spokesman Michel Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the difficulties Taiwan is facing now lie in U.S.
administrative procedures, as the U.S. government may have
difficulties finding time to deal with this issue. However, he added
that there is no need for pessimism and that the government will
continue with its efforts.</P>
      <P>He further said that many heavyweight U.S. politicians are also
urging the Bush administration to hold FTA talks with Taiwan as soon
as possible, adding that such an agreement would be beneficial to
both parties as well as to U.S.-Taiwan bilateral ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE IN RUSSIA URGED TO AVOID SKINHEADS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese visiting or residing in Russia
have been cautioned to avoid local skinheads, an official of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Ching-yuan, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs'
West Asian Affairs Department, said that the country's representative
office in Moscow has advised Taiwanese in that country to be vigilant
about their personal safety following an attack by skinheads on a
Taiwanese student residing in St. Petersburg. The student, surnamed
Chen, was not seriously injured in the attack.</P>
      <P>Tseng said skinheads are radical groups in Russia who do not
welcome the presence of foreigners. Most skinheads are
street-wandering youngsters wearing leather jackets who attack
foreigners, but they mostly do not belong to any specific gang.</P>
      <P>He said the U.S. ambassador to Russia and other countries'
diplomatic envoys jointly expressed their concern to the Russian
foreign ministry in 2004 about skinheads' xenophobic behavior which
poses a threat to foreigners.</P>
      <P>The skinhead problem seemed then to be milder in Moscow following
Russian police's frequent patrols, but they sometimes still attack
foreigners in other cities, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>He added that as Adolf Hitler's birth anniversary falls on April
20 and Vladimir Lenin's falls on April 22, skinhead activities are
more frequent during this month.</P>

Thursday. Cheng has offered to resign over the incident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEEP-SEA WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT TO COMMENCE THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A project for the commercial development of
Taiwan's deep-sea water resources will begin this year under the
guidance of the Council of Agriculture (COA) , COA Minister Su
Jia-chyuan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Su said that the COA
plans to spend some NT$900 million (US$27.7 million) on the research
and development of deep-sea water resources over four years beginning
this year.</P>
      <P>Su said the deep-sea regions in Taiwan's exclusive economic zone
off the island's east coast can be used to cultivate high-value
fishery products by taking advantage of the waters' cleanliness, low
temperatures, and richness in minerals and other valuable substances.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in response to a question raised by
opposition Kuomintang Legislator Huang Chien-ting who inquired about
the Taitung branch of the COA-sponsored National Aquatic Germplasm
Center's work progress. The deep-sea water development project is the
centerpiece of the Taitung branch's operations.</P>
      <P>Huang said that Taiwan, like Japan, is surrounded by waters that
provide convenient and economic opportunities for the sustainable
development of environmentally-friendly products.</P>
      <P>He noted that Japan's deep-sea water resources contributed 600
billion yen (US$5.1 billion) to the country's economy in 2003, with
products ranging from beer and cosmetics to nutritional food
supplements and medicines.</P>
      <P>Experts have estimated that Taiwan could also produce NT$80
billion (US$2.46 billion) to NT$100 billion worth of similar products
a year by developing and exploiting its deep-sea water resources,
Huang said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 6 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Pan-green" political parties Thursday gave
Judicial Yuan Vice President Cheng Chun-mo high marks for resigning
over a suspected extramarital affair while "pan-blue" parties
demanded that he apologize for lying.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who is also a grand justice, offered to resign from the
two posts after the media widely reported that he and a woman
professor went to a motel in suburban Taipei together and stayed for
more than an hour on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he decided to quit the posts because his private
social life had been "exaggerated" to the extent that the dignity of
judicial authorities has been seriously jeopardized.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) legislative
caucus lauded Cheng for "having courageously admitted to mistakes and
shouldered responsibility by resigning."</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun, caucus secretary-general, said Cheng might have
acted imperfectly by failing to admit his wrongdoing at the earliest
possible time.</P>
      <P>After all, he has resigned, Chen said, urging the public not to
interfere too aggressively in Cheng's privacy.</P>
      <P>Because a grand justice is expected to be "absolutely loyal like
a queen to her king, " Cheng should explain in detail what really
happened on Sunday when he and the reported woman were together, said
the DPP politician.</P>
      <P>"Our society simply cannot tolerate a grand justice telling
lies," he added.</P>
      <P>The DPP's "pan-green camp" ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU), praised Cheng for having "made the wisest choice" by quitting
the two critically important public offices.</P>
      <P>"A grand justice must demand the highest moral requirements of
himself," said Huang Shih-chuo, TSU legislative caucus convener, who
noted that the alleged motel affair was not a legal incident, but a
moral one.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party (PFP) were not so generous with their comments
on Cheng's decision to step down, with the KMT demanding that the
council of grand justices investigate whether Cheng had acted
improperly or lied, or both.</P>
      <P>Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng should apologize to the
public for one of the grand justices having acted improperly, and
Cheng himself owes the public an apology for having lied, said Pan
Wei-kang, secretary-general of the KMT's legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>Pan's deputy, Lei Chien, called on people to express their
concern about who will replace Cheng as a grand justice, an important
post that she said should never become a political tool.</P>
      <P>The PFP's legislative caucus claimed that Cheng's behavior has
shown he's no longer fit for the post of grand justice, who is a
"guardian deity of the Constitution" and whose moral integrity must
be impeccable.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun, PFP legislative caucus secretary-general, said
Cheng probably lied when he said his female companion needed to stop
at a motel to use the toilet since there were many gas stations and
shopping malls along the way.</P>

      <P>A Shanghai fruit trading company announced
Thursday that it has placed an order for 20,000 kilograms of produce
from farmers in Changhua, central Taiwan, claiming that fruit grown
here is of a superior quality.</P>
      <P>The fruit order consists principally of guava and starfruit. Lin
Chih-hung, manager of the Shanghai-based Chi-Koo company that placed
the order, said Taiwanese fruit consistently fetches a high price in
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Lin said Shanghai consumers aggressively demand Taiwanese
starfruit and guava because it tastes better than the fruit grown in
China. Plus, he added, selling fruit to China will augment the income
of Taiwanese farmers.</P>
      <P>Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan, said there have been
difficulties in exporting Taiwanese fruit to China in the past
because there hasn't been a proper distribution channel in place.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese fruit is directly delivered to their Chinese clientele,
Lin said, also adding that the company's customers are mostly at the
top of the social ladder.</P>
      <P>Lin added that Chinese consumers no longer desire Chinese fruit
once they have taken a bite of those grown in Taiwan, because fruit
from across the Taiwan Strait is sweeter and juicier.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Judicial Yuan Vice President Cheng
Chung-mo, who doubles as a grand justice, denied media reports
alleging he was having an extramarital affair with a young woman as
he offered to resign from both posts Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a statement, Cheng said the exaggeration of his personal
social life by the media has "seriously undermined the reputation of
the judiciary."</P>
      <P>Cheng apologized to the officials who had nominated him, to
legislators who had endorsed his nomination and to all those who have
supported him.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the move amid legislators' calls for his resignation,
following reports that he took a woman to a motel in Wuku, Taipei
County Sunday and stayed there for 70 minutes. The woman was
identified by local media as 38-year-old Wang Mei-hsin, an assistant
professor at the Graduate School of Science and Technology Law at
National Yunlin University of Science and Technology.</P>
      <P>Cheng claimed Wednesday that he and Wang had visited the motel to
use the toilet because Wang had felt sick to her stomach.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he had met Wang at her residence that day to offer
assistance on some legal issues, and later drove her to a
biotechnology center in Taipei City to submit materials concerning
her job application at the center.</P>
      <P>After that, Cheng said, Wang suggested they go for a joyride,
which was the reason they ended up in Wuku.</P>
      <P>However, Chang Kuo-hua, director of the graduate institute where
Wang teaches, told media on the same day that Wang had denied she
went to the motel with Cheng Sunday.</P>
      <P>Local media described Cheng's clarification as being "full of
suspicions" and said the details were "in violation of common sense,"
and accused Cheng of lying about the matter.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held on the incident Thursday, Cheng
stressed that he would not lie to anyone and that "honesty" was his
family's guiding principle.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he was surprised at the media reports and wondered if
Taiwan's society had "fallen ill."</P>
      <P>Claiming that he had offered to help Wang because he thinks she
is talented and can contribute to the country's bio-tech sector,
Cheng said he could not understand why such a simple matter would
have become so complicated.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Wang called for an end to what she called
"rumor-mongering."</P>
      <P>Noting that there are "different versions of the incident in

    <HEADLINE>BUDGET FREEZE ON ABORIGINAL TV LIFTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A freeze on the Aboriginal Television
Channel's annual budget imposed in January by the
opposition-controlled legislature was lifted Thursday.</P>
      <P>The end of the freeze was apparently a great relief not just for
the station's employees, but also for Walis Pelin, minister of the
Council of Indigenous Peoples, who warned several days ago that the
channel would be put out of business by the end of May if the freeze
were not lifted soon.</P>
      <P>Also, aboriginal Legislator Kao-Chin Su-mei questioned the
fairness of the Hakka Television Channel receiving a much higher
annual budget than Aboriginal TV.</P>
      <P>Kao-Chin also questioned the appropriateness of giving Aboriginal
TV's annual budget to the private Eastern Multimedia Group, which in
turn produces all programs aired by Aboriginal TV.</P>
      <P>Kao-Chin demanded that the Council of Indigenous Peoples come up
with a plan to help secure Aboriginal TV's independence. Otherwise,
she said, the channel should be disbanded and its annual budget
should be used to hire another station to produce better programs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Chen Hsiu-hui from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party said that the best policy to allow Aboriginal TV to
maintain its independence would be to free the channel from the
influence of legislators. Chen said there has been too much
influence-peddling by legislators seeking to pressure the station
into employing their friends, relatives and supporters.</P>
      <P>The freeze on two other budget items concerning the Council of
Indigenous Peoples -- the budget for the building and maintenance of
37 aboriginal museums islandwide and the budget for the development
of modern aboriginal communities -- were also lifted during the
session of the Legislative Yuan Home and Nations Committee Thursday.</P>
      <P>Later in the session, a proposal submitted by seven members of
the Home and Nations Committee also passed into a resolution
demanding the Executive Yuan use the Second Reserve Fund to beef up
the Council of Indigenous Peoples's annual budget so that the
council's budget can be on par with that of the Hakka Television
Channel.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE SPEAKER OPEN TO 'TWO-IN-ONE' ELECTION PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Thursday that he is open to a proposal by the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) on holding the December 2007 legislative election
and the March 2008 presidential election simultaneously if a
consensus is built on the issue between ruling and opposition camps.</P>
      <P>The proposal seems beneficial to the KMT, which gained seats over
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in the "three-in-one"
local elections late last year, but the DPP's attitude will be key in
whether the proposal can be put into practice, Wang told reporters.</P>
      <P>Wang added that he would throw his support behind the proposal
should both ruling and opposition parties back the idea. It is
important that such a proposal, based upon a social consensus, is
allowed to really help the country reduce waste and lower the risk of
social disorder, he said, noting that the nation's overall interests
should take precedence over partisan gains.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang called for support from
the various major political parties on grounds that holding the two
elections simultaneously will help save spending and social
resources.</P>
      <P>The "two-in-one" election proposal will benefit the entire nation
rather than just the KMT, she claimed, opining that doing so will
also coincide with the DPP's stance in favor of holding fewer
elections to avoid wasting resources.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Wu Yu-sheng, who initiated the proposal, said that
both President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu have
publicly called for a reduction in the number of elections. It is
an issue that meets the public's expectations while being consistent
with the DPP's stance, he argued.</P>
      <P>Admitting that combining the legislative and presidential
elections would be more beneficial to the KMT, Wu said that it is not
the key point in this case and stressed that it is unfair to target
the KMT when discussing the issue.</P>
      <P>He urged the ruling DPP to support his proposal as the KMT did in
backing former Premier Frank Hsieh's idea of holding the
"three-in-one" local elections late last year.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Chen Chin-jun responded later in
a news conference he called at the Legislative Yuan that President
Chen, if backed by public consensus, would "respect" and "cooperate"
on the "two-in-one election" proposal in the interest of the nation's
long-term development.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, DPP members remain sharply divided over the
issue at the present time.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, a People First Party (PFP) legislative caucus
whip, said that his party is not opposed to establishing a sound
election system that is in line with the Constitution, but called for
greater caution.</P>
      <P>Lu questioned whether in the future, the president should also
step down if he dissolved the Legislative Yuan -- Taiwan's
parliament.
</P>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union legislative caucus whip David Huang said
that he suspected the KMT's initiative was aimed at expanding its
voter base.</P>
      <P>Huang said that it would be meaningless if it were necessary to
hold a snap parliamentarian election should the president dissolve
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The KMT's "two-in-one" election proposal is merely an
electioneering strategy which he said was useless in helping build a
healthy constitutional system.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times:
Fossil Called Missing Link From Sea to Land
Animals 

Scientists have discovered fossils of a 375-
million-year-old fish, a large scaly creature
not seen before, that they say is a long-sought 
missing link in the evolution of some fishes
from water to a life walking on four limbs on
land. In two reports today in the journal
Nature, a team of scientists led by Neil H.
Shubin of the University of Chicago say they
have uncovered several well-preserved skeletons
of the fossil fish in sediments of former
streambeds in the Canadian Arctic, 600 miles
from the North Pole. The skeletons have the
fins, scales and other attributes of a giant
fish, four to nine feet long. But on closer
examination, the scientists found telling
anatomical traits of a transitional creature, a
fish that is still a fish but has changes that
anticipate the emergence of land animals -- and
is thus a predecessor of amphibians, reptiles
and dinosaurs, mammals and eventually humans.

Wall Street Journal: Higher Learning In
Religion Studies, Universities Bend To Views
of Faithful

In 1993, the Mormon church excommunicated D.
Michael Quinn, one of the world's foremost
authorities on the faith, whose writings had
frequently contradicted the church's traditional
history. Although Mormon studies is a
fast-growing academic discipline, Quinn -- a
former professor at Mormon-run Brigham Young
University and the author of six books on Mormon
history -- can't find a job. Quinn's struggles
reflect the rising influence of religious
groups over the teaching of their faiths at
secular colleges, despite concerns about
academic freedom. U.S. universities have usually
hired religious-studies professors regardless of
whether they practiced or admired the faiths
they researched. But some universities are
bending to the views of private donors and state
legislators by hiring the faithful. Some
professors at the state universities that
rejected Quinn say fear of offending Mormons
played a role. Deans at the universities deny
that.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATION ON SENSITIVE TECHNOLOGY PROTECTION STALLS IN COMMITTEE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  6  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The sensitive scientific technology
protection bill hit a snag in the Legislative Yuan Thursday when a
meeting held by the Sci-Tech and Information Committee to deliberate
the bill failed to make any progress.</P>
      <P>The committee called the meeting to begin clause-by-clause
consideration of the bill, but could not finish its examination of
the language in Clause One because of a volatile debate among
legislators of different political parties who were each sticking to
their strongly held but divergent views.</P>
      <P>As a result, Legislator Lee Jih-chu, a co-convener of the
committee who chaired the meeting, had no choice but to dismiss the
meeting. Lee, of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said she will
try to seek consensus on the bill among the committee members,
beginning by communicating with KMT legislators.</P>
      <P>She said she had thought the draft version of the bill, sponsored
by 56 legislators, would best represent the KMT's stance, but was
surprised when some KMT legislators on the committee expressed
reservations over the legislation.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Yong-ping said that while she does not object
to the legislation, she believes the bill should be considered only
under the premise that it will not affect Taiwan's competitive edge
by triggering fear among Taiwan's industries and prompting them to
move their production bases to China and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Another KMT legislator, Ting Shou-chung, insisted that
consideration of the bill should be suspended. He said the KMT should
not give the people the impression it is assisting the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union, in their attempts to tighten control on Taiwan's economic and
trade relations with China.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are six different versions of the sensitive
scientific technology protection bill, with the one introduced by the
KMT legislative caucus having the largest number of sponsors.</P>
      <P>The bill was first proposed by the Cabinet in April last year in
an attempt to prevent the export of sensitive technologies to China
without government approval after Beijing enacted its Anti-Secession
Law, which provides for the use of force against Taiwan if China
decides Taiwan is moving toward independence.</P>

north.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP PUSHES FOR EARLY IMPLEMENTATION OF 'GOOD HOUSEKEEPING PROJECT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu pushed Thursday
for the early implementation of the "Good Housekeeping Project" so
that qualified housekeepers can be produced via an examination
mechanism to benefit society.</P>
      <P>Addressing a workshop held at the Presidential Office on women's
unemployment and employment services to women, Lu claimed that Taiwan
would be able to import far fewer foreign workers if the Good
Housekeeping Project is carried out quickly and efficiently.</P>
      <P>Lu said housekeeping can be a respectable career with high social
values if the housekeepers are publicly screened via an examination
mechanism and have received professional training.</P>
      <P>Lu said that while a great number of Taiwan families need to hire
housekeepers to help run their families, there are also a great
number of women who need to seek employment to support their
families.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, Lu claimed, the Good Housekeeping
Project -- put forth by her late last year and endorsed by President
Chen Shui-bian -- will serve both needs.</P>
      <P>She said that of Taiwan's 11.2 million female population, about
4.2 million are career women or working women. Of the 4.2 million
working women, 2.05 million have college or higher education. There
are also some 400,000 married couples in Taiwan who are both working
and some 557,000 people who have families with elderly or handicapped
members.</P>
      <P>All these groups of people need the help of housekeepers,
providing at least 1 million job openings for career housekeepers,
according to Lu.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she added, there are some 400,000 women who are not
working after getting married or having children and there are some
560,000 single-parent families, most of them are of the mother-child
composition.</P>
      <P>Members of these groups may need to seek employment working as
housekeepers, she speculated.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official
in charge of Hong Kong affairs urged the Hong Kong authorities
Thursday to open a liaison office in Taipei the sooner the better for
the benefit of the special administrative region's residents.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chih-chung, director of the MAC's Department of Hong Kong
and Macau Affairs, called for the Hong Kong authorities not to impose
any preconditions on the establishment of such an office.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that by establishing an office in Taiwan, the Hong Kong
authorities could better serve its people and engage in closer
exchanges with Taiwan in many sectors, as Taiwan-Hong Kong exchanges
have become increasingly close with more Hong Kong people coming to
Taiwan for tourism or study.</P>
      <P>The number of visits to Hong Kong by Taiwan citizens has
increased year on year, with the figure standing at 2.6 million in
2003, increasing to 3.32 million in 2004 and 3.9 million in 2005,
Tsai said.</P>
      <P>To serve the people of Hong Kong and Macau and to facilitate the
visits to these two regions by Taiwan citizens, the MAC established a
Hong Kong affairs bureau and a Macau affairs bureau -- known as the
Chung Hwa Travel Service in Hong Kong and the Taipei Economic and
Cultural Center in Macau -- several years ago, Tsai added.</P>
      <P>These two agencies are also the Taiwan offices responsible for
handling emergencies, Tsai noted.</P>
      <P>He said the number of emergencies has also risen over the past
three years, with 831 in 2003, soaring to 2,220 in 2004 and 3,092 in
2005.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks in response to an inquiry by a reporter who
quoted an unnamed Hong Kong media outlet as reporting Thursday that
Stephen S.L. Lam, secretary of Hong Kong's Constitutional Affairs
Bureau, has said that Hong Kong will establish a liaison office in
Taiwan only after Taiwan opens direct trade, postal and
transportation links with China, commonly known as the "direct three
links."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WANTS MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION IN WHO: FOREIGN MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> Taipei, April 6 (CAN) Taiwan is striving for "meaningful
participation" in the World Health Organization (WHO), to be included
in the organization's alert and response network and to attend all
professional and technical seminars, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs
Michael Ying-mao Kau said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has made bids to join the WHO over the past decade that
have failed due to China's strong objections. This year, Taiwan
continues to its bid to become an observer in the World Health
Assembly (WHA), the supreme decision-making body for the WHO.</P>
      <P>"The focus this year is meaningful participation in the WHO...
but so far, we have yet to reach meaningful, pragmatic or systematic
participation, " Kau told the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Kau said that if the WHO members respond to Taiwan's intention
for meaningful participation this year, then Taiwan will not push for
a vote on the floor on its application for WHA membership in May, but
if international community shies away from supporting Taiwan, then
Taiwan will again push for a vote.</P>
      <P>Kau defined "meaningful participation" as Taiwan's inclusion in
the WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, a mechanism for
the rapid identification, confirmation and response to outbreaks of
international importance.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan also wants to participate in all WHO professional
and technical seminars. While Taiwan participated in about half of
those seminars in 2005, Kau said the degree of Taiwan's participation
was "not satisfactory." Further, Taiwan also wants to become involved
in events held by WHO's regional offices, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan is still striving for the universal application
of the International Health Regulations, which aim to prevent,
protect against, control and provide a public health response to the
international spread of disease and avoid unnecessary interference
with international traffic and trade.</P>
      <P>Besides "meaningful participation" in the WHO, Kau said, Taiwan
still wants to become an observer in the WHA.</P>
      <P>Kau, who went to Europe last month to seek European countries'
support for Taiwan's membership of the WHO, said that some European
countries are very supportive of Taiwan's stance.</P>
      <P>However, as a diplomat told him that "Europe is an elephant with
25 legs, " Kau said that for the European Union to reach a consensus
on Taiwan's WHO efforts remains a challenge.</P>
      <P>Talking about Taiwan's bid to become a WHA observer this year, he
said the government will adopt a "strong and positive" approach.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan continues to be a good boy, then others would continue
to take us for granted, and we get nowhere, " Kau said. He said the
government this year is considering setting up balloons with strong
slogans above the WHO secretariat to attract attention and embarrass
the WHO.</P>

      <P>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael
Ying-mao Kau said Thursday that the status quo in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations is dynamic rather than unchangeable, and that good
relations will only come with efforts from both sides.</P>
      <P>Kau noted that China has increased the number of missiles aimed
at Taiwan from 200 to 800, while Taiwan has changed from an
authoritarian regime to a democratic one.</P>
      <P>"The concept of maintaining status quo is wrong -- we should be
maintaining peace and stability and that is a more concrete way to
phrase it, " he said during an interview with the Central News
Agency.</P>
      <P>Kau said the international community should not bow to China just
because they want to invest there and should not over-appease China.
Using Hitler as an example, he said that if the international
community had stood firm against Hitler in the 1930s, World War II
might not have broken out.</P>
      <P>He said that China is a rising powerhouse and that it is the
responsibility of the international community to guide China to
become a peaceful country.</P>
      <P>Asked about the National Unification Council issue, Kau said the
government should not make policies to limit the people's choices and
that the choice of unification or independence is up to the people.</P>
      <P>"We need to be pragmatic -- we cannot provoke China and affect
peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and we cannot sacrifice
Taiwan's democracy, " said Kau, who went to Europe last month to
explain Taiwan's stance on the issue.</P>
      <P>Kau pointed out that European Union has a different footing from
Taiwan and that it wants Taiwan and China to get along with each
other and avoid provocation, although it also understands that good
relations will come only with efforts from both sides.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) rose
0.41 percent in March over the same period last year, with the
year-on-year CPI increase amounting to 1.35 percent in the first
quarter of 2006, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and

according to the DGBAS.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said the inflation rate of 0.41 percent in March
is the lowest single-month level since February 2004, mainly due to
the decline in vegetable and fruit prices.</P>
      <P>In 2005, the inflation rate climbed 2.3 percent, the highest
level over the last five years, owing to skyrocketing vegetable
and fruit prices as a result of crop damages caused by a string of
typhoons that blew through Taiwan between July and September last
year.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS forecast the CPI will pick up 1.7 percent for the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has approved
Judicial Yuan Vice President Cheng Chung-mo's resignation over a
suspected extramarital affair, a Presidential Office spokesman said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who doubles as a grand justice, offered to resign from the
two posts earlier in the day after the media widely reported that he
and a woman professor went to a motel in suburban Taipei together and
stayed there for more than an hour on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng immediately forwarded
Cheng's resignation letter to Chen, who approved the resignation,
said Lee Nan-yang, director of the Presidential Office's Public
Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Lee said Chen had yet to decide whether to name a candidate to
fill the posts left vacant by Cheng's resignation.</P>
      <P>Under current constitutional provisions, only grand justices are
eligible to serve as Judicial Yuan president or vice president and
the president can only appoint a grand justice with the consent of
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>As the Judicial Yuan Organic Law does not prescribe that
vacancies in the Judicial Yuan vice president and grand justice
roster must be filled, Lee said Chen is still mulling whether to come
up with a grand justice nominee for legislative confirmation or just
to select a candidate from among the 13 incumbent grand justices to
serve as Judicial Yuan vice president.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEVEL OF TAIWAN FOREX RESERVES SOUND: ECONOMIST</HEADLINE>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan does not sit on top of the
world's highest level of foreign exchange reserves, the size of the
country's forex reserves remains sound, according to a local
economist.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan's forex reserves have been amassing
at a slower pace in recent years as a result of a decreasing trade
surplus and a steady but not drastic capital outflow due to
investment overseas, the country still holds a relatively high amount
of forex reserves, said Chu Hao-min, a professor at National Chengchi
University.</P>
      <P>Chu opined that Taiwan's forex reserves will remain relatively
stable as long as the country's current account and capital account
do not show large amounts of capital outflows.</P>
      <P>According to statistics made public by Taiwan's Central Bank of
China (CBC) early this week, Taiwan holds the world's third largest
amount -- US$257.05 billion -- in forex reserves as of the end of
March, coming after only China and Japan. The figure represents a
slight growth of US$72 million over the February level.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Perng Fei-nan has said that Taiwan's forex reserves
remain at a sound level even compared with China's in view of the
sharp difference in size of the two country's economies.</P>

(By Lin Yu-li and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative in
Denmark gave a batch of woodball game equipment to the national
athletic and sports committee of Denmark Thursday to help promote the
sport in the Scandinavian country.</P>
      <P>Chang Ping-nan presented the gift -- including 50 9.5 cm-diameter
wooden balls, 50 mallet-shaped clubs, 25 scoring gates and a number
of tee boxes -- to Knud Bjorn, vice chairman of the Danish national
athletic and sports committee during a ceremony held in Copenhagen
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Woodball, which was invented by Taiwan citizen Wong Ming-hui in
1990, has become an internationally known sport following a series of
international competitions being held in Taiwan and abroad over the
past 15 years.</P>
      <P>Bjorn, who visited Taiwan at the invitation of Wong -- chairman
of the Chinese Taipei Woodball Association and the Federation of
International Woodball Associations -- for an international woodball
competition last November, accepted the gift with gratitude.</P>
      <P>Bjorn said during the ceremony that he will see to it that
woodball is promoted in Denmark and that exchanges in other athletic
and sports categories, including gymnastics, between the two
countries will also be enhanced.</P>
      <P>He said the assistance from the Taiwan representative office in
Denmark is essential for boosting bilateral sports exchanges in the

    <HEADLINE>OVERSEAS TAIWANESE MEDICAL GROUP URGES EU TO SUPPORT TAIWAN'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  April 6 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group comprised of Taiwanese medical
workers in Europe called on the European Union Thursday to support
Taiwan's bid to participate as an observer in the World Health
Assembly (WHA) -- the highest decision-making body of the World
Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>During a news conference held in the Belgian capital, leading
members of the European Federation of Taiwan Health Alliance,
including Chang Lian-tze, Lee Hung-yao, Yeh Hsueh-yuan and Huang
Li-teh, asserted that it is unfair for the WHO to exclude Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Taiwan is being blocked from entering the WHO for
political reasons and that the organization should not allow health
issues to be overridden by politics, urging EU nations to help Taiwan
take part as an observer in the next WHA annual meeting slated for
May.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan's exclusion violates the WHO's principle of
universality and also threatens the health of the people of Taiwan
and the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is not a WHO member, it cannot obtain information with
regard to the prevention and control of major infectious diseases,
and even if some countries intend to cooperate with Taiwan, they face
pressure from China, Lee pointed out.</P>
      <P>Even during the SARS outbreak in 2003, Taiwan was not offered any
immediate assistance from the WHO, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Further illustrating the unfair treatment received by Taiwan, Yeh
noted that while Taiwan has so far remained free of H5N1 bird flu
cases, the country was classified as an H5N1-affected area in maps
published by the WHO last month because the WHO considers Taiwan part
of China, where H5N1 cases have been reported.</P>
      <P>Although the European Parliament passed a resolution in 2003
urging the EU nations to support Taiwan's bid to gain observer status
at the WHA, the resolution continues to be ignored by the EU, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>Huang said that in light of the increase in international travel
and economic activities, Taiwan must not be shut out of the world
health system.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's representative to the European Union Chen
Chien-jen said what Taiwan is asking for is to be treated fairly and
reasonably by the world.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's efforts over the past 10 years, the United States
and Japan have openly expressed their support for Taiwan's WHO bid,
while the European Union has become more sympathetic towards Taiwan,
Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Friday to protect
Taiwan's interests at the upcoming economic forum between the KMT and
the Chinese Communist Party to be held in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, director of the DPP Department of Culture and
Information, called for the forum-goers, including KMT Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan and 29 KMT legislators, not to "dwarf Taiwan's
sovereignty" and not to infringe upon the Taiwan government's
administrative authority during talks with the Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>Tsai suggested that the KMT members and lawmakers tell the
Chinese authorities to take back the illegal Chinese immigrants
currently being detained in Taiwan as soon as possible as the
country's three detention centers are overcrowded and cost over
NT$100 million (US$3.08 million) a year to operate.</P>
      <P>Tsai further suggested that the KMT forum-goers ask the Chinese
authorities to apprehend major Taiwan criminals and fugitives in
hiding in China and repatriate them back to Taiwan to face justice.</P>
      <P>The DPP spokesman also suggested that they ask the Beijing
leadership to stop undermining Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization as an observer.</P>
      <P>The KMT-CCP forum is set to be held in Beijing April 14 and may
be followed by a meeting between Lien Chan and Chinese President Hu
Jintao, which would be their second meeting since April last year.</P>
      <P>In addition to 29 KMT lawmakers and a number of KMT party
officials, members of Lien's 60-strong delegation will also include
prominent businesspeople who serve on the KMT Central Standing
Committee, such as Jeffery Koo, chairman of the Chinatrust Financial

    <HEADLINE>BETEL NUT CHEWING RELATED TO UPPER DIGESTIVE TRACT CANCERS:  STUDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Betel nut chewing is not only the leading
cause of oral cancer in Taiwan, it also increases the risk of getting
other forms of cancer, according to the results of the latest study
by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) released Friday.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are around 70,000 new cancer cases reported in
Taiwan every year. Cases related to betel nut chewing account for
between six and eight percent of that total.</P>
      <P>About 30 out of every 100,000 men in Taiwan develop oral cancer,
ranking the country third in the world in this respect. Moreover, the
average age when men with oral cancer pass away is 53, or ten years
younger than men with other forms of cancer.</P>
      <P>The NHRI said that according to its most recent study, carried
out in cooperation with the Kaohsiung Medical University, betel nut
chewing is also linked to pharynx, larynx and asophageal cancers.</P>
      <P>Ker Ying-chin, director of the NHRI's Division of Environmental
Health and Occupational Medicine, said that arecoline, a major
alkaloid found in betel nut, may cause upper digestive tract cancers
such as pharynx, larynx and asophageal cancers.</P>
      <P>The study showed that the risk of betel nut chewers getting
pharynx cancer is 7.7 times greater than that for other people.</P>
      <P>Cigarette smoking and drinking are cited as the leading causes of
larynx cancer and asophageal cancer, with the risks multiplying if
one smokes, drinks and chews betel nuts. The pharynx incidence ratio
increases 96.9 fold, the risk of developing larynx cancer increases
40.3 fold, and the risk of developing asophageal increases 195 fold,
according to the study.</P>
      <P>Ker noted that betel nut chewing over a long period could also
cause liver cancer or sclerosis of the liver. He urged betel nut
chewers to undergo regular oral examinations, adding that the best
thing to do is to give up the habit altogether.</P>

(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should ban poultry slaughter
in traditional markets and accelerate drug and vaccine development
efforts to better prepare Taiwan for a bird flu outbreak, a Taipei
mayoral candidate said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chin-chuan, a former Taipei deputy mayor who resigned from
the post last month in order to focus on running in the year-end
mayoral election, said that bird flu will certainly appear in Taiwan
sooner or later, urging the government to allocate funds for bird flu
prevention measures instead of only allotting funds for relief
purposes.</P>
      <P>"It would be pretty idiotic if the government were only to
reimburse people after bird flu breaks out. It would feel like the
government were spending money to buy coffins for the people and not
spending any money to save patients," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Yeh is a public health expert who made a name for himself during
the SARS outbreak in 2003 when he helped the Taipei City Government
bring the outbreak under control.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to ban the practice of killing live
chickens at traditional food markets and to encourage poultry vendors
to purchase their chickens from professional butcheries instead. He
also suggested that the government reimburse poultry vendors for the
refrigerators, freezers and display equipment they will need to
purchase to make the change.</P>
      <P>He also urged the government to stock up on enough Tamiflu to
treat 10 percent of the population by the end of the year and to
develop vaccines within three years.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed Friday
his promise to render a new constitution for Taiwan that is "timely,
relevant and viable" before his term ends in 2008.</P>
      <P>The president said the idea of drafting a new constitution for
Taiwan was put forth by the late democratic activist Deng Nan-jung
and that he has always kept this idea in mind.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while addressing a ceremony commemorating
the 17th anniversary of the death of Deng, who burned himself to
death in 1989 in protest against the former Kuomintang government's
suppression of freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>According to the president, Deng had proposed many ideas and
objectives to promote democracy and freedom in Taiwan, and the best
way to remember him is to stick to democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>Chen said the movement promoted by Deng to redress the
miscarriage of justice in the 228 Incident, his efforts to uncover
scandals involving the military, as well as his public discussion of
Taiwan independence contributed greatly to the liberation of Taiwan
society.</P>
      <P>There is much room for improvement in the government's efforts to
deal with the heritage of the past authoritarian era, because the
complicated problems accumulated over the past five decades cannot be
solved in a short period of time, he said.</P>
      <P>Despite the challenges, such as the internal disparity over
national identity and China's threat to invade Taiwan, the government
will not give up on its ongoing efforts to deepen the country's
democracy, he said.</P>
      <P>On freedom of speech, the president said that although some
people think that the freedom of speech enjoyed by the people in
Taiwan is excessive in light of the release of some irresponsible
remarks, the government will not compromise in its efforts to allow
100 percent freedom of speech in the country.</P>

      <P>Yen made the remarks in response to media reports that the

rules by allowing local reporters to enter the CKS Airport's control
area Thursday to cover Premier Su Tseng-chang's inspection of an

      <P>According to the new regulations put into practice March 1, all

      <P>Yen said that the ministry is reviewing its regulations on news
coverage at the airport, adding that if it is the government taking
the initiative, or news related to the nation's "major policies or
public interest, " then the government will invite the media to cover

      <P>Yen noted that Thursday's drill was an important training drill
in an effort to keep the disease out of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that the prevention of avian flu is a major policy.

that Taiwan's economic growth will top 4.5 percent this year, while
the unemployment rate will decline to below 4 percent.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Su vowed that his

the economy, improve public order and boost diplomatic relations with
the rest of the world without partiality.</P>
      <P>Su made the vow in response to opposition Kuomintang Legislator
Hsu Shu-po's interpellation. Hsu claimed that despite the
overnment's management policy, Taiwan's economic reliance on China
has become increasingly serious.</P>
      <P>Hsu quoted Bureau of Foreign Trade statistics as indicating that
Taiwan's two-way trade with China increased to the tune of US$57
billion in 2005, a trend he claimed could not be reined back with any
kind of management policy.</P>
      <P>Noting that the economy, social order and diplomacy are
inextricably linked, Hsu lamented that because Taiwan has
continuously been blocked from joining the Association of Southeast

free trade harbor zone partnerships with Japan and South Korea, its
economy has unavoidably been affected and while the domestic economy
has flattened out, public order has also deteriorated.</P>

      <P>A locally made collagen extracted from pig
skin has hit the market and is claimed to be better than imported
collagen, according to a surgeon at the Tri Service General Hospital
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chen Tien-mu, director of the Plastic Surgery Department of

skin strength and elasticity.</P>
      <P>Chen said the home-made collagen, which has already been

than imported products.</P>
      <P>Chen said his department has given the collagen to 49 patients in
the last six months and has found it to be more effective when
injected into the skin than when applied topically or orally.</P>
      <P>Injecting 1 cc of collagen under a wrinkle through a fine needle,
Chen said, will remove even smile lines around the mouth, which are

    <HEADLINE>CPC DEFICIT SOARS AS CRUDE OIL PRICES SPIRAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The deficit of Taiwan's state-run Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) has been deteriorating since the beginning of
this year as a result of spiraling international crude oil prices,
the CPC president said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Pao-lang recapped at a swearing-in ceremony that the company
suffered a cumulative deficit of NT$13.8 billion (US$424.6 million)
in crude oil imports in the first three months of this year, with the
deficit totaling NT$3.246 billion in January, NT$6.084 billion in
February and NT$4.5 billion in March.</P>
      <P>Chen was presiding over a ceremony to mark the swearing-in of
Chuang Chueh-an as chairman of the Taiwan Petroleum Workers Union.</P>
      <P>Chen said the CPC has been striving to expand its business
operations territory by engaging in various investment projects over
the past several years. However, he said, CPC's looming deficit due
to skyrocketing crude oil prices is putting these investment projects
at risk of compromise.</P>
      <P>The growing deficit is also affecting the revenue of the national
coffers, since CPC is one of the main revenue contributors, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chuang said CPC processes and distributes about 75
percent of the petroleum and diesel products that Taiwan consumes.
Unlike the private Formosa Oil, CPC is a major supplier of oil
products domestically and has to import crude oil to meet those
needs. Even worse, Chuang claimed, CPC has continued to keep a cap on
domestic oil prices in compliance with government policy.</P>
      <P>Noting that CPC's losses represent a dent in the national coffers
that in turn will be translated into losses for the public, Chuang
suggested that the administration consider raising oil prices across
the board to reflect the principle of "the users pay."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang admitted Friday that
Taiwan's economy has in recent years not grown as fast as those of
such rapidly rising countries as South Korea and China.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in reply to opposition People First Party

fact that in 2005, South Korea's per capita GDP surpassed that of
Taiwan for the first time.</P>
      <P>South Korea registered a per capita GDP of US$16,291 last year,
compared with Taiwan's US$15,271.</P>

"the most important thing for the government is to make the people

      <P>A military salute ceremony to honor
foreign national leaders will be relocated to the square in front of
the Presidential Office from the square at the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall complex, officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Presidential Office's Department of Public
Affairs said the relocation takes into consideration the practice of
other allies, which often hold the ceremony near the public office of
the head of state.
</P>
      <P>In addition, the square in front of the Presidential Office is
appropriate to highlight the solemn nature of the ceremony and
facilitates the itinerary arrangement, as before and after the
military salute ceremony, there are meetings between the leaders of
Taiwan and whichever foreign leader is being honored.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in the past, the ceremony is often
relocated to the National Concert Hall at the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall complex if the weather is inclement, but from now on,
the venue will change to a hall on the second floor of the

    <HEADLINE>PFP REITERATES OPPOSITION TO ARMS PURCHASE AT 'EXORBITANT PRICES'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
reiterated Friday its strong objection to any military procurement
plan that would require Taiwan to pay "exorbitant prices."</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-pin told reporters that the PFP will not
allow military procurement legislation to pass the Legislative Yuan
because doing so might be seen as the opposition's endorsement of
President Chen Shui-bian's recent decision to scrap the National
Unification Council and the National Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>Hsieh acknowledged that PFP Chairman James Soong reminded Ma
Ying-jeou, chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , at a
meeting earlier this week that the opposition should not allow the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government's military procurement
plan to pass the legislature.</P>
      <P>"The PFP's position has never changed," he said, adding that "the
PFP has always insisted that any military procurement plan must be
based on the maximum interests of the Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that concessions by the opposition on the military
procurement plan at this stage will not do any good for Taiwan's
security aand credibility because the international community might
take them to mean that Taiwan is no longer committed to maintaining
the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The PFP spokesman said no other country can make the decision for
Taiwan on the types and amounts of weapons it should acquire as a way
to demonstrate Taiwan's determination to defend itself.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the DPP should not use U.S. reaction to the
matter to apply pressure on the opposition in an attempt to get the
legislation passed in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks after DPP legislators William Lai and
Winston Dang claimed that Soong's objection to the military
procurement plan was the main reason why Ma failed to explain to U.S.
officials during his recent visit to the United States how the KMT
intends to resolve the issue.</P>
      <P>Lai and Dang, who visited the United States after Ma's visit,
said they learned from a conversation with former U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Richard Armitage that Ma did not "deliver an
envelope" on the arms purchase plan "because of someone" and that
after pursuing the subject further with Armitage, they got the
impression that Soong was that "someone."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SONY AIMS TO BE DOMINANT AGAIN WITH ORGANIZATIONAL REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With unprecedented personnel changes and a
total organizational reform, Sony Corp. aims to emerge from a slump
and regain dominance in the electronics, entertainment and mobile
fields, Sony President Ryoji Chubachi said at a press conference
Friday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Sony last year named American Howard Stringer as its chairman, a
new development in Japanese conglomerates, and decided to re-focus on
three "core positions" in trying to build itself once again into a
dominant global leader, Chubachi said prior to the "2006 Sony Fair"
exhibition.</P>
      <P>"We vowed to provide products from a customer standpoint, to
maintain Sony's advantage in technology and to focus on the
'frontline operation' -- given that Sony has always been a
manufacturing company, " said Chubachi, who started at the company as
an engineer in 1977 and became president in June 2005.</P>
      <P>Combining Stringer's expertise in business operation and
Chubachi's technology background, Sony has been doing well with its
Bravia televisions, digital cameras and camcorders since last year
after losing the MP3 battle to Apple's iPod.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Sony plans to develop Asian "localized markets"
under the globalization theme, Chubachi said. It has set up a
Research and Development (R&amp;D) Center in Taiwan and will probably
increase procurement from Taiwan's LCD panel manufacturers.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is an important market and development base for Sony.
Hopefully, with Taiwan's technology and manufacturing expertise, Sony
can push forward the local market, " said Sony Taiwan President Kenji
Sakai.</P>
      <P>Sony will release a wide range of new products in the second half
of 2006, including the long-awaited PlayStation 3 and VAIO
computers, and will keep promoting the new generation "blue-ray DVD"
technology, Chubachi said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A national campaign was launched by the
Council of Cultural Affairs (CAA) and other sponsors to encourage
more people to cultivate reading habits in Taiwan, amidst a modern
trend of spending less time on reading books.</P>
      <P>The 2006 National Reading Campaign was officially launched Friday
at a book exhibition displaying a collection of 63 works of
literature, the campaign's theme this year. The books were selected
and recommended by the CAA.</P>
      <P>In addition to the book exhibition in Kingstone Bookstores
islandwide from April 7-May 19, an essay competition and a
cloze test will be held. Writers will also visit campuses for
speeches from April 17-June 17 to advocate the importance of reading.</P>
      <P>"Statistics show Taiwanese college students spend only one hour a
day reading, which is sad as far as I'm concerned," said CAA Vice
Chairman Wu Chin-fa, who is also an author.</P>
      <P>"Great writers are the architects of society's souls, which is
why we have selected literature as the theme for the campaign. When
you face a crossroads in life, the wisdom found in books can save your
soul," Wu said.</P>
      <P>"As a writer, I would say that reading is far more enjoyable than
writing," said Hsu Hui-chih, whose poetry is among
the exhibition's selected publications.</P>
      <P>"Literature reflects the diversity of human nature. The beauty of
literature is that it's not science and it helps you to learn more
about people," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>This is the third consecutive year that CAA has organized a
national reading campaign.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND INSISTS ON SEEKING COMPENSATION FROM FRANCE OVER LAFAYETTE DEAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 7 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) will
continue the litigation procedures for financial compensation from
France over the Lafayette frigate procurement deal back in the early
1990s, a ministry official said Friday.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Wu Chi-fang was referring to an appeal filed by the
navy with a court of international commercial arbitration in Paris in
2003 demanding the French defense contractor refund Taiwan
US$500 million in illegal kickback paid for the Lafayette deal plus
US$99 million in reputation damages.</P>
      <P>His remarks came after a local newspaper claimed earlier the same
day that the MND has been unable to produce sufficient evidence to
back its allegation that Thales, the French company that sold the six
Lafayette-class frigates to Taiwan in the 1990s, had violated the
contract terms by paying out kickbacks for the deal. The report said
Thales has denied the kickback payout charge and has instead filed a
counter appeal demanding Taiwan pay US$199 million in reputation
damages.</P>
      <P>Wu said the media report was sheer speculation. "As the case is
still under judicial scrutiny, it's inappropriate for the MND to
reveal any evidence the navy has secured, " Wu said, adding that the
French firm's counter appeal is just part of its negotiation
strategy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan struck the US$2.8 billion Lafayette deal with France in
1991, with a ban on any kickback payout. But allegations about
illegal commission payouts surfaced after the death of naval Capt.
Yin Ching-feng in late 1993 under suspicious circumstances. Yin is
widely believed to have been murdered when he was about to blow
the whistle on colleagues who were allegedly taking kickbacks from
the deal.</P>
      <P>After years of investigation, the government is ready to
file a lawsuit for the return of a huge slush fund frozen in Swiss
banks that is believed to be made up of illegal kickbacks from the
Lafayette deal.</P>
      <P>Outgoing State Public Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao told CNA
earlier this year that a special prosecutorial panel investigating
the high-profile kickback scandal has authored a 70-page report on
the kickback refund lawsuit.</P>
      <P>"The report clearly lists the individuals to be asked to refund,
the amount of kickbacks each of them has to refund and the offenses
each has committed, as well as other related matters," Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Andrew Wang, the agent in Taiwan for the French
defense contractor that sold the frigates to Taiwan, is not the only
target to be asked to refund the illegal kickbacks. Nevertheless, he
would not reveal the identity of any other defendant nor the amount
of the refunds sought.</P>
      <P>"The special panel is still putting the final touches on the
paperwork," Wu said.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the special investigation panel said that as the
refund suit must follow Switzerland's civil suit procedures, the
report was sent in January to Swiss lawyers retained by Taiwan to
handle the lawsuit.</P>
      <P>"The Swiss lawyers have suggested that we prepare some additional
information and data. We have thus added seven more pages to the
report and are studying follow-up procedural issues with the Swiss
lawyers, " the spokesman said, adding that a French formal lawsuit
will be filed with the Swiss Judicial Department later this year.</P>
      <P>Under a bilateral judicial aid agreement, the Swiss government
handed over to Taiwan a collection of bank files suspected of links
to the Lafayette kickback scandal last November.</P>
      <P>"After poring over the six cases of files brought back from
Switzerland, we discovered that each time our government made a
payment installment for the frigates, a sum roughly equivalent to 18
percent of the payment would 'coincidently' be remitted into bank
accounts owned by Wang or members of his family, "the spokesman
said." We suspect that the remittances were illegal kickbacks."</P>
      <P>The Swiss files show that frozen deposits in the Wang family's
bank accounts top 900 million Swiss francs (about NT$23 billion) .
Even after the family's legal assets are deducted, the amount that
Taiwan intends to reclaim would still be astronomical.</P>
      <P>It might take three to five years to conclude the lawsuit, the
spokesman said, adding that Taiwan might still seek judicial aid from
several other relevant countries, including France and Luxembourg, to
back its request for Switzerland to return the money.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the spokesman said, the lawsuit will be very expensive.
According to a preliminary estimate, the cost of retaining foreign
lawyers alone could exceed NT$100 million. "The Ministry of Justice
must appropriate budget for the lawsuit," he added.</P>
      <P>The files brought back from Switzerland include 46 bank accounts
under the names of Wang, his three sons and Wang's company, all of
whose accounts have been frozen by the Swiss Federal Court. Wang is
the key suspect in the scandal.</P>
      <P>The files, which are written in English, French and German, also
include a number of previously hidden overseas bank accounts related
to the US$2.8 billion Lafayette deal, as well as information about
relevant capital flows in Switzerland, judicial authorities said,
adding that the Swiss court files clearly document deposit times and
destinations of the capital.</P>
      <P>Wang has been charged in absentia with murder, corruption, money
laundering and fraud.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The prosecution asked the court to detain
Chen Che-nan, former deputy secretary general of the Presidential
Office, on suspicion of fraud Friday.</P>
      <P>The former senior aide to President Chen Shui-bian was queseioned
after prosecutors charged Yang Chen-feng, a sauna business owner,
with perjury. Yang was released on NT$800,00 bond and banned from
leaving the country.</P>
      <P>Chen and Yang were involved in a political contribution and
influence-peddling scandal in which Liang Po-hsun, a bankrupt former
chairman of a construction company, accused Chen of taking NT$7.11
million in bribes from him.</P>
      <P>Liang, a wanted economic criminal, recently returned from
Shanghai, China, claiming he would "prove everything with solid
evidence" about the scandal.</P>
      <P>The prosecution, on instructions from Premier Su Tseng-chang,
stepped up the investigation into Liang's allegations that through
Yang, he gave Chen three checks in political donations plus a cash
gift (on the occasion of the funeral of Chen's mother) totalling
NT$7.11 million in exchange for his services in lawsuits.</P>
      <P>Yang had earlier told prosecutors that Liang owed Chen a debt and
Liang had made the payment to clear the debt. But late Thursday, the
prosecution found that Liang did not owe Chen a debt. Yang was thus
charged with perjury.</P>
      <P>Further investigation revealed that Chen was suspected of
defrauding Liang, who will soon begin serving his term. As
investigators were concerned that Chen might engage in collusion and
destroy evidence, they requested the court to keep him under custody.</P>
      <P>Chen has also been investigated for suspected involvement in
other corruption cases including the Kaohsiung rapid transit scandal
and a stock-playing scandal while he was working in the Presidential
Office.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City Government will appeal the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government's decision not to allow
a pair of gift pandas to enter Taiwan from China when the panda
closure at the Taipei Municipal Zoo is completed in June, Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Friday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from councilors at a city council meeting, Ma
said the Council of Agriculture gave an "insufficient" reason for
denying the Taipei Zoo import permits on grounds the zoo's facilities
did not meet requirements for housing pandas, because few zoos would
wait until after they had the facilities and then apply for import
permits.</P>
      <P>Ma said that before the Taipei Zoo's panda closure is completed
in June, the Taipei City Government will send zookeepers to the
United States, Japan and China to train in the care of giant pandas.</P>
      <P>"When we've done all these things and then appeal the case, the
government will be unable to say we haven't made the necessary
preparations," he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said if the government continues to contend that pandas are
protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and should not be allowed to
leave their natural habitat, the city government will point out that
many pandas have left their natural habitat in China, and that those
in captivity have successfully reproduced 168 pandas through
artificial breeding.</P>
      <P>Beijing offered to give the two pandas to Taiwan as a gift during
an historic visit to China by former KMT Chairman Lien Chan last
year.</P>
      <P>Proponents of Taiwan's independence in the DPP government have
expressed suspicion that Beijing's gesture might be a "united front
tactic" intended to win favor among the Taiwanese public.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Dangerous Decision
In South Africa, Poor AIDS Patients Adopt Risky 
Ploy

AIDS patients in South Africa can receive
advanced anti-AIDS drugs free from the
government. The pills work just the way they're 
supposed to, boosting the immune system,
relieving the symptoms and restoring the
health as long as she takes them twice a day.
However,some stopped taking them, because
thegovernment in addition to the drugs, the
government will also give the patient a US$130-

And if the patient takes the drugs, he or she

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian met with a
delegation of U.S. academics specializing in cross-Taiwan Strait
affairs Friday for exchanges of views on a broad range of issues of
mutual concern.</P>
      <P>The delegation was headed by Nat Bellocchi, a former chairman of
the American Institute in Taiwan, a quasi-official U.S. organization
authorized to handle relations with Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chen told the American scholars that Taiwan's
core values lie in the deepening and consolidation of its democratic
system.</P>
      <P>For the sake of good governance and upgrading of national
competitiveness, Chen said Taiwan needs a new round of constitutional
reforms. Even though current constitutional provisions set an
extremely high threshold for constitutional amendments, Chen said he
is confident of realizing the goal with the maturity of social
conditions and popular support.</P>
      <P>Chen said he would endeavor to honor his promise to render a new
constitution for Taiwan that is "timely, relevant and viable" before
he steps down from the presidency in May 2008.</P>
      <P>Touching on relations with China, Chen said his firm conviction
is that only the 23 million Taiwan people have a final say on
Taiwan's future and its relations with China or any change to the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$1.51
billion in March, according to the latest tallies released by the
Ministry of Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>Exports amounted to US$17.68 billion for the month, up 7.1
percent over the year-earlier level, while imports amounted to
US$16.17 billion, down 0.5 percent, MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>The trade surplus totalled US$3.23 billion in the three months to
March, with exports rising 11.4 percent year-on-year to US$49.98
billion and imports climbing 9.3 percent to US$46.75 billion, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>They said Taiwan's trade has shifted from a deficit in February
to a surplus in March mainly because of the decrease in imports such
as steel, machinery, transport vehicles and organic chemicals and the
increase in exports such as electronic and electrical products as
well as optical equipment.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of 2006, capital equipment imports declined
12.2 percent from the same period last year, marking the third
consecutive quarter that the figure has seen negative growth, they
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, consumer product imports increased just 1.4 percent
year-on-year in the first quarter of 2006, they added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington, April 7 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two U.S. congressmen introduced a
resolution Thursday calling for the lifting of all restrictions on
visits to the United States by high-level Taiwan officials.</P>
      <P>Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), co-chairmen of
the Congressional Taiwan Caucus, a pro-Taiwan group in the House of
Representatives, introduced the resolution ahead of Chinese
President Hu Jintao's scheduled visit to Washington, D.C. April 20.</P>
      <P>The resolution says that "all restrictions on visits by
high-level elected and appointed officials of Taiwan to the United
States, including the democratically elected president of Taiwan,
should be lifted.'</P>
      <P>It also says that the U.S. "should encourage direct high-level
exchanges at the Cabinet, in order to strengthen a policy dialogue
with Taiwan's government."</P>
      <P>Chabot previously expressed his concern about the restrictions
during a Congressional hearing two years ago, citing the example of
his meeting with Legislator Mark Chen (Tan Sun Chen) at that time but
then not being able to meet with him a few weeks later after Chen had
become foreign affairs minister.</P>
      <P>Based on U.S. State Department guidelines, Taiwan's president,
vice president, premier, foreign affairs minister and defense
minister cannot make formal visits to the United States, although
they can make transit stops, except in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>"Frankly, I think that the policy is kind of silly, " Chabot
said.</P>
      <P>He noted that during former President Lee Teng-hui's visit to
Washington, D.C. in October 2005, over a dozen members of Congress
urged the Bush administration to not only welcome Lee but also to
allow President Chen Shui-bian to come to the nation's capital and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Guide Dog Association on
Saturday called for the public to support its plan to set up a guide
dog training school to benefit the visually impaired in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The association made the appeal at a guide dog carnival it
sponsored at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen Chang-chin, secretary-general of the association, noted that
Taiwan currently has around 50,000 visually impaired people, but
there are only 14 qualified guide dogs, and all of them were trained
in other countries.</P>
      <P>"This is why the association has decided to set up a school to
train the best friends for the visually impaired," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The association started to solicit money last year and has so far
collected NT$10 million (US$307,700), but it is still NT$50 million
short of its goal, Chen said, adding that the association will
continue to sponsor a series of activities and launch a campaign to
solicit more donations for the cause.</P>
      <P>Chang Chiu-hsiung, president of the association, said that
although a law to protect the physically and mentally challenged
ensures the right of freedom of movement of guide dogs and young dogs
under training in public transportation systems and business places,
quite a few places still refuse these dogs entry.</P>
      <P>Chang said the campaign of the association this year will focus
on the concept of "no shutting out."</P>
      <P>He said that guide dogs have to undergo long-term training. They
are mild and stable and don't bark or bite recklessly, he said,
expressing the hope that the public will allow the dogs more freedom
of movement.</P>
      <P>Director Liang Hsiu-shen also took the opportunity to publicize a
TV movie featuring a guide dog he directed for the Public Television

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's seven leading state-controlled
enterprises together registered a deficit of NT$11.28 billion (US$349
million) in the first two months of this year, according to the
latest tallies released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>Analysts said the situation poses a great challenge to the
government's goal of the seven enterprises achieving NT$888 million
in profits for this year.</P>
      <P>Contributing the most to the deficit were Taiwan Power Co.
(Taipower) and Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) , which together lost
NT$11.95 billion, owing to soaring international oil prices, the MOEA
statistics revealed.</P>
      <P>Taipower, which lost NT$2.62 billion in January and February,
originally projected an after-tax deficit of NT$18.02 billion for
2006, but the company now expects the figure to further expand to

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE DEMANDS KMT LAWMAKER APOLOGIZE FOR ACCUSATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee
Chuan-chiao should apologize within three days for making false
accusations against President Chen Shui-bian and first lady Wu
Shu-jen, otherwise, he will face a slander suit, a Presidential
Office spokesman said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chuan-chiao claimed at a news conference earlier the same day
that President Chen had received political contributions from Liang
Po-hsun, a convicted economic criminal. The lawmaker from Tainan
County also hinted that the first lady had received cash coupons from
Pacific Sogo Department Store.</P>
      <P>Lee Chuan-chiao's accusations against the first couple came a day
after Chen Che-nan, a former Presidential Office deputy
secretary-general, was detained for alleged involvement in a bribery
scandal. Chen Che-nan confessed to having received NT$7.11 million in
bribe money from Liang. Lee Chuan-chiao claimed at Saturday's news
conference that part of the money was political donations to
President Chen.</P>
      <P>In response, Lee Nan-yang, director of the Presidential Office's
Public Affairs Department, said Lee Chuan-chiao should come up with
concrete evidence to back up his allegations.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, his accusations are sheer speculation and his
irresponsible act has seriously smeared the head of state's
reputation," Lee Nan-yang said, adding that the lawmaker's unfounded
accusations should be sternly condemned.</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang stressed that the president has never accepted any
political contributions from Liang and that the Presidential Office
has no knowledge about whether Chen Che-nan has ever accepted any
bribes from Liang.</P>
      <P>As to Lee Chuang-chiao's allegation that the first lady had
purchased tens of thousands of dollars worth of luxury goods at
Pacific Sogo Department Store using cash coupons, Lee Nan-yang said
Wu has never spent such a big sum of money at that department store.
Since every cash coupon has a serial number, he said, it's easy to
check whether the lawmaker's accusation is true.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee Nan-yang said the wheelchair-bound first lady has
consistently been accompanied by a large crowd of security officers
and nurses on each of her shopping outings. "There are no secrets
about the first lady's shopping activities," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee Nan-yang further said that if Lee Chuan-chiao fails to make a
public apology for the false accusations within three days, the first
couple will file a slander suit against the lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Liang, who fled to China in 2004 after being found guilty of
embezzling funds from Overseas Chinese Bank, returned to Taipei last
Saturday. He was arrested upon his arrival at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport.</P>
      <P>Liang, a former chairman of Hsinchiehchung Construction Co. and a
board member of the Overseas Chinese Bank, had told reporters before
his return that he would come back to Taiwan to accuse Chen Che-nan
of taking money from him to bribe judges but eventually failing to
help resolve his embezzlement case.</P>
      <P>Liang has been sentenced to one year in prison for embezzling
NT$5.3 billion from the bank, and was given an additional 14-month
prison term for forging his construction company's contracts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of Mines under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Saturday that it is planning to employ a
high-tech approach to help monitor illegal gravel mining on land.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials said that with gravel in rivers gradually being
depleted and gravel mining on land involving environmental issues and
other problems, illegal gravel mining has become a serious problem in
view of the strong market demand.</P>
      <P>The officials said that illegal gravel mining also leaves ugly
pits on land, which have posed a threat to public safety. If
hazardous waste has been dumped in the pits, they could also affect
environmental safety, they added.</P>
      <P>To stop such illegal practices and to help city and county
governments crack down on the practice, the bureau will use
satellite imaging provided by the Formosat-2 as well as aerial
photographs.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they will soon target areas where rampant
illegal gravel mining has been reported. They will pinpoint the
locations and provide related information for reference to local

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen on Saturday urged
the public to have confidence in the nation's economy, saying that
she is confident of its continued stable growth over the next two to
three years.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks when she was invited by Legislator Hsieh
Ming-yuan of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taichung
Association of Industry and Commerce to give a speech in Taichung,
central Taiwan. More than 300 industrial and business leaders
attended the meeting at which she gave her speech.</P>
      <P>Tsai, a former head of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, didn't talk too much about cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>She noted that some in Taiwan are pessimistic about Taiwan's
economic development, even to the extent of criticizing the government
as being incompetent.</P>
      <P>However, the fact is that Taiwan ranks near the top of the list
in every aspect of economic competitiveness in major international
assessments, she said.</P>
      <P>"The public need not feel uneasy about the nation's economic
development, " she said, adding that "as long as Taiwan doesn't make
any missteps, it can maintain stable growth over the next two to
three years."</P>
      <P>She also said that as Taiwan moves toward a high-tech
knowledge-based economy, it is inevitable that the widening gap
between rich and poor will become more serious.</P>
      <P>"The government will have to embark on long-term structural
reforms to effectively close the gap between rich and poor, " she
continued.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait economic issues, Tsai said that with the trend of
globalization, the positive and negative effects of an economically
rising China will impact Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businesspeople investing in China will get high yields if
they are successful, but they shouldn't ignore the high risks
inherent in the economic environment in China, she said.</P>
      <P>She said she believes that direct cross-strait transportation is
only a short-term issue and that the more important issue will be how
to face an economically rising China in the long term.</P>
      <P>Some participants suggested to Tsai that the idle Shuinan Airport
complex in downtown Taichung be turned into an exhibition center, and
Tsai promised to take their suggestion to the Council for Economic
Planning and Development for studies.</P>
      <P>Shuinan Airport has been idle since Chingchuankang Airport in
suburban Taichung took over its business in 2004.</P>
      <P>Some also suggested that Chingchuankang Airport open direct
flights to Hong Kong and Macau.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOP PROSECUTOR'S CONFIRMATION HANGS IN BALANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan
is scheduled to vote on President Chen Shui-bian's nomination for the
nation's top prosecutorial post Tuesday, but the voting result
remains uncertain, particularly after a former senior presidential
aide was detained over a bribery scandal Friday.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Chuan-chiao said
Saturday that Hsieh Wen-ting, the nominee for the post of state
public prosecutor general, must show a firm resolve to fight
government corruption in order to win the opposition camp's support
for his accession to the top prosecutorial post.</P>
      <P>Lee urged Hsieh, who is now the chief prosecutor general of the
Public Prosecutors' Office of the Taiwan High Court, to declare
before the confirmation vote that he would be willing to appoint
courageous, upright and incorruptible prosecutors to form a special
panel to investigate a spate of high-profile corruption scandals
allegedly involving senior officials.</P>
      <P>"If Hsieh can do so, I'll do my best to persuade all of my KMT
colleagues to vote for his appointment. Otherwise, I'll demand that
the KMT legislative caucus order all members to cast a 'no' vote, "
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Tuesday's vote will mark the first time that the legislature has
a role in the appointment of the state public prosecutor general. In
the past, the president had full authority to appoint the nation's
top prosecutor. According to the newly revised Court Organic Law, the
president can only nominate a candidate whose appointment requires
the legislature's confirmation.</P>
      <P>Lee praised judicial authorities' decision to have Chen Che-nan,
a former Presidential Office deputy secretary-general, detained for
further investigations into his role in several suspicious official
corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>Chen was detained Friday on the charge of fraud after he
confessed to having accepted NT$7.11 million in bribe money from a
construction tycoon but eventually failing to help the convicted
tycoon resolve an embezzlement case.</P>
      <P>Lee said the fraud charge was relatively minor compared to Chen's
alleged role in other high-profile influence-peddling scandals, such
as the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. profiteering and the Pacific
Sogo Department Store embezzlement cases.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee claimed it is likely that more powerful politicians
are involved in those cases. With a view to wiping out official
corruption and establishing clean politics, Lee said the new top
prosecutor must have the guts to name honest and trustworthy
prosecutors to solve all those cases.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES OPPOSITION NOT TO BOYCOTT TOP PROSECUTOR'S CONFIRMATIONrepeat</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged the opposition camp Saturday
to refrain from boycotting President Chen Shui-bian's nomination for
the nation's top prosecutorial post.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, a DPP legislative caucus whip, made the call after
her countrpart from the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , Pan
Wei-kang, said that Hsieh Wen-ting, the nominee for the post of state
public prosecutor general, must show a firm resolve to get to the
bottom of a spate of corruption scandals allegedly involving senior
government officials if he wants to win the opposition's support for
his accession to the top prosecutorial post.</P>
      <P>Yeh said Hsieh, who is now the Taiwan High Court's chief
prosecutor general, already assured lawmakers at the legislature's
judicial committee earlier this week that if he gets the top
prosecutorial post, he would look into several widely watched
controversial cases, such as suspected Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.
racketeering and possible irregularities in Taiwan High-Speed Railway
Corp. financing and electronic freeway toll collection system
bidding.</P>
      <P>"Since Hsieh has promised to make a thorough investigation into
those cases if any solid evidence is found in the preliminary review,
I see no reason for the KMT caucus to continue grueling Hsieh over
them," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold a
confirmation vote on Hsieh's nomination Tuesday. The vote will mark
the first time that the legislature has a role in the appointment of
the state public prosecutor general. In the past, the president had
full authority to appoint the nation's top prosecutor. According to
the newly revised Court Organic Law, the president can only nominate
a candidate whose appointment requires the legislature's
confirmation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRIVATE INVESTMENT REGISTERED NEGATIVE GROWTH IN 2005</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  9  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the government does not attach
importance to investment in the service industry, it will be
difficult to expect a good record in domestic investment, according
to an economist who pointed out that private investment dipped 1.3
percent in 2005 on a year-on-year basis.</P>
      <P>Ku Ying-hua, a research fellow at the Institute of Economics of
Academia Sinica, made the remarks in an article she contributed to
the online newspaper of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial
Development and Investment Center.</P>
      <P>She said the service industry has become the mainstay of Taiwan's
economy, accounting for 73.56 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP) last year. However, she went on, the sector has received little
assistance from the government.</P>
      <P>Instead, she noted, the government has focused its energy on the
manufacturing industry, which in 2005 accounted for only 21.13
percent of the GDP -- a level which she claimed could not possibly be
a locomotive driving economic growth.</P>
      <P>Still, Ku said, the government has made every effort to find land
for investors wishing to invest in the manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>With the completion of the sixth naphtha cracking plant and the
high-speed railway system, Taiwan will face a challenge in terms of
increasing private investment, she said.</P>
      <P>According to Ku, if the government wants to encourage investment
in the service industry, it must start with urban development, as
manufacturing has been moving out of the country, while the service
sector will not see such a huge exodus.</P>
      <P>"The only way to improve private investment is to legislate a
good set of laws and regulations for the service industry that will
provide good services to consumers," she said.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, fixed capital took a 19.7
percent share of Taiwan's GDP in 2005, a record low level with a
total amount that is up only 0.46 percent from 2004.</P>
      <P>Of that total, private investment actually dipped 1.3 percent
from the previous year, Ku pointed out, adding that the share of
fixed capital in GDP would have dropped even more had
government-owned enterprises not invested 17.21 percent more than a
year earlier to make up for the shortfalls in fixed investment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP FORUM NOT MEANT TO SUPERVISE PERFORMANCE OF CABINET: PARTY WHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A policy forum to be held by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) at the Presidential Office next
week is aimed at seeking consensus between the party and the Cabinet
on important issues, DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tsai, a whip of the DPP's legislative caucus who also serves as
the party's culture and information director, denied media claims
that in holding the forum, the DPP is trying to supervise the
performance of the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the policy forum, which has been held by the DPP's
Policy Committee several times over the past few years, is part of
the party's consensus-seeking mechanism.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, participants in the forum will include
President Chen Shui-bian, Premier Su Cheng-tsang, DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun, some Cabinet members, DPP legislators and possibly National
Security Council Secretary-General Chiou I-jen.</P>
      <P>News reports Sunday said the DPP chairman, who is a former
premier, wants the party to be the locomotive in the government's
policy planning and reviewing process, but some Cabinet officials
believe that Yu has transgressed the bounds of his duty.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lin Chia-lung and other high-ranking party
officials reportedly decided at a meeting last week that the party
will begin to hold a policy forum every week to play a role parallel
to that of the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission of the
Executive Yuan in an attempt to supervise the Cabinet's performance
on important policy issues.</P>
      <P>The reports claimed that the DPP's "drastic move" is intended to
revive the party's plummeting popularity in the wake of a series of
corruption scandals implicating high-ranking government officials.
According to the results of an opinion poll released last week, the
approval ratings for the president and the DPP have plunged to 18
percent.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, Cheng Wen-tsang, a government
spokesman and head of the Government Information Office, pointed out
that the DPP's policy forum is nothing new. He said he had never
heard of the DPP's plan to supervise the Cabinet's performance.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Shen Fa-hui -- one of eight DPP lawmakers who
called for an extraordinary session of the party's national congress
to discuss ways to reform the party -- said that if the DPP wants to
supervise the performance of the Cabinet, it should do so through the
DPP caucus at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"The party does not have a mechanism to oversee the Executive
Yuan's performance; it only has the right to make suggestions to the
DPP's legislative caucus," Shen said.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chi-chang, another DPP legislator who joined the call for an
extraordinary session of the DPP's national congress, said it would
sound "strange" if the party wanted to supervise the Cabinet in the
implementation of important policies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEASED FARMLAND TO BE RECLAIMED TO HELP SAVE ENDEMIC SALMON SPECIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wuling Farm, located near the natural
habitat of Taiwan's "national treasure" fish, the Formosan landlocked
salmon in central Taiwan, said Sunday it has reclaimed most of its
land that has been leased for fruit and vegetable plantation in an
effort to help save the endangered species.</P>
      <P>Water pollution caused by the pesticides used by fruit and
vegetable growers in the Wuling Farm area over the years has been
blamed as one of the reasons behind the decline in the population of
the rare fish.</P>
      <P>Actually, the Veterans Affairs Commission -- the owner of Wuling
Farm -- has been cutting the leasing of land to fruit and vegetable
growers over the past several years as the country's awareness of
environmental protection has risen.</P>
      <P>So far, according to the Wuling Farm management, only 40 hectares
of land is currently leased, and this land will be reclaimed as soon
as possible for reforestation.</P>
      <P>Wuling Farm officials said that there are four categories of fish
endemic to the Chichiawan stream area, which is part of the
Sheipa National Park in central Taiwan. Of the four kinds of fish,
the Formosan landlocked salmon, an endangered species endemic to
Taiwan, is the most prominent, as it has been recognized as a
subspecies of the cherry salmon, a throwback from the last Ice Age.</P>
      <P>The salmon became landlocked during the glacial epoch in frigid
mountain streams, and its discovery in Taiwan, a subtropical island,
is regarded by biologists as "a miracle." Similar species are also
found, although in much colder areas, in Japan, South Korea and
northeastern China.</P>
      <P>Wuling Farm officials said that in compliance with the policies
of the Sheipa National Park Administration, the farm decided to
forsake its economic gains to help protect the environment and
conserve endangered species.</P>
      <P>Despite the government's comprehensive and intensive conservation
efforts, the number of Formosan landlocked salmon in the Chichiawan
stream in the upper stretches of the Tachia river and the lower
reaches of the Wuling stream in mountainous regions of central Taiwan
has continued to decline in recent years as a result of ecological
changes in the fish's natural habitat.</P>
      <P>Sheipa National Park officials attributed the decline primarily
to climatic changes and environmental pollution in the fish's native
habitat. The crises identified by the officials include frequent
typhoons and summer storms that affect water levels in the rivers
where the fish lives, and global warming that scientists believe
leads to a lower breeding rate.</P>
      <P>According to the park officials, the Formosan landlocked salmon
inhabits cold, slow-flowing streams with gently sloping beds at
elevations above 1,500 meters. It needs clean cold water under 18
degrees Celsius to thrive.</P>
      <P>Another crisis faced by the fish is that its native habitat is
prone to forest fires, which can easily change the ecological balance
in the region, the officials said, adding that water pollution caused
by pesticides used by fruit and vegetable growers in the nearby
Wuling Farm has also contributed to the population decline.</P>
      <P>In addition, the establishment of sandtraps in the Tachia river
to prevent downstream silting is yet another threat to the survival
of the rare species, as the sandtraps prevent the adult salmon from
returning to their spawning beds, park officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Education is planning to
promote the usage of Taiwanese dialect nationwide so that the mother
tongue of the Taiwan people can be revived.</P>
      <P>Beginning from the 2006 academic year, or Sept. 1 this year, a
"Taiwanese Mother Tongue Day" will be implemented each week in
elementary and junior high schools around the nation to allow
children to practice Taiwanese so as to make the dialect part of
their daily lives, said Pan Wen-chung, director of the Education
Ministry's Elementary Education Department.</P>
      <P>This "Taiwanese Mother Tongue Day" activity has been carried out
in 1,524 elementary and junior high schools on a trial basis since
last year, but starting from September, the weekly program will be a
mandated part of the curriculum, Pan said.</P>
      <P>The design of the "Taiwanese Mother Tongue Day" is aimed at
enabling school children to speak Taiwanese as their mother tongue
and to use it more frequently in their daily lives, Pan added.</P>
      <P>The "Taiwanese Mother Tongue Day" curriculum will be considered
an index of how successful local governments have been in promoting
the dialect teaching in their respective areas, Pan said, adding that
local governments that give outstanding performances in this regard
will be rewarded with cash prizes of NT$500,000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pan said, beginning from the 2006 academic year,
kindergartens around the nation can apply for subsidies to provide
dialect teaching, which could include Taiwanese and indigenous mother
tongues.</P>
      <P>The subsidies will amount to NT$70,000 for each kindergarten per
academic year and up to 50 kindergartens nationwide could be chosen
to receive the grant.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Six members of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) have registered with the party to put themselves up
as candidates in the KMT's primary election for Kaohsiung mayor after
KMT Legislator Lee Fu-hsing submitted his application Sunday.</P>
      <P>The five others who completed the application procedure in the
past four days are former independent Legislator Su Ying-guei, former
Kaohsiung City Council Speaker Huang Chi-chuan and legislators Huang
Chao-shun, Lwo Shih-hsiung and Lee Chuan-chiao.</P>
      <P>The six candidates have each submitted a NT$1 million deposit,
plus documents to prove that their candidacy is supported by at least
2,097 KMT members.</P>
      <P>Six other KMT members have also declared their intention to run
but have not turned in application forms. They include former
Kaohsiung Deputy Mayor Huang Jun-ying, former Legislator Chen
Hsueh-sheng, former Penghu County Magistrate Lai Feng-wei, and
Legislator Chiu Yi. They will have to decide whether to join the May
27 party primary before the registration ends Monday.</P>
      <P>It is hard to predict at this stage which candidate will emerge
as the KMT's nominee in the year-end Kaohsiung mayoral race.</P>
      <P>According to regulations governing the KMT's primaries, in
determining who will be the party's candidate in an election, support
by KMT members accounts for 30 percent, while support by voters as
reflected by opinion polls accounts for 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The KMT primary for the Kaohsiung mayoral election will take
place the same day as the party's primary for the Taipei mayoral
election.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) is also scheduled
to hold its primary election May 28 to choose the party's nominee for
Kaohsiung mayor.</P>
      <P>The competition in the DPP's Kaohsiung mayoral primary has been

Affairs Chairwoman Chen Chu and Legislator Kuan Bi-ling.</P>
      <P>Kuan has urged Chen to withdraw from the race because of her poor
record as the nation's highest labor official that resulted in her
having to resign, while Chen's supporters have said that Kuan should
finish her term as a legislator instead of switching her political

    <TEXT>
      <P>Scores of environmental groups issued a
joint statement Sunday to call for the government to decide on goals
for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and a timetable for
their implementation to help Taiwan secure sustainable development.</P>
      <P>The groups, led by the Taiwan Environmental Protection Union,
called for the government to seek concrete results at a national
sustainable development conference slated for April 21 in
environmental protection efforts.</P>
      <P>Expressing hope that the conference will not turn out to be
another "show of formality, " the environmental protection groups
said the government must come up with concrete goals for reducing CO2
emissions, requirements for the private industrial sector and an
implementation timetable once the conference is convened.</P>
      <P>They said these measures are imperative if Taiwan wants to
prevent itself from facing the international trade sanctions that
will occur if the country continues to slack off on control of
emissions of greenhouse gases after the Kyoto Protocol entered into
force in February 2005.</P>
      <P>The statement said that before the government puts forth concrete
goals for CO2 emission reduction programs and their implementation
timetable, the Executive Yuan should not approve any new high
CO2-emission development projects, such as the eighth naphtha
cracking plant and big steel mills.</P>

      <P>China (including Hong Kong) , the United
States and Vietnam were the top three sources of Taiwan's trade
surplus in the first three months of this year, the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) under the
Executive Yuan said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Among the three, China and Hong Kong recorded a US$13.9 billion
trade deficit with Taiwan, compared with US$11.9 billion during the
same period of last year, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>During the first quarter of 2005, Taiwan's trade surpluses with
the U.S. and Vietnam were US$2.19 billion and US$830 million,
respectively, the officials added.</P>
      <P>They noted that Taiwan's main export products were precision
instruments, electric machinery, and electronics, which rose 68.8
percent, 30.2 percent, and 27.8 percent, respectively, from the same
period of last year. However, shipments of information technology and
telecommunication products were down 9 percent.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's trade deficits during the first season of the

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April 9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu challenged
Sunday the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , which insists on its "one
China, with each side of the Taiwan Strait free to interpret its
meaning, " to espouse a "two Chinas" theory.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a gathering of the Taiwan Heart Association founded
by Lu herself, the vice president said she cannot accept KMT Chairman
Ma Ying-jeou's "five do's" proposal for re-starting cross-Taiwan
Strait negotiations based on the so-called "1992 consensus, "
describing Ma's "five do's" as sugar-coated poison.</P>
      <P>If the KMT is not faint of heart, it should put forth a "two
Chinas" formula for handling Taiwan-China relations, she said.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which ruled Taiwan until 2000, said its "one China"
refers to the Republic of China, while for the Communist Party of
China (CPC), it refers to the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, during a rare meeting with Ma earlier
this month, challenged the KMT to wrestle a "one China" consensus
from Beijing that allows Taiwan to proclaim itself the Republic of
China. If such a consensus could be reached, Chen said he "absolutely
will respect it."</P>
      <P>The chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Yu
Shyi-kun, reiterated the challenge in Chiayi, central Taiwan, where
he called on the KMT to talk with the DPP before a KMT delegation
leaves for a joint forum with the CPC in Beijing later this month.</P>
      <P>Suspecting that the KMT-CPC forum is aimed at stripping the DPP
government of its administrative authority over cross-strait affairs,
Yu said the KMT should talk with the DPP over how to work for the
best interests of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>The proposed DPP-KMT talks could cover such topics as
repatriating illegal immigrants from China, protecting the interests
of Taiwan investors in China and reiterating the so-called "1992
consensus" claimed by the KMT to have been reached by officials from
Taipei and Beijing in Hong Kong, Yu said.</P>
      <P>It would better serve Taiwan's interests if the DPP and KMT could
reach a consensus on how to talk with China, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-made extracoporeal shock wave
lithotripters, which break up kidney stones with high-energy waves
without injuring the patient, were cast into the spotlight here
Friday during a meeting of European urologists, thanks to a report by
two Taiwan doctors.</P>
      <P>Doctors Chen Shih-jung from Hualien Hospital and Chang Cheng-yeh
from Hsinchu Hospital shared their experience of using the machines
in a report read at a panel discussion at the annual congress of the
European Association of Urology (EAU).</P>
      <P>The two urologists said the Taiwan-made device combines an X-ray
machine, which locates the stones in the urinary tract, with an
ultra-sound device that breaks the stones into small pieces that can
be passed by the patient, and are nearly 100 percent precise.</P>
      <P>The two urologists said they have used the machines to treat 514
patients aged between 21 and 76 and that no change in blood pressure
during the process has ever been detected. Less than 20 percent of
them had traces of blood in their urine -- a sign that their urinary
tracts were injured by the process.</P>
      <P>The machines have integrated the technology of computers,
imaging, automation and machinery, the two doctors said.</P>
      <P>Their report earned high respect at the congress which was held
between April 5-8 and brought together more than 16,000 EAU members.</P>

      <P>Thirty years of peaceful and stable
development is what China wants most at the moment, therefore
Taiwan's government has to be aware that cross-Taiwan Strait
situation is quite different from what it used to be, visiting
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh said Sunday upon his arrival
in Singapore.</P>
      <P>China has experienced 20 years of reform and has had a taste of
peace, stability and development; what they most want to have now is
thirty more years of peace, stability and development, Lee said as he
arrived from Xiamen, southern China.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan has to realize the situation across the strait is
not the same as before, as can be seen from the leading slogan in
Xiamen, across Kinmen that is under Taiwan's jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Lee said the propaganda panel in Xiamen facing Taiwan's Kinmen
Islands read "Unifying China with One Country-Two Systems," replacing
the old one calling for "Liberating Taiwan, " and the change from
"Liberating Taiwan" to "Unifying China" is quite significant.</P>
      <P>Lee joked that foreigners in China sometimes ask locals if "One
Country-Two Systems" means combining Taiwan's socialism and China's
capitalism because social welfare in Taiwan, such as the national
health insurance program and senior citizens' pension system are even
better than in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng said
Monday the government is firm in its position that traditional
Chinese characters will continue to be used in Taiwan's school system
given their historical and cultural significance.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Tu also said that traditional
Chinese characters, or complex Chinese characters, have been used in
Taiwan for a long time in official documents and everyday life.</P>
      <P>Tu was asked by lawmakers whether Taiwan will consider adopting
simplified Chinese characters, which are used in the People's
Republic of China, as the United Nations is reportedly preparing to
designate simplified characters as the official Chinese script to be
used in all of the world body's official documents.</P>
      <P>Simplified characters were officially adopted by Beijing in 1949
in an effort to eradicate illiteracy in the country. They are also
used in Singapore, while traditional characters are used in Taiwan,
Hong Kong, Macau and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Responding to the legislators' question, Tu said that his
ministry is working to find out whether the reports are true, adding
that regardless of what the U.N. does, traditional characters will

Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) is planning to stage a
protest rally near the White House April 20 when Chinese President Hu
Jintao is scheduled to visit his U.S. counterpart George W. Bush
there, a FAPA executive said Sunday.</P>
      <P>FAPA President Chen Wen-yen said that some 600 Taiwanese
expatriates residing on the U.S. east coast are expected to attend
the protest rally against China's military threat against Taiwan and
its suppression of human rights. Several groups of Falun Gong
practitioners and exiled Tibetans are also expected to participate,
he added.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement at a gathering of the Intercollegiate
Taiwanese American Students Association in Los Angeles. Talking about
the planned Hu-Bush meeting, Chen said that he does not expect the
two will touch on the Taiwan issue and that they will focus on
China-U.S. trade issues, the currency exchange rate, human rights in
China, and the North Korea problem.</P>
      <P>The FAPA, founded in 1982 in Los Angeles, is a non-profit
organization that aims to promote international support for the right

      <P>The Cabinet-level Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission (OCAC) will soon launch a series of initiatives at home

OCAC official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The OCAC will sponsor press conferences and various publicity

characters instead of simplified characters, OCAC Vice Minister Cheng

simplified characters as the official Chinese script to be used in
all of the world body's official documents after 2008.</P>
      <P>The plan has raised concerns among many people around the world.
As of Monday, nearly 100,000 people have visited the voting Web site

      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Cheng said promoting

    <HEADLINE>HOLDING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION EARLIER 'INAPPROPRIATE': CEC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Holding the next presidential election two
months earlier than scheduled would be "inappropriate" based on
constitutional considerations, Taiwan's top official in charge of
election affairs said Monday.</P>
      <P>Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung was
responding to a proposal by the main opposition Kuomintang to hold
the presidential election, set for March 2008, and the next
legislative elections, set for December 2007, simultaneously on Jan.
19, 2008.</P>
      <P>Chang said that although their is no provision in the
Constitution on when a presidential election should be held, the
constitution does stipulate that the period of time that a premier
may take over the president's duties cannot exceed three months, and
based on this, it would be "inappropriate" for the period of time
between the election of a new president and his inauguration to
exceed three months.</P>
      <P>He noted that if the March 2008 presidential election were to be
moved forward to Jan. 19, 2008, there would be a four-month interval
between the new president being elected and his being sworn into
office. During this interval, he argued, the government's major
tasks, including the appointment of government personnel, decisions
on administrative policies and responses to major events or
incidents, would be left up in the air.</P>
      <P>Discounting Chang's explanation, KMT Legislator Tsao Er-chung
asked what's wrong with a four-month interval if all matters
regarding the changeover are written down and followed.</P>
      <P>The KMT has pushed for the "two-in-one" election format on the
grounds that it is "based upon a social consensus, " that it would
help save costs, and that it is in line with the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's stance in favor of holding fewer elections to
avoid wasting resources.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has adopted a new "double-handed
strategy" toward Taiwan, the nation's top China policy charter said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made the
remarks when he and his deputy, You Ying-lung, were invited by the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) legislative caucus to report
on an upcoming economic forum between the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and the Communist Party of China (CPC) April 14-17.</P>
      <P>The forum is part of a five-point agreement reached between KMT
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan and Chinese President Hu Jintao during
their meeting in Beijing April 29, 2005, when Lien was still KMT
chairman. The upcoming forum will discuss cross-Taiwan Strait trade
and economy, transportation links, agriculture, tourism and finance.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Beijing has "become softer" in trying to court
Taiwan people, although the softness is only words, "most of which
are fake."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, China has "become harder" in its high-handed
manner toward Taiwan, referring to its relentless diplomatic stifling
and continuing military buildup.</P>
      <P>Wu said China's "united front strategy" to drive a wedge into
Taiwan society is an attempt to "maneuver Taiwan political parties to
marginalize the Taiwan government."</P>
      <P>He noted that the KMT and the CPC, while discussing cross-strait
charter flights, cannot "rule out the participation of the
government" as the issue involves government authority.</P>
      <P>If the two parties were to attempt to circumvent the government
and reach an agreement on behalf of Taiwan, "it would be basically
illegal," he noted.</P>
      <P>You echoed Wu's words, pointing out that any agreement reached
between the KMT and the CPC involving government authority, policial
issues or cross-strait cooperation, should conform with the Statute
Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area, or will be invalid and non-binding.</P>
      <P>Wu also said that China has told the heads of Taiwan
businessmen's associations in China to attend the KMT-CPC forum and
has instructed that if they cannot attend, they must take a leave of
absence or instruct deputies to attend on their behalf.</P>
      <P>"I cannot agree with this way of forcing Taiwan businessmen to
attend," he said.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) described as "misinformation"
Monday reports they are going to the United States to persuade former
Premier Frank Hsieh to run for Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>They were responding to media speculation that DPP legislators
close to Hsieh, including Hsu Kuo-yung, Hsieh Hsin-ni and Lee
Chun-yi, are planning to visit the United States April 18 to boost
momentum for Hsieh, who is on a short-term study program at the John
F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, in the
year-end mayoral election.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the recent spate of scandals
allegedly involving the ruling party mean the DPP faces an uphill
battle in the Kaohsiung and Taipei mayoral elections. In a bid to
reverse the situation, some within the DPP are calling for Hsieh to
run in the Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>The embattled DPP will find it hard to compete with opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who is also incumbent Taipei
mayor and the best bet to represent the KMT in the 2008 presidential
election, the reports claimed.</P>
      <P>In response, Lee said that the reports are probably related to
the DPP's low approval rating, which is why "some within the party"
are desperate to win the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>"The trip to the U.S. is mainly to exchange views with Hsieh on
the DPP's future prospects, "Lee said, adding that the Taipei mayoral
election is not their major issue and that they will not persuade
Hsieh, a former Kaohsiung mayor, to throw his hat into the ring.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the party could not determine the candidates for
Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections earlier because of an overall
consideration of the development of the party's future.
</P>
      <P>He also said that the party is "not ruling out the possibility
that the DPP's Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral candidates will be the
top executives and de facto leaders of the DPP."</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsieh said that the year-end elections are critical to
the party and that the party's candidates should be both capable and
have chances of winning.</P>
      <P>Hsu said they will travel to the U.S. to hear a speech delivered
by Hsieh at Harvard University April 19, and not to "persuade Hsieh
to run."</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) decided Monday not to endorse the nominee
for the country's top prosecutorial post.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus decided at a meeting that the party
will not vote to confirm at a Legislative Yuan session Tuesday the
the appointment of Hsieh Wen-ting, the Taiwan High Court
prosecutor-general who has been nominated by President Chen Shui-bian
to be the next state public prosecutor-general.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang said the KMT feels that
Hsieh will not live up to Taiwan society's expectations, particularly
in the wake of a spate of incidents, including the 319 shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, the KRTC Thai
workers riot and alleged corruption in the high-speed railway
development project, if he were approved to be the next
prosecutor-general.</P>
      <P>Pan claimed the KMT caucus has no doubt about Hsieh's integrity,
but is worried that his weak personality might mean he will flinch
from probing corruption charges involving high-ranking officials.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Legislative Yuan has allowed Hsieh enough time
and opportunities over the past two months to show his guts and
ingenuity, KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng claimed that Hsieh is a "lame
duck."</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Ting Shou-chung claimed that the KMT's refusal to
approve Hsieh's nomination should serve to remind other nominees in
the future that in addition to the president's nomination, half of
the prosecutor-general's power comes from the legislature.</P>
      <P>Pan said the KMT legislators will be fully mobilized to attend
the legislative session Tuesday, although none of them will cast a
vote, to "shore up the threshold of approval."</P>
      <P>According to newly revised Court Organic Law, except for
nomination by the president, the nominee's approval requires the
presence of one-third of the 221-seat legislature at the meeting and
the consent by half of the lawmakers present on the day.</P>
      <P>If the legislature endorses the president's nomination, Hsieh
will be the country's first top prosecutor to be appointed under the
revised Court Organic Law that took effect Feb. 3 this year.</P>
      <P>In the past, the president had full power to appoint a state
public prosecutor-general. Under the new law, however, the
president's nomination requires the legislature's consent.</P>
      <P>Under the new law, the state public prosecutor-general will serve
only a single four-year term. The new measures are designed to
enhance the democratic legitimacy and independence of the
prosecutorial system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT-CPC FORUM AIMED AT BAILING OUT TAIWAN ECONOMY: KMT LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An upcoming economic forum between the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) is
aimed at bailing out Taiwan's flagging economy, KMT lawmakers said
Monday.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang and lawmakers Kuo
Su-chun and Fei Hung-tai made the comments at a news conference prior
to the KMT-CPC economic forum slated for April 14-15 in Beijing,
which will focus on cross-Taiwan Strait cooperation on trade and
commerce, agriculture and tourism, as well as stepping up financial
exchanges and setting up direct transport links.</P>
      <P>Pan defended the KMT's decision to hold the forum with the CPC,
arguing that the KMT is just keen on seeking a way out for Taiwan's
sluggish economy. She urged the "pan green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union to
stop political fighting for the sake of overall national interests.</P>
      <P>Kuo criticized the "pan green camp's" boycott of the forum as
"sour grapes, " accusing the "pan green camp" of standing in the way
and trying to block efforts of others.</P>
      <P>The KMT is planning to send a group of around 170 lawmakers,
experts and business community representatives to attend the Beijing
economic forum.</P>
      <P>The agreement on holding the forum can be traced back to a
five-point press communique signed in late April last year in Beijing
by then-KMT Chairman Lien Chan and Chinese President Hu Jintao when
Lien paid a landmark visit to China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The hours devoted to Chinese language
lessons for first and second graders in Taipei City elementary
schools will be increased from five or six hours per week to eight,
the city's director of education said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-ji said the new regulation will be implemented from the
2006 academic year that will begin Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>He made the announcement after Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
instructed the city education department to adjust the hours given
over to Chinese and English language lessons, as well as to
mother-tongue dialect lessons in schools.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Wu reported to the mayor on his department's recent
survey on the capital's Chinese language education. Citing official
statistics, the report indicated that total hours of Chinese language
lessons for sixth graders in elementary schools amounted to 80-133
hours per academic year, less than the level of 172 hours in China
and 80-200 hours in Singapore.
</P>
      <P>The report suggested that efforts, including establishing a

language lessons, and setting up Chinese proficiency indicators, be
made to upgrade the city's Chinese language education.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April 10 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Deputy Transport Minister Chen
Shih-yih told a court Tuesday that the government procurement law
should apply to six controversial sections of Kaohsiung's mass rapid
transit system.</P>
      <P>Chen's testimony at the court hearing on the applicability of the
government procurement law on the issue could be damning to five
members in the city government's "final decision group" who have been
accused of breach of trust.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had all along proposed that the construction of the
city's rapid transit system should follow the government procurement
law, a proposal he made at many screening meetings, including several
at the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>He added that he did not know why his proposal was later
rejected.</P>
      <P>Chou Li-liang, former director of the city's Department of Rapid
Transit System and one of the five accused, claimed that the Public
Construction Commission of the Executive Yuan "has clearly stated
that the government procurement law does not apply to the Kaohsiung
rapid transit project."</P>
      <P>If the court agrees with Chou, he and the other four -- former
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) Vice Chairman Chen Min-hsien and
General Manager Lai Hsien-yu, former Kaohsiung Urban Development
Planning Bureau Director Wu Meng-te and former MOTC Chief
Secretary-General Chung Shan-teng -- will be charged with breach of
trust.</P>
      <P>If the court decides to side with Chen, the five will be indicted
on charges of "attempting to profit certain parties, " a charge that
could bring heavier sentences for them.</P>
      <P>Chen told the court that during the planning stage, the private
sector needed invest just over NT$20 billion to control the whole
build, operate, transfer (BOT) project worth more than NT$200
billion.</P>
      <P>"The media at the time said this would give the private sector a
chance to bet small money on a huge return," he said.</P>
      <P>In response to a prosecutor's request, Chen explained that this
means the private sector would be investing a small portion, with
most of the money coming from the government.</P>
      <P>The 42-km rapid transit system has ended up costing NT$181.6
billion to build, with the city government investing a whopping
NT$150.8 billion or 83.2 percent, and yet allowing the KRTC, which
was dominated by Chen Min-hsien, to control the use of the building
funds.</P>
      <P>Chen stands accused of breach of trust in connection with a
corruption investigation into why Thai workers working on the KRTC
project rioted in August last year and all five members in the "final
decision" committee stand accused of attempting to profit certain
contractors when awarding the NT$44.7 billion project because they
failed to follow government regulations in choosing winning bidders.</P>
      <P>The prosecution also charged them with disclosing bottom lines to
certain bidders while excluding competitors, incurring heavy losses
to the city government and to KRTC.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) legislative caucus urged the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Monday to seek Chinese cooperation in extraditing Taiwanese criminals
who have fled to China to escape justice.</P>
      <P>TSU legislators requested that Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Joseph Wu make a written request to former KMT Chairman Lien
Chan, who is scheduled to make a trip to China April 13, to help
extradite wanted Taiwanese criminals on the run in China.</P>
      <P>The TSU caucus made the request when MAC officials briefed caucus
members at the Legislative Yuan on the MAC's plan of action regarding
a KMT-Communist Party of China forum scheduled for April 14-15 in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Wu did not respond to the TSU request, but he urged Lien and the
Chinese government to join Taiwan in fighting crime by sending
Taiwanese criminals back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Lo Chih-ming said the most-wanted list includes
individuals such as economic criminals Chang Chao-chuan, Wu

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Justice Minister Lee Chin-yung said
Monday that the ministry will study whether to increase the
punishments for drug-related crimes.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while making a report at the Judicial
Committee of the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Legislators Wu Ping-jui and Kuo Jung-tzung of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party claimed that rampant drug abuse has been
the major cause of deteriorating social order.</P>
      <P>They noted that some of what they described as the "milder" forms
of drugs, such as ketamine and FM2, are easily accessible and said
the government should revise the law to step up regulations on such
drugs.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, such drugs, which he described as less likely
to be addictive and the use of which he claimed carries no criminal
responsibility, constitute a loophole in the law that should be
closed as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislators also asked the Ministry of Justice
(MOJ) to study whether to increase the punishments for drug
trafficking.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PMMA, a new kind of ecstasy that is popular in Europe
and the United States, has made inroads into Taiwan, a doctor at the
Taipei Veterans General Hospital, reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Yang Cheng-chang noted that recently a group of junior high
school dropouts took part in a house party in Keelung, northern
Taiwan, where two of them developed the symptoms of intoxication
after consuming two PMMA tablets. One died on the spot and the other
was rushed to hospital.
</P>
      <P>The 16-year-old boy was in coma when he arrived at the hospital,
and he could not be resuscitated.</P>
      <P>Yang said the toxicity of PMMA is several times stronger than the
average ecstasy available in Taiwan and could easily lead to death.
He urged the government to list PMMA at the same level as ecstasy so
that it can be more strictly regulated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ADJUSTMENT OF PETROLEUM PRICES REQUIRES CABINET CONSENSUS: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Any adjustments to petroleum prices will
have to wait for a consensus within the Cabinet, Minister of Economic
Affairs Hwang Ing-san said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hwang made the remarks after newly named Chinese Petroleum Corp.
Chairman Pan Wenent said domestic oil prices will have to follow a
reasonable market mechanism.</P>
      <P>Hwang said the Executive Yuan pronounced several principles early
this year upon which domestic petroleum and electricity fees will be
adjusted.</P>
      <P>The principles include increasing the efficiency of state-owned
enterprises, seeking new revenue and savings, and taking into
consideration living conditions and economic development.</P>
      <P>But Hwang said that if world oil prices soar to a high "beyond
the expectation of the government, " the government will have no
choice but to intervene.</P>
      <P>Asked whether it is time to adjust petroleum prices amid reports
that West Texas crude had reached US$68 a barrel, Hwang said only
that whenever world oil prices fluctuate, domestic oil prices will
have to be reviewed, which is what is happening now.</P>
      <P>Pan earlier said that the CPC lost NT$13.8 billion (US$425.9
million) in the first quarter and that if the trend continues, the
losses for the year could reach over NT$50 billion, or 40 percent of
the CPC's paid-in capital.</P>
      <P>"The company will collapse with those kinds of losses, " Pan
warned.</P>
      <P>He noted that the CPC is a state-owned enterprise whose losses
will be shouldered by the public. The current oil price mechanism
means that "the underprivileged subsidize the stronger groups, " or
those who use smaller vehicles subsidize owners of bigger cars, which
he said is not in the best interests of the nation.</P>
      <P>"Using subsidized oil prices to achieve international
competitiveness is fake competitiveness, " Pan said, adding his hope
that oil prices can be adjusted in line with a "reasonable market
mechanism."</P>

(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A work group preparing to hold a special
conference of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) worked
out a reform plan Monday calling for a "clean government" amid a
series of corruption scandals implicating high government officials.</P>
      <P>The work group, consisting of eight DPP legislators, proposed 10
days ago that DPP members meet to discuss various issues facing the
party after a DPP legislator expressed his disillusionment with the
DPP government and quit the party.</P>
      <P>After the work group held its third meeting Monday, Tsai
Chi-chang, one of the eight DPP legislators, told reporters the
meeting adopted a sketch plan for clean government, including asking
the Presidential Office to conduct a review of its staff and affairs
that have become a source of controversy.</P>
      <P>The plan will also ask the Presidential Office to respond to
public concerns about the corruption scandals in a concrete manner.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the reform plan suggests the DPP's legislative
caucus establish a disciplinary committee with the power to
investigate irregularities in the executive branch of government.</P>
      <P>In addition, the DPP's legislative caucus should have the right
to participate in the formulation of important government policies,
and be consulted in advance when the government appoints a top
executive to head a state-owned enterprise.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the reform plan will be presented to the DPP's
legislative caucus for approval before being included in the planned
conference's agenda.</P>
      <P>Although President Chen Shui-bian and other DPP heavyweights have
thrown their support behind the conference, DPP legislative caucus
whips Chen Chin-jun and Yeh Yi-chin expressed doubt about the event's
usefulness because resolutions reached at the meeting will not be
binding to either the party or the government.</P>
      <P>They proposed the DPP hold an extraordinary national convention
instead, so that reform plans from such a meeting could be realized.</P>
      <P>In addition to Tsai, the DPP lawmakers who initiated the move to
hold the special conference are Shen Fa-hui, Chen Chi-yu, Huang
Wei-cher, Pan Meng-an, Cheng Yun-peng, Hsieh Hsin-ni and Yu
Cheng-tao.</P>
      <P>The call of the DPP "young turks" for party and government
reforms came at a time when the president and the DPP's approval
ratings slipped to a record low of 18 percent after a series of
corruption scandals involving high-ranking government officials were
brought to light, including accusations of insider trading,
profiteering from the Kaohsiung rapid transit project and bribery in
the bidding process for the electronic toll collection system on

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   10  (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and
Communication Kuo Yao-chi said Monday that it is unfeasible to stop
collecting tolls on the Sun Yat-sen Freeway (No. 1 Freeway) because
the highway construction fund and the Highway Act states that
parallel routes should adopt the same toll system.</P>
      <P>If tolls are not collected on the No. 1 Freeway, then toll
collection on the No. 3 Freeway would also have to stop, otherwise
drivers would forsake the No. 3 and swarm the No. 1, Kuo said in
reply to lawmakers' questions at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The government's freeway construction fund is now running a
NT$190 billion (US$5.94 billion) deficit, and by 2015, another
NT$241.1 billion (US$7.53 billion) will be needed to build more
freeways, said Kuo.</P>
      <P>The fund will not break even until 2037, when freeway tolls can
finally be abolished, she said.</P>
      <P>According to Tsao Erh-chung, a legislator of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), the government originally planned to collect tolls
for only 20 years on the No. 1 Freeway starting in 1974, but 32 years
on, drivers still have to pay to use it, giving the government NT$75
billion (US$2.34 billion) in excess of its toll collection target. He
urged the government to either stop collecting tolls or cut the tolls
by half.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>First lady Wu Shu-jen did not accept any
gift coupons from a department store, so how could there be so-called
serial numbers on the coupons, asked Tan Sun Chen, secretary-general
to President Chen Shui-bian, Tuesday, in response to a lawmaker's
allegation.</P>
      <P>The president's senior aide was incensed by opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Legislator Lee Chuan-chiao's allegation that the first lady had
accepted NT$8.8 million in gift certificates and used hundreds of
thousands of NT dollars of these "special coupons" which were
different from those issued by Pacific Sogo Department Store.</P>
      <P>He challenged the lawmaker to produce evidence that would prove
his allegation was not a lie. Otherwise, he said, "the lying lawmaker
should step down."</P>
      <P>In response to Lee's call on the first lady to make public the
serial numbers on her coupons, the secretary-general said this was
simply impossible since Wu did not take any gift coupons in the first
place. Lee was just trying to make a fool of the public, he said.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen expressed hope the media would be bold enough to
challenge lawmakers who make allegations to provide evidence, asking
them "based on what are you making these allegations?"</P>
      <P>The government is willing to take criticism, but the media should
not shift responsibility for "proving things" to the government
whenever it is alleged to have made a mistake, he added.</P>
      <P>He claimed President Chen was "absolutely not afraid" of having
his policies challenged by the people. However, he added, most
criticism of the government is seldom based on fact.</P>
      <P>He said he was concerned that Taiwan's society will become ever
more chaotic if lawmakers continue taking advantage of immunity

    <HEADLINE>NO ROOM FOR 'RESPECTIVE EXPLANATIONS' OF 'ONE CHINA': MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan's refusal to relay the government's hope
for Beijing's acknowledgement of "respective explanations" of the
"one China" definition reflects the fact there is no room for such a
statement, a government official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu made the
remarks during a meeting with the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union's (TSU) legislative caucus to discuss the government's response
to an economic forum between the KMT and the Communist Party of China
(CPC) in Beijing over the coming weekend.</P>
      <P>"A lot of Taiwanese would applaud Lien if he were willing to
speak out loudly for the Republic of China on the soil of the
People's Republic of China," Wu said.</P>
      <P>But Lien's rejection to do so is tantamount to a tacit consent
that there is no room for "respective explanations" of "one China" in
terms of Taiwan's relations with Beijing, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Since Beijing's enactment of the "Anti-Secession" Law in March
last year, the Chinese communist regime has been seeking to contend
with Taiwan over the law and the two press communiques that it signed
later that year with leaders of the KMT and the People First Party,
Wu said, stressing that "the MAC just cannot turn a blind eye to
Beijing's vigorous practice of its 'one China' principle."</P>
      <P>TSU Secretary-General Lo Chih-ming urged the KMT in a TSU
advisory meeting not to "sell its soul" by aligning and conspiring
with Taiwan's enemy.</P>
      <P>"The KMT must not ignore the interests of Taiwan's 23 million
people for the sake of private gain for the few," Lo urged.</P>
      <P>Lo asked KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou to discipline KMT lawmakers
not to go overboard by taking part in the Beijing forum, and also
lashed out at the ruling Democratic Progressive Party for having
failed to condemn the event.</P>
      <P>Lien will lead a group of more than 170 KMT lawmakers, experts
and business community representatives to attend the forum in Beijing
-- the first between the KMT and the CPC in nearly 60 years, after
Taiwan and China split in 1949 amid a civil war.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the CPC are slated to discuss cross-Taiwan Strait
cooperation on direct transport links, tourism, agriculture and
financial exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET: NO COMMENT ON FUZHOU'S NEW ECONOMIC POLICIES TOWARD TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Cabinet spokesman declined to comment
Monday on new economic measures by Fuzhou, Fujian province, toward
Taiwan after they were announced by the Chinese city's deputy mayor.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsang, head of the Government Information Office, noted
that one measure adopted by Fuzhou to enhance its economic and trade
cooperation with Taiwan is to allow more of Taiwan's agricultural
products to enjoy tariff-free treatment starting May this year.</P>
      <P>Cheng said it was unlikely that China would let the deputy mayor
of a second-tier city determine tariff matters on behalf of the
central government.</P>
      <P>He added that the Executive Yuan would not comment on Fuzhou's
new economic policies toward Taiwan at this stage, but will keep an
eye on developments.</P>
      <P>Fuzhou's Deputy Mayor Liang Jianyong announced in Hong Kong that
Fuzhou will increase the number of categories of Taiwan farm produce
that enjoy tariff-free treatment, allow Taiwanese people to set up
businesses in Fuzhou, encourage Chinese outside Fujian province to
tour Taiwan's two outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu, and expand
the area of an agricultural experimentation program with Taiwan to
cover the whole of Fujian province.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several legislators of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and high-ranking officials of the
Presidential Office accused Kuomintang (KMT) legislators Chiu
Yi and Lee Chuan-chiao Monday of making unfounded allegations.</P>
      <P>Chiu alleged that Presidential Office Deputy Secretary-General Ma
Yung-cheng was involved in the March 19, 2004 shooting incident of
the president and a financial scandal.</P>
      <P>DPP legislator Chen Chin-jun told media that Ma said he
would resign from the post if he was found to be acquainted with
"Doctor Yang" or had any relationship with the Fu-Ton group. On the
other hand, if Chiu cannot prove his allegations, he should step
down within three days, Chen quoted Ma as challenging Chiu.</P>
      <P>"Ma has been considering what to do next, including filing a
lawsuit against KMT legislator Chiu," Lee Nan-yang, the Presidential
Office spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen also noted
that Ma had denied all allegations made against him. Chen said
the unfounded allegations had already made a negative impact on
society.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chen said the Presidential Office was under
fire these days from opposition KMT Legislators Chiu and Lee
Chuan-chiao, and that it was something that should be taken seriously.
Lee also alleged that first lady Wu Shu-jen had accepted gift coupons
from a department store.</P>
      <P>On media speculation that the first lady was involved in a SOGO
gift coupon scandal, DDP Legislator Yeh Yi-jin said that the KMT

    <HEADLINE>KMT-CPC FORUM AIMED AT DEBASING DPP GOVERNMENT: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An economic forum soon to be held between
Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of
China (CPC) is one of Beijing's strategies to sow seeds of discord in
Taiwan and to debase the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government, a China policy planner said Monday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu made the remarks
while meeting with a visiting delegation of American academics
specializing in cross-Taiwan Strait affairs. The delegation was
headed by Nat Bellocchi, a former chairman of the American Institute
in Taiwan, which handles Taiwan-U.S. relations in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>Wu told his guests that he deeply regretted the KMT's refusal to
heed his call for KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan to refrain from
holding any closed-door meetings with Chinese President Hu Jintao --
who concurrently serves as the CPC general secretary -- during Lien's
upcoming Beijing visit.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former vice president, will head a large crowd of KMT
lawmakers, scholars and business executives to attend the first-ever
KMT-CPC economic forum slated for April 14-15 in Beijing.</P>
      <P>During Lien's previous visit to Beijing, he held a closed-door
meeting with Hu. Similar Lien-Hu talks are expected to take place
again during Lien's forthcoming visit. Despite the MAC's call for
having such a meeting proceed in public or broadcast live, KMT
authorities ruled out such a possibility.</P>
      <P>Wu said a closed-door meeting between an opposition bigwig like
Lien and the top leader of Taiwan's rival would set a bad example
that could be detrimental to Taiwan's young democracy.</P>
      <P>Visiting American academics shared Wu's view, saying that most
democratic countries would not tolerate such an action, which they
said may incite internal division and chaos.</P>
      <P>Wu said China has spared no effort to suppress Taiwan's
international presence, even when it involves non-governmental
international organizations. Regrettably, Wu said, the United States
has often failed to warn China that such actions have hindered the
development of cross-strait relations. As a result, he said, Taiwan's
anxiety over diplomatic isolation is growing ever stronger.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan is now a democracy, Wu said the United
States should generously support Taiwan's efforts to preserve its
liberal democratic lifestyle and political system.</P>

Joseph Wu told visiting European Parliament members Monday that the
so-called "1992 Consensus" advocated by Taiwan's main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) has never existed.</P>
      <P>Wu was referring to the KMT's claim that the two sides of the

but completely denies "one China" could mean the Republic of China as
the KMT perceives it.</P>
      <P>Wu also urged honorary KMT Chairman Lien Chan to publicly mention
the term the "Republic of China" (ROC) during his upcoming China

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE NIXES NOMINEE FOR TOP PROSECUTORIAL POST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan rejected President
Chen Shui-bian's nominee for the country's top prosecutorial post in
a vote Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 101 lawmakers voted in support of the appointment of
Hsieh Wen-ting, the Taiwan High Court prosecutor-general, to be the
next state public prosecutor-general, while 19 voted against the
nomination. There were a total of 88 invalid votes.</P>
      <P>As Hsieh failed to receive the endorsement of half of the
legislators present, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng announced that
the nomination was rejected.</P>
      <P>Despite the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) strong
urging to approve the appointment of Hsieh, the legislative caucus of
the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) decided Monday that the KMT would
not endorse the nomination. The legislative caucus of the People
First Party, an ally of the KMT, decided in a meeting prior to the
voting that it also would not support Hsieh's nomination.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang said Monday that the KMT
feels that Hsieh would not live up to Taiwan society's expectations,
particularly in the wake of a spate of incidents, including the 319
shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu,
the KRTC Thai workers riot and alleged corruption in the high-speed
railway development project.</P>
      <P>Pan claimed that the KMT caucus has no doubts about Hsieh's
integrity but that the party is worried that his weak personality
might mean he would flinch from probing corruption charges involving
high-ranking officials.</P>
      <P>In the past, the president had full power to appoint a state
public prosecutor-general. However, under the newly revised Court
Organic Law, the president's nomination requires the legislature's
consent. According to the law, an appointment must be approved by
half of the legislators present at a session, with at least one-third
of the lawmakers in the 221-seat legislature being in attendance for
the vote.</P>
      <P>Under the new law, the state public prosecutor-general will serve
only a single four-year term. The new measures are designed to
enhance the democratic legitimacy and independence of the
prosecutorial system.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
clarified Tuesday that the United Nations actually adopted the use of
simplified Chinese characters in all respects in 1971.</P>
      <P>The MOFA made the clarification in response to media reports that
the U.N. was planning to do so in 2008.</P>
      <P>Some media agencies reported recently that Chen Zhangtai, chief
of China's academy of practical linguistics, said the U.N. would use
only simplified characters in all the world body's documents from
2008. Simplified Chinese characters are used in China and Singapore,
while traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and
Malaysia.</P>
      <P>"The U.N. adopted the use of simplified characters in 1971 when
the People's Republic of China became a member. There has been no
period of time when traditional characters and simplified characters
have been used together in the U.N.," MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said.</P>
      <P>He made the comments after receiving verification from Taiwan's
representative office in New York.</P>
      <P>Lu explained that when China became a U.N. member in 1971,
Beijing demanded that the U.N. adopt the use of simplified
characters, but all the world body's documents produced before 1971
were not affected.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Air Force's Thunder Tiger Aerobatics
Team will perform stunning air shows this weekend in celebration of
the commissioning of two E2-K early warning and control aircraft, an
opposition lawmaker said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislator Lin Yu-fang said the Thunder Tiger
Aerobatics Team had originally planned to stage an air show at the
E2-K aircraft commissioning ceremony to be held at the Pingtung air
base in southern Taiwan Saturday.</P>
      <P>While the air base will open its barracks Sunday for the public
to view a static display of the two new U.S.-built aircraft, there
will not be any air show on that day.</P>
      <P>The decision drew complaints from local aircraft and air show
fans because the commissioning ceremony would not be open to regular
citizens, Lin said, adding that he then relayed the public complaints
to Air Force authorities.</P>
      <P>In response, Lin said, the Air Force command center has decided
to have the Thunder Tiger Aerobatics Team stage an additional air
show at 10 a.m. Sunday to coincide with the opening of the Pingtung
air base barracks to the public.</P>
      <P>Lin praised the Air Force command center for its quick response
to public opinion. He also expressed the hope that the Thunder Tiger
team can stage air shows once or twice every year to demonstrate its
superb flight skills and win local people's recognition and support
for the military. Lin suggested that the team present at least one
dazzling air show around Aug. 14 Air Force Day every year.</P>
      <P>Saturday's show will be the first of its kind after a six-year
hiatus. The Thunder Tiger team suspended all air shows six years ago
after then Defense Minister Tang Yiau-ming ordered military personnel
to focus on combat preparedness.</P>
      <P>Taiwan struck the E2-K procurement deal with the United States
last year. The Air Force has completed personnel training and
relevant preparations for the two warplanes' delivery, military
officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The commissioning of the two E2-Ks is expected to further beef up
Taiwan's air combat capabilities, the officials said, adding that
President Chen Shui-bian is likely to travel to the Pingtung air base
to review the commissioning ceremony.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
refuted Tuesday a media report that the Dominican Republic, which has
official diplomatic relations with Taiwan, is considering switching
ties to China.</P>
      <P>The Associated Press reported last week that Dominican Republic
Foreign Minister Carlos Morales Troncoso said in a TV interview April
6 that his country would see whether China or Taiwan is better for
it.</P>
      <P>"Morales only said that whether the Dominican Republic will
pursue relations with China depends on whether it suits the country's
national interests.... What the media has reported is not true, "
said Ko Jai-son, director of the MOFA's Department of Central and
South American Affairs.</P>
      <P>Ko pointed out that Morales said in the TV interview that the
Dominican Republic will fortify ties with countries in Asia, mainly
India, and that it wants to attract Indian business investment.</P>
      <P>Ko reiterated that Dominican Republic President Leonel Fernandez
said in public Jan. 13 this year that his country and Taiwan will
maintain a friendly relationship and the stance will not change.</P>
      <P>In related news, Ko revealed that President Chen Shui-bian will
visit Costa Rica for President-elect Oscar Arias Sanchez's

      <P>The Kaohsiung District Court has set

importation of Thai workers.</P>
      <P>Prominent defendants include Chen Che-nan, former deputy
secretary general to President Chen Shui-bian, and Chen Min-hsien,

in another scandal, was charged in this case with taking NT$94,700

    <HEADLINE>ANY CROSS-STRAIT TIES POSSIBLE IF CHINA GIVES UP ONE-PARTY RULE: CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday
that if China renounces its one-party rule and totalitarianism, there
is no ruling out of the possibility of developing any forms of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks when receiving a pro-Taiwan
delegation from the European Parliament at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen said he is adamantly opposed to the totalitarianism in
China, adding that the Chinese people have no democracy and no
freedom of speech, press or religion under Beijing's premise that
power comes from the barrel of a gun and stability overrides all
other considerations.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's trampling of human rights is well known, and its
squeezing of the media and access to the Internet is also
unacceptable," the president said.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that if China renounces its one-party rule and
totalitarianism, there is no ruling out the developing of any forms
of cross-strait relations with the consent of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>The president also took the chance to express his appreciation to
the European Parliament, noting that it has passed several major
resolutions in recent years to oppose a lifting of the E.U.'s
ban on arms sales to China, which was imposed shortly after the
Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes that the European Union will not lift its arms
embargo before the human rights situation improves in China.</P>
      <P>He also thanked the European Parliament, noting that it has
expressed the hope that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can
peacefully resolve their differences and disputes through dialogue
and that the free will of the 23 million people on Taiwan will be
respected.</P>
      <P>The European Parliament also urged China several times to remove
the missiles and military equipment targeting Taiwan, Chen
continued.</P>
      <P>The president asked the delegation members to exert their
influence in the European Parliament to sway the European Union
nations so that Taiwan can be successful in its bid to become an
observer at the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of
the World Health Organization, when it convenes its annual conference

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has asked
for a suspension of imports of ReNu multi-purpose contact lens
solution produced by U.S.-headquartered Bausch &amp; Lomb, a DOH official
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Sales of the ReNu MoisturLoc solution have been suspended in Hong
Kong, Singapore and the United States following reports over the past
several months suggesting that the product might be linked with an
unusually high incidence of fungal infection-caused keratitis among
contact lens wearers.</P>
      <P>Deputy DOH Director-General of Pharmaceutical Affairs Liu Li-ling
said that although approval has been granted for sale of the product
in Taiwan, it has not yet been imported.</P>
      <P>Out of health concerns, the DOH will not consider opening the
doors for the import of ReNu MoisturLoc solution until the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration releases the results of its investigation
into the safety of using the contact lens care product, Liu said.</P>
      <P>The culprit fungus, called fusarium, is commonly found in plant
material and soil in tropical and subtropical areas. Without eye drop

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTORIAL NOMINEE RESPECTS LEGISLATURE'S DECISION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hsieh Wen-ting, the nominee for the post
of state public prosecutor-general, said Tuesday that he respects the
Legislative Yuan's decision after his nomination was rejected.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who currently serves as prosecutor-general of the Taiwan
High Court, reiterated that the judiciary must be kept beyond the
reach of political influence and must never yield to political
pressure.</P>
      <P>If the leaders of the judicial system cannot stay neutral while
enforcing the law, it will be impossible for prosecutors to maintain
their credibility, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he has always stuck to this belief and will not
compromise it for the sake of any position, adding that he will
request that prosecutors get to the bottom of the various corruption
scandals that have been uncovered recently with disregard for any
political pressure.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he would accept a second nomination by President
Chen Shui-bian, Hsieh said he would not accept it for whatever reason
since his nomination has been turned down by the legislature.</P>
      <P>The nomination was rejected owing to objections from opposition
legislators led by those from the Kuomintang (KMT) who expressed
doubts about Hsieh's resolve to fight government corruption in the
wake of a series of scandals allegedly involving senior officials.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang said Tuesday that the
solidarity of the KMT and its ally, the opposition People First
Party, has been displayed in the voting down of Hsieh's nomination.</P>
      <P>While Pan expressed her approval for Hsieh's integrity and
professional ability, she said she doubts Hsieh's fortitude and
ability to resist political pressure.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said he hopes President Chen will
reconsider his choice for the post and that he expects the next state
public prosecutor-general will be one who is able to discriminate
between right and wrong.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmakers said they will continue to investigate into alleged
scandals such as those involving the electronic toll collection (ETC)
project and the procurement of Lafayette-class frigates from France
as well as the alleged insider stock trading involving Presidential
Office officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HEALTH CARE SPENDING WASTE COULD TOP NT$2.8 B. PER YEAR: BNHI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official from the Bureau of National
Health Insurance (BNHI) said Tuesday that the amount of waste in
health care spending could top NT$2.8 billion (US$86.4 million)
annually.</P>
      <P>Kao Tzu-shan, head of a medical screening section of the BNHI,
made the remarks based on BNHI statistics about redundant use of
prescription medicines and unnecessary medical exams.</P>
      <P>The BNHI focused on waste in 12 areas of health care, including
treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (including common
colds) , diabetes, hypertension, mental illnesses, as well as CT
scans, magnetic resonance imaging, dialysis, ultrasound examinations,
and gastroscope examinations.</P>
      <P>Kao cited several sensational examples of misuse of medical
resources, including some patients seeing doctors for common colds up
to six times a month and being prescribed more medicine than one
patient could possible use. Some people received six gastroscope
examinations in a single year, while others received four cataract
operations in the same period of time, he continued.</P>
      <P>In view of the huge amount of waste occurring in health care, the
BNHI has been urging hospitals and clinics over the last few years to
stop prescribing medicines or giving examinations that are not
strictly necessary.</P>
      <P>The efforts have borne some fruit, with hospitals and clinics
saving at least NT$1.2 billion during the 2004-2005 period, the
official added.</P>
      <P>Currently, patients with respiratory infections, including those
from common colds, are prescribed less medicine, while the number of
self-payment treatments for some illnesses have increased, according
to the official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PATIENTS WITH MENTAL DISORDERS LACK ADEQUATE CARE: KMT LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker with the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) called Tuesday for government aid to provide over
70,000 mentally diseased patients with adequate care and treatment at
rehabilitation centers.</P>
      <P>Lai Shyh-bao issued the call at a public hearing he held at the
Legislative Yuan. Hau Lung-bin, a former minister of the Department
of Health, and Yeh Ching-chuan, a former deputy mayor of Taipei, also
attended the activity to support Lai's call.</P>
      <P>More than 70,000 mentally challenged patients have not received
enough care and treatment across Taiwan due to a lack of
rehabilitation institutes in local residential communities, Lai said,
asking the government to offer incentives to assist in setting up
mental rehabilitation facilities in local neighborhoods.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the number of mentally diseased patients in
Taiwan is increasing at a pace faster than that of rehabilitation
centers in residential communities around the country.</P>
      <P>Lai pointed out that the government needs to review its mental
rehabilitation program that begun in 1997 on grounds that currently,
the government has 73,572 patients with mental disorders (not
hospitalized) registered around Taiwan, far more than the 1997
figure.</P>
      <P>Although being attended by family members at home is the best
arrangement for people who suffer a mental disease, Hau opined that
setting up a neighborhood care and assistance system nationwide is
needed urgently in view of the present-day social situation in which
both husband and wife must often work to support the family.</P>
      <P>According to a study, each patient would affect the lives of
seven family members, Hau said.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who is also a public health expert, called on the government
to subsidize the establishment of mental rehabilitation institutes in
local neighborhoods due to the expensive cost of opening such
facilities.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, April 11 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Yeh Chu-lan said
Tuesday that she is "not pessimistic" about the chance of the
scandal-sullied ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) winning in
the southern harbor city's year-end mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the remarks in response to reporters' questions about
whether an influence-pedaling scandal involving Chen Che-nan, former
deputy secretary general to President Chen Shui-bian, would hamper
the DPP's chances of retaining the Kaohsiung mayor seat in the
election.</P>
      <P>There are many factors -- including the popularity of the
political party, charisma of the candidate and the administration's
performance -- that may affect election results, Yeh said, noting she
has confidence in the DPP due to its excellent performance in the
city's development.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung has been developed into a modern city in the past eight
years under the administration of a DPP-led city government, a record
far better than that of the opposition Kuomintang, which had run the
city for 50 years before the DPP come to power, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Aasked whether she would run in the upcoming election as the DPP
candidate, Yeh, who is highly respected by DPP members, did not give
a clear answer but said "I am grateful" while thanking members of the
"pan-green" camp for their support.</P>
      <P>Stressing that taking on the post of acting mayor six months ago
was not to "enjoy the power" but to "shoulder" the responsibility in
the promotion of the city's development, Yeh expressed her gratitude
for Kaohsiung citizens' support.</P>

elaborate on his point recently in a television talk show that he
hosts, Lee said there have not been any outstanding figures in

      <P>These recent remarks by Lee again triggered much displeasure
among Singaporeans, with some criticizing Lee as "bullshitting" on TV

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and first lady Wu
Shu-jen filed a private criminal complaint Tuesday against a
legislator of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), claiming that he
defamed them with "false" allegations of receiving illegal political
contributions and department store gift vouchers.</P>
      <P>The first couple's lawyer, Ku Li-wei, filed the complaint at the
Taipei District Court on their behalf against Legislator Lee
Chuan-chiao, who claimed at a news conference last weekend that the
president had received political contributions from a convicted
economic criminal through a ranking official at the Presidential
Office, while the first lady had received NT$8.8 million in gift
vouchers from Pacific Sogo Department Store.</P>
      <P>Before filing the complaint, the president and first lady had
denied the allegations twice through Presidential Office spokesmen
and demanded that Lee apologize within three days or face a slander
suit.</P>
      <P>Lee's allegations against the first couple came a day after Chen
Che-nan, a former Presidential Office deputy secretary-general, was
detained after admitting he took NT$7.1 million from Liang Po-hsun,
who had asked Chen to use his influence to get him off the legal
hook.</P>
      <P>Liang, 50, a former vice chairman of the Bank of Overseas
Chinese, was convicted in November 2002 for borrowing NT$5.3 billion
illegally from several of the bank's branches through dummy accounts
in 1996-97. The Taiwan High Court sentenced him to one year in
prison, but while applying for a deferred prison sentence in March
2003, he absconded abroad and remained at large in China, Hong Kong,
Japan and South Africa.</P>
      <P>He was also sentenced to one year and two months in a separate
case for committing forgery in real estate deals while he was
chairman of the Hsinchiehchung Construction Co.</P>
      <P>Liang was indignant that Chen took his money but failed to
deliver what he had promised. He returned to Taiwan April 2 with
evidence against Chen, although he knew he would be arrested and sent
to jail to serve his sentence.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislator has indicated that he would welcome the first

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A few days prior to a forum in Beijing
between the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of
China (CPC) , former President Lee Teng-hui blasted the KMT for
working with the communists through economic means to bring Taiwan to
a "painless death."</P>
      <P>From former KMT Chairman Lien Chan's meeting with Chinese
President Hu Jintao in 2005 to the upcoming KMT-CPC forum, scheduled
for April 14-15, Lee said, the KMT has been "selling out Taiwan and
selling out the Republic of China." The KMT is acting as an
accomplice in China's attempts to annex Taiwan, he charged.</P>
      <P>Lee ridiculed Lien for "not daring to make a statement in front
of Hu" about the KMT's "one China" position that Taiwan sees as "the
Republic of China." Instead, Hu made it clear that the "one China"
principle refers only to the People's Republic of China, Lee added.</P>
      <P>He accused the KMT of fabricating its so-called "1992 consensus"
to fool the people of Taiwan, an act he described as "unacceptable."</P>
      <P>Lee said the KMT has been criticizing the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) for widening the income gap and causing
tragedies in families whose members are hounded by heavy credit-card
debts.</P>
      <P>But at the same time, he continued, the KMT -- the party he once
led -- has been advocating allowing Chinese investment in Taiwan and
launching direct transport links across the Taiwan Strait, policy
proposals that he claimed will "push Taiwan to the verge of
destruction."</P>
      <P>By holding a joint forum with the CPC, the KMT is joining hands
with the communists to use economic means that would lead to the
euthanasia of Taiwan's sovereignty, Lee said, urging the people to
stop the KMT from creating such a danger for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in a statement read by Huang Chao-tang at a

      <P>Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of modern
companies will find themselves at the forefront of the innovation
war, which will be a big challenge, two Taiwanese CEOs said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"This is an age of competition, no matter what sector you're in.
The product life cycle is as short as months. Innovation is not only
inevitable but also the only way to move forward. And the CEOs are
standing on the front line, " said Vincent Lin, President of Fuhwa
Venture Capital and the Senior Vice President of Fuhwa Financial
Holding Company.</P>
      <P>"The CEO can't hide in his little hole. He has to embrace as many
new technologies, keep making as many friends and visit as many
places as possible in order to be innovative, " said Lin.</P>
      <P>But "an innovation is more than just a crazy idea, it has to be
feasible," said Charles Kao, General Manager of Innotera Memories.</P>
      <P>To be innovative, a company has to sort out its core competence
in the very beginning. "The key is know yourself. Go with what you
have and what you're good at," Kao said.</P>
      <P>"And don't be afraid of changes. Any innovation, personnel-wise
or operation-wise, means you have to move in a different direction,
which is against human nature of wanting to be stable, " according to
Lin.</P>
      <P>Both Lin and Kao agreed that business innovation is a "top-down"
process in most companies.</P>
      <P>"A good leader has to be someone who is optimistic, encouraging,
curious, honest, always progressing, and profit-motivated," Kao said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUALIEN COUNTY WANTS COMPENSATION FOR RICE EXPORTS TO JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government should compensate
the deficit that a farmers' association in Hualien county absorbs in
its exports to Japan of locally grown "Fu Lee" rice, according to a
county official.</P>
      <P>According to Tu Lee-hua, director of Hualien county's agriculture
bureau, the farmers' association in Fuli, Hualien county has exported
high end "Fu Lee" rice to Japan since 2004 in line with the central
government's policy to help Taiwan produced rice make inroads into
the quality-conscious Japanese market.</P>
      <P>As "Fu Lee" rice is exported to Japan at a much lower price than
its production cost, the local farmers' association has to absorb a
noticeable price shortfall, resulting in losses to the farmers'
association, Tu said, adding that Hualien County Magistrate Hsieh
Shen-san also viewed it as something extremely unfair to local
farmers and residents.</P>
      <P>"Fu Lee" rice is exported to Japan at a price of NT$22 per
kilogram, Tu pointed out, noting that the local farmers' association
purchases the rice from local growers at around NT$25 per kilogram to
ensure their earnings and that the difference between them was
absorbed by the farmers' association.</P>
      <P>Although the local farmers' association is willing to cooperate
with the central government's policy, Tu said, a lack of profits has
led to a heavy financial burden on the local unit and it keenly hopes
that the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) will help reduce
the financial strain by providing it with reasonable subsidies.</P>
      <P>Tu also criticized COA officials for falling short of asking for
a reasonable price for "Fu Lee" rice in negotiations with the
Japanese side, lamenting that the failure is the root cause of the
association's mounting losses.</P>
      <P>Amid a central government drive to sell Taiwan's high quality
rice to Japan since 2004, "Fu Lee" rice -- produced in eastern
Hualien county -- was the only variety that passed a total of 127
tests for exports to Japan, Tu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan produced rice has gained greater popularity in Japan in
recent years, in particular the varieties cultivated in eastern
Taiwan, an official of the COA's Agriculture and Food Agency said
Monday, adding that he believes Taiwan's fine quality rice will be
able to seize a bigger slice of the highly stringent Japanese market
in two or three years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is one of the 15 countries whose rice has been approved by
the Japanese authorities to enter the Japanese market, he said.</P>

      <P>The totalitarian system of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) is intolerable in the international community
and has done the greatest damage to the freedom, democracy, human
rights and peace pursued by the world, President Chen Shui-bian
claimed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during talks with Marshall Islands
President Kessai Note, who is in Taiwan on a state visit.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the greatest differences between Taiwan and China
are their lifestyles and political systems, with Taiwan a country
that practices democracy and freedom and China ruled by a
dictatorship under the domination of the CPC.</P>
      <P>The fact that Taiwan and the Marshall Islands are both followers
of freedom, democracy, human rights and peace has brought the two
countries closely together, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his appreciation for the Marshall Islands'
long-term, firm support for Taiwan's bid to participate in
international organizations such as the United Nations and the World
Health Organization and said he believes the Marshall Islands, under
Note's leadership, will continue to offer its support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Note thanked Chen for inviting him to visit Taiwan and for the
assistance and support that Taiwan has offered the people of the
Marshall Islands.</P>
      <P>He said his country will fully support Taiwan's bids to take part
in international organizations and that he believes Taiwan will be
able to participate in the international community freely.</P>
      <P>Note urged the international community to officially recognize
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, Chen presided over a formal welcoming ceremony

    <HEADLINE>IMPORT SAFEGUARD MEASURES ON TOWELS SHOULD BE REASONABLE: ITC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Trade Commission (ITC)
under the Ministry of Economic Affairs decided Tuesday to elevate
tariffs on Chinese towels dumped on Taiwan's market, but stressed
that the import safeguard measures must be "reasonable."</P>
      <P>ITC officials made the remarks after a commission meeting was
held on whether to adopt import safeguard measures against Chinese
towels, which are being sold in Taiwan at abnormally low prices.</P>
      <P>Hung Teh-sheng, president of the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research and also an ITC member, presided at the meeting.</P>
      <P>Although the meeting was prolonged from one hour to two, the ITC
members did not reach a final decision on the duty rate, and expect
that conclusion to be made at another meeting April 14.</P>
      <P>Domestic towel manufacturers -- led by Taiwan Solidarity Union
legislators -- went to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to present
their petitions.</P>
      <P>According to ITC officials, domestic towel producers are
demanding the government elevate current tariffs of 10.5 percent on
Chinese towels to 189 percent -- or a 189 percent tariff on Chinese
towel products exceeding the annual quota of three million tons.</P>
      <P>ITC member Huang Chih-tien, who is also a professor at National
Taiwan University, noted that the commission has decided to elevate
tariff rates on Chinese towels instead of adopting the tariff rate
quota (TRQ) , in which imports above the quota threshold will face a
much higher tariff as the TRQ will involve a more complicated
calculation.</P>
      <P>Huang said the import relief measure against Chinese towels will
last three years, and that the tariff rate will return to the current
10.5 percent after three years.</P>
      <P>In response to queries about the exact tariff rate on Chinese
towel products, Huang stressed the import safeguard measures were
aimed at preventing or compensating for the losses resulted from a
market disorder caused by imported goods; therefore the import duty
should be maintained at a reasonable level, he said.</P>

BANKS HIRING FEWER GANGSTERS TO COLLECT DEBTS: MOI

Taipei, April 11 (CNA) Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang said
Tuesday that incidents of banks hiring gangsters to collect on credit
card debt defaulters have decreased over the past six weeks.

Lee made the remarks in a review of the results of telephone
hotlines that were established in late February for the public to
report on improper methods used by banks to intimidate credit card
defaulters.

He said that out of 2,776 calls received, only 23 calls involved
violent methods related to organized crime, intimidation, obstruction
of freedom, vandalism, fraud and assault.

"The practice of using improper methods to collect debts has been
checked, which is why the number of calls received daily has
decreased to the level of less than one call per day," he said.

Lee said, however, that the hotlines will stay open, although the
20 existing lines will be cut to eight.

In addition, Lee said the National Police Agency has taken the
initiative to crack down on underground loansharks, as well as
illegal debt collection companies. A total of 301 people involved in
the illegal practice have been turned over to the authorities for
prosecution.

The hotlines and the crackdown were instigated by the government
as part of its effort to help "credit card slaves" in the wake of
increasing reports of suicide and robberies motivated by the heavy
pressure of repaying outstanding credit card debts. Other measures

    <HEADLINE>BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION A TOP PRIORITY FOR COMPANY SUCCESS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 11 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Business model innovation is the most important 
factor in determining the success and revenue of modern enterprises,
according to responses from 765 Chief Executive Officers (CEO) in a
worldwide survey released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Conducted by International Business Machines Corporation (IBM ) ,
the biennial survey "The Global CEO Study" found that 28 percent of
CEOs will focus on business model innovation, relatively lower than
42 percent who said they would focus on products/services/markets
innovation and another 30 percent that would stress operational
innovation.</P>
      <P>However, after a more in-depth study of the responses from 200
companies, IBM concluded that business model innovation was the key
factor in helping usher in more revenue for enterprises.</P>
      <P>"The result tells us that emerging companies are those that can
master business model innovations," said Paul Liu, Associate Partner
of IBM Taiwan Corporation.</P>
      <P>Among CEOs who regard business model innovation as the priority,
66 percent said they would implement organizational reform while 53
percent said they will seek to establish a strategic partnership.</P>
      <P>Collaborative innovation is also indispensable for businesses,
the survey found; meanwhile, it takes the full devotion and planning
of upper-level management for innovation to be successful.</P>
      <P>Eighty percent of CEOs believed it was important to integrate
technology and business. Sixty-five percent of respondents said they
would pay attention to and spend more energy on innovation in the
next three years to embrace the trend of globalization.</P>
      <P>The survey was based on responses of 765 CEOs from 200 companies
representing 20 different sectors across three continents -- Europe,
Asia and the Americas.</P>
      <P>Eighty-six respondents were from the Greater China region,
including 11 from Taiwan. The survey was first conducted in 2004.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 11 (CNA)
(By Timothy Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no need for the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to flinch from "one China, with each side of
the Taiwan Strait free to interpret its meaning" and President Chen
Shui-bian needs just to recognize it, without Chinese President Hu
Jintao's consent, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Ma also said KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan will not forward any
message to Hu from Chen when they meet in Beijing later this month.</P>
      <P>Chen said earlier this month he would "absolutely respect" if Hu
accepts the so-called "1992 consensus, " which the KMT claims means
"one China, with each side of the strait having its own
interpretations."</P>
      <P>But the Presidential Office's official records about Chen's
promise to "respect" the 1992 consensus seem to have been erased, and
the Presidential Office is suspected of having falsified history,
according to Ma.</P>
      <P>Several high-ranking officials, including Chen and DPP lawmakers,
have urged Lien to publicly mention the term the "Republic of China"
and "one China, respective interpretations" during his upcoming visit
to China, but Lien has rejected the requests.</P>

      <P>An opposition lawmaker sued by the first
family for defaming them said Tuesday that he would present his
evidence in court and he urged the first family to face justice in
person.</P>
      <P>Lee Chuan-chiao of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) alleged that

of which have been used by members of her family at Pacific Sogo
Department Store in Taipei.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and his wife filed a private criminal
complaint against Lee for defaming them with what they claimed are
false allegations. Through their lawyer, Ku Li-hsiung, the couple
said they would respect the judge's request for them to appear in
court if need be.</P>
      <P>Lee said he had anticipated the first family's reaction to his
accusation and that he would produce further evidence to support his
allegations.</P>
      <P>During a press conference in Taipei, Lee called a person
identified only as Miss Huang, who tipped him off about the
allegations of the first family using the vouchers at the department
store.</P>
      <P>Huang said over the phone that she saw the president's daughter
Chen Hsing-yu and her husband buying bedding at the department store
nearly four years ago and paying with vouchers.</P>

be completed in six months.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CALLS FOR 'NO DOUBLE STANDARDS' IN DISCIPLINING PROSECUTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice should not have
double standards in meting out discipline to prosecutors, the
legislative caucus of the opposition People First Party (PFP) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The PFP legislative caucus made the appeal to lend support to
Hualien district prosecutor Lee Tzu-chun one day after Lee joined
around 1,000 demonstrators outside the Legislative Yuan when
lawmakers were reviewing Hseih Wen-ting's nomination as the nation's
top prosecutor and Vice Justice Minister Lee Chin-yung demanded that
the Hualien Prosecutors' Office convene a meeting to discuss whether
to discipline Lee. Lawmakers vetoed Hsieh as the state public
prosecutor-general in a vote.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Lu Hsueh-chang pointed out that Liu
Cheng-wu, chief prosecutor of the Taoyuan Prosecutors' Office,
stumped for President Chen Shu-bian when the latter sought
re-election as Taipei mayor in 1998. Liu was then a Taipei district
prosecutor.</P>
      <P>"Liu's violation was even more serious as he openly interfered in
election activities in his capacity as a civil servant," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu pointed out that Council of Agriculture Chairman Su Jia-chyuan
also protested against the deteriorating law and order situation in
Taichung City when he was the interior minister on the eve of mayoral
election in the central Taiwan city in December 2005 in a bid to help
the candidate of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>"Ministers taking to the streets is the worst example, " Lu said,
urging the Ministry of Justice not to have double standards in
disciplining Lee.</P>
      <P>Lee became an instant celebrity when he summoned President Chen
Shui-bian to testify before him in a probe into an alleged
vote-buying case involving a DPP candidate for Hualien county
magistrate last year. The outspoken prosecutor has recently appeared
on TV political commentary programs to criticize the government.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN RANKS 17TH IN WORLD IN TRADE FOR 2005: WTO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April  11 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan was the world's 17th largest
trading nation in 2005, down two notches from the previous year,
according to the annual world trade report released Tuesday by the
World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports amounted to US$196.6 billion in 2005, up 8
percent over the year-earlier level, making Taiwan the 16th largest
exporter in the world and the sixth largest exporter in Asia, behind
China, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's export value registered 8 percent year-on-year growth,
ahead of Japan's 5 percent, but behind China's 28 percent,
Singapore's 16 percent, Hong Kong's 12 percent and South Korea's 10
percent.</P>
      <P>Owing to a 10-percent increase in the total value of imports into
Taiwan, the country's trade surplus slid from US$14.5 billion in 2004
to US$10.3 billion in 2005.</P>
      <P>The WTO report said Taiwan's performance, which relies heavily on
the export of electronic products, could have been affected by the
slowdown in the global demand for computer and electronic products.</P>
      <P>Also, soaring oil and raw material prices caused an increase in
the costs of imports, which brought down Taiwan's trade surplus, the
report said.</P>
      <P>In 2005, world trade registered a growth rate of 6 percent, which
was much lower than the 9 percent recorded for the previous year. The
trade value, however, rose 13 percent in 2005 and topped US$10
trillion for the first time.</P>
      <P>China maintained its status as the world's third largest trading
nation in 2005, with its gross domestic product posting a growth rate
of 10 percent and its trade surplus amounting to US$102 billion.</P>
      <P>The WTO predicted that world trade will expand 7 percent this
year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN WON'T OPT FOR INDEPENDENCE: ACADEMIA SINICA HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, April 12 (CNA)
(By Charles Kang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
said in Singapore Tuesday that he firmly believes that President Chen
Shui-bian is a rational man who will not opt for independence in
terms of Taiwan's future.</P>
      <P>Speaking during an interview with two Singaporean media outlets,
the visiting Lee said that Chen putting forth the "five noes"
doctrine in his 2000 inaugural address and repeating it in his 2004
inauguration speech clearly reflected his intention of improving
bilateral relations with China.</P>
      <P>Chen pledged in May 2000 that as long as Beijing has no intention
of using military force against Taiwan, he will not declare
independence, not change Taiwan's name, not add the state-to-state
theory into the Constitution, not promote a referendum on the issue
of independence versus unification, and not scrap the National
Unification Guidelines during his time in office.</P>
      <P>The president has been unwavering in upholding his pledge and has
even tried to break the impasse across the Taiwan Strait via the
United States, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said, Chen's many gestures of holding out olive
branches to the Beijing leadership have not been recognized nor
appreciated.</P>
      <P>Lee said it would be understandable if President Chen's stance
were to change as his goodwill toward China has been consistently
ignored for so many years.</P>
      <P>Lee called for the Beijing leadership to show some respect to the
people of Taiwan and the administration in Taiwan if it wants to
defuse cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>To improve relations with Taiwan, Lee said, Beijing needs to talk
to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , adding that if
Beijing is unwilling to talk to the DPP, it should at least talk to
some private groups in Taiwan, rather than engaging in talks only
with the opposition "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>Lee, co-winner of the 1986 Nobel Prize in chemistry, also said it
is perplexing that after having visited China almost every year since
1978 to help raise China's scientific research standards, Chinese
authorities abruptly ceased contact with him after the year 2000,
labeling him a supporter of Taiwan independence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Five Taiwan companies are presenting
their new products and technology at the BIO2006 being held at the
Hyatt Regency McCormick Place in Chicago April 9-12, featuring
traditional Chinese medicine and gene modification for plants.</P>
      <P>Organized by the Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TETRA) , the five companies have joined Taiwan's leading
biotechnology research institutes in presenting the Taiwan Pavilion
at the world's largest biotechnology exhibition.</P>
      <P>Four of the five companies are presenting agro-bio products and
technology, namely the Sinphar Group, Well Shine Biotechnology
Development Co., Microbio Co., and Exon Science Inc.</P>
      <P>The Sinphar Group is presenting products which feature the purity
of the efficacious extracts from green tea. A Sinphar report
indicates that the products are expected to reach the market in 2007
as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the
medicine-grade ingredient.</P>
      <P>The Well Shine Biotechnology Development Co. is introducing
cultivation techniques for Antrodia, a well-known source of
traditional Chinese medicine for improving the body's
immunocompetence.</P>
      <P>While health food has been growing in popularity around the
world, Microbio Co. is expecting that its new product, made from
fermented soybeans, which can enhance the activity of natural killer
cells in the human body, can make its way smoothly onto the world
market.</P>
      <P>Exon Science Co. has developed advanced gene modification
techniques for orchids with a grant from the Council of Agriculture
under the Executive Yuan. The new techniques allow the implanting of
modified genes into orchids to help the plants resist cold or blight.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture delegate to the exhibition gave a
briefing on Taiwan's agriculture biotechnology at a seminar Monday,
saying that the council is undertaking six major projects, including
orchid breeding and gene modification for animals and plants. The
projects involve government agencies and research institutes as well

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FLEXIBLE TOWARDS CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taiwan, April 12 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is holding an open attitude
towards the expansion of cross-Taiwan Strait charter services and
will not rule out any possibilities as long as they are arranged by
both sides through negotiations, Premier Su Tseng-chang said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Such possibilities could include the launch of cross-strait cargo
charter flights, the institutionalization of cross-strait passenger
charter flights for special holidays and the launch of cross-strait
weekend charter services, Su said.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during a weekly Cabinet meeting, after
listening to a briefing by Mainland Affairs Council Minister Joseph
Wu on the status and outlook of cross-strait economic and trade
interactions.</P>
      <P>Su said in handling cross-strait affairs, the government must
protect Taiwan's identity and the country's initiative in
policy-making and should let the people understand the government's
policy.</P>
      <P>The government must request negotiations with China on any
matters involving the exercise of government authority, Su said.</P>
      <P>Su instructed authorities concerned to arrange for talks with
Chinese authorities on issues related to cross-strait economic
exchanges, cross-strait charter flights, and visits to Taiwan by
Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Also, the authorities concerned should set a reasonable timetable
for the completion of these talks to display the government's
positive and pragmatic attitude in handling cross-strait affairs, he
said.</P>
      <P>According to Su, Beijing has been delaying talks with Taipei on
the issue of allowing more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan, although
Taiwan has since 2001 permitted the entry of Chinese tourists meeting
certain criteria.</P>
      <P>Su said proper planning is required before the measure can be
implemented because this issue involves not only the availability of
enough hotels, but also the exchange of Chinese yuan, the problem of
Chinese tourists overstaying their visas, and the responsibilities of
travel agencies.</P>
      <P>For example, Su said, the U.S. government has recently confirmed
that there are more than 39,000 Chinese citizens who have overstayed
their visas in the United States, with more than 8,000 in detention
centers, a problem which has caused a heavy financial burden on the
U.S. government.</P>
      <P>Unless a system for tourist identity authentication is
established between Taiwan and China, there will be no way for the
government to resolve the problem of illegal immigrants, which will
threaten national security and increase social costs, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC REP TO U.S. VOWS TO SAFEGUARD TAIWAN INTERESTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Representative to
the United States David Ta-wei Lee said Tuesday he will do his best
to safeguard Taiwan's interests when Chinese President Hu Jintao
visits the United States April 18-22.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the representative office has kept in close
communications with the U.S. government, expressing Taiwan's concerns
over Hu's visit. He added that Washington, based on goodwill, has
also communicated with his office for its understanding of the
expected meeting between Hu and U.S. President George W. Bush April
20.</P>
      <P>The representative office has done everything to prevent any
possible harm to Taiwan's interests, Lee said, although it cannot
guarantee that there will be no surprises.</P>
      <P>"The representative office will work toward not letting the
Bush-Hu meeting affect the interests of Taiwan and its 23 million
people," he added.</P>
      <P>On whether President Chen Shui-bian's recent announcement to
cease the functions of the National Unification Council (NUC) , a
symbolic body whose goal is eventual unification with China, will
become an issue at the Bush-Hu meeting, Lee said that the U.S. and
Taiwan have agreed that the NUC issue should be temporarily "put
aside."</P>
      <P>"What the representative office will do is work to prevent the
things that the public does not want to see or take place, " he
further said.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the U.S. has a consistent and long-standing policy
toward the Taiwan issue, and as far as he knows, the U.S. side will
"give its standard answer" if China raises any questions on the
issue. The U.S. has said repeatedly that its policy toward Taiwan is
based on the three communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on the largest-ever Chinese trade delegation currently
visiting the United States to pave the way for the Bush-Hu meeting,
Lee said that he has experienced a sense of "deja vu."</P>
      <P>The visit by the Chinese delegation, led by Vice Premier Wu Yi,
is expected to include 13 states and result in multimillion-dollar
orders for Boeing and Motorola.</P>
      <P>With China recording a US$200 billion trade surplus with the
United States in 2005 and its desire to cool the protectionist
sentiment in the U.S. Congress, Lee said he has felt a sense of "deja
vu."</P>
      <P>He noted that in order to cut the huge trade surplus with the
United States in the late 1970s, Taiwan also sent large procurement
delegations to the U.S. Although with the structural changes, it is
not as easy for Taiwan to send such a large trade delegation to the
U.S. for "policy" procurement nowadays as in the past, he continued.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that Wu's delegation has targeted certain
constituencies of individual congressmen to purchase items that China
doesn't really need so as to court these congressmen.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should absolutely take heed, although there is no need to
panic, " Lee said, adding that Taiwan's edge lies in its freedom and
democracy and a political system that is relatively more mature.</P>
      <P>"As long as Taiwan sticks to these values, the U.S. Congress will
continue to support Taiwan," Lee said.</P>

    <TEXT>La Repubblica: Berlusconi proposes grand
coalition.

Facing a uncertain result of the April 9-10 general election
and a loomed defeat, Premier Silvio Berlusconi proposed Tuesday
that the ruling and opposition camps form a grand coalition.
Opposition Union leader Romano Prodi apparently rejected the
proposal by saying that the center-left coalition can rule the

    <HEADLINE>ICG TO CHANGE TAIWAN'S TITLE TO HELP CHINA'S MEMBERSHIP: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed worry
Wednesday that the International Crisis Group (ICG) might opt to
change Taiwan's designation in the worldwide conflict prevention
organization in order to facilitate China's admission.</P>
      <P>Chen said it would be unfair for Taiwan if the ICG changes
Taiwan's designation and the title used at the ICG Council simply
because China is taking part in the group, after Taiwan has been one
of the major contributors to the organization.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a meeting with two
parliamentarians from Belgium at the Presidential Office. One of them
was Alain Destexhe, a Belgian parliamentarian and former ICG
president, who has been a staunch supporter of Taiwan and a major
force in Belgium behind Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Assembly (WHA) as an observer.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his hope that Destexhe will bring his sense of
righteousness into full play to help prevent Taiwan from being
excluded from the ICG as a result of China's admission.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the president also noted that Beijing has persistently
blocked Taiwan from joining the WHA, the decision-making body of the
World Health Organization (WHO) , and that China's ambassador to
Belgium, Zhang Qiyue, has exerted pressure on the Belgian parliament
to make it drop discussions on Taiwan's WHA bid.</P>
      <P>Chen called for Destexhe to help revive the proposal to support
Taiwan's WHA bid. "It would be the international community's loss if
Taiwan continues to be excluded from global disease-prevent
networks," he said.</P>
      <P>The president also said the European Union should not consider
lifting its arms embargo against China on the grounds that human
rights protection has not improved in China. Besides, he added, China
has deployed nearly 800 missiles targeting Taiwan and has passed its
"Anti-Secession Law" that codifies China's longstanding threat to
attack Taiwan if it thinks Taiwan is seeking formal independence.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that it is natural that there are differences
across the Taiwan Strait and said the differences should be solved
only via peaceful dialogue, and that military or non-peaceful means
should never be an option.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added, because of China's totalitarian regime,
many issues are complicated ideologically, leaving the world's
democratic communities "astounded."</P>
      <P>Chen said the Beijing leadership believes that only the barrel of
guns can protect power. In a society where politics and party are
entwined, with the Chinese communist party forces in total control of
politics, Chen said, the Beijing leadership believes that only
"stability" will prevail.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he said, the Chinese authorities exert
heavy control on society, with no human rights, no freedom of speech,
no freedom of journalism, no freedom of religion, and where even
Internet communications or media operations are censored, tampered
with and kept under tight surveillance.</P>
      <P>The president argued that the people and government of Taiwan do
not oppose the people of China, but are definitely opposed to the
Chinese communists' totalitarianism.</P>
      <P>He said the biggest gap between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait lies in the difference in lifestyles and social systems. That
is also the reason why the Taiwan people are firm in choosing their
current path, though a harder one, toward peace, freedom and
democracy, he added.</P>

      <P>U.S. officials do not see eye-to-eye

officials were interested in some of Ma's ideas but did not agree

American Institute in Taiwan, who briefed the Taipei authorities on
Ma's visit and through U.S. officials from the White House, the
departments of defense and state and the National Security Council,
who briefed Lee on Ma's activities in America.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan should make clear to Beijing that the party's
definition of "one China" refers to the "Republic of China" during
his upcoming China visit, a Cabinet official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang was referring to the KMT's
claim that Taiwan and China reached a consensus in 1992 that both
sides can interpret the meaning of "one China" separately. He made
the remarks during a news conference held after a weekly Cabinet
meeting when asked how the government will react to an upcoming
economic forum between the KMT and the Communist Party of China
(CPC).</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, if Lien recognizes the existence of the ROC
and does not negate the legitimacy of the ROC government, he should
tell China to stop its diplomatic suppression and military threats
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cheng reiterated that any matters involving the exercise of
government authority must be dominated by the governments on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait or organizations authorized by the
governments.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former vice president, will head a delegation of KMT
lawmakers, academics and business executives to attend the first-ever
KMT-CPC economic forum slated for April 14-15 in Beijing.</P>
      <P>During Lien's previous visit to Beijing, he held a closed-door

    <TEXT>
      <P>Producers of Chinese medicines must abide
by set procedures and apply for GMP (good manufacturing practice)
certification of compliance before they can sell their wares legally
in Taiwan, an official of the Department of Health (DOH) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin I-hsin, head of the Committee on Chinese Medicine and
Pharmacy under the DOH, made the remarks in response to an appeal by
Legislator Tseng Tsang-teng of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
earlier that day for stricter regulation of illegal Chinese
medicines, claiming that such medicine is easily available on the
streets or over the Internet.</P>
      <P>Lin said that China started to require GMP certification for its
medicines three years ago, but still has difficulty in controlling
quality.</P>
      <P>However, Lin said the DOH "will not rule out the possibility of
accepting Chinese applications to export medicines to Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has measures governing the application or
certification of foreign medicines, adding that if individual
pharmaceutical manufacturers in China apply, they should provide full
information as well as allowing the Taiwan government to send
representatives to inspect their plants.</P>
      <P>He stressed that even if China determines that its medicine
manufacturers have complied with the GMP system, they will still have
to be examined by Taiwan inspectors.</P>
      <P>Liao Chi-chou, head of the Bureau of Pharmaceutical Affairs under
the DOH, said that no Chinese medicine manufactures have received GMP
certification so far and urged people to support Taiwan-produced
medicines, which he said are "cheap, safe and effective."</P>

      <P>FORMOSAT-3, Taiwan's third satellite
project, is scheduled to be launched from the Vandenberg Air Force
Base in California April 15, a project manager from Taiwan's National
Space Program Office (NSPO) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chen Cheng-yi, manager of the FORMOSAT-3 project, said that
after the satellite is launched into orbit and becomes fully
operational, it will provide a powerful databank for climatology and
atmospheric research.</P>
      <P>The international meteorological community is eagerly awaiting
the launch because it will be the world's first climate monitoring
and forecasting system using a constellation of six microsatellites
to collect atmospheric remote sensing data for operational weather
prediction, said Chen.</P>
      <P>FORMOSAT-3 is expected to significantly enhance Taiwan's
cooperation with the international community, thereby improving
Taiwan's international image, he added.</P>
      <P>FORMOSAT-3, also known as Constellation Observing System for

800 km above the earth's surface, Chen said, adding that the project
is an academic research program with the goal of developing an
advanced system for real-time monitoring of the globe's climate.</P>
      <P>After it becomes fully operational, FORMOSAT-3 will be capable of
providing some 2,500 pieces of meteorological data in every 24-hour

      <P>Taiwan is not suffering from a sugar
shortage and the state-run Taiwan Sugar Company (Taisugar) can import
sugar urgently if the need arises, Vice Economic Affairs Minister
Chen Ruey-long said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan consumes an average of 570,000 tons of
sugar annually. Taisugar currently supplies around 1,500 tons of
white refined sugar per day, more than 1,400 tons of which is to
satisfy actual demand.</P>
      <P>Taisugar also has no limitations on its supply of liquid
or B-grade sugars, which are estimated to have a daily demand of 700
tons.</P>
      <P>Even if there is no shortage of sugar on the market, sugar
importers could still be reluctant to sell and are sitting on their
stocks waiting for a better time to sell amid high world sugar
prices.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taisugar should keep an eye on the market situation and
make necessary adjustments allowing it to import sugar urgently if
needed.</P>
      <P>The ministry has not prohibited Taisugar from hiking its prices,
Chen said, adding that it has only asked Taisugar to act in line with
other state-owned enterprises, which is to seek new revenues and to
save expenditure.</P>
      <P>If there is still a need to reflect world sugar prices, then the
ministry will agree to Taisugar's request to raise prices, Chen

      <P>The government's second phase of financial
reform is a policy that is not going to be to halted and the
government will be even more scrupulous when implementing it, Vice
Premier Tsai Ing-wen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks in response to media reports that the
Executive Yuan has won approval from the Presidential Office to put a
halt to the second phase of financial reform because of widespread
worry that big conglomerates are trying to snatch control of the
nation's financial industry.</P>
      <P>As to concerns about the process of carrying out the reform, Tsai
said that "we are reviewing the issue" but that no conclusion had
been reached. "A complete explanation will be made to the public when
we have completed our review, " she said during an interview at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to the media reports, the government has given up its
goal of halving the number of financial holding institutions by the
end of the year, but Tsai said the government will not halt the
reform program, adding that "we will be more careful when
implementing the program."</P>
      <P>She said the Executive Yuan will try to bring about a more
efficient financial market whose financial institutions will be more
competitive.</P>
      <P>Her remarks were later quoted by Government Information Minister

      <P>The first phase of financial reform consisted of reducing the
non-performing loan ratio of domestic banks, while the second phase
involves the privatization of state-owned banks and mergers between
them, with the goal of halving the number of state-owned banks to six

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party

bureau in the central government and urged opposition lawmakers to
back the proposal and begin screening a draft bill on the issue as
soon as possible.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Chen Chin-jun made the call at a

      <P>Citing the MOJ report, Chen claimed that it is a "world trend" to
set up a task force at the central government level to crack down on
corruption.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that an organic draft bill on opening a clean
politics bureau under the MOJ has been stalled for some time by

the public. "So far, the progress regarding the issue at the

      <P>Chen acknowledged that another reason behind the slow progress in

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former chairman of Taiwan's ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) suggested Wednesday that Taiwan
and China form an economic union.</P>
      <P>"When the two become a country economically, it will best serve
Taiwan's economic interests, " said Hsu Hsin-liang, who served as DPP
chairman twice, in 1991-1993 and again in 1996-1998.</P>
      <P>He made the suggestion during a speech to the faculty and
students of Beijing University's School of International Relations.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan enjoys a surplus of US$50 billion annually in
trade with China, meaning China has become so important to Taiwan
that if it tightens cross-Taiwan Strait trade and economic exchanges,
it would not be in the DPP government's interests.</P>
      <P>"More than 10 years ago, I was already calling for a 'boldly
go-west' policy for Taiwan, because combining Taiwan and China into
an economic entity would best serve Taiwan's interests," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He also proposed that direct transportation links across the
strait be conducted on a domestic basis because domestic flights are
much less costly than international flights and more routes can be
flown from Taiwan to China -- Taiwanese would be able to fly directly
into 50 Chinese cities.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan had adopted his "boldly go-west" proposal, because
China's aviation industry is a latecomer on the world stage, Taiwan's
China Airlines and EVA Airways might have by now become the world's
largest airlines, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT BACKS SECOND TRUTH COMMITTEE IF IT IS LAWFUL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian would fully
support the formation of a second truth investigation committee to
probe the March 2004 election-eve shooting, as long as the task force
is legal and constitutional, a Presidential Office spokesman said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Chen is more eager than anyone else to know the
facts behind the March 19 shooting of himself and Vice President
Annette Lu while they were campaigning in southern Tainan city, the
spokesman said that the president is also willing to cooperate with
an investigation into the incident by the committee in line with the
country's constitutional system.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office's remarks came after the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan approved an amendment to the
Organic Statute for the 319 Shooting Truth Investigation Commission
Tuesday, allowing the legislature to set up a 17-member panel -- the
second of its kind -- to probe the shooting.</P>
      <P>Each political party is allowed to recommend members, who cannot
be either legislators or Control Yuan members, to form the task force
in proportion to the number of legislative seats the party controls.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers of the "pan green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union walked out of the
Tuesday meeting in protest before "pan blue alliance" lawmakers voted
on the passage of the law amendment.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the second truth committee is still
unconstitutional, the "pan green" lawmakers said that they will ask
the Council of Grand Justices to give a ruling on its
constitutionality.</P>
      <P>The first truth investigation committee set up by the Legislative
Yuan was dissolved after the Council of Grand Justices ruled in
December 2004 that its establishment was unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The election-eve shooting prior to the March 20, 2004
presidential election is believed by many "pan blue alliance"
supporters to have been staged by Chen to garner sympathy votes to
help him win re-election.</P>
      <P>After grueling investigations, prosecutors in charge closed the
investigation of the case last August amid strong criticism after
indirectly accusing Chen Yi-hsiung of being the mastermind behind the
shooting without producing hard evidence.</P>
      <P>Chen was found drowned in Amping Harbor in Tainan city around 10
days after the incident.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Justice Minister Lee Chin-yung said
Wednesday that the ministry hopes Lee Tzu-chun, a prosecutor in
Hualien, will continue to execute his duties faithfully despite
having been disciplined.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-yung made the remarks after the Hualien Prosecutor's
Office convened a disciplinary meeting at the request of the ministry
and decided to mete out two minor demerits to Lee Tzu-chun.
</P>
      <P> The decision came one day after Lee joined around 1,000
demonstrators outside the Legislative Yuan when lawmakers were
reviewing whether to endorse Hseih Wen-ting's nomination as the
nation's top prosecutor. Opposition legislators vetoed Hsieh as the
state public prosecutor-general in a vote.</P>
      <P>Participants in the disciplinary meeting discussed Lee Tzu-chun's
participation and a speech he made to the demonstrators and meted out
the punishment on the grounds that Lee violated the public
functionary service law and guidelines for prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Lee Tzu-chun said that he will not appeal the decision. </P>
      <P>"The ministry is gratified that the Hualien Prosecutor's Office
responded quickly to the concerns of society over Lee Tzu-chun's
behavior and made the decision," Lee Chin-yung said.</P>
      <P>He said that though Lee Tzu-chun was disciplined, the ministry is
not disappointed in him and hopes he will continue to be faithful to
his duty and take into consideration the image of his office.</P>
      <P>Lee Tzu-chun became an instant celebrity when he summoned
President Chen Shui-bian last year to testify before him in a probe
into an alleged vote-buying case involving a candidate of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party for Hualien county magistrate.
The outspoken prosecutor has recently appeared on TV political

      <P>The National Police Agency (NPA) and the

foreign workers, a spokesman for the NPA said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the action is aimed at protecting the rights
of legal employers whose interests are being harmed by illegal

      <P>The remarks were made in the wake of the arrest Tuesday of a
group of 40 absconded foreign workers by the Keelung police
authorities. The workers were sent to a detention center for
foreigners in Sanhsia to await deportation.</P>
      <P>NPA statistics show that 23,574 foreign workers had absconded
from their legal employers as of the end of March. The spokesman said
foreign workers who have left their legal jobs are often exploited by
their new employers.</P>
      <P>The NPA urged legal foreign workers not to be tempted by illegal

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cloud Gate 2 Dance Theatre will perform
late choreographer Lo Man-fei's last work in its annual presentation
with Lo's proud student Sheu Fang-yi playing a leading role, the
troupe announced Wednesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Pursuing the Dream," the last work directed by well-known
choreographer and dancer Lo Man-fei, who died of lung cancer March 24,
will be one of three programs in Cloud Gate 2's Spring Gathering
2006.</P>
      <P>Lo, one of the most important figures in Asian dance and a
New York University graduate, began her professional career in 1974
and continued her training at different schools, including the Martha
Graham School. In 1979, she joined Cloud Gate Dance Theatre of Taiwan
and was appointed artistic director of Cloud Gate 2 in
1999.</P>
      <P>Cloud Gate 2 was founded in 1999 to foster young choreographers,
and to tour campuses and grass-root communities in Taiwan. The
dancers range in age from 18 to 25.</P>
      <P>"It means a lot to me to play the lead role in [Lo's] last
work," said Sheu, who is the first Taiwanese principle dancer in the
prestigious Martha Graham Dance Troupe and one of Lo's favorite
students. She will play the role of Tu Li-niang, the love-struck
female who is willing to live or die for love.</P>
      <P>It also means a lot to Sheu to dance in her hometown. The dance
presentation premieres April 29 in Yilan, where Sheu grew up and
dreamt of being a professional dancer as a young girl.</P>
      <P>Lo's last piece was also her first collaboration with her
New York-based elder sister Sophie Lo. The elder Lo, a singer, will
perform Chinese traditional Kunqu opera during the program.</P>
      <P>Sheu's long-time boyfriend Bularayang Pagarlava, a Paiwan
Aborigine and up-and-coming choreographer in Taiwan, also made his
presence felt in the show by his work "Gloaming." The third program
is "A Dignified Joke," choreographed by Cheng Tung-lung.</P>
      <P>The Spring Gathering 2006 will be performed April 29-30 in
Yilan, May 4-7 in Taipei, May 20 in Kaohsiung and May 27
in Taichung. Ticket information is available at

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former chairman Chen Chen-jung, vice
chairman Chen Min-hsien and current General Manager Fan Chen-po of
Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) and three others were indicted
Wednesday on charges of breach of trust for involvement in illegally
contracting out public art projects to an American company.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung District Court's prosecutors were also indicting
project manager Chou Yu-chu, former KRTC general manager Lai Hsien-yu
and KRTC Deputy General Manager Hsu Ying-hsiung for their suspected
roles in doling out a NT$185 million contract for installing public
art at 37 rapid transit stations in the southern Taiwan port city.</P>
      <P>The prosecution said Chou Yu-chu, an in-law of Chen Min-hsien who
stands accused in other KRTC scandals, had not followed legal
procedures in awarding the contract to Derix Art Glass Consults of
the U.S. and ignored the city government's demand to submit documents
for screening.</P>
      <P>Because of her special relationship with Chen Min-hsien, a key
KRTC player at the time, Chou had changed the contents of the public
art contract and then sought approval from Chen and Hsu, the
incumbent top executives of KRTC, according to the indictment.</P>
      <P>As of Jan. 10 this year, according to the prosecutors, KRTC had
awarded contracts worth NT$143 million for installing public works of
art, of which NT$73 million has been paid.</P>
      <P>Chen Min-hsien has been indicted on charges of breach of trust in
connection with a Thai workers' riot last August which led to a spate
of corruption and law-breaking charges.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dancing without hearing the instruction
and compliments of a great teacher and friend takes a while to get
used to, Martha Graham Dance Troupe principle dancer Sheu Fang-yi
said Wednesday in reminiscing about Lo Man-fei, who passed away in
late March.</P>
      <P>Well-known choreographer and dancer Lo Man-fei, who died of lung
cancer March 24, was Sheu's teacher and instructor since Sheu's
freshman year in college. Sheu said the 15-year relationship
"felt more like being friends" rather than a teacher/student
relationship.</P>
      <P>"I miss her voice, instruction, compliments and that simple
gaze. She is always like a proud mother who would tell everyone that
her daughter is the best dancer. I get confidence from her
confidence in me," Sheu said while trying to fight back tears.</P>
      <P>Lo's confidence in Sheu was not blind faith. Sheu, who left
Taiwan in 1995 to pursue her dancing career in the U.S., has been
rated by U.S. "Dance Magazine" as among the 25 most talented
dancers of 2005.</P>
      <P>Sheu also received the Order of the Brilliant Star from President
Chen Shui-bian in May 2005 and was one of the "Top Ten Rising Stars"
selected by CNA in 2006.</P>
      <P>"She is always a person who looks at the bright side of life. It
seems to me there's nothing she can't handle. As late as last
December, when her condition was worsening, she still worked
with me and the troupe every day -- and looked energetic," Sheu said.</P>
      <P>Playing the lead role in Lo's last choreographic work brings
mixed feelings for Sheu. She feels proud to perform Lo's work but has
to control her emotions carefully because the dance makes her think
of Lo.</P>
      <P>For now, Sheu plans to keep dancing. In the future she wants to
be involved in choreography and production, just like Lo.</P>
      <P>"To carry on her legacy," Sheu said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's vacillation has been the greatest
hurdle toward the realization of regular charter flights across the
Taiwan Strait, Government Information Office Minister Cheng Wen-tsang
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cheng quoted Premier Su Tseng-chang as having made the comments
during a weekly Executive Yuan meeting, during which the premier was
briefed by Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) officials on the current
situation in cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, Su also asked relevant agencies in charge of
cross-strait exchange issues to avoid creating the misunderstanding
that it is Taiwan's government that does not wish to open the
services.</P>
      <P>Since 2001, the government has been ready to address issues such
as Chinese tourism in Taiwan, agricultural exports to China and
opening direct passenger and cargo charter flights between the two
sides, Cheng said.</P>
      <P>For instance, Cheng said, the government has never banned
Taiwan's agricultural and fruit exports to China despite the small
amount of trade. Last year, Taiwan's agricultural and fruit exports
to China accounted for only 0.17 percent of total volume, he
added.</P>
      <P>In opening direct cross-strait charter flights on weekends or
holidays, China insists that carriers must fly over the Hong
Kong Information Zone, totally ignoring the MAC's proposals involving
other options in neighboring countries, such as the Inchon
Information Zone in South Korea or the Okinawa Information Zone in
Japan.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, China has been trying hard to stall bilateral
negotiations and delay cross-strait exchanges by imposing many strict
thresholds, he said, pointing out that China's flip-flops are the
major reason behind broader two-way exchanges.</P>

any case involving child abuse or parents murdering their children
before taking their own lives is a national disgrace.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks at a weekly Cabinet meeting after being
briefed on the nation's child protection mechanism.</P>
      <P>Noting that child protection is an integral part of social
security and care for the disadvantaged, Su said the Ministry of the
Interior must cooperate closely with local governments in identifying
children prone to fall victim to abuse or domestic violence and offer
them timely assistance.</P>
      <P>Medical personnel and police authorities should also never
hesitate or delay in reporting any suspected child abuse case to
relevant social welfare agencies, Su said, adding that judicial
authorities should mete out harsh punishment to abusers or
perpetrators in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>"If we can craft a sound and comprehensive system for child abuse
risk assessment, prevention, reporting and supervision, we'll be able
to better protect our youngsters and offer them better opportunities
to grow up and enrich their life," Su said.</P>
      <P>Social activism is also important in child protection, Su said,
adding that neighbors, classmates and schools can play an active role
in helping children in need. He cited a recent case in which a junior
high school principal mobilized all faculty members and students to
search for a dropout and have eventually persuaded him to continue
his studies. </P>
      <P>"They are all the benefactor of this student. I hope all of us
can follow suit in helping troubled children, " the premier added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun urged the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) Wednesday to drop
its obstructionist tactics, arguing that political infighting will
lead nowhere.</P>
      <P>Yu made the call a day after the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan vetoed the president's nominee for the nation's top
prosecutor by a margin of four votes.</P>
      <P>"Yesterday was a dark day in our country's democratic development
as our popularly elected legislature lost respect and its
self-control by failing to confirm the appointment of a
well-qualified judicial figure to the top prosecutorial post while
passing an unconstitutional bill," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Yu lamented that while some opposition lawmakers are now
preoccupied with making unfounded accusations against senior
government officials, their colleagues have continued to freeze the
government budget and boycott critical bills, including a
long-stalled U.S. arms procurement package.</P>
      <P>"After virtually 'eradicating' the Control Yuan more than a year
ago, the opposition again boycotted the appointment of the top
prosecutor while refusing to unfreeze the budgets for the Executive
Yuan and the Examination Yuan. I'm afraid our five-branch government
is on the brink of paralysis," Yu regretted.</P>
      <P>Noting that the golden credo of democracy lies in rational debate
on major policy issues, Yu said the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
should not scuttle any sensible discussion of crucial public issues.</P>
      <P>As the ruling party, Yu said the DPP is obligated to carry out
self-examination and self-improvement according to the highest moral
standards. At the same time, Yu said he hopes the opposition will
cooperate with the DPP in forging a political setting favorable for
rational and sensible debate on major policy issues.</P>
      <P>Despite the opposition's refusal to endorse the appointment of
Hsieh Wen-ting as the state public prosecutor-general, the DPP
legislative caucus urged President Chen Shui-bian to nominate Hsieh
to the post again lest Hsieh become a pawn of domestic political
infighting.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a DPP legislative whip, said Hsieh is
well-qualified for the top prosecutorial post in trms of both
professional capabilities and character. Against this backdrop, Chen
said he is hopeful that the president can nominated Hsieh again.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued after the legislature's veto, Hsieh said he
would not accept a second nomination for whatever reason since his
nomination has been turned down by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, representatives from civil groups promoting judicial
reforms criticized the opposition camp for rejecting Hiseh simply on
their own political affiliations.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-ming, president of the Prosecutors Reform Foundation,
said that political manipulation of the vote would damage judicial
independence.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yeh Yi-jin, also a DPP legislative whip, said KMT and
PFP lawmakers wanted a state public prosecutor-general who is
partisan because in Tuesday's vote, they received ballots yet
intentionally surrendered their voting rights and even assembled a
crowd to riot outside the legislature.</P>
      <P>Yeh further said she felt sorry that opposition PFP Chairman
James Soong had capitulated to demonstrators led by a TV talk-show
host, who threatened to "obliterate Soong from the world" if the PFP
caucus endorsed Hsieh's appointment.</P>
      <P>In Tuesday's vote, Hsieh received four "yes" votes from the
"pan-blue" or independent lawmakers. As the vote was conducted by
secret ballot, the identity of the supposed "renegade" lawmakers was
the source of medial speculation.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chen Chieh didn't cast his ballot, saying that he
felt the decision by the KMT caucus to cast blank votes was
"unthinkable."</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said Wednesday it will look into a media report that China has used
Taiwan-made cutting-edge machine tools to manufacture missile
components and parts.</P>
      <P>The Japanese economic daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported in its
Wednesday edition that China used scores of ultra-sophisticated
numerical controlled (NC) machine tools purchased from Taiwan to
manufacturer stainless steel missile components and parts in the
second half of last year.</P>
      <P>Responding to the report, Chen Chao-yi, director of the MOEA's
Industrial Development Bureau, said the bureau has not yet received
any relevant information about the reported NC machine tool export to
China.</P>
      <P>"We'll cooperate with our overseas representative offices in
inquiring into the truth or details of the report," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director of the MOEA's Board of Foreign Trade,
said the international community has formulated strict regulations on
trade in strategic high-tech products.</P>
      <P>"We have also had a set of rules governing export and import of
sensitive high-tech goods. Outbound shipment of controlled items has
been subjected to stringent regulations," Huang said, adding that the
United States and Japan have often provided relevant information to
help Taiwan rein in exports of strategic high-tech products.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun urged the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) Wednesday to drop
its obstructionist tactics, arguing that political infighting will
lead nowhere.</P>
      <P>Yu made the call a day after the opposition-controlled
Legislative Yuan vetoed the president's nominee for the nation's top
prosecutor by a margin of four votes.</P>
      <P>"Yesterday was a dark day in our country's democratic development
as our popularly elected legislature lost respect and its
self-control by failing to confirm the appointment of a
well-qualified judicial figure to the top prosecutorial post while
passing an unconstitutional bill," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Yu lamented that while some opposition lawmakers are now
preoccupied with making unfounded accusations against senior
government officials, their colleagues have continued to freeze the
government budget and boycott critical bills, including a
long-stalled U.S. arms procurement package.</P>
      <P>"After virtually 'eradicating' the Control Yuan more than a year
ago, the opposition again boycotted the appointment of the top
prosecutor while refusing to unfreeze the budgets for the Executive
Yuan and the Examination Yuan. I'm afraid our five-branch government
is on the brink of paralysis," Yu regretted.</P>
      <P>Noting that the golden credo of democracy lies in rational debate
on major policy issues, Yu said the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
should not scuttle any sensible discussion of crucial public issues.</P>
      <P>As the ruling party, Yu said the DPP is obligated to carry out
self-examination and self-improvement according to the highest moral
standards. At the same time, Yu said he hopes the opposition will
cooperate with the DPP in forging a political setting favorable for
rational and sensible debate on major policy issues.</P>
      <P>Despite the opposition's refusal to endorse the appointment of
Hsieh Wen-ting as the state public prosecutor-general, the DPP
legislative caucus urged President Chen Shui-bian to nominate Hsieh
to the post again lest Hsieh become a pawn of domestic political
infighting.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a DPP legislative whip, said Hsieh is
well-qualified for the top prosecutorial post in trms of both
professional capabilities and character. Against this backdrop, Chen
said he is hopeful that the president can nominated Hsieh again.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued after the legislature's veto, Hsieh said he
would not accept a second nomination for whatever reason since his
nomination has been turned down by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, representatives from civil groups promoting judicial
reforms criticized the opposition camp for rejecting Hiseh simply on
their own political affiliations.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-ming, president of the Prosecutors Reform Foundation,
said that political manipulation of the vote would damage judicial
independence.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yeh Yi-jin, also a DPP legislative whip, said KMT and
PFP lawmakers wanted a state public prosecutor-general who is
partisan because in Tuesday's vote, they received ballots yet
intentionally surrendered their voting rights and even assembled a
crowd to riot outside the legislature.</P>
      <P>Yeh further said she felt sorry that opposition PFP Chairman
James Soong had capitulated to demonstrators led by a TV talk-show
host, who threatened to "obliterate Soong from the world" if the PFP
caucus endorsed Hsieh's appointment.</P>
      <P>In Tuesday's vote, Hsieh received four "yes" votes from the
"pan-blue" or independent lawmakers. As the vote was conducted by
secret ballot, the identity of the supposed "renegade" lawmakers was
the source of medial speculation.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chen Chieh didn't cast his ballot, saying that he
felt the decision by the KMT caucus to cast blank votes was
"unthinkable."</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORUM AIMED AT FINDING NEW WAYS TO RE-ENERGIZE TAIWAN'S ECONOMY: LIEN</HEADLINE>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan said before leaving for China Thursday that the
forum his delegation is attending there is aimed at finding a new way
to revitalize Taiwan's trade and economy.</P>
      <P>Lien is leading a group of legislators, business leaders and
academics to attend the first "KMT-Communist Party of China Trade and
Economic Forum" scheduled for April 14-15 in Beijing.</P>
      <P>When there are difficulties in cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue at
the official level, "we must boldly face the reality and try to seek
a breakthrough," Lien said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan's trade and economic performances have
slipped in recent years to the bottom among Asia's "four dragons"
which include South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore.</P>
      <P>As the industries in Taiwan and in China are "highly
complementary, " he warned that great harm could be done to Taiwan's
economy if no efforts are made to boost cross-strait economic
cooperation.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he added, a "win-win situation" can be created
if cooperation can be strengthened between the two sides of the
strait under the trend of globalization.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT, its legislative caucus and many private-sector
business leaders as well as trade and financial experts have made
great efforts to help expand Taiwan's trade and economic ties with
China, but regrettably, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government has not done its share of the job, causing "a lot of harm"
to Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>He stressed that because of the impasse in official dialogue
across the strait, his delegation will try to act as a bridge in
cross-strait communications and find ways to create another economic
miracle for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Besides attending the Beijing forum, Lien will pay tribute to his
ancestors enshrined in his ancestral home in Zhangzhou, Fujian
Province. Lien is a ninth-generation immigrant in Taiwan.</P>

(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP)
Minister Walis Pelin said Thursday that he supports the holding of a
referendum on aboriginal constituency demarcation.</P>
      <P>Walis Pelin noted that while the Constitution stipulates that the
indigenous peoples should be taken as a whole in constituency
demarcation, election laws in effect separate the indigenous
population into two electorates, "plains aboriginals" and "mountains
aboriginals." Since the law contradicts the constitution, he said he
supports the referendum proposed by the Saisiyat tribal council to
amend the error.</P>
      <P>Walis Pelin claimed that ending the practice of separating the
indigenous population into plains aboriginals and mountains
aboriginals is the general will of all the aboriginal peoples in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The dispute over the issue of indigenous constituency demarcation
has been going on for years. However, it was only recently that the
Saisiyat tribal council proposed the holding of a referendum to
resolve the issue.</P>
      <P>A CIP official admitted that "separating the indigenous
constituency into plains aboriginals and mountains aboriginals is
unsuitable, " adding that the government made the decision in 1956
"for its convenience."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP ACCUSES KMT OF BECOMING TOOL OF CHINA'S UNITED FRONT TACTICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) accused the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Thursday of reducing
itself to the position of "China's tool" to carry out Beijing's
united front tactics against Taiwan for holding an economic forum
with the Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>Arguing that Beijing should discuss cross-Taiwan Strait economic
issues with the government of Taiwan, DPP legislative caucus whip
Chen Chin-jun said Beijing is attempting to isolate Taiwan's
government by holding talks with an opposition party.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Taiwan has allowed the export of
agricultural products to China and in 2001 announced a policy of
allowing visits to Taiwan by Chinese tourists but that Beijing has
repeatedly ignored Taiwan's request for cross-strait negotiations to
map out related measures.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is "perplexing" that the KMT is cooperating
unconditionally with China while the party has constantly obstructed
the personnel nominations and budget proposals put forth by the DPP
government.</P>
      <P>KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, who is a former vice president,
left for China earlier in the day to attend the first-ever KMT-CPC
economic forum slated for April 14-15 in Beijing. He is heading a
delegation of KMT lawmakers, academics and business executives.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Lien is expected to hold talks with Chinese
President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, DPP Legislator Wu Ming-min urged Lien not to make
any concessions to Beijing that would lead to a loss of capital,
technology or talent in Taiwan's agricultural sector, that would
allow China to dump its agricultural products in Taiwan, or that
would ruin the livelihood of Taiwan's farmers.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that China has picked up Taiwan's agricultural
technology after Taiwan exported its agricultural products to China.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, a lot of China-produced fruits are now being
sold under the name of Taiwan, and Taiwan's agricultural trade with
China posted a deficit of NT$6.7 billion (US$206.15 million) last
year because their competitiveness was brought down by expensive
exportation costs.</P>
      <P>After acquiring Taiwan's agricultural technology, China has begun
dumping its agricultural products in Taiwan through channels such as
the "mini three-links" and smuggling activities, Wu claimed, adding
that China's agricultural products are also competing with Taiwan's
products in the U.S. and Japanese markets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHEN BLASTS CHINA'S INTERFERENCE IN TAIPEI HOSTING ANMC21 MEETING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Timothy Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lambasted China
Thursday for its "forceful political intervention" that thwarted the
4th Plenary Meeting of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 (ANMC21)
in Jakarta in 2004, causing a suspension of the 2005 annual meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen fired his accusation while speaking at the opening ceremony
of the 5th Plenary of the ANMC21, which was hosted by Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou. The meeting will last until April 16. </P>
      <P>In a keynote speech, Chen said the ANMC21, initiated by Tokyo
Mayor Shintaro Ishihara in August 2000, has 12 country members from
Asia, giving a special meaning to all Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Chen said that in 2004, Beijing joined a race with Taipei to win
the right to host the 5th ANMC21 meeting, using all sorts of
political maneuvering to block Taipei from hosting the meeting in
2006.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that in spite of an agreement reached by the ANMC21,
China opposed including Taipei's right to host the 2006 annual
meeting in the agreement. Nevertheless, because of Ishihara's
decisive intervention to mediate, the 5th Plenary of the ANMC21 is
being held, he said.</P>
      <P>The president recalled a similar unhappy incident when he served
as mayor of Taipei. Chen noted that China did all it could to erect
obstacles to Taipei's hosting of a meeting of the International Union
of Local Authorities as well as the World Capitals Forum in May 1998.</P>
      <P>In spite of China's hard work to stop its allies from sending
delegates to Taipei, 70 cities from 67 countries, including 61
capitals, were represented in the 1998 conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen's presence at the ANMC21 function marked the first time he
has met with Ma, who is also chairman of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , since their meeting earlier this month at the
Presidential Office which attracted the media's spotlight.</P>
      <P>Ma hosted Wednesday night a welcome party for guests and
delegations from Asian cities, including the Tokyo mayor and
representatives from Bangkok, New Delhi, Singapore, Seoul, Kuala
Lumpur, Jakarta, Hanoi, Manila and Yangon at the Far Eastern
International Hotel.</P>
      <P>Under the main theme of "Asia in Transformation, " five themes
will be featured during four-day event -- namely Joint projects of
the ANMC21, Information Asia, Tourism Asia, Healthy Lifestyle Asia,
and Handicraft and Cuisine Asia.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over a
regular political and military exercise Wednesday aimed at honing the
country's ability to respond in several crisis scenarios, a Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The political and military exercise, dubbed the "Yushan No. 2, "
was conducted to examine the Taiwan military, political and security
authorities' response capabilities in the event of the Chinese
president being assassinated during a visit abroad and Taiwan being
fingered as the culprit, and in the event of China launching a
surprise missile attack on Taiwan's political and economic "nerve
centers," MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said.</P>
      <P>Lu said that in the exercise, the MOFA chose to strengthen
communications with the international community and seek help from
the United Nations as well as Taiwan's neighboring countries in
response to the scenarios.</P>
      <P>The exercise began at 7: 50 p.m. Wednesday after an emergency
order was directed to all top level officials from the Presidential

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 13 (CNA)
(By Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A research laboratory at Far East 
College announced Thursday their latest achievement in developing
compact disc (CD) recycling technology.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chen Chia-hsun, the head of the laboratory, said that once
applied, the improved technology can retrieve raw materials from
junkyards worth up to NT$700 million per year.</P>
      <P>Chen Chia-hsun said there are more than one billion CDs used per
year in Taiwan, with most winding up in refuse dumps. But if the
polymer composite in CDs is recycled, it could be used again in items
such as car bumpers, mobile phones and laptop computers.</P>
      <P>Chen explained that by combining microwaves, supersonic waves and
a low density alkaline fluid, the new technology can peel down metal
layers on CDs more efficiently and cost-effectively. After removing
the metal layer, the remaining polymer composite may be crushed into
small particles and used for other commodities.</P>
      <P>Chen said that if all one billion CDs are recycled, the extracted
polymer composite would have a market value of NT$500 million to
NT$700 million.</P>
      <P>"[It could be] quite profitable for the recycling company," added
Chen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>By taking over the 5th annual convention
of the Asian Network of Major Cities (ANMC21) from Beijing, which
failed to host it in 2005, Taipei has enabled the network to continue
functioning, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks as the fifth plenary meeting of ANMC21 opened
with President Chen Shui-bian blasting China for attempting to
obstruct Taipei from hosting the event. Chen praised Ma for having
worked hard to bring the event to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma said Taipei had tried to win hosting privileges to the
network's 2006 annual meeting, but China had intervened and provoked
a controversy at its 2004 meeting in Jakarta. Beijing did not sign
the Jakarta agreement and withdrew from the organization, he noted.</P>
      <P>The 2004 Jakarta Declaration stated that Beijing would host the
2005 annual meeting and that Taipei had the "priority" right of
hosting the 2006 meeting, according to Ma, who noted that Beijing did
not sign the declaration and quit the organization, so the 2005
meeting was skipped, leading to Taipei hosting the fifth ANMC21
meeting half a year ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan is playing the role of peacemaker in
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, not a troublemaker in regional
affairs. He added that through close cooperation, Asian countries
will be able to form a joint living and economic sphere in which
prosperity can be created for all, as each country increases their
industrial output and per capita income.</P>
      <P>Among participants in the 2006 annual convention of ANMC21 were
Tokyo Mayor Shintaro Ishihara, Mayor Matthias Yao of Singapore and
deputy mayors or senior delegates from eight other Asian cities --
Seoul, New Delhi, Bangkok, Jakarta, Hanoi, Manila, Kuala Lumpur and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will allow Chinese citizens
to visit Taiwan for sightseeing purposes as soon as both sides of the
Taiwan Strait complete negotiations in this regard, a government
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made
the remarks at a meeting with members of the opposition People First
Party's (PFP) legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, which was aimed at inviting PFP representatives
to participate in a planned conference on Taiwan's sustainable
economic development to be organized by the Cabinet, Wu noted that
the opening of cross-strait direct passenger and cargo charter
flights is a set policy of the government.</P>
      <P>Noting that the opening of Taiwan's market to Chinese tourists is
also a set government policy, Wu said Taiwan will welcome those
holding People's Republic of China passports to visit Taiwan for
sightseeing purposes once cross-strait negotiations are completed.</P>
      <P>Since 2002, Taiwan has allowed Chinese with permanent residency
status in a third country to visit Taiwan in group tours for a short
stay.</P>
      <P>As for cross-strait direct passenger and cargo charter flights,
Wu said former Premier Frank Hsieh had already ordered related
agencies to actively promote such flights last June.</P>
      <P>"If talks between the two sides can be completed within six
months, such charter flight services will be opened immediately," Wu
added.</P>
      <P>Wu revealed that cross-strait negotiations on weekend charter
flights are also under way, but declined to offer more details.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government's China policy has always been
clear, Wu said obstacles the government faced in the past in
implementing the policy mostly came from factors beyond Taiwan's
control.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that since promoting cross-strait charter flights and
opening Taiwan's market to Chinese tourists are both set policies of
the government, the MAC will try its best to defuse pressure from all
sides.</P>
      <P>"The government will promote various mainland policies according
to the schedule, despite obstructions," Wu added.</P>

never accepted any gift vouchers presented by former SOGO major

major shareholder Douglas Hsu or former Presidential Office Deputy
Secretary-General Chen Che-nan.</P>
      <P>"The recent string of unfactual reports have done serious harm to

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan should verify with Beijing if there was a
consensus between Taiwan and China in 1992 whereby both sides could
interpret the meaning of "one China" separately, ruling Democratic
Progressive Party Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yu urged Lien to raise the question during his meeting with
Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Yu pointed out that the KMT -- the ruling party in Taiwan until
2000 -- has claimed for more than 10 years that such a consensus
exists between the two sides, but Beijing has repeatedly denied the
claim.</P>
      <P>Yu said it would hamper the development of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations if the dispute remained unresolved.</P>
      <P>Noting that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou has proposed that Taiwan
and China establish a "modus vivendi" based on the so-called "1992
consensus," Yu said it would be impossible for the KMT to promote the
proposal unless the dispute is clarified.</P>
      <P>Lien is visiting China to attend the first-ever economic forum

      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP)
legislative caucus condemned Chinese authorities for forcing
China-based Taiwanese merchants to take part in a trade and economic
forum in Beijing, which former Kuomintang (KMT) chairman Lien Chan
will also attend, DPP legislative caucus whip Yeh Yi-jin said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>China is creating the erroneous impression that Taiwanese
businesspeople support Lien, who is now in China to take part in the
KMT-Communist Party of China (CPC) forum, Yeh told a news conference
at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Yeh showed the press an official document that a Chinese
provincial government sent to a Taiwanese business association, which
states that the association's chairman must not be absent when Lien
shows up at the conference; and if the chairman cannot attend, a vice
chairman should show up.</P>
      <P>Yeh said this is no different from forcing them to show up with
Lien, creating the impression they lend their support.</P>
      <P>Yeh urged Lien not to be "used" by the Chinese authorities,
reminding Lien that the KMT was once defeated by the CPC.</P>
      <P>Lien, who departed for China Thursday, is at the head of a
60-member KMT delegation attending the forum April 14-15 in Beijing.
Lien is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao April 16.</P>
      <P>The delegation Lien leads includes 29 KMT legislators, as well as
other lawmakers of the "pan-blue alliance." Prominent business
leaders, such as Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Chinatrust Financial

Group Chairman Kao Chin-yen among others are represented in the

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) welcomed Thursday the government's plan
to open Taiwan to Chinese tourists and cross-Taiwan Strait charter
flight services, urging it to take concrete action instead of just
paying "lip service" to these issues.</P>
      <P>KMT Policy Coordination Committee Director Tseng Yung-chuan
issued the call at a news conference at the Legislative Yuan after
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu urged Beijing
Wednesday to wrap up bilateral negotiations with Taiwan on these
issues in six months -- just one day before a large KMT delegation,
led by Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, heads to China.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the MAC would not rule out the possibility of
unilaterally announcing the opening of Taiwan to Chinese tourists and
specific-purpose charter flights as long as complementary measures
have been put in place, even if two-way negotiations have not been
wrapped up by that time.</P>
      <P>He added that "it is China, not Taiwan, that has tried to block
cross-strait exchanges."</P>
      <P>Tseng hailed the Cabinet's planned opening and called on the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to "back its words with
action" based on the path laid down by the KMT -- referring to a
five-point agreement reached in last April in Beijing between Lien
and Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Pan Wei-kang said that Taiwan "cannot
afford to lose the Chinese market" in its globalization efforts and
she urged the DPP government to be visionary when seeking outlets for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Su Chi, who once served as MAC chairman, called on
Premier Su Tseng-chang to "have more teeth" and not to back away from
the opening plan.</P>
      <P>Premier Su said in a weekly Executive Yuan meeting Wednesday that
he hopes Taiwan and China can complete bilateral negotiations on
cross-strait trade and commercial exchanges as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Regarding opening Taiwan to Chinese tourists, the government has
already made public its measures in 2001 and is awaiting China's
response, Premier Su pointed out.</P>
      <P>As for setting up direct charter flight services between Taiwan
and China, the government remains open to the issue and will not rule
out any possibility as long as it is properly arranged through
bilateral negotiations, Su said.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Ing-san
said Thursday that it is time to review domestic gasoline prices, and
that the final decision will be made by the state-owned Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC) at some point.</P>
      <P>Hwang made the remarks during the changeover ceremony for the new

      <P>Faced with surging crude oil prices in the international market,
Hwang noted that they will affect the nation's economic policies and
everyone's livelihood.</P>
      <P>However, oil prices should be decided upon by the market and
reflect CPC's oil costs. CPC holds a more than 70 percent share of
the country's oil market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A second group of 27 volunteer attorneys
were contracted by the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) Thursday to boost the intermediary organization's legal
services across the Taiwan Strait, particularly for Taiwanese
businesses operating in China.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony marking the establishment of the second SEF
group of volunteer attorneys, Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen exhorted
the legal professionals to live up to their commitment so as to help
raise the quality of exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that when she was head of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) -- Taiwan's top China policy planner -- many Taiwanese
businesspeople operating in China were being questioned by Chinese
authorities for a litany of reasons. She said the authorities exerted
an imperceptible form of intimidation that had "a deterrent effect"
on them.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the MAC perceived the implications of the interrogation
and authorized the SEF to organize a group of attorneys to travel to
China and provide consultation to those Taiwan businesspeople who had
been questioned.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that when Taiwanese became physically or mentally
incapacitated or disturbed after being questioned by Chinese
authorities or ran into legal problems in China, legal assistance
from Taiwan was more than welcome.</P>
      <P>She said that as the modes of cross-strait exchange have become
even more diverse and complicated, the need for legal assistance is
naturally more urgent.</P>
      <P>She said lawyers and attorneys are not only the defenders of
society's core values, they can also serve as catalysts who lead
efforts to help stabilize cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The first SEF group of 23 volunteer attorneys was established in
December 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN BLASTS BEIJING FOR BOYCOTTING ANMC21 PLENARY MEETING</HEADLINE>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian criticized
Beijing for boycotting the plenary meeting of the Asian Network of
Major Cities 21 (ANMC21) and disregarding the network's
resolution in his opening remarks of the 5th annual Plenary Meeting
of the AMNC21 Thursday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"China continuously used its political power to hinder the
meeting's progress by boycotting meeting sessions. Even worse,
it disregarded the meeting's resolution, and was unwilling to allow
the section giving Taipei priority as the 2006 host city to appear in
the joint declaration," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen praised incumbent Tokyo City Mayor Shintaro Ishihara for
dealing with the matter resolutely and bringing the meeting forward
to April this year. He also welcomed dignitaries who arrived from
nine major Asian cities to take part in the meeting.</P>
      <P>Cities that sent delegations to Taipei for the two-day meeting
include Bangkok, Delhi, Hanoi, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul,
Singapore and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>A former Taipei City Mayor, President Chen cited past experience
in which he took the proactive approach of promoting "city diplomacy"
to help Taipei reach out to the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is "not an isolated island, but rather, an island that
embraces the world," President Chen stressed, adding that "a city
charged with energy brings an influence far beyond our imagination."</P>
      <P>ANMC21 was originally proposed by Ishihara in August 2000 in
Kuala Lumpur during a joint conference involving the four cities of
Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Delhi, and Seoul. It has 12 member cities before
Beijing unilaterally withdrew from the ANMC21, resulting in the 2005
plenary meeting not being held.</P>

Lenient Rule Set for Rebuilding in New Orleans 

U.S. federal officials issued unexpectedly
lenient guidelines on Wednesday for rebuilding
the flood-damaged homes of New Orleans,
potentially allowing tens of thousands of
homeowners to return to their neighborhoods at
costs far less than they had feared. The
announcement dovetails with a political
climate in New Orleans in which the idea of not
rebuilding damaged neighborhoods has been taboo.
In a heated mayor's race that is now reaching
its conclusion, no candidate has been willing to
say some areas should not be rebuilt because of
flood danger.

Wall Street Journal: Wal-Mart Sticks With
Fast Pace Of Expansion Despite Toll on Sales

After decades of relentless expansion in the
U.S., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is cannibalizing its 
own business in many markets. But the huge
retailer says the strategy of opening new
stores that compete with older ones is paying
off and will continue, despite Wall Street's
rising dissatisfaction. Some Wal-Mart watchers
want the company to slow its expansion and
channel more resources into improving the
appearance of existing stores and upgrading its
merchandise to entice shoppers to spend more.
"What hurts the company and ultimately the value
of its stock price is if you're paying more for
the real estate but getting less and less out of
it," says Morgan Stanley analyst Gregory Melich.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian filed a lawsuit
Thursday against media commentator Chang Yu-hua for slandering him
with the allegation that the president met twice with a deposed
Presidential Office official involved in a corruption scandal related
to the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC).</P>
      <P>The president asked lawyer Ku Li-hsiung to institute the criminal
proceedings after Chang ignored the president's demand that he
apologize within three days over his allegation made during a TV
program that the president met with his former aide Chen Che-nan in
secret on Jan. 11 and shortly after Lunar New Year's Day on Jan 29.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, a notorious figure in Taiwan's political and
business circles, is currently in detention and being investigated
over a charge that he took money illegally from an economic criminal
in 2002 and promised to get him off the legal hook.</P>
      <P>Chen, who served as deputy secretary-general of the Presidential
Office from 2000 to 2004, was forced to quit his post as the
president's national policy adviser in early October last year
because of his involvement in the KRTC corruption scandal, brought to
light by the Aug. 21, 2005 riot of Thai laborers working on the
Kaohsiung rapid transit railway project.</P>
      <P>The public affairs department of the Presidential Office claimed
that the president had never met with Chen Che-nan since Chen's
resignation, and that Chang's allegation about his two meetings with
Chen were "sheer fabrication" that cannot be substantiated with
evidence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei delegates to the 5th annual
convention of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 (ANMC21) called
Thursday for the establishment of an allied Asian tourism network to
help promote tourism development throughout Asia.</P>
      <P>Kang Ping-cheng, a Taipei city government official in charge of
tourism affairs, called for the governments of all ANMC21 members to
form an allied Asian tourism network as a useful regional tourism
promotion mechanism.</P>
      <P>Kang's proposal was enthusiastically received by delegates from
Jakarta, Bangkok, Hanoi and Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Singaporean delegate advocated that young citizens
from ANMC21 member countries be allowed to exchange residence
experiences in different Asian cities under the ANMC21 framework.</P>
      <P>Responding to the Singaporean delegate's advocacy, a Taipei
delegate said that Taipei City receives about 100 young artists and
performance artists from around the world each year to stay in Taipei
for one to three months as "artists in residence."</P>
      <P>Echoing the Taipei delegate's remarks, Tokyo Mayor Shintaro
Ishihara said he has personally visited Taipei to pick up clues about
Taipei's "artists in residence" program.</P>
      <P>In turn, Ishihara -- who initiated the formation of the ANMC21 in
August 2000 in Kuala Lumpur during a joint conference involving the
cities of Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Delhi and Seoul -- said that
enlightened by the Taipei International Art Village program, he has
approached the authorities of Aoyama Gakuin University to suggest
that a similar program be established in that institute.</P>
      <P>Ishihara said Asia is a fast-changing area with the greatest
development potential among all regions around the world and that
regional and inter-regional exchanges and cooperation have thus
become increasingly important. After having visited so many cities
around Asia, Ishihara said, he found that the need for regional
aircraft of about 100 seats has become increasingly urgent and he
called for regional cooperation on this issue.</P>
      <P>Among the participants in the 2006 ANMC21 are Ishihara, Mayor
Matthias Yao of Singapore and deputy mayors or senior delegates from
eight other Asian cities -- Seoul, New Delhi, Bangkok, Jakarta,
Hanoi, Manila, Kuala Lumpur and host Taipei.</P>
      <P>ANMC21 currently is down to 12 member cities as a result of
Beijing's withdrawal from the ANMC21.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>To gain support from the international
community for Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization
(WHO) , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it
will continue making efforts behind the scenes.</P>
      <P>However, a MOFA official said, it won't be easy for Taiwan to
participate in the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's governing
body -- as an observer due to China's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Chen Chaun, director of the Department of International
Organizations of MOFA, said that despite support from European
countries expressing their sympathy for Taiwan's "meaningful
participation" in the WHO, it is difficult for them to vote or speak
for Taiwan in public under pressure from China.</P>
      <P>MOFA's Taiwan International Health Action (TaiwanIHA) has been
functioning well, and has already recruited 2,400 volunteer medical
professionals. Chen also said TaiwanIHA will be institutionalized and
establish networking sites to integrate resources in case of
contingency.</P>
      <P>The WHA will hold an annual meeting in Geneva at the end of May.
MOFA officials said they have tried hard to "row the boat silently, "
adding they cannot release any details of their action plan at
present.</P>
      <P>As in the past, Chen said Taiwan's diplomatic allies will
propose that Taiwan be admitted to WHA this year on grounds of
humanitarianism and Taiwan's professional achievements in health
care.

      <P>Delegates from 10 major Asian cities
assembled in Taipei Thursday for a two-day meeting, with the main
theme of "Asia in Transformation," seeking to establish a network and
deepen social and economic bonds and cooperation.</P>
      <P>The fifth Plenary Meeting of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21
(ANMC21) is taking place in Taipei, with Beijing and Yangon the only
absentees among the 12 member cities of the 6-year-old international
platform.</P>
      <P>Beijing withdrew from the organization in 2004 after Taipei was
selected as the host city for the 2006 plenary meeting. The 2005
plenary meeting, which was to be hosted by Beijing, never took place.</P>
      <P>Major Asian cities should "work together and share the same
vision to fight poverty and achieve peace and prosperity, " said
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou at the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Asia has been undergoing mass changes since the 1950s and this is
especially true in the 21st Century, Ma said, which is why the theme
of this meeting is "Asia in Transformation."</P>
      <P>Delegates from Bangkok, Delhi, Hanoi, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur,
Manila, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei and Tokyo are attending the meeting

      <P>In addition to discussions on joint projects that range from the
environment, urban planning, education, women's development, health
and disaster control between member cities, they will also work on an
amendment of the ANMC21 Charter and determine the host city of the
next meeting before signing the Taipei Declaration.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an exhibition and cultural events of all participating
cities will take place at Hall 2 of the Taipei World Trade Center
from April 13-16.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An ambitious educational project embarked
upon by the government and enterprises is looking to model itself on
German craftsmanship and pave the way for new vocational training in
Taiwan, a government agency said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Tai-Ger Vocational Training Project (TGVTP) , which is
entering its third year, enjoys the cooperation of the Taishan
Training Center -- a subsidiary of the Council of Labor Affairs --
the German Trade Office in Taipei and the Association of German
Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHK).</P>
      <P>The project, which covers senior vocational schools, two-year
junior colleges and two-year technical colleges, requires
participating students to work for three days and go to school for
two days every week.</P>
      <P>"Our objective is to change the traditional thinking on Taiwan's
vocational education, which is sometimes referred as 'secondary
education, ' and help produce more competent workers, " said Liao
Wei-ren, research and development section chief of the TGVTP.</P>
      <P>Students admitted to the project will receive a 50 percent
subsidy on tuition from the government and their salaries are
required to be not less than 50 percent of a full-time employee who
works in the same position.</P>
      <P>Graduates of the project will receive DIHK certification.</P>
      <P>"This is a project with mutual benefit to the students and
companies. Students get the on-the-job training while the companies
provide a training ground for their potential employees of the
future, " said Jim Chang, a senior manager of the Ruentex Group,
whose company employs 22 project participants.</P>
      <P>"These students are usually more mature, motivated and
goal-oriented than those in four-year universities because they
receive academic, vocational and human skill training at the same
time. And they know what they want, " said Mark Chen, a professor at
Nanya Institute of Technology. The school has 249 students under the
project this year.</P>
      <P>TGVTP, which was launched in 2003, will have its first graduation
class of 206 students this summer. More than 1,000 students have been
admitted to the project in the past three years.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou suggested to
member cities of the Asian Network of Major Cities 21 (ANMC21)
Thursday that they should persuade their respective governments to
offer visa-free treatment to citizens of each other's countries.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at the 5th Plenary Meeting of ANMC21, which
is being held at Far Eastern International Hotel in Taipei April
13-16.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that Japan's offering visa-free treatment to
Taiwan tourists last year has helped boost Taiwan citizens' visits to
Japan, Ma expressed hope that other ANMC21 member cities will suggest
that their governments follow suit.</P>
      <P>ANMC21, initiated by Tokyo Mayor Shintaro Ishihara in 2001, is a
platform aimed at seeking progress and giving member cities an
opportunity to strengthen cooperation in various aspects, such as
economic, transport, cultural, urban planning, education, women's
development, medical care, environmental protection and sustainable
development.</P>
      <P>Mayors and representatives from Bangkok, Delhi, Jakarta, Kuala

      <P>Ma noted that Taipei's Cultural Affair Bureau invites some 100
artists from around the world annually to stay for periods of one to
three months in Taipei to present their artistic talent and enhance
exchanges with local artists. He said he hoped ANMC21 member cities

    <HEADLINE>TRADITIONAL CHINESE CHARACTERS SHOULD BE MADE U.N. WORLD HERITAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of academics in Taipei suggested
Thursday that Taiwan file an application with the United Nations to
make traditional Chinese characters a world cultural heritage
entitled to special protection.</P>
      <P>Professor Wang Kai-fu of National Taiwan Normal University said
that although Taiwan is not a U.N. member and that an application put
forth by Taiwan might encounter huge difficulties at the U.N.
headquarters, efforts to push for traditional Chinese characters'
being listed as a U.N.-protected world cultural heritage are
imperative.</P>
      <P>Kang said he is confident that traditional, complex, or long-form
Chinese characters will survive and even thrive because of the
medium's strong "vitality, " but he admitted that under Beijing's
strong political pressure, it has become increasingly difficult for
Taiwan to promote traditional Chinese characters and script around
the world.</P>
      <P>The best way to prevent traditional Chinese characters from being
marginalized is to list them as a U.N.-protected world cultural
heritage, Kang added.</P>
      <P>Only Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau still use long-form characters,
with the rest of the world mostly using the simplified, or short-form
characters developed in China, supposedly to "boost literacy."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Professor Hsu Ching-yun of Soochow University said
that simplified characters were officially adopted by Beijing in
1949. However, he claimed, the Chinese people have come
to increasingly "crave" traditional characters as standards of living
have continued to rise in China, a development that has led the
Chinese people to need more cultural things.</P>
      <P>Hsu also suggested that Taiwan convene an international sinology
conference to raise world awareness about the importance and
significance of traditional Chinese characters.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An oversupply of university graduates in
China this year could upset the Chinese labor market and cause the
nation's unemployment rate to rise further, the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) predicted in a report
released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The report quoted statistics compiled by the Institute of
Population and Labor Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences in Beijing as showing that China is expected to have 4.13
million university graduates this year, representing an increase of
750,000 over 2005, while the average employment rate for them in the
past five years was only 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The report indicated that the number of university graduates in
China has increased by leaps and bounds in recent years, causing the
backlog of unemployed graduates to rise from 340,000 in 2001 to
790,000 last year.</P>
      <P>The oversupply of university graduates has not only upset the
labor market but has also caused the growth of salaries to stagnate.
Chinese official statistics show that university graduates in China
now receive an average monthly income of 1,588 yuan, up only 37 yuan
from 2003, with 20.3 percent of them making less than 1,000 yuan a
month.</P>
      <P>The CEPD's report pointed out that the oversupply of university
graduates and a shortfall in skilled workers have resulted in an
imbalance in China's manpower structure.</P>
      <P>It also said that China's actual unemployment rate might be
higher than the officially acknowledged figure of 4.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The report concluded that China's high economic growth will be
dogged by the problem of high unemployment, a problem the Chinese
leadership will have to overcome if it hopes to maintain China's
long-term prosperity.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  March 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) decided Thursday to expel two lawmakers who have been indicted
on charges of health insurance fraud.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Central Review Committee (CRC) came to the decision to
oust Chiu Yeong-jen and Peter Lin after a heated debate. Chiu lost
his legislative seat simultaneously with his ouster from the DPP
because he was a legislator-at-large with party membership as a
prerequisite for the post. As Lin is a regional legislator, he will
be able to retain his seat.</P>
      <P>Chiu said he was disappointed and saddened by the party's
decision and couldn't accept it. And Lin declined to make any
comments.</P>
      <P>Chiu, who runs the Yeong-jen Hospital in the southern port city
of Kaohsiung, and Lin, owner of the Peter Lin Hospital, also in
Kaohsiung, could each face five-year prison terms if found guilty.
Prosecutors charge that they swindled NT$110 million and NT$190
million, respectively, out of the Bureau of National Health Insurance
by making false insurance claims. Both of them have been allowed to
remain at large after each paid bail of NT$3 million in February.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP's disciplinary rules, party members indicted
on charges of graft, malfeasance or vote buying, among other illegal
acts that tarnish the party's image, will be immediately banned from
taking part in party activities, but prosecuted members will be
deprived of membership only if they are convicted at a first trial.</P>
      <P>Both Chiu and Lin appeared at the CRC meeting to defend their
memberships, arguing that they would eventually be acquitted,
claiming that prosecutors made only cursory charges against them
without assiduous investigations.</P>
      <P>While some CRC members also voiced support for the two
physicians-turned-politicians, the committee still decided to expel
them after four hours of grueling debate.</P>
      <P>CRC Chairman Kao Chih-peng said after the meeting that the DPP
must adopt the highest level of moral standards in response to public
expectations for clean politics and good governance and that if Chiu
and Lin manage to clear them names, the DPP will seek remedial
measures.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the DPP's internal regulations, Lin wen-lang
will fill the legislative seat left vacant by Chiu's ouster. Lin has
served as a regional legislator for three terms.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a DPP legislative whip, said the party caucus
supports the decision to oust Chiu and Lin as part of the party's
effort to restore its clean image and regain public trust.</P>
      <P>"The public's perception of our party's political integrity is
the most important. Since the DPP no longer controls the largest
number of seats in the legislature, it's not important that we have
one less seat following Lin's ouster. Responding to public
expectations for political accountability is more critical, " Chen
said.</P>

      <P>Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen urged Beijing
Thursday to respond quickly to the government's call for re-opening
bilateral negotiations on trade and commercial issues, as a
delegation of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) left for China for
an economic forum with Beijing officials earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
after attending a ceremony held by the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation in which more than a dozen lawyers were cited for their
volunteer counselling services for people from the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the Democratic Progressive Party
government wanted to conduct talks with the KMT before the delegation
left for China, Tsai expressed the hope that the KMT will take the
initiative to discuss the issues that the mission talks about with
the Chinese officials during the Beijing forum with relevant official
agencies "out of respect for the government" after the group returns
from the trip.</P>
      <P>She also called on Beijing to respond swiftly to Taiwan's call
for resuming two-way negotiations on cross-strait exchanges, as some
of the issues that it is to discuss with the KMT delegation might
infringe upon the power of Taiwan's authorities.</P>
      <P>KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan led the group of over 170

    <HEADLINE>BOFT CONCERNED ABOUT TAIWAN'S MACHINE TOOL EXPORTS TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan trade officials began to examine
Taiwan's export of machine tools to China Thursday after foreign wire
service reports said that China is using Taiwan-made high-precision
machine tools to make parts for missiles.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Board of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs said the board had begun a case-by-case
investigation to find out whether machine tools exported to China
could be used for military purposes.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that the investigation was ordered after
government officials became concerned about the news reports that
China last year used dozens of Taiwan-made machine tools to
manufacture parts and components for its missiles.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that a review shows that from January 2005 to
January this year, Taiwan exported a variety of machine tools worth
NT$230 million to China, including six cases that obtained the
board's export permission granted under the regulations governing the
export of strategic and high-tech products.</P>
      <P>He said the initial understanding of trade officials is that the
machine tools did not meet such high-precision standards as could be
used for manufacturing missile parts.</P>
      <P>The spokesman added that the news reports could also be a
misrepresentation of the facts.</P>

(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokesman for the Kaohsiung Customs
Office Thursday reminded travelers to Taiwan not to bring in any
luggage on behalf of strangers in order to avoid unwittingly
bringing illegal drugs into the country.</P>
      <P>Stepped-up crackdowns on drug trafficking have uncovered led to an
increase in the number of foiled drug-smuggling attempts, and
the spokesman warned that people traveling to and from foreign
countries might be asked to help carry suspect luggage
into the country.</P>
      <P>Travelers may be tempted by the profits to be made from bringing
in illegal drugs, but would face severe punishment, the spokesman
warned.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that 21,800 grams of heroin, marijuana,
amphetamines and other drugs -- worth about NT$22 million
(US$687,500) -- were seized in the past three months from travelers
arriving from Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, Thailand and the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>Most have attempted to smuggle drugs through customs inspection
by affixing the illegal shipments to their bodies, the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that Kaohsiung customs have established
connections with various foreign agencies to facilitate the job of
intercepting illegal drugs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IIPA STRONGLY SUPPORTS U.S.-TAIWAN FTA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   April  13  (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Intellectual
Property Alliance (IIPA), an influential business entity, expressed
strong support Thursday for the signing of a free trade agreement
(FTA) between the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>IIPA President Eric H. Smith asserted at a symposium on the topic
of a U.S.-Taiwan FTA that IIPA members strongly support the signing
of such an agreement, rebutting a State Department official, who said
that "until now, no member of the U.S. business sector has expressed
support for a U.S.-Taiwan FTA."</P>
      <P>Smith made the rebuttal immediately after Priscilla
Hoffman-Stowe, a State Department economic analyst, said at the
symposium that he has not heard any voices of support from the U.S.
business sector so far about the signing of a U.S.-Taiwan FTA.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that the IIPA -- a private sector
coalition comprised of seven trade associations representing 1,900
companies producing and distributing materials protected by copyright
laws throughout the world -- has expressed support for the
U.S.-Taiwan FTA initiative since Oct. 2002.</P>
      <P>During the symposium, sponsored by George Washington University's
Sigur Center for Asian Studies, most of the scholars present agreed
that given Taiwan's dynamic economy and the close ties between the
United States and Taiwan, it is imperative that a free trade
agreement be forged between the two sides.</P>
      <P>However, they admitted, the U.S.'s foreign policy, or
Washington's stance on the cross-Taiwan Strait relations and the U.S.
Congress' reaction to that stance, could be major obstacles to the
FTA initiative.</P>
      <P>The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) began to conduct a
survey on the economic impact of a U.S.-Taiwan FTA in February 2002.
When the survey was released in October the same year, more than 120
U.S. companies were found to be supportive of the U.S. signing a free
trade agreement with Taiwan, but the IIPA block expressed opposition
to the initiative, saying that it would be inappropriate to have the
agreement signed before Taiwan improved its intellectual property
rights (IPR) protection.</P>
      <P>In January 2005, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative
(USTR) removed Taiwan from its "Special 301 priority watch list" in
recognition of the island's efforts and progress in IPR protection.
Taiwan had been on the "priority watch list" for four consecutive
years dating back to 2001.</P>
      <P>Political observers in Washington attributed the IIPA's turnabout
on the U.S.-Taiwan FTA issue mainly to the fact that Taiwan has made
significant progress in cracking down on commercial piracy and that
the Taiwan legislature passed IPR protection legislation in 2004.</P>
      <P>The IIPA -- which is comprised of most of the U.S. companies
producing or distributing materials protected by copyright laws,
including all types of computer software and entertainment software,
movies, television programs, home videos, records, CDs, textbooks,
professional publications and journals -- is now more focused on
rampant commercial piracy and counterfeiting in China.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan must not forget the existence of the ROC
government and his identity as an ROC citizen during his current
visit in Beijing, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during an interpellation session in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Su said Lien, as an ROC citizen, enjoys the freedom and democracy
of this country and can travel in and out of the country freely,
which is different from the situation in the People's Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Lien has insisted that Taipei and Beijing
should be allowed to maintain their separate interpretation of the
meaning of "one China, " Su urged Lien not to forget to mention his
version of "one China" -- the Republic of China -- while in Beijing.</P>
      <P>While the PRC constantly suppresses the ROC and does not
recognize the ROC, this is Lien's best opportunity to promote the
existence of the ROC, Su said.</P>
      <P>He further reminded Lien to respect the existence of the
government if he is to discuss with Beijing authorities any issues
involving the exercise of government authority.</P>
      <P>Also, he called on Beijing to negotiate with the elected
government in Taiwan or government-authorized organizations on issues
in this regard.</P>
      <P>On visits to Taiwan by Chinese tourists, Su said the main problem
with this issue lies with China because Beijing has so far refused to
allow its people to visit Taiwan for sightseeing purposes.</P>
      <P>Lien is in Beijing to attend the first economic forum between the
KMT and the Communist Party of China, which opened Friday. He is also
expected to hold talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao during the
visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QUANZHOU-KINMEN 'MINI LINKS' ALREADY ON PLANNING CHART: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Direct shipping links between Taiwan's
outlying island of Kinmen and Quanzhou in the Chinese province of
Fujian have already been on the government's planning chart, the head
of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Quanzhou-Kinmen shipping links were included in the
government plans when Taiwan initiated direct shipping links between
Kinmen and Matsu islands and Fujian Province on Jan. 1, 2001 --
commonly known as the "mini three links -- MAC Chairman Joseph Wu
said.</P>
      <P>"It's nothing new in terms of government policy on the
development of cross-strait relations, " Wu said when commenting on
news reports that the Chinese authorities may declare the opening of
the Quanzhou-Kinmen mini links as a goodwill gesture during the
on-going economic forum between Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang and
the Communist Party of China being held in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Wu said that as a matter of fact, a plan to begin ferry services
between Kinmen and Quanzhou is currently under screening at the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks at a meeting of the legislative caucus of the
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) to which Vice Premier Tsai
Ing-wen led an Executive Yuan group to keep the TSU fully abreast of
an economic sustainable development conference that the government is
planning to convene.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, according to Lin Chih-ming, director of the MOTC
Department of Navigation and Aviation, the transportation and
communication ministry is helping the private shipping sector solve
the navigation problems regarding the ferry route between Kinmen and
Quanzhou.</P>
      <P>Lin said that a shipping company briefed the MOTC two weeks ago
about a Kinmen-Quanzhou ferry service route. A problem that the
company is facing is that when heading to Quanzhou, the ferry must
first sail southward before turning to head to Quanzhou due to
defense regulations imposed by the Ministry of National Defense
(MND), Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said he was told by the shipping company that by doing so,
the one-way trip between Kinmen and Quanzhou would take about 100-120
minutes, much longer than the 70 minutes if the ferry were to sail
directly in a northward direction from Kinmen to Quanzhou.</P>
      <P>Lin said his office would like to talk with the MND authorities
about the matter.</P>
      <P>According to MOTC tallies, as regulations on the "mini three
links" have been continually relaxed year-on-year, the number of
people traveling via this channel has increased over the past four
years -- to some 1 million in the second half year of 2005.</P>

      <P>Consumer prices in Taiwan are not expected
to rise continuously despite the recent hikes in the prices of
certain products, Council of Economic Planning and Development
Minister Hu Sheng-cheng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks in response to public concerns over the
possible increase in inflation rate following the hikes in sugar
prices by the state-run Taiwan Sugar Co. Also, the Chinese Petroleum
Corp. is likely to hike oil prices in the near future.</P>
      <P>Citing data from the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics, Hu said Taiwan's inflation rate has been declining
since the start of this year.</P>
      <P>While the consumer price index (CPI) increased only 0.41 percent
in March over the same time last year, the CPI rose 1.35 percent
year-on-year for the first quarter of this year, with the hikes in
food product prices contributing 0.86 percentage points to the
increase and the hikes in oil prices contributing 0.23 percentage
points, Hu pointed out.</P>
      <P>Hu said that the inflation rate is expected to gain 0.2
percentage points if oil prices are hiked 10 percent for one year and
that the consumer prices will remain reasonable as long as food
prices are maintained at a normal level.</P>

but will avoid taking any intervention actions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan entrepreneurs might be able to
contribute to normalizing cross-Taiwan Strait relations if they make
necessary suggestions to the Chinese authorities, the head of the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Responding to the ongoing economic forum between Taiwan's

being held in Beijing, in which executives of some 50 leading Taiwan
businesses reportedly are also taking part, MAC Chairman Joseph Wu
said that through their wisdom accumulated from their contributions
to Taiwan's economic prosperity, executives of leading Taiwan
businesses could serve as a catalyst for improving cross-strait
political and business relations in the event that they offer the
necessary suggestions during the KMT-CPC forum.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan, Wu said that as Taiwan is a
democratic country that follows market economic laws, the government
will not and cannot impose any bans on their moves, such as attending
the KMT-CPC forum.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Taiwan entrepreneurs' participation in the forum is
nothing for the government to fret over, although he admitted that
the government is "concerned" about their activities in China, on the

      <P>An opposition Kuomintang lawmaker urged
the Ministry of Education (MOE) Friday to ditch a policy proposal
under which students using simplified Chinese characters in
examinations will have their marks deducted.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wang Yu-ting said the policy should not be implemented
until the MOE updates its list of commonly accepted simplified
characters to serve as the criteria for mark deductions.</P>
      <P>Wang pointed out that according to a list of standard characters
published by the MOE, there are 57 commonly seen simplified
characters that are now considered standard characters.</P>
      <P>While the policy is expected to apply to basic ability tests for
junior high school students starting this May, the MOE has so far not
made public the criteria for mark deductions, which has caused
anxiety among the students, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Holding a similar view, Wang Kai-fu, a Chinese language professor
at National Taiwan Normal University, said the policy will create a
lot of trouble unless the MOE first clarifies exactly which
simplified characters are forbidden.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue a few days ago, Education Minister Tu

    <HEADLINE>WEATHER TO DECIDE FORMOSAT-3 SATELLITE'S LAUNCH TIME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles,  April  13 (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Weather conditions will dictate
whether Taiwan's third satellite project -- FORMOSAT-3 -- can be
launched Friday as scheduled, project leader Dr. Chen Cheng-yi said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The only factor that could delay the lift-off at the Vandenberg
air force base in California is an expected thunderstorm, Chen said,
noting that forecasters indicated that a thunderstorm front was
expected to hit California Friday that would not leave until
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Since FORMOSAT-3 will be carried by a U.S. Air Force-owned
spaceship on its journey into orbit, only a command from the
Vandenberg base for the launch project can decide whether the launch
will go ahead, Chen said.</P>
      <P>FORMOSAT-3 is scheduled to be launched at 17:10, Western time, or
08:10 Saturday, Taipei time.</P>
      <P>FORMOSAT-3, also known as Constellation Observing System for
Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) , is an international
collaborative project between Taiwan's National Space Organization
and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research of the U.S.
It will be the world's first climate monitoring and forecasting
system using a constellation of six microsatellites to collect
atmospheric remote sensing data for operational weather prediction,
according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The satellite's mission will involve the placement of six
microsatellites into six different orbits ranging between 700 km and
800 km above the earth's surface. The project is an academic research
program with the goal of developing an advanced system for real-time
monitoring of the globe's climate.</P>
      <P>After it becomes fully operational, FORMOSAT-3 will be capable of
providing some 2,500 pieces of meteorological data in every 24-hour
period, covering all areas of the globe.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Space Organization (NSPO)
said Friday that the FORMOSAT-3, Taiwan's third sounding satellite,
will be launched by the U.S. Air Force April 15 at 8: 10 a.m. Taipei
time from Vandenberg air base, California to provide vital data for
weather prediction, as well as research on the ionosphere, gravity,
and global climate change.</P>
      <P>The NSPO said the FORMOSAT-3, which has six micro-satellites,
will be sent to the initial parking orbit of about 500 kilometers in
altitude on Saturday. In 13 months, all six micro-satellites will
gradually settle in their designed orbital planes to form a full
function constellation.</P>
      <P>An NSPO expert explained that equipped with three primary science
payloads, Global Positioning System (GPS) radio receivers, tiny
ionospheric photometer (TIP), and tri-band beacon transmitter ( TBB),
FORMOSAT-3 can obtain near real-time figures on air pressure,
temperature, water vapor in the atmosphere, and the electron density
of the ionosphere.</P>
      <P>The expert also said that although Germany already has one
satellite with similar functions in operation, the FORMOSAT-3 is so
far the only one that has six micro-satellites to cover the entire
global atmosphere and ionosphere, as well as to provide sounding data
on as much as 2,500 locations per day.</P>
      <P>The NSPO's first satellite project, FORMOSAT-1, was designed to
observe the effects of ionospheric plasma and electrodynamics, while
the second project, FORMOSAT-2, was designed to conduct remote
sensing and imaging over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The FORMOSAT-3 is a Taiwan-U.S. collaborative project, carried

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC FORUM IS CHINA'S WAY OF HIDING EVIL INTENTIONS: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday
that an economic and trade forum between Taiwan's opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and China's Communist Party of China (CPC) is
China's way of hiding its evil intentions toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to the two-day forum that opened in Beijing
Friday, while he received a delegation from the National Committee on
American Foreign Policy headed by Winston Lord, a former U.S.
ambassador to China, at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>According to the president, both the forum and a second meeting
between Lien Chan, the KMT's honorary chairman, and Chinese President
and CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao scheduled for Sunday are a "cloth
used by China to cover up its hidden evil intentions toward Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He said he believes it is a deliberate attempt by Hu to create "a
facade of cross-Taiwan Strait peace" to mislead the international
community prior to a scheduled meeting with U.S. President George W.
Bush in Washington, D.C. April 20.</P>
      <P>Beijing is aiming at "mitigating Washington's pressure in urging
the Chinese leadership to have dialogue with Taiwan's duly elected
government and leader," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"All can remember that the first Lien-Hu meeting took place April
29, 2005, shortly after Beijing's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law
targeting Taiwan in March, " Chen said, describing that meeting as
also a deliberate bid by Hu to cushion the mounting pressure from the
international community against its newly enacted law codifying the
use of force against Taiwan should it move toward formal
independence.</P>
      <P>Beijing is using the same strategy to circumvent the duly elected
government in Taiwan, Chen went on, adding, however, that as long as
China refuses to renounce its one-party authoritarian rule and its
use of force against Taiwan, then all its forums are just "facades."</P>
      <P>He noted that the cover story of the latest edition of The
Journalist, a news magazine that he described as "friendly toward the
KMT, " reported that the five-point consensus -- including the
resumption of stalled cross-strait talks and the termination of
bilateral hostility -- reached after the first Lien-Hu meeting has
achieved absolutely nothing a year after it was reached.</P>
      <P>Chen predicted that the second Lien-Hu meeting will produce yet
another "bounced check."</P>
      <P>The president said that this is why the U.S. has encouraged
cross-strait dialogue, especially Beijing's opening of dialogue with
Taiwan's leader, to resolve cross-strait differences.</P>
      <P>"Because regardless of whether the participants in the forum are
enterprises or representatives of political parties, they cannot
replace the government's authority," Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait trade and economy, he said the government's
stance is unequivocal -- that the Chinese market is but one of the
global markets and that Taiwan should not pin its economic lifeline
and all its resources on China.</P>
      <P>"Sovereignty, democracy, peace and equal footing" will be the
guiding principles in dealing with cross-strait issues, Chen said. </P>
      <P>China must respect and recognize the fact of the existence of
Taiwan, respect the free will of the Taiwan people and not resort to
force, he went on.</P>
      <P>China should also use the results achieved in cross-strait talks
in Hong Kong in 1992 to resume government-to-government negotiations,
Chen added.</P>

the 2004 ANMC21 meeting in Jakarta. Beijing did not sign the Jakarta
agreement and withdrew from the organization, he noted.</P>
      <P>The 2004 Jakarta Declaration stated that Beijing would host the
2005 annual meeting and that Taipei had the "priority" right of
hosting the 2006 meeting, according to Ma, who noted that Beijing did
not sign the declaration and quit the organization, so the 2005
meeting was skipped, leading to Taipei hosting the fifth ANMC21
meeting half a year ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>By taking over the ANMC21 from Beijing, Taipei has enabled the
network to continue functioning and has smashed China's attempt to
obstruct Taipei from hosting the event, he added.</P>
      <P>Ishihara said during the press conference that when in Jakarta,
ANMC21 member cities put forth several versions concerning the
hosting privileges to the network's 2005 annual meeting, but none of
the versions was accepted by China.</P>
      <P>Noting that China is a notorious major polluter in Asia and a
major source of illegal immigrants, Ishihara claimed that the entry
of illegal Chinese immigrants into Japan is one of the factors behind
Tokyo's high crime rate.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing is an important Chinese city and that important
cities symbolize their countries, adding that Beijing's withdrawal
from the ANMC21 was regrettable.</P>
      <P>The 2006 annual convention of ANMC21 issued a "Taipei
Declaration" Friday, one day before its close, after mayors and top
city officials from Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul, Delhi Bangkok, Jakarta,
Hanoi, Manila, Kuala Lumpur and Taipei took part in the four-day
event April 13-16.</P>

Opposition Union leader Romano Prodi said Thursday that his

the fact that only several hundreds of officially disputed ballots

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Debby Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) urged
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Friday to demand that the Chinese
authorities open talks with the Taiwan government.</P>
      <P>A KMT delegation led by the party's honorary chairman, Lien Chan,
is visiting China to take part in a cross-Taiwan Strait economic and
trade forum with the Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>The MAC pointed out that the forum is an exchange activity
between individual political parties and said it cannot violate the
framework for political party exchanges.</P>
      <P>"To fulfill its duty, the KMT should demand that the Chinese
authorities clarify whether they agree with the Republic of China's
sovereign status as laid out in the so-called `1992 Consensus' as the
KMT claims. At least the KMT should ask the Chinese authorities to
declare that their stance is the same as that of the KMT, as this
would be beneficial to the resumption of official cross-strait
talks," MAC Vice Chairman David W.F. Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said the KMT should also demand that the Chinese
authorities reflect on their Taiwan policies, which are against
Taiwan's popular opinions and democratic values, and urge them to
engage in talks with the Taiwan government to initiate normal
interactions.</P>
      <P>He refuted the Chinese authorities' recent claim that everything
is ready for cross-strait exchanges except for the Taiwan
government's consent. He pointed out that the Taiwan government has
already completed necessary plans for the exchanges proposed by
Beijing, but claimed that the Chinese authorities are stalling for
political considerations.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan government is open-minded and willing to negotiate
with the Chinese authorities on various issues, including opening
Taiwan to Chinese tourists, direct charter flights and the export of
Taiwan agricultural produces to China," Huang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou has no plans to hold a second meeting with President Chen
Shui-bian at the present stage, a KMT spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu-cheng, deputy director of the KMT's cultural and
communications department, made clear the KMT position when asked by
reporters to respond to a call by the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) that Chen and Ma should meet again to discuss how to
revive Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>At a meeting in the Presidential Office a day earlier, DPP party
leaders and DPP members serving as senior government officials
decided that Ma should be invited to a second meeting with the
president, with the focus of their discussion placed on issues that
most affect people's livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Huang said that the KMT "sees no need for a second Chen-Ma
meeting at present. As to whether such a meeting will take place in
the future, it will depend on the overall climate and the topics for
discussion."</P>
      <P>The KMT spokesman indicated that there are many urgent economic
issues that could be tackled right away if the Cabinet could reach
consensus with the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>"If the DPP government really wants to devote itself to improving
the nation's economy, it could do so right away without waiting for a
second Chen-Ma meeting," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen and Ma met April 3 at the Presidential Office and talked
about a variety of topics, including the definition of the
controversial "one China" policy, the cessation of the National
Unification Council and its guidelines, arms procurement and
constitutional reform. The two-hour meeting ended with neither side
bending to the other on any of the issues at stake.</P>
      <P>Ma acknowledged afterwards that he met with the president despite
opposition within the KMT because he wanted to relay some important
messages to him and allow him to explain his positions on the various
issues.</P>
      <P>According to results of an opinion poll conducted by the United
Daily News shortly after the meeting, Ma's approval rating dropped
from 67 percent to 58 percent, while that of Chen dropped from 21
percent to 20 percent.</P>
      <P>It is believed Ma's reluctance to meet with the president again
might be related to the lesson he has learned that he would have
nothing to gain from another meeting with Chen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The International Trade Commission under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs decided Friday on relief measures it
will implement to protect local towel manufacturers from Chinese
dumping.</P>
      <P>Officials said custom duties on imported Chinese towels will be
changed from the current level of 10.5 percent based on price to a
levy according to volume.</P>
      <P>In the first year, tariffs will be NT$42 (US$1.3) per kilo, with
NT$32 in the second year and NT20 in the third year, all of which
will not be lower than the duties levied under the existing policy.</P>
      <P>After a lengthy probe into Taiwan towel makers' complaints about
Chinese dumping, the commission reached a conclusion March 17 that
local towel makers have been harmed by a deluge of cheap Chinese
products entering the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>Local towel makers have complained that since both Beijing and
Taipei entered the World Trade Organization, China-made towel imports
have taken 70 percent of the Taiwan market and have driven major

      <P>The Asian Network of Major Cities (ANMC21)
concluded its fifth annual meeting in Taipei Friday after issuing a
joint declaration on forging closer cooperative relations among
member cities and playing a more important role in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Delegates from 10 ANMC21 member cities -- Bangkok, Delhi, Hanoi,
Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, Seoul, Singapore, Taipei and Tokyo --
signed the "Taipei Declaration" after two days of discussions on
measures to galvanize the positive aspects of all member cities and
expand their international presence.</P>
      <P>Addressing the closing session, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
expressed his gratitude for the foreign delegates who traveled to
Taipei to attend the meeting and contribute their wisdom to the
promotion of common prosperity and development of all ANMC21 member
cities and the upgrading of the quality of life of their residents.</P>
      <P>The declaration reviewed the organization's work since its
establishment four years ago, saying that all member cities have
achieved "steady results in implementing 18 joint projects, including
`Promotion of Development of a small- to medium-sized Jet Passenger

      <P>During the past two days, the declaration went on, the conference
attendees also discussed how to use information technology (IT) to
further enhance urban functions and the civil service.</P>
      <P>Noting that Asia has high IT potential, the declaration said all

More Retired Generals Call for Rumsfeld's
Resignation 

The widening circle of retired U.S. generals
who have stepped forward to call for Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's resignation is
shaping up as an unusual outcry that could pose
a significant challenge to Rumsfeld's
leadership, current and former generals said
on Thursday. Maj. Gen. Charles H. Swannack Jr., 
who led troops on the ground in Iraq as recently
as 2004 as the commander of the Army's 82nd
Airborne Division, on Thursday became the
fifth retired senior general in recent days to
call publicly for Rumsfeld's ouster. Also
Thursday, another retired Army general, Maj.
Gen. John Riggs, joined in the fray.
There were indications on Thursday that the 
concern about Mr. Rumsfeld, rooted in years of 
pent-up anger about his handling of the war, 
was sweeping aside the reticence of retired 
generals who took part in the Iraq war to 
criticize an enterprise in which they 
participated. 

Wall Street Journal: As Markets Bet on Rate
Increases, Fed Officials Seem Less Committed

Financial markets increasingly expect the
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in May
and keep lifting them into the summer. But not
all Fed officials are convinced that much action
will be needed. Two factors are influencing the 
markets. One is upbeat economic news, such as Ma
rch's hefty job gains, which confirmed other ind
ications that the first quarter was very strong.
Fed officials agree that makes a rate increase 
in May very likely. The second factor is that
the markets read the Fed's March statement as
a commitment to raise rates in May and probably
in June. But some Fed officials say they were
trying to convey an inclination, not a
commitment, to move rates in May, and weren't
sending any signal about June.</TEXT>

      <P>A large scale Taiwan-India forum aimed at
increasing commercial exchanges and helping Taiwanese businessmen to
"seize the India trend" will be held from April 27-28 in Taipei,
organizers said Friday.</P>

assembled on a single platform to discuss a wide range of commercial
topics on India, " said Ho Mei-yueh, secretary-general of the
Taiwan-India Cooperation Council (TICC).</P>
      <P>The forum, titled "Seize the India Trend" is being organized by
the TICC, the Taiwan Thinktank and the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) and is a response to the "Go South" policy the government
advocates to shift the over-dependence of Taiwan's economy on China
to South Asia, especially India.</P>

      <P>India is going full-speed for political reform and refining the
infrastructure, which includes airports, ports and highways, said
Gokhale, adding that "in five years you will see big changes in
India."</P>
      <P>With more than 100 million middle-class people, India will also
be a market with strong buying power that will benefit Taiwanese
businesses, Gokhale added. He encouraged Taiwan people to learn more
about India through the exchange forum.</P>
      <P>The speakers will address general topics such as Taiwan's trade
and economic policies in response to India's emerging market and
branding Taiwan enterprises on the first day. More detailed sessions
on different sectors -- textiles, medical, software and automobiles,
to name a few -- will take place on the second day.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China should establish a
common market, beginning with cooperation in the areas of
agriculture, finance, energy and charter flights, Lien Chan, honorary
chairman of Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT), said in Beijing
Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony of a two-day economic and trade
forum between the KMT and the Communist Party of China (CPC), Lien
said that if the two sides miss the "rare window of opportunity" for
mutual cooperation, they will both end up losers.</P>
      <P>Lien, who is leading a 170-member KMT delegation to attend the
forum, said he suggested the four relatively uncontroversial areas
for cooperation because they are what the people on both sides need
most at present and could yield the greatest benefits.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government in
Taipei has agreed to allow charter flights across the Taiwan Strait,
he said the move shows that the DPP government is reluctant to move
forward without a push from the opposition.</P>
      <P>He criticized the lack of direct air links between Taiwan and
China as the reason why he and his delegation were forced to spend
eight hours making a detour in their flight path from Taipei to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>"I think everybody would have the same feeling: the detour was
such a waste," he said.</P>
      <P>Lien acknowledged that there are two irreversible trends in the
world: regional economic cooperation and the rise of China.</P>
      <P>He underlined the importance of Taiwan's trade relations with
China and indicated that although Taiwan has faced a recessive
domestic market over the past six years, it still managed to record
an average economic growth rate of 3.57 percent, thanks mainly to its
trade surplus with China.</P>
      <P>The current visit is Lien's third to China within a year. He is
scheduled to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao Sunday.</P>
      <P>During his first visit to China from April 26 to May 3 last year,
Lien held talks with Hu in his then-capacity as KMT chairman -- the
first talks between the heads of the KMT and the CPC since the 1940s.
He made a second trip in October last year to see a panda
conservation program in Sichuan Province.</P>
      <P>Lien's delegation to the forum includes many influential
Taiwanese industry leaders whose enterprises represent more than 40
percent of Taiwan's total industrial output.</P>

condemned the KMT and the CPC at a news conference at the DPP
headquarters following the opening of the forum.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, an address given by KMT Honorary Chairman Lien
Chan at the forum's opening was nothing but flattery of China and
also a demonstration of his disparagement of Taiwan. Lien's all-out
effort to tout Taiwan investment in China reflects his lack of a
global deployment and risk management concept, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In view of the anti-Taiwan independence remarks made recently by
Jia Qinglin, a standing member of the CPC Central Committee Political
Bureau, it is easy to see that the KMT and the CPC are conspiring
against Taiwan, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He also lashed out at Lien for failing to underline Taiwan's
national sovereignty and for failing to protest to Beijing officials
against China's opposition that led to Taiwan's exclusion from world
bodies.</P>
      <P>Echoing Tsai's remarks, Lai claimed that Lien made various
"mistakes" in his speech. For instance, he pointed out, Lien fell
short of identifying China as the hurdle to Taiwan's participation in
the region's free trade agreements. Lien should also make it clear to
Beijing that it is to blame for Taiwan becoming an outcast in
regional and international activities, he added.</P>
      <P>Lai claimed that Lien was totally wrong when he called China a
world economic powerhouse and a major world market and advocated a
common market across the Taiwan Strait. Lien's efforts to tie
Taiwan's economic development to the Chinese market is the leading
obstruction to the nation, he argued.</P>
      <P>The DPP does not deny the importance of the Chinese market, but
risk control is the key to the issue, he said, blaming Lien for his
failure to use the occasion to ask Beijing to improve the investment
climate for Taiwan businessmen in China.</P>
      <P>To date, Taiwan agricultural exports to China have made little
progress, but Taiwanese farmers have been seriously hurt by fake
products from China, he said, adding that "flattering China is
useless to the call for a better investment environment there."</P>
      <P>Lai also questioned the KMT's motivation in taking part in the
forum, claiming that the participation by Hu Kang, an economist who
is also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, is solid evidence of the KMT's attempts to contain the
DPP government by aligning with the CPC.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, Ho has been reported various times by both
Chinese and foreign media as supporting the idea of an "economic
blockade" of Taiwan. He claimed that should Lien fail to speak
against any rhetoric of this kind from Hu at the forum, it will be
clear evidence of the KMT's desire to get into bed with the
communists.</P>
      <P>Lai also asked whether KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou will sum up
Lien's stance if Lien does not voice opposition to Hu's desire for an
"economic blockade" of Taiwan. He demanded that the KMT give a clear
explanation in this regard to the public.</P>
      <P>Traveling at the head of a KMT delegation of more than 170
people, Lien arrived in Beijing Thursday to attend the forum that
will discuss cross-strait cooperation in tourism, energy, transport
links and financial exchanges through April 17.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO REVIEW COMMISSIONING OF E2-K EARLY WARNING AIRCRAFT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two U.S.-built E2-K early warning and
control aircraft will be commissioned into service Saturday to
further shore up Taiwan's air defenses, the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) said Friday.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will preside over the commissioning
ceremony, to be held at an air force base in Pingtung, southern
Taiwan, MND officials said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan struck the E2-K procurement deal with the United States
last year, the officials said, adding that the air force has
completed personnel training and relevant preparations for the
delivery of the two planes.</P>
      <P>The air force's Thunder Tiger Aerobatics Team will perform a
stunning flight show at the E2-K commissioning ceremony to celebrate
the expansion of the country's air arm, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The show will be the first of its kind after a six-year hiatus.
The Thunder Tiger team suspended all aerial shows six years ago after
then-Defense Minister Tang Yiau-ming enjoined military personnel to
focus on combat preparedness.</P>
      <P>In connection with the E2-K commissioning, the officials said,
the Pingtung air base will also open its barracks for public visits
for two days from Saturday.</P>
      <P>Besides watching the air show, visitors can also take a rare
glimpse into the nation's air combat arsenals on static display,
including AT-3 assault trainers, F-5E jet fighters, locally developed
IDF jet fighters, U.S.-built F-16 jet fighters, French-built Mirage
jet fighters, E-2T early warning aircraft, C-130H transport planes
and many other weaponry systems.</P>
      <P>Marching band performances, a local farm produce trade fair and
an exhibition of aboriginal artifacts and handicrafts will also be
held at the air base during the two-day period to help boost local
tourism, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT URGED TO ATTEND NATIONAL ECONOMIC GROWTH CONFERENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  14  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party urged the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Friday
to take part in a national economic conference on sustainable growth
to be convened by the Executive Yuan between May and June.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-jin, a DPP legislative caucus whip, made the call at a
Legislative Yuan news conference shortly after a high-profile
economic forum between the KMT and the Communist Party of China (CPC)
opened in Beijing that same day.</P>
      <P>Since the KMT is willing to discuss economic issues with the CPC,
it should also hold such talks with the DPP for the sake of national
interests, she said, pointing out that Beijing's hostility toward
Taiwan is the major reason behind the failure to re-open bilateral
negotiations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan is attending an
economic forum with CPC officials in Beijing that will run through
April 17 -- the first of its kind in more than five decades after
Taiwan and China split in 1949 amid a civil war.</P>
      <P>Lien arrived in Beijing Thursday at the head of a delegation of
more than 170 KMT lawmakers, business leaders and experts to take
part in the forum aimed at discussing ways to boost cross-Taiwan
Strait cooperation in energy, tourism, transport links and financial
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Business executives from Taiwan accompanying Lien on the tour
said unanimously that economy is Taiwan's lifeline and claimed that
political affiliation makes no difference among them in their pursuit
of greater business development.</P>
      <P>They said that Taiwan should further internationalize and that
wider opening is necessary if it wants to play a bigger role on the
world stage.</P>
      <P>An improvement in cross-strait relations would be very helpful to
this end and it is a major concern for many Taiwan businessmen in
search of new horizons amid increased globalization that has made
China a world economic powerhouse and possibly a world market of the
future, they said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must not miss the chance and should not stand on the
sidelines of the global market, the businessmen stressed, pointing
out that they are very willing to help the government boost Taiwan's
economy, through activities such as attending the forum in Beijing,
regardless of their political leanings.</P>
      <P>As cross-strait economic exchanges are already very close, it is
natural that Taiwan businessmen will set their sights on the
promising Chinese market, they said, adding that the Taiwan
government has not expressed any special concern over their
participation in the Beijing forum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOST PEOPLE WANT  SAY IN DETERMINING TAIWAN'S FUTURE: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An overwhelming majority of local people
responding to a recent opinion poll have expressed their desire to
have a say in determining Taiwan's future, the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The MAC commissioned National Chengchi University's election
research center to conduct the telephone survey from March 31-April 2
to explore local adult people's views on the current state of
relations across the Taiwan Strait. A total of 1,088 valid samples
were collected, with a margin of error of 2.97 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the poll results, 84.3 percent of the respondents
agreed with the statement that Taiwan's future should be determined
by the people of Taiwan themselves, and only 7.5 percent said
Taiwan's future should be jointly determined by the people in Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's status, 76.6 percent of those surveyed gave a
thumbs-up to the statement that Taiwan is a sovereign independent
state, and only a marginal 10.5 percent said Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>A noteworthy finding was that 34.5 percent of the respondents
said the current speed of development in cross-strait exchanges is
"too slow" -- the highest ratio since the MAC began to regularly
survey local people's views on the issue in 1998.</P>
      <P>While the ratio of respondents who said the government's
restrictions on investment in China should be more stringent still
surpassed the 50 percent mark to reach 54.6 percent in the latest
poll, the ratio of those who said the government should further ease
the restrictions reached 27.4 percent, also the highest level of all
similar MAC-sponsored surveys.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 54 percent of the respondents said they think local
businesses' China investment fever has inflicted a negative impact on
Taiwan's economic development and only 29.3 percent said they believe
the phenomenon has had a positive effect.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that a majority of 88.6 percent support the
maintenance of the cross-strait status quo, roughly same as the
findings in all previous MAC surveys.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Chang Ming-kun and Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A spokesman for Taiwan's main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said in Beijing Friday that if President Chen
Shui-bian wants to work for peace between Taiwan and China, he should
not be "foul-mouthed" to the KMT and its economic and trade forum
with the Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, deputy executive director of the KMT's Central
Policy Committee, made the remarks in response to Chen's criticism
made in Taipei earlier in the day that the KMT-CPC forum is China's
way of "hiding its evil intentions" toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes the forum is a deliberate attempt by
Chinese President Hu Jintao to create "a facade of cross-Taiwan
Strait peace" to mislead the international community prior to an
April 20 meeting with U.S. President George W. Bush in Washington,
D.C.</P>
      <P>Chen also quoted a magazine comment as saying that KMT Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan, who is heading a 170-member KMT delegation to the
two-day forum April 14-15, was "hiding behind a pair of pandas" and
that Lien's second meeting with Hu might be just "another bad check."</P>
      <P>Rebutting Chen's criticism, Chang said the Democratic Progressive
Party government under Chen's leadership in the past six years has
achieved nothing in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, except to cause
the political deadlock between the two sides to become more serious.</P>
      <P>Chang said that as the main opposition party, the KMT is worried
about the development and hopes to promote cross-strait peace,
beginning with reconciliation between the KMT and the CPC.</P>
      <P>The KMT spokesman added, however, that the KMT will not be
affected by Chen's criticism and will continue to work for peaceful
interactions and mutual benefit in trade and economic areas between
Taiwan and mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S RISE AT CRITICAL CROSSROADS: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
China's rise has reached a critical crossroads that could either be
an opportunity or a threat.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with Tokyo Governor Shintaro
Ishihara, who is in Taipei to attend the fifth annual meeting of the
Asian Network of Major Cities 21 (ANMC21).</P>
      <P>Ishihara touched on the topic regarding China's rise, saying that
the United States has gradually come to understand that in China's
rise lurks volatile political risks. Among others, Ishihara said, an
average of 38,000 violent protests occur in China every year and the
Chinese authorities have consistently crushed them with brute force.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Ishihara went on, 3 percent of China's crude oil
imports come from Sudan and he claimed that China has footed its oil
bills by providing weapons for Sudan. In addition, he said, China has
purchased a large amount of crude oil from Latin American countries,
which he claimed has led to the rise of Anti-American leftist forces
there.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said some countries have enormous illusions
about China's rise, which they think could offer tremendous
opportunities. But for other countries, China's rise could spell a
threat to its security, Chen said, adding that for Taiwan, China's
rise marks the rise of military threat.</P>
      <P>Chen also blamed China for procrastinating
government-to-government dialogue with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"U.S. President George W. Bush has said on many occasions that
cross-strait issues should be resolved by the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait through official dialogue and consultations. Bush has also
urged Beijing to hold talks with Taiwan's democratically elected
leader," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Referring to an economic forum co-sponsored by Taiwan's main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC)
being held in Beijing, Chen said cross-strait issues are too prickly,
complicated and solemn to be addressed by any non-government
organizations or individual politicians.</P>
      <P>Without the participation of Taiwan's democratically elected
government, Chen said any conclusions reached at the KMT-CPC forum
would be empty talks and lead nowhere.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's third satellite project --
FORMOSAT-3 -- was successfully launched at 9:40 a.m. Saturday, Taipei
time at the Vandenberg air force base in California.</P>
      <P>All six microsatellites smoothly broke away from the rocket to go
into the orbit 19.19 minutes after the lift-off, according to the
Hsinchu-based National Space Organization (NSPO).</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian delivered a message of congratulations
to the Vandenberg base right after the successful launch.</P>
      <P>FORMOSAT-3, also known as Constellation Observing System for
Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) , is an international
collaborative project between Taiwan's National Space Organization
and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in the U.S.</P>
      <P>The project is regarded as the world's first climate monitoring
and forecasting system using a constellation of six microsatellites.
As soon as the constellation is completed, the microsatellites placed
in six different orbits ranging between 700km and 800km above the
earth's surface will begin to collect atmospheric remote sensing data
for operational weather prediction.</P>
      <P>After it becomes fully operational, FORMOSAT-3 will be capable of

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN OFFICIAL CALLS FOR SUPPORT OF TAIWAN'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  April 14 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should not be excluded from the
World Health Organization (WHO) for the sake of the safety of people
in Taiwan and in the rest of the world, a Taiwan official said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Jack Kuo-jung Lee, deputy director of the information division at
the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York, addressed the
issue in an article published in the New York Sun newspaper.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that while specialists from 192 WHO member states
convened on World Health Day in Zambia April 7 to discuss ways to
combat disease as a global community, Taiwan is unable to benefit
from the meeting or the existing global health network because it is
not a WHO member.</P>
      <P>Not only is it not a WHO member, Lee noted, but it is also shut
out of the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and the
International Health Regulations 2005 mechanism.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is still struggling to gain access to the global disease
prevention and control network. But because of China's intervention,
the likelihood of this happening still seems small," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the exclusion of Taiwan based on political reasons is
obviously in violation of the principle of membership universality
and the humanitarian spirit of the WHO, and that it is important for
the WHO to follow this principle since "infectious diseases know no
national boundaries."</P>
      <P>For example, Lee said, if a flu virus originating in Thailand
spreads to Taiwan -- a busy transportation and trade center -- it is
likely the virus will propagate rapidly around the world.</P>
      <P>When a large-scale SARS outbreak occurred in China in 2003,
Taiwan -- located on the other side of the Taiwan Strait that
separates both countries -- soon also fell victim to the SARS crisis,
Lee recalled.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's failure to obtain any immediate medical information or
assistance from the WHO led to the death of 83 Taiwanese from the
disease, with financial losses suffered by local industries amounting
to US$1.8 billion, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is willing to contribute, the international
community has no access to Taiwan's experience in medical development
and disease control and prevention because it is not a WHO member, he
said.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's claim that Taiwan's people have enjoyed the health
resources provided by the WHO under the so-called "one China" policy,
Lee clarified that the Chinese government has no jurisdiction over
Taiwan and therefore it is impossible for Taiwan to benefit from
China's WHO membership.</P>
      <P>While it is hard to predict when the next outbreak of SARS or flu
will occur, a gap in the global health network will definitely bring
about an unbearable impact on the international community, he said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will not politicize the issue of its WHO
participation and is trying to resolve the problem through
non-political means, such as putting forth a proposal to join the WHO
as a "health entity."</P>
      <P>Since the WHO has granted observer status to the Holy See and
Palestine, there is no legitimate reason for the WHO to continue
denying access to Taiwan, he said.</P>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An ongoing exhibition at the Taipei World
Trade Center highlights new images of Tokyo and Seoul, both of which
have devoted strenuous efforts to urban redevelopment in recent
years.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is being held in connection with the
just-concluded fifth plenary meeting of the Asian Network of Major
Cities 21 (ANMC21) hosted by the Taipei City Government.</P>
      <P>Cheonggyecheon Restoration Project, which was completed in
September 2005, brought back the vitality of downtown Seoul,
transforming an area of concrete-covered stream and elevated highway
into a leading tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>In Tokyo's Akihabara district, the birth of "Akihabara
Crossfield" complex aimed at expanding the famous district of
eletronic goods to an "IT (Information Technology) hub." The complex
was opened in March.</P>
      <P>The ancient Cheonggyecheon stream was concreted over in the 1960s
to resolve road problems and an elevated highway was constructed on
top of the road later. However it started to pose safety and
environment concerns for the city.</P>
      <P>Led by Seoul Mayor Lee Myung Bak, who launched a "Vision Seoul
2006" initiative, the city of Seoul spent 386.7 billion South Korea
won (12 billion $NT) and 27 months to complete the successful
project, which has been reported by numerous international media.</P>
      <P>Akihabara Crossfield project also tried to bring a "makeover" for
an old district. As a part of "Tokyo Plan 2000, " the Tokyo
Metropolitan Government released "Urban Development Guidelines for
the Akihabara Area" in 2001, highlighting its intent "to create a
global center for the IT industry."</P>
      <P>The complex consists of two super-highrise buildings: Akihabara
Daibiru Building and Akihabara UDX. It is expected to be a new focal
point for the Akihabara district, holding areas for Industry-Academia
Collaboration, information networking, and attractions for visitors.</P>
      <P>Taipei City, which is hosting the Fifth Plenary Meeting of the
ANMC21, also has been devoted to various urban redevelopment
projects. It has submitted the concept of "Reverse the axis of
development. Redevelop the western district, " which seeks to revamp
the west side -- the earliest developed area of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The estimated budget of urban redevelopment projects in Taipei
City this year amounts to NT$40 billion.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "transformational diplomacy" promoted
by the U.S. government is expected to extend points of conflict
between the United States and China from trade to political and
military aspects, according to a recent report released by the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>The report pointed out that the idea of "transformational
diplomacy" proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice Jan.
18 has since become the core diplomatic policy of the George W. Bush
administration and that the main thrust of "transformational
diplomacy" is to promote democracy around the world in order to
achieve the ultimate goal of ending dictatorship.</P>
      <P>As shown in the National Security Strategy 2006 report issued
last month by the U.S. government, Washington thinks that China's
economy is transforming but its politics have not, the MAC report
said.</P>
      <P>The report noted that the United States has repeatedly referred
to China as a country requiring transformation and has taken measures
such as pressing China to promote democratization, while
strengthening the Chinese language ability of American diplomats and
increasing the number of diplomats posted in China.</P>
      <P>Under the principle of "transformational diplomacy," Washington's
diplomatic policy towards China will be to urge Beijing to enhance
its military transparency, stop using "energy diplomacy" to support
non-democratic regimes and to carry out political and economic
reforms simultaneously, the report said.</P>
      <P>The MAC said the transformational diplomacy of the U.S.
government was food for thought for Taiwan, where some are pushing
the government to open cross-Taiwan Strait economic and trade
exchanges with disregard to the fact that democratic development is
going backwards in China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan spent NT$260.9 billion (US$8.03
billion) on research projects in 2004, accounting for 2.4 percent of
the country's gross domestic product (GDP) , similar to the 2.6
percent level in the United States, Germany, and South Korea,
according to the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>DGBAS statistics released Saturday showed the amount of research
funds recorded a growth of 30 percent over 2000, which represented an
average annual growth rate of 7.2 percent during the four-year
period.</P>
      <P>The growth indicated both the government and private enterprises
in Taiwan have never spared efforts in promoting research and
innovation projects while facing strong global competition by
emerging economies with low-priced products.</P>
      <P>In an analysis of the 2004 research funds, the DGBAS pointed out
that the private industrial sectors spent a total of NT$167.9 billion
on high-tech research programs that year, a 33.6 percent growth from
the 2000 level.</P>
      <P>Most private funds were used in the research and development of
innovative information and electronic products, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>The analysis also showed that private sectors invested twice as
much money in research and development as the government during the
2000-2004 period, a situation similar to that of Germany and the U.S.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday
that the commissioning of two U.S.-built E-2K early warning
and control aircraft will enable Taiwan to respond quickly to any 
contingency in the event of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while addressing the aircraft commissioning
ceremony at Pingtung air base in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president said the E-2K is one of the latest versions of
early warning aircraft in the United States, which he said will
greatly enhance the nation's overall air defense capabilities.</P>
      <P>Noting that a strong air force will be a pillar in ensuring
safety and stability in the Taiwan Strait, he urged legislators
across the party spectrum to quickly pass a major arms procurement
package from the United States.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is at a critical moment in its transformation and
upgrading of combat capabilities," the president said.</P>
      <P>But the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has continued to
block three major items in a major arms procurement package --
eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft and Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries --
requested by the Executive Yuan, he lamented.</P>
      <P> He said that during his April 3 meeting with Ma Ying-jeou,
chairman of the main opposition Kuomintang, Ma said the KMT would
support a reasonable arms purchase budget, but the arms procurement
package was recently rejected by the legislature for the 51st time.</P>
      <P>He urged legislators across the board not to put at risk the
nation's security or use the defense budget as leverage in political
squabbles, and to pass the arms purchase package as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The president later observed various aircraft flying past the
review stand, including combat planes flying in formation and
the Thunder Tiger Aerobatic Team doing a stunt flying performance.</P>
      <P>During the review of ground forces, a minor mishap took
place when the 20th battalion's flag snapped while paying tribute to
the President. The flag bearer used too much force in saluting the
president, a spokesman of the Ministry of National Defense later

      <P>Taiwan and Japan can step up investment 
in India as one measure to cut risks associated with their increased 
economic interaction with China, Premier Su Tseng-chang said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks while meeting with visiting Tokyo Governor

Major Cities (ANMC21), which concluded Friday.</P>
      <P>Su noted that although China has recorded rapid economic
development in recent years, its economy has still fallen prey to its
politics. In addition, China has lax regulations regarding the
protection of intellectual property rights, often resorting to theft
in the interest of its own technological development.</P>
      <P>Also, China has often cracked down on domestic dissent in a
violent fashion, and has no regard for environmental protection or
human rights, the premier said, adding that China is a country "full
of uncertainties."</P>
      <P>But India -- with its booming high-tech developments in recent
years, large workforce and substantial English-speaking population --

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislative caucus whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party urged main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Saturday to "summon KMT lawmakers visiting
China" to return soon for review of pending legislation.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun was referring to some 30 KMT legislators in Beijing
for an economic forum being held jointly by the KMT and the Communist
Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>Chen noted that consideration of the government's arms
procurement bill was blocked by the opposition "pan-blue alliance"
for nearly two years, which Chen said seriously threatened Taiwan's
national defense.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party
also boycotted the appointment of Hsieh Wen-ting as the nation's
state public prosecutor-general, as well as the confirmation of
Control Yuan member nominations, which Chen criticized as having
damaged the country's constitutional system.</P>
      <P>Since Ma has instructed the KMT think tank to study how to
resolve problems involving the arms purchase bill and Control Yuan
member nominations, he should summon back the KMT lawmakers as soon
as possible to screen these major bills pending in the legislature,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen also questioned why KMT legislators cannot communicate
rationally with the ruling DPP administration while were willing to
negotiate with China.</P>
      <P>Besides, with the Legislative Yuan now in session, the KMT
legislators should not forget their duties, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Noting that China is employing the "two-faced" strategy of
inviting the KMT to convene an economic forum to discuss favorable
treatment toward Taiwan while targeting Taiwan with hundreds of
missiles and promulgating the "Anti-Secession" Law, Chen reminded
opposition parties to beware of China's "united front" tactics which
intend to downgrade Taiwan as one of its local governments.</P>
      <P>KMT's honorary Chairman Lien Chan is heading a 60-member
delegation composed of lawmakers and business leaders to participate
in a two-day economic KMT-CPC forum in Beijing that begun Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that Taiwan's government is willing to negotiate
with its Chinese counterpart in the interest of economic cooperation,
but that such talks should be conducted on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>China skipped talks with the DPP administration, but made
frequent contacts with the opposition parties, Chen noted, urging the
opposition not to make visits to China to "kowtow" to Beijing rulers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT's legislative caucus said the same day that
the Cabinet should withdraw its arms procurement proposal for a
package including eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC III anti-missile
batteries from the United States, since President Chen Shui-bian and
the Ministry of National Defense had agreed to acquire the three
major items through regular annual budgets instead of being put in a
special budget.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-lung, a KMT legislative caucus leader, noted that the
procurement of Patriot PAC III anti-missile batteries had been vetoed
by a national referendum, but the DPP still presented it in the
package bill, which Tsai said was "very unreasonable.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan to publicly recognize
Taiwan's progress and achievements during his current China visit.</P>
      <P>Lu made the appeal during a local Rotary Club meeting held at
Grand Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lu criticized Lien, who is heading a 170-member delegation to
participate in a Beijing economic forum jointly organized by the KMT
and the Communist Party of China (CPC), for saying "not even one good
word" about Taiwan's progress during his China visits -- this year or
in 2005.</P>
      <P>As for domestic business leaders who have accompanied Lien to
Beijing for the economic forum, Lu said she respected their efforts
in Taiwan over the past several decades, stressing that their
achievements, especially in high-tech industries, are the pride of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Lu reminded these entrepreneurs that it was Taiwan's
government, not China's, that gave them the most preferential
treatment by sometimes sacrificing the interests of traditional
industries, therefore allowing them to achieve maximum progress.</P>
      <P>Due to the constant blocking of the Cabinet's arms procurement
proposal by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the
People First Party, Taiwan's annual defense budget has remained at
US$7.65 billion for the past four years, while China's has surged
from US$20.4 billion to US$35.1 billion during the same period, Lu
stressed.</P>
      <P>Under such circumstances, Lu questioned whether Lien had ever
asked China to dedicate itself to democratization or reduce its
military threat against Taiwan. China has currently more than 700
misiles targeting Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROGRESSIVE STEPS TAKEN IN TB CONTROL: CDC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 15 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is currently a set of plans being
carried out step-by-step in the promotion of the "Directly Observed
Treatment, Short course (DOTS) " program -- one of the government's
key measures in the control of aggressive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB)
outbreaks, said Center for Disease Control (CDC) Director-General Kuo
Hsuh-sung Saturday.</P>
      <P>In order to more efficiently and effectively carry out the DOTS
program, the CDC budgeted NT$180 million (US$5.5 million) in 2006 for
it, and the money will be used in employing and training DOTS care
workers who will attend TB patients with sputum smear positive, and
monitor their medicine intake, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Experts in the DOTS program in the United States, which has been
implementing the same program for more than 20 years, will be invited
to give professional training courses to local DOTS care workers, Kuo
noted while explaining the CDC's budget regarding TB control.</P>
      <P>Earlier, Legislator Yang Li-huan of the opposition Kuomintang and
independent Legislator Chang Li-shan criticized the budget at a news
conference as "inflated."</P>
      <P>Chang criticized the CDC's proposed employment of 3,456 DOTS
caretakers as being too numerous as only 292 people currently
employed to take care of more than 4,000 TB patients around the
country.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
officials said Saturday they have not found any suspicious case
involving exports of high-precision machine tools to China as
reported by the Japanese media.</P>
      <P>Officials of MOEA's Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) made the
remarks after the Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun reported recently
that some numerical control lathes exported by Taiwan manufacturers
had been used by the Chinese military to produce stainless steel
components in missile devices.</P>
      <P>Sankei Shimbun cited Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense (MND)
as the source of its information, which the MND denied.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said they had also asked relevant Japanese
authorities for information about the report. None of the Japanese
authorities had any information about the reported event, the BOFT
officials said.</P>
      <P>At present, the officials said, only Japan, Switzerland, Germany
and the United States have the ability to produce the high-precision
lathes described by the Japanese daily.</P>
      <P>After examining export licensing documents from Jan. 1, 2005
through March this year, the officials said no suspicious cases were
found in which domestic lathes makers imported high-precision
numerical control lathes from Japan or Germany for later export to
China after assembling.</P>
      <P>The officials said they will keep checking other related export
documents and remind domestic manufacturers to abide by the nation's
export control regulations.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, high-precision machines that could be shifted to
military use are prohibited, the officials said.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's policy of not accrediting college
or university diplomas issued in China will be maintained, Vice
Education Minister Lu Mu-lin said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks amid reports earlier in the day that China
had announced 15 new goodwill measures toward Taiwan -- including the
accreditation of diplomas from Taiwan's colleges and universities --
at the end of a two-day economic and trade forum between Taiwan's
main opposition Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lu said that China "has recognized Taiwan's diplomas from the
start."</P>
      <P>Taiwanese students have always been able to pursue studies in
China, he said, wondering why China has raised the question at this
juncture.</P>
      <P>"At the present stage, Taiwan still won't accredit China's
diplomas," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, several college students were positive about China's
accreditation of Taiwan's diplomas, believing the measure would
benefit Taiwan's students.</P>
      <P>National Taiwan University President Lee Si-chen said the
measure would help Taiwan's students land jobs or pursue studies in
China. Lee was not concerned about a "brain drain," saying since
Taiwan excels in the high-tech industry, high-tech talent will
remain in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>National Chiao Tung University President Chang Chun-yen said that
China is a vast market, and it would benefit Taiwan's students
whether they work, study or obtain certificates in China.</P>
      <P>National Cheng Kung University President Wu Jin said the
time has come for Taiwan and China to start "head-hunting" for talent,
and China's new measure is aimed at recruiting Taiwanese talent.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan wants to compete with China, to recruit and retain
talent, it must reciprocate and recognize China's diplomas, Wu
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian hailed the
successful lift-off of FORMOSAT-3 -- Taiwan's third satellite project
-- from a U.S. air base Saturday, saying the new satellite will help
upgrade Taiwan's status in world atmospheric research.</P>
      <P>In a taped speech transmitted after the lift-off to Vandenberg
Air Force Base in California via videoconference, Chen expressed his
felicitations and thanked those involved in the project for their
hard work and contributions.</P>
      <P>Noting that FORMOSAT-3 is aimed at establishing a global
real-time atmospheric observation network, Chen said the project will
enable Taiwan to exchange climatic information with countries around
the world and thus enhance its status in global atmospheric research.</P>
      <P>FORMOSAT-3, also known as Constellation Observing System for
Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC), is an important
cooperative project between Taiwan and the United States that began
in December 1997, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The project has helped cultivate Taiwan's basic capacity in
satellite development and manufacturing, Chen said, adding that the
project has nurtured a new crop of outstanding satellite software
talent and satellite components manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Formosa-3 is regarded as the world's first climate monitoring and
forecasting system using a constellation of six microsatellites. As
soon as the constellation is completed, the microsatellites placed in
six different orbits ranging between 700km and 800km above the
earth's surface will begin to collect atmospheric remote sensing data
for operational weather prediction.</P>
      <P>After it becomes fully operational, FORMOSAT-3 will be able to
provide around 2,500 pieces of meteorological data in every 24-hour
period, covering all areas of the globe.</P>

Wall Street Journal: As Users Go Online, Tax-Software Firms
Retool Strategies

This year, more than 130 million Americans are suffering through
the annual ordeal of tax filing. Behind the scenes, the companies
whose software many people use to compile their returns are facing a
challenge of their own. A growing number of Americans have turned to
the Internet to file their taxes, using sites that crunch their
numbers and zap returns to the Internal Revenue Service at lower
cost. That shift has sent Intuit Inc. and H&amp;R Block Inc., the
companies that have long dominated the U.S. market for
tax-preparation software, scrambling to retool their business models.
Intuit estimates that more than 10 million people now file returns

    <HEADLINE>MAGNITUDE 6.2 QUAKE FELT AROUND EASTERN, CENTRAL, SOUTHERN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A magnitude 6.2 earthquake struck early
Sunday morning in Taitung County, eastern Taiwan, waking people up as
far away as central and southern Taiwan, the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) reported.</P>
      <P>According to the CWB Seismology Center, the quake rattled eastern
Taiwan for about 30 seconds at 6: 40 a.m., with the epicenter of the
jolt located 19.9 km northeast of Taitung at a depth of 11.7 km
beneath the surface of the sea, CWB seismologists said.</P>
      <P>Because the quake occurred in a relatively shallow area, it was
felt in almost every area in eastern, central and southern parts of
the island. The shock waves penetrated beneath the Central Mountain
Range to reach even Penghu Island offshore the southern county of
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>As of 9 a.m. Sunday, no damage or injuries had been reported,
although officials are still checking to see if the tremor caused any
landslides or falling rocks.</P>
      <P>The quake is the second with a magnitude greater than 6.0 to
rattle the island in less than half a month.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo Kai-wen, director of the CWB Seismology Center,
as the geological structure underneath and offshore Taiwan's eastern
coast is uniquely complex, earthquakes in those areas could be the
results of both squeezing and rupturing actions when the Pacific
Plate and the Eurasian Plate collide, and when another deep-sea fault
is broken.</P>
      <P>The quake had an intensity of 5.0 in Taitung County's Chengkung
area and Hualien County's Fuli area, 4.0 in Taitung City, 3.0 in
Taichung, Nantou and Yunlin counties in central Taiwan as well as in
Chiayi, Tainan, Kaohsiung and Pingtung counties in southern Taiwan,
2.0 in Yilan County in eastern Taiwan, Miaoli County in north-central
Taiwan and Tainan City in southern Taiwan, and 1.0 on Penghu Island
located in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE OPENESS AND ENGAGEMENT ACROSS STRAIT THE RIGHT DIRECTION: LIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  April  16 (CNA)
(By CNA reporters and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the unprecedentedly amicable
cross-Taiwan Strait situation, there still exists a "push and pull"
struggle between the forces of peace and the forces of conflict,
Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) honorary Chairman Lien Chan
said Sunday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao at the Great
Hall of the People in Beijing, Lien said that there have been ups and
downs in the struggle between the forces for more openness and
engagement and the forces for constriction of engagement. Lien
asserted that expanding open and peaceful engagements should be the
direction of concerted efforts of both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Lien expressed welcome to the 15 incentive measures benefiting
private exchanges across the strait that Beijing spelled out Saturday
upon the conclusion of an economic forum between the KMT and the
Communist Party of China (CPC), saying that these measures will have
"far-reaching influence" on the development of cross-strait relations
and that they reflect the expectations of "mainstream opinion" on
both sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>The former KMT chairman said he hopes that with the conclusion of
the historic KMT-CPC economic forum, both sides will make unrelenting
efforts to enable the two sides to face the even harder challenges
that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hu claimed that peaceful development should be made
the common goal of the people across the strait and the main subject
of all cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Hu even stressed that the "92 consensus" reached during official
cross-strait talks in Hong Kong in 1992 should be an important
bedrock on which the two sides strive for peaceful development. Hu
did not elaborate on the details of the "92 consensus." In Taiwan,
President Chen Shui-bian has said recently that the "92 consensus" is
only a fabricated term and does not exist.</P>
      <P>Lien and the KMT delegation of 100-odd party officials, KMT
legislators and heavyweights from Taiwan's business and industrial
sectors are scheduled to proceed to Fujian Province Monday for a
visit before returning to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEADER'S INTEGRITY AFFECTS TAIWAN'S SECURITY STRATEGY: NEW BOOK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new book released Sunday by the
Cross-Strait Interflow Prospect Foundation -- a subsidiary of the
National Security Bureau under the National Security Council -- says
that the integrity of the head of state is the foremost factor
affecting Taiwan's national security strategy.</P>
      <P>The book, "2005-2006: An Assessment of Taiwan's Security
Strategy, " compiled by former National Security Council
Secretary-General Ting Yu-chou, includes reports by scholars in the
areas of politics, economy, psychology and military affairs. It warns
that the threats Taiwan is facing internally and externally are
graver than in the past.</P>
      <P>The book lists six factors as affecting Taiwan's national
security strategy most and places the integrity of the head of state
at the top of the list. The other five factors are the people's
identification with and support for the nation, Taiwan's overall
economic strength and development, Taiwan's defense capability, the
situation in the Taiwan Strait in terms of whether there is peace and
stability, and the United States' policy and attitudes toward the
Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>In an interview upon the release of the book, Ting implied that
the integrity problem refers to President Chen Shui-bian's recent
scrapping of the National Unification Council and its guidelines,
which he pledged not to abolish during his two inaugural speeches in
2000 and 2004.</P>
      <P>According to the book, Taiwan's greatest national security threat
comes from the rise of China. While the economic threat faced by
Taiwan is greater than the military threat, the internal threat
confronting Taiwan is more serious than the threat from outside.</P>
      <P>Reports in the book say that the source of Taiwan's internal
disputes lies in the divergence of views on such issues as national
identity, Taiwan independence versus unification with China, and
ethnic discord.</P>
      <P>The reports suggest that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and the opposition parties should address their differences by going
back to their "greatest common factor" -- acknowledging the Republic
of China as Taiwan's official title as a nation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S '92 CONSENSUS' HAS NO ROOM FOR DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China continues to make use of the
so-called "1992 consensus" to insist on its "one China" principle,
under which there is no room for "different interpretations" of the
meaning of "one China, " Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>In response to Chinese President Hu Jintao's "four suggestions"
for improving cross-Taiwan Strait relations, the MAC issued a press
release accusing China of trying to dupe the people in Taiwan as well
as the international community with its "one China" principle clothed
in the "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>In his meeting with Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan at the Great Hall of People in Beijing Sunday, Hu
stressed that only by insisting on the 1992 consensus can
cross-strait peace and development be realized. He also blamed "some
people denying the existence of the 1992 consensus" for causing
ripples in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Besides criticizing Hu for sticking to an outdated and obstinate
"one China" principle that allows for no room at all for different
interpretations, the MAC also blamed Lien for failing to ask Hu to
clearly state whether their two parties (the KMT and the Communist
Party of China) look at the 1992 consensus as the same thing.</P>
      <P>What the MAC cares about is whether in Beijing's terminology, the
1992 consensus means Beijing's recognition of the Republic of China
or at least Beijing's not denying the existence of the Republic of
China. The MAC said it is regrettable that Lien failed to ask Hu to
make a clear statement about this.</P>
      <P>The MAC went on to blast China for unilaterally breaking up the
institutional mechanism of cross-strait negotiations in 1995 before
using its "one China" principle to blackmail Taiwan politically.</P>
      <P>For Beijing, "one China" means the People's Republic of China.
For the KMT, "one China" means the Republic of China. As a result,
the KMT says, the "one China" principle in their 1992 consensus means
"one China, different interpretations." But for the DPP, the 1992
consensus simply does not exist.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian recently challenged Lien to ask Hu to
state that China agrees with the KMT version of the 1992 consensus --
"one China, different interpretations."</P>
      <P>The MAC said that since 2000, when the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) ousted the KMT at the polls to become the Republic of
China's ruling party, mainland China has hidden its "sinister plots"
in the KMT-created term "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>It charged that the Chinese authorities have intentionally
ignored the fact that the ROC exists and have restricted the options
for the people of Taiwan to decide on their future. "This is the
fundamental reason for the impasse in cross-strait interactions, " it
said.</P>
      <P>While China has claimed that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
should work for peace and development, it has refused to enter into
dialogue or negotiations with Taiwan, the MAC said. Instead, it
added, China has beefed up its military deployment for invading
Taiwan, threatening the safety of the people of Taiwan and their
property, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that China has not the slightest sincerity to
improve cross-strait ties; it has merely been adopting a two-pronged
tactic of saying one thing and doing another toward Taiwan, " the MAC
said.</P>
      <P>It said the government of Taiwan has over the past years made a
lot of efforts for improving cross-strait ties, without receiving any
good-will response from China.</P>
      <P>It urged China to give up its political prerequisites for talking
with Taiwan and immediately resume talks with Taiwan on an equal
footing in order to solve issues affecting both sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S ECONOMIC FAVORS TO TAIWAN SEEN AS UNITED FRONT GIMMICKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 15 new measures toward Taiwan that
China announced Saturday are just small favors aimed at creating
conflicts within Taiwan, former Vice Premier Wu Rong-i Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wu said he suspects that the new measures announced at the
conclusion of the Kuomintang-Communist Party of China forum in
Beijing are part of China's united front strategy toward Taiwan and
"nothing but political maneuvering."</P>
      <P>If China really wants to make a goodwill gesture to Taiwan, he
said, it should first remove its missiles aimed at Taiwan, scrap its
Anti-Secession Law, let Taiwan take part in the World Health
Organization (WHO) and let Taiwan freely sign free trade agreements
with other member countries of the WHO.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the KMT-CPC trade and economy forum, Wu said
Taiwan, a country with a free economy, is obliged to restrict trade
activities with China because Beijing hasn't given up its intention
to seize Taiwan by force as stated in its Anti-Secession Law, and
because it is trying to suffocate Taiwan in the international
community.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has to be careful with the 15 new measures.
He cited the gravel industry as an example, noting that China's
gravel exports to Taiwan were halted May 1 this year under a simple
order from Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>Out of self-interest, some gravel business operators in Taiwan
have gone as far as acknowledging that Taiwan is part of China, Wu
said, adding that "this is where the gravest danger lies." He
stressed that Taiwan must not surrender to China for the sake of some
minor interests.</P>
      <P>A 170-member delegation led by KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan
attended the KMT-CPC forum in Beijing, including many influential
Taiwanese industry leaders whose enterprises represent more than 40
percent of Taiwan's total industrial export.</P>

      <P>Medical doctors in Taiwan welcomed on
Sunday new measures announced by Beijing that will allow Taiwan
investors to set up joint venture hospitals in mainland China and
permit Taiwanese medical doctors to get a license and practice on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Kao Ming-chien, president of the Taiwan Medical Alliance
Association, said that although Taiwan's medical sector is elated by
the news, the measures are really nothing new because Chinese
authorities planned to allow Taiwan doctors to set up a healthcare
complex in Xiamen, Fujian Province, three years ago.</P>
      <P>Kao, a noted brain surgeon and former legislator, added that the
plan did not materialize due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) outbreak in April and May 2003 and the opposition from the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its "pan-green" camp partner
-- the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>He said that in terms of opportunities in China's healthcare
market, Taiwan is no longer in a favored position, as compared to
three years ago, because the medical sectors of the United States,
Japan and Germany have already made inroads in such major Chinese
cities as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzen.</P>
      <P>Kao acknowledged that Taiwan still has opportunities in
second-tier Chinese cities that host a considerable number of Taiwan
businesspeople and members of their families.</P>
      <P>Beijing announced last Saturday that Taiwan investors will be
allowed to hold up to a 70-percent stake in joint venture hospitals
they set up with mainland partners, and that medical doctors from
Taiwan will be allowed to get a license and practice in the mainland
after they pass official examinations.</P>
      <P>Currently there are no legally established Taiwanese hospitals in
China to provide healthcare to hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese
living there, many of whom choose to go back to Taiwan for treatment
when they get sick because the healthcare standards in China cannot
compare to those in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'92 CONSENSUS' NOT CLARIFIED DURING LIEN-HU MEETING: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Sunday to stop
creating chaos with the so-called "1992 consensus, " as Chinese
President Hu Jintao failed to acknowledge "one China, respective
interpretations" as its essence in his meeting with KMT honorary
Chairman Lien Chan earlier the same day in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lai I-chung, head of the DPP's China affairs department, called
on the KMT to stop misleading the Taiwan people as Hu, who also
serves as general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) ,
failed to make it clear in public during the Lien-Hu meeting at the
Great Hall of the People that the "1992 consensus" refers to an
agreement on "respective interpretations of 'one China'" as the KMT
has been claiming.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the KMT and the CPC came up with 15
beneficial measures aimed at "luring" the Taiwan people following a
historic two-day KMT-CPC economic forum that wrapped up Saturday, Lai
said that Hu did not respond to Lien's call for a cross-strati common
market.</P>
      <P>Lai claimed that Lien was fooled again by the CPC and that the
results of the KMT-CPC forum have in turn become a bargaining chip
for Beijing in its dealings with the United States.</P>
      <P>As Hu did not mention in public that he accepts the "1992
consensus, respective interpretations of 'one China'" statement, it
is obvious that there is no consensus in this regard between the KMT
and the CPC, Lai said, accusing Lien of not having asked Hu to do so
and calling it a flop of Lien in dancing to Beijing's tune.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the root of cross-Taiwan Strait squabbles lies
in China's suppression of Taiwan, Lai blasted Lien for singing a duet
with Beijing instead of speaking up for Taiwan during their meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, a DPP legislative caucus whip, said that although
the Lien-Hu meeting seems to have produced many incentives, they are
actually cover-ups of Beijing's malicious intentions against Taiwan.
He claimed that "Taiwan's 23 million people will never accept them."</P>
      <P>According to Chen, neither Taiwan nor China can provide documents
to prove the existence of the disputed "1992 consensus" -- a result
which former KMT government officials said they obtained during a
1992 meeting with Chinese officials in Hong Kong that both sides
agreed to give their own definitions of the "one China" principle in
terms of Taiwan's relations with the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>The DPP remains firm on safeguarding Taiwan's national
sovereignty and Beijing should not set any preconditions on reopening
negotiations with Taiwan, Chen said. As long as Taiwan's national
dignity and sovereignty and its democratic system are fully
protected, the DPP government is willing to hold talks with Beijing
on any topic, he said.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that the Lien-Hu meeting, a disguise of
China's united front tactics, is unacceptable to the DPP government.</P>
      <P>Chen maintained that Beijing should approach the ruling DPP
government, rather than an opposition party, for talks on
cross-strait relations, pointing out that Beijing's talks with the
KMT is apparently a plot to cripple Taiwan's government.</P>
      <P>Hu said during Sunday's Lien-Hu meeting, the second of its kind
since last year, that peaceful development is the common desire of
the people on both sides of the strait and insisted that the "1992
consensus" is the cornerstone on which Taiwan and China can achieve
the goal through reciprocal and equal negotiations.</P>
      <P>Hu also said that Beijing will "do its best" to live up to its
promises made to the Taiwan people despite "changing situations
across the strait and the boycott of a few people."</P>
      <P>Lien paid a landmark visit to China in late April last year when
he was still KMT chairman, breaking a decades-old stalemate between
the KMT and CPC after Taiwan and China split in 1949 amid a civil
war.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES KMT TO DISCUSS WAYS TO UPGRADE TAIWAN'S INDUSTRIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Leaders of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
should sit down and discuss how to upgrade Taiwan's industries, a DPP
legislative caucus whip urged Sunday.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chen Chin-jun told a news conference that the KMT
should not be complacent about the favors granted by Beijing after
KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan's meeting on Sunday with Chinese
President Hu Jintao, who also serves as the general secretary of the
Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>"The Kuomintang cannot save Taiwan by only relying on China,"
Chen said, adding that there are many issues concerning Taiwan's
economic development strategies that need to be sorted out between
the DPP and the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Yet instead of discussing these issues with the ruling party
behind closed doors, KMT leaders "are happy to become tools of
China's united front tactics," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that if the KMT does not stand firm on the issue of
Taiwan's sovereignty and allows China to downgrade Taiwan to the
level of a local government, then whatever was achieved by the KMT
delegation during its two-day trade and economic forum with the CPC
in Beijing would be of little significance.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan and China should discuss mutual problems
with no preconditions, with both sides treating each other as equals.</P>
      <P>"The people of Taiwan will not accept the 'one-China' principle
as a premise for cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue," Chen said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) urged Chinese President Hu Jintao Sunday to talk with
Taiwan's government and ruling party on ways of "co-existing with
Taiwan's democracy."</P>
      <P>On Hu's proposal to take "peace and development" as the
foundation of cross-strait exchanges and the common goal for people
on both sides, Yu Shy-kun, DPP chairman, said peace and development
will not be possible if they are not built on the basis of freedom
and democracy.</P>
      <P>Hu also suggested that the 1992 consensus is a "critical basis
for realizing peace and development across the strait."</P>
      <P>Yu said Hu should recognize the fact that Taiwan exists and try
to co-exist with Taiwan's democracy by, for instance, acknowledging
the right of the Taiwan people to decide on their own future.</P>
      <P>Yu also urged Hu to make "concrete commitments" about promoting
China's democracy and human rights, adding that the DPP will closely
monitor such "key indicators" as whether Hu will rehabilitate victims
in the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Massacre and whether he will continue
to suppress China's freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>Yu said he is asking China to speed up democratic reforms because
only democracy can serve as a basis for cross-strait exchanges, and
only democracy will minimize the hidden risks involved in China's
economic development.</P>
      <P>As Hu did not specify Beijing's position with regard to the KMT's
claim of "one China, different interpretations," Yu called on the KMT
not to mention it again since it was not even a consensus between
itself and the Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>However, he noted that the DPP government would, in a spirit of
pragmatism, like to resume talks with Beijing based on the "results
achieved in the 1992 talks in Hong Kong."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT'S CHINA POLICY PLATFORM NON-NEGOTIABLE: LIEN CHAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  April  16 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang's (KMT's) "one China,
different interpretations" platform is clear and definite, leaving no
room for further bargaining, the party's honorary chairman said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lien Chan made the remarks in answer to reporters' questions
after he met with Chinese President Hu Jintao, a meeting in which
some people in Taiwan expected he would raise the issue of "one
China, different interpretations" to his host.</P>
      <P>The issue is at the center of a controversy in Taiwan about the
"1992 consensus" reached between Taipei and Beijing in Hong Kong. The
KMT, which was in power at the time, said the two sides agreed on the
principle of "one China, " with each side free to interpret what it
means. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government has
said that it will not accept the consensus until Beijing publicly
endorses it.</P>
      <P>Lien recalled that before he made his historic visit to China
last year as the leader of Taiwan's largest opposition party, he
informed President Chen Shui-bian that he would be taking the KMT's
cross-strait policy proposals to China, proposals that were "very
clear" and that "would not change a bit -- with nothing being added
and nothing being taken away."</P>
      <P>"I specifically asked him (Chen), do you get me?" Lien added.</P>
      <P>The problem lies with Chen and his DPP, he said, adding that
"this is their problem, which they themselves should solve. They
should face the question posed by the media, namely: Do you accept
'one China, different interpretations?'"</P>
      <P>On April 3, during a meeting with KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, Chen
challenged Lien to urge China's Hu to publicly proclaim Beijing
accepts the KMT's version of "one China" -- the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Hu did mention the 1992 consensus while meeting with Lien Sunday,
but only expounding on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait belonging
to "one China" without mentioning whether he agreed with the KMT's
interpretation of "one China" as the ROC.</P>
      <P>To a reporter who said Hu did not mention "one China, different
interpretations, " Lien jokingly began his response by saying: "I
believe you are not asking me this question on behalf of Chen
Shui-bian."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP TO PUSH PASSAGE OF AMENDMENTS TO FACILITATE AT CHINA LINKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) will push for
passage of various law amendments at the Legislative Yuan in order to
have direct transport links between Taiwan and China in place by the
end of this year, PFP lawmaker Daniel Y. C. Huang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks during the launch of a new book sponsored
by the Cross-Strait Interflow Prospect Foundation.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the PFP is poised to do so by putting the
revisions to the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People
of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area to a vote at the Legislative
Yuan after a four-month negotiation period comes to an end late this
month, despite the fact that a just-concluded economic forum between
the Kuomintang (KMT) the Communist Party of China (CPC) failed to
produce a timetable for the matter.</P>
      <P>Huang called on the Democratic Progressive Party government to
face up to the issue "the sooner the better, " as setting up direct
air and shipping links will help Taiwan businesses significantly
reduce their production costs.</P>
      <P>The PFP lawmaker, however, called it a surprise development that
the two-day KMT-CPC forum which ended Saturday in Beijing did not
work out a fixed time frame on opening direct transport links across
the Taiwan Strait, apart from 15 economic cooperation measures
covering a wide range of issues from tourism, agriculture and health
care.</P>
      <P>KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan met Chinese President and CPC
General Secretary Hu Jintao Sunday morning, with the two agreeing to
further advance cross-strait peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT-CPC economic forum and the Lien-Hu meeting
drew flak from the ruling DPP, which criticized the KMT, Taiwan's
largest opposition party, for "going a long way" to engage Beijing
officials instead of holding talks with the government.</P>
      <P>Speaking at Legislative Yuan news conference, DPP legislative
caucus whip Chen Chin-jun condemned the KMT for being willing to act
as a united front tool for the CPC.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, various DPP lawmakers reportedly have suggested
that the government accept some "acceptable agreements" reached at
the KMT-CPC forum as long as they do not infringe upon Taiwan's
national sovereignty.</P>
      <P>DPP whip Chen said he was disgruntled upon hearing this,
stressing that Taiwan's status as an independent and sovereign nation
must not be eroded no matter what. "The Taiwan people will never take
any results yielded in talks held under the 'one China'
precondition," he said.</P>
      <P>Lien, leading a high profile delegation of more than 170 KMT
lawmakers, experts and business leaders, arrived in Beijing Friday to
attend the historic forum with CPC officials -- the first of its kind
after Taiwan and China split in 1949.</P>
      <P>Lien, in his capacity as KMT chairman, met Hu in Beijing for the
first time during a landmark visit to China in late April last year,
paving the way for their second meeting and the economic forum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA AIMS TO ANNEX TAIWAN ECONOMICALLY VIA 'HAIXI PLAN': ADVISER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's plan to develop China's Fujian
Province into a "peaceful cooperation experimental district on the
west side of the Taiwan Strait" -- known by its shortened name as the
"Haixi district development plan " -- is aimed at annexing Taiwan
economically, a Presidential Office adviser said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ruan Ming, a national policy adviser to President Chen Shui-bian,
warned at a press conference on the implications of the
just-concluded economic forum between the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and the Communist Party of China (CPC) held in Beijing that the
Beijing leadership put forth a "tremendously dangerous" slogan at the
forum, namely "district to district, enterprise to enterprise and
private sector to private sector" in terms of cross-strait efforts to
boost trade and business exchanges across the strait.</P>
      <P>This slogan fully underscores the strategic goal of Beijing's
"Haixi district development plan, " which was put forward by Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao during the National People's Congress in early
March aimed at persuading more Taiwan businesses and industries to
relocate their operations to Fujian and further "dwarfing Taiwan into
a local district of China," Ruan said.</P>
      <P>Ruan said that Beijing's according high-profile hospitality to
KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan and the offering of 15 incentive
measures to Taiwan during the forum were mainly aimed at helping
alleviate pressure that the United States is likely to exert on
Beijing when U.S. President George W. Bush meets with President Hu
Jintao in Washington, D.C. this week regarding economic, human rights
and religious freedom issues.</P>
      <P>The adviser made the analysis during the press conference
sponsored by the Taiwan Association of University Professors.</P>
      <P>Ruan invited his audience to view the politics and economies of
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait separately, saying that
politically, Taiwan is a free country with its own full sovereignty,
while China is a totalitarian regime ruled by the Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>Economically, he said, Taiwan can talk with the Chinese
government on economic issues if the principles of equality and
reciprocity exist. If this is the case, he said, Taiwan doesn't need
to take a hostile stance toward China, although Taiwan should by no
means condone China's plot to strip Taiwan of its sovereignty.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's offering Taiwan the 15 incentive measures, Ruan said
that despite China's rapid economic and industrial growth, the
country is facing major problems in its agricultural sector, health
system and educational reforms. China's opening of its doors to
Taiwan medical professionals and larger-scale agricultural imports
are part of its strategic scheming, he claimed.</P>
      <P>He reminded Taiwan that before engaging in cooperation in the
establishment of an agricultural cooperation experimental district in
China, which would unavoidably involve Taiwan's agricultural
high-tech know-how, Taiwan should demand that China follow
international norms and regulations in terms of patent rights and
intellectual property rights protection.</P>
      <P>Ruan said Taiwan should work to prevent its hard-earned
agricultural technology advances from being used by China for
nothing. If it doesn't stop this from happening, he said, the Taiwan
agricultural sector's international competitiveness will be
compromised in the long run.</P>

      <P>Main oppostion Kuomintang (KMT) honorary
Chairman Lien Chan touted the just-concluded forum between his party
and the Communist Party of China (CPC), saying the achievements were
"better than expected."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference after his meeting with Chinese
President Hu Jintao, who doubles as the CPC general secretary,
Lien said the 15 measures announced by Beijing at the conclusion of
the forum with the purpose of opening its market further to Taiwan
cover a range of fields much wider than was expected and will have
far-reaching effects.</P>
      <P>Lien brushed aside his critics' claims in Taipei that he failed
to prod Beijing to acknowledge the KMT's interpretation of "one
China, different interpretations" as the essence of the "1992
consensus," saying it wasn't worth the fuss to respond.</P>
      <P>However, Lien, who served as the KMT chief from 2000 to 2005,
said his party's stance on the relationship between Taiwan and China
is very clear and that it is more than his or KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou's personal view.</P>
      <P>On the "five visions" that he worked out with Hu during their
first meeting in Beijing in April, 2005, Lien said that they have
already been translated into the KMT's political platform and that
they were reaffirmed by Ma during his recent U.S. visit.</P>
      <P>After being reminded by a journalist of his earlier claims that
the difference between Taiwan and China lies in their different
political systems, Lien said that it is obvious that Taiwan and China
have different systems and that this doesn't need to be emphasized.
However, he added that China has changed a lot in this regard and
that the changes would be accelerated further in the future.</P>
      <P>Lien led a 170-member delegation to the KMT-CPC forum which was
held April 14-15 in Beijing.</P>

Counter Rumsfeld Critics

The U.S. Defense Department has issued a memorandum to a group of
former military commanders and civilian analysts that offers a direct
challenge to the criticisms made by retired generals about Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. The memorandum begins by stating, "
U.S. senior military leaders are involved to an to an unprecedented
degree in every decision- making process in the Department of
Defense." It says Mr. Rumsfeld has had 139 meetings with the Joint
Chiefs of Staff since the start of 2005 and 208 meetings with the
senior field commanders. Seeking to put the criticism of the
relatively small number of retired generals into context, the e-mail
message also notes that there are more than 8,000 active-duty and

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IS A FROG IN CHINA'S GRADUALLY WARMING POT: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 16 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is like a frog enjoying a good bath
in a warm-water tub prepared by China, a scholar commented Sunday
after Beijing released another series of economic favors to Taiwan at
the end of a joint trade and economic forum of the Kuomintang (KMT)
and the Communist Party of China in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lin Chung-pin, former vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council and former deputy defense minister, said the gravest danger
facing Taiwan is that it is like a hypnotized frog in a gradually
warming tub set up by China.</P>
      <P>He said all of the new measures that Beijing has announced since
April, 2005, including giving a pair of pandas as gift to Taiwan,
importing Taiwan fruit at zero tariffs, lowering the tuition and
offering scholarship to Taiwan students, were "unilateral" decisions
that do not need Taipei's "matching" efforts.</P>
      <P>Other such measures were lengthening the time for Taiwan
journalists based in China, offering financial loans to Taiwan
business people investing in China, relaxing rules on Taiwan citizens
working in China, and encouraging dialogue with Taiwan's "die-hard
independentists," according to Lin.</P>
      <P>Beijing has been launching the "charming offensive" in the
aftermath of enacting Anti-Secession Law, mainly to remedy the harms
done by that piece of legislation, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Beijing's "smile" tactic actually has extended to the United
States, using the U.S. to restrain Taiwan, he said, noting that such
a tactic indicates that Chinese President Hu Jintao is not afraid of
delaying the time for a showdown with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>By working with the U.S. in restraining the Taiwan independence
movement, Beijing is trying to eventually annex Taiwan without
triggering a war, said the China expert.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, he pointed out, China has never slowed down the
pace of its military modernization program, an indication that its
"two-pronged" strategy toward Taiwan has not changed.</P>
      <P>In spite of China's smile offensive and growing military might,
Lin said there are still many opportunities for Taiwan, but Taiwan
authorities must first of all work to build a party-government
consensus and proceed to forge a national consensus.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government must also realize that China is a huge
neighbor sitting near by the "small island" country, and try to take
part in all aspects of cross-Taiwan Strait interactions, Lin said.</P>
      <P>In particular, he suggested that Taiwan take part in the
"fermenting" process of China's political reforms.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Twelve medical professionals from Taiwan
have taken part in eight specialists conference organized by World
Health Organization (WHO) ever since the health body signed an
memorandum of understanding with China in last May to offer Taiwan
access to relevant WHO technical activities, WHO Director-General Dr.
Lee Jong-wook said recently.</P>
      <P>Among the eight conferences with the presence of Taiwan's
specialists, Lee said two were related to avian flu and all
meeting-goers of these conferences considered Taiwan's participation
positive and in line with a WHO resolution about universal
participation in this health body.</P>
      <P>Lee said the WHO signed the memorandum with China in order to
fulfill its goal of helping all peoples attain the highest possible
level of health, adding that the world can't afford any gap in its
surveillance and response network against epidemics.</P>
      <P>Lee made the statement in response to questions from some WHO
member states which are concerned about Taiwan's access to WHO
activities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan which is not a member of the United Nations and is thereby
shut out of the WHO refuses to accept the memorandum between the WHO
and China which referred to Taiwan as a province of China and
required the WHO to consult with China before conducting technical
exchanges with Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Twelve medical professionals from Taiwan
have taken part in eight specialists conference organized by World
Health Organization (WHO) ever since the health body signed an
memorandum of understanding with China in last May to offer Taiwan
access to relevant WHO technical activities, WHO Director-General Dr.
Lee Jong-wook said recently.</P>
      <P>Among the eight conferences with the presence of Taiwan's
specialists, Lee said two were related to avian flu and all
meeting-goers of these conferences considered Taiwan's participation
positive and in line with a WHO resolution about universal
participation in this health body.</P>
      <P>Lee said the WHO signed the memorandum with China in order to
fulfill its goal of helping all peoples attain the highest possible
level of health, adding that the world can't afford any gap in its
surveillance and response network against epidemics.</P>
      <P>Lee made the statement in response to questions from some WHO
member states which are concerned about Taiwan's access to WHO
activities.</P>
      <P>Taiwan which is not a member of the United Nations and is thereby
shut out of the WHO refuses to accept the memorandum between the WHO

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NOT TO BE MAIN TOPIC IN BUSH-HU MEETING: THINK TANK OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is not expected to be the top
subject in the forthcoming meeting between U.S. President George W.
Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao in Washington, D.C., a think
tank senior fellow said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Elizabeth Economy, director of Asia Studies of the prestigious
think tank the Council on Foreign Relations, said that from the U.S.
point of view, the Taiwan issue will only be third on the list in the
Bush-Hu meeting slated for April 20.</P>
      <P>The most pressing issues that Bush is expected to talk with Hu
about are the U.S. trade deficit with China and the undervalued
Chinese currency, as well as global security issues involving North
Korea and Iran, Economy said.</P>
      <P>The Bush administration is also expected to push China to engage
in a partnership with the United States to share responsibilities in
the international community, she added.</P>
      <P>Economy admitted that from China's perspective, Taiwan will
always be the most or second most important issue to be talked about
in meetings like the Bush-Hu one, and China will certainly raise the
issue of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan as well as President Chen
Shui-bian's independence inclination.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she said, there have been no incidents regarding
Taiwan over the past several weeks that were prominent enough to make
the Taiwan issue the centerpiece of the upcoming Bush-Hu meeting.</P>
      <P>To the United States, particularly the U.S. Congress, the trade
deficit, the value of the Chinese yuan, and intellectual property
rights (IPR) protection are the most crucial issues to be tackled,
Economy said, adding that the United States' trade deficit with China
exceeded US$200 billion for 2005 and that Congress has become
increasingly concerned about fairness in trade with China.</P>
      <P>Just recently, Economy said, Washington and Beijing jointly
announced at a meeting of the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade
several measures regarding IPR protection and China's opening of its
telecommunications market. The purpose of the meeting was apparently
to pave the way for Bush and Hu to arrive at concrete conclusions in
their meeting, she said. However, she added that the key is whether
Hu will implement the measures after he returns to China.</P>

flights on holidays and weekends.</P>

      <P>Asked about Chen's statement, Liu said that the government has
commissioned the Taipei Airlines Association, which has helped
negotiate cross-strait charter flights for the Chinese New Year
holidays before, to help arrange for negotiations on the issues of
cross-strait cargo and passenger charter flights.</P>
      <P>The communications have "been in progress" and have never been
disrupted, Liu said, adding that "there are absolutely no special
envoys or any need to designate envoys to communicate with China."</P>
      <P>Liu said Chen's statement should be read as "both sides of the

    <HEADLINE>CHINA URGED TO ADDRESS TAIWAN TRAVEL ISSUE IN 'ONE SHOT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 17 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A mainland affairs official urged China on
Monday to take a "once-and-for-all" step in its move to allow its
citizens to travel to Taiwan for sightseeing.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's announcement a day earlier of a package
of rules governing Chinese people's sightseeing travel to Taiwan,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Liu Teh-shun said that
even if the regulations are put into effect, this does not mean that
Chinese citizens will be able to come to Taiwan for tourist visits
right away, because Beijing has not yet listed Taiwan as one of the
destinations where Chinese tourists can visit.</P>
      <P>Compared with Taiwan's unveiling of a complete program and
measures in 2002 in accepting Chinese tourists' requests for
sightseeing trips to Taiwan, China's announcement Sunday marked a
delay of four-and-a-half years, Liu said, adding that "it's time for
China to catch up with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Analyzing Taiwan's measures to allow Chinese tourists to sightsee
in Taiwan and Beijing's regulations for management of mainland
residents' pleasure trips to the island, Liu said that some
differences still exist between the two sides on the issue and that
there are relevant technical problems that need to be settled through
negotiations.</P>
      <P>China's Taiwan sightseeing management regulations are comprised
of two main parts, including rules governing Chinese tourists'
activities in Taiwan, as well as regulations on the selection and
management of Chinese travel agencies in providing Taiwan tour
packages and on Taiwanese organizations receiving Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>"Why do our host units need China's affirmation?" Liu asked</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Hong Kong daily Wen Hui Bao cited Feng Chuozhe,
president of the Beijing-run China Strait Travel Service, as saying
Monday that the new Taiwan travel rules are aimed at providing legal
protection to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The new rules help unfold "trust-based tourist activities" across
the Taiwan Strait, ensuring that China will transport tourists to
Taiwan "in an orderly way" and that Chinese tourists will receive
hospitable services, Feng said.</P>
      <P>The report predicted that Taiwan's unique natural resources and
abundant cultural landscapes will attract many Chinese tourists,
estimating as many as 50 million mainland citizens will want to visit
Taiwan for sightseeing.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is willing to see more talent, including former Premier Frank
Hsieh, join the party's primary for the year-end Taipei mayoral
election, a DPP official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, director of the DPP's Department of Culture and
Information, made the remarks after reports that the DPP's
decision-makers will not rule out the possibility of inviting Hsieh
to run for Taipei mayor.
</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is also willing to join other
heavyweights to persuade Hsieh -- who is currently on a short-term
study program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard
University -- after his return from the United States at the end of
this month, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that many party members think Hsieh has a good chance
of winning the election, but he also said the party will give its
full support to whoever wins the primary -- whether Hsieh or former
DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung, who is the only one to have expressed
any intention of running for Taipei mayorship.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, a DPP caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, said
"Hsieh is definitely the trump card to turn the situation around for
the DPP."</P>
      <P>Noting that pro-Hsieh legislators will organize a delegation to
the United States to hear Hsieh give a speech at Harvard University
Wednesday, Ker said that he will join them to try to persuade Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Various factions within the DPP said Monday that they will 
respect Hsieh's wishes as to whether he wants to run.</P>
      <P>Legislator William Lai, also convener of the DPP's New Tide
faction, said the faction thinks Hsieh will be a suitable candidate,
claiming that no-one, whether in the ruling or opposition parties,
can be on a par with him in terms of service record and
qualifications.</P>
      <P>"The faction will give full support to the party's nominee, " Lai
said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kao Chih-peng, secretary-general of DPP's Justice
Alliance faction, said the decision-making of the DPP has been mostly
from the bottom up and that only prodding from the grassroots will
persuade Hsieh to run.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kao Chien-chi of the Welfare State faction said the
Presidential Office, the DPP legislative caucus and the party should
discuss who have the best chances of winning the Taipei and Kaohsiung
mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>In addition to Hsieh, former DPP chairmen and premiers should
also be possible candidates, Kao said. </P>
      <P>Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni, a protege of Hsieh, said the DPP
leaders have realized that the party is in disarray in the wake of a
spate of scandals.</P>
      <P>"To galvanize the party, the most crucial battles will be the
year-end Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections. The DPP will be out
of the woods if it can win the elections," she said.</P>
      <P>If Hsieh considers joining the election, his motives will be "for
the party, and not for the individual," according to Hsieh Hsin-ni.</P>
      <P>If other factions are only attempting to keep Hsieh away from the
presidential election in 2008, then the strenuous efforts to persuade
him to join the mayoral race will be unnecessary, she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FARMERS URGED NOT TO OVER-PRODUCE UPON CHINESE OFFERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan farmers were urged Monday not to
over-produce fruit and vegetables simply because China has offered to
increase imports of Taiwan agricultural products duty free.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fruit growers and vegetable farmers were warned by Chen
Chang-chen, a deputy researcher with the Chung-Hua Institution for
Economic Research -- a private think tank -- about the risks of
excessive production in light of Beijing's offer, which so far is
only verbal.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan farmers should give it a second thought before
increasing production, given the gap in the price structures between
Taiwan and China is wide, the fierce competition from Southeast Asia,
and the generally short shelf life of fruit and vegetables.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that for future exports of Taiwan-produced fruit
to China, such trade should follow the formula adopted when Taiwan
exports fruit to Japan -- keeping the shipments high quality with
high price tags.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that Taiwan fruit growers export their produce
directly to supermarkets or franchise stores in big cities in China
to shorten delivery periods and avoid exploitation by middlemen.</P>
      <P>At the conclusion of the economic forum between Taiwan's main
opposition Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China held in
Beijing Saturday, Chen Yunlin, China's top official in charge of
Taiwan affairs, announced that China will dispatch procurement
missions to Taiwan to purchase the "extra" fruit and vegetables in
times of over-production. Such imports will also be duty free too, he
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will not get
involved in the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DDP's)
nomination of candidates for mayoral elections in Taipei and
Kaohsiung, the Presidential Office said Monday.</P>
      <P>It noted that the DPP will name someone who best represents the
party in the election battles according to party rules, which include
the holding of primaries.</P>
      <P>The statement was in response to media claims that Chen will call
on former Premier Frank Hsieh, who is studying in the United States,
to run for mayor of Taipei in order to invigorate the demoralized
rank-and-file of the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-land, director of the DPP's Department of
Communication and Culture, denied the speculation after a meeting of
senior officials of the Presidential Office, the DPP and the
Executive Yuan. Tsai said the reports were incorrect.</P>
      <P>He said the Presidential Office will respect the DPP's
nominations for the two municipalities, which will hold mayoral and
city council elections in December.</P>

      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said Monday that it will host breakfast meetings for
three days in which officials and businessmen will be invited to talk
about the results of a just-concluded economic forum in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Topics of the three breakfast meetings, which will start Tuesday,
will center on direct cross-Taiwan Strait air links and tourist
exchanges, agricultural and fishery issues and issues concerning
education and health care.</P>
      <P>The caucus wants to discuss with the government and the private
sector 15 new measures toward Taiwan announced by China Saturday at
the conclusion of the forum co-sponsored by the KMT and the Communist
Party of China (CPC) in Beijing in the hope of seeking affirmation
from the government and the private sector of the results of the
KMT-CPC forum.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT's policy
coordination department, and KMT caucus whip Pan Wei-kang, as well as
KMT legislators Joanna Lei, Wu Yu-sheng and Chu Feng-chi, announced
the planned breakfast meetings at a news conference at the KMT
legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>China's 15 new measures, which KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan
claims is designed to further open China's market to Taiwan, include
recognizing Taiwan's tertiary education diplomas, allowing Taiwan
citizens to take part in China's customs broker licensing
examinations, sending farm produce procurement missions to Taiwan and

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An office and a group of friends of former
Premier Frank Hsieh will be inaugurated in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan
next month, an executive director of the office said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang Ching-chuan said the office will set up May 7, while the
"Hsieh's friends" group will be launched May 18. Both aim to bring
Hsieh closer to the grassroots.</P>
      <P>"Hsieh hopes to hear the voice and keep abreast of the
expectations of the grassroots to work for the good of Taiwan's
future," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Two other Hsieh offices will be set up in central and northern
Taiwan later, he said, adding that he is hoping for 300 "Hsieh's
friends" groups by the end of the year, with one in every village and
township in the country.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the inauguration of so many offices and groups in
such a short time is related to paving the way for Hsieh to run in
the presidential election in 2008, pro-Hsieh officials said that "it
is premature to say this."</P>
      <P>When Hsieh, who was Kaohsiung mayor before serving as premier,
stepped down from the premiership in late January after serving for
less than a year, he said clearly that he wanted to listen to the
voice of the grassroots, and the "Hsieh's friends" groups will
provide the best forum for this, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTION IN NO HURRY TO INDICT FORMER PRESIDENTIAL OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The prosecution authorities said Monday
they are in no hurry to indict former Presidential Office Deputy
Secretary-General Chen Che-nan, even though they have strong evidence
to charge him with fraud.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they were thinking of delaying Chen's indictment
because he is also suspected of involvement in several other major
scandals that are being investigated.</P>
      <P>These scandals include stock playing at the Presidential Office
and an ownership fight over the Pacific Sogo Department Store, which
has led to a controversy over whether the first family accepted gift
vouchers for the store.</P>
      <P>Chen also stands accused in the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp.
(KRTC) scandal for using his political influence to help Huapan
Administration Consultant Co. win a contract to manage foreign
workers working on the KRTC's construction project.</P>
      <P>As all of these scandals are very complicated, Taipei District
Court Chief Prosecutor Yen Ta-ho called a meeting of prosecutors and
investigators last week, urging them to "aggressively pursue all
likely evidence."</P>
      <P>On a newspaper report that the judicial authorities will soon
conclude probes into the fraud case, in which bankrupt construction
businessman Liang Po-hsun accused Chen of taking bribes from him,
Prosecutor Lin Pang-liang said the prosecution will not consider
which case to conclude first.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan was detained April 7 on suspicion of defrauding
Liang and is supposed to be indicted within four months. Because Chen
is also highly suspected for his involvement in the stock playing and
Pacific Sogo scandals, the prosecution was concerned that if Chen
were freed on bail by a court hearing the case, investigations into
his suspected roles in the other cases could be made difficult.</P>
      <P>As a result, the Taipei prosecutors said they were in no hurry to
indict Chen at present, as they have until Aug. 8 to take that
action.</P>
      <P>Both Chen and Liang could be indicted on charges of breaking the
anti-corruption law, while Yang Chen-feng, a sauna business owner, is
expected to be indicted on charges of perjury in the fraud case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LASHES OUT AT KMT OFFICIAL'S PERFORMANCE IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun expressed disappointment Monday with main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, accusing him
of lacking moral integrity when speaking in front of Chinese leaders.</P>
      <P>Yu said that Lien's performance in China was really deplorable
because he did not dare mention the Republic of China or his own
experience in serving as premier and vice president of the nation
when meeting Chinese President Hu Jintao Sunday in Beijing following
a two-day forum between the KMT and the Communist Party of China (CPC)
that ended Sunday in the Chinese capital.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yu also strongly criticized Lien for not having the
courage to ask Hu to clarify the dispute centering on the "separate
interpretation of 'one China'" statement regarding Taiwan's relations
with China.</P>
      <P>A set of 15 overtures offered by Beijing to Taiwan following the
KMT-CPC forum are nothing more than some agreements that have been
reached between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait or some issues
that will soon be settled under the framework of the World Trade
Organization, the DPP chairman said, urging China to stop playing the
"carrot and stick" strategy.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus also held a news conference at the
Legislative Yuan to condemn the KMT-CPC forum, saying that in
addition to Lien, KMT lawmakers attending the forum also have the
responsibility to report on their meetings and the itinerary of their
China tour to the Taiwan people in public after they return home.</P>
      <P>Echoing Yu's view, DPP legislative caucus whip Chen Chin-jun
claimed that the Taiwan people are "really disappointed" with the KMT
after scores of KMT lawmakers have headed to Beijing to meet Hu --
something he called a sharp contrast to their all-out boycott of the
DPP government at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Several key bills, such as a U.S. arms procurement package bill
and a government budget bill, as well as a presidential nomination
list of Control Yuan members, have long been pending legislative
approval due to boycotts from the opposition "pan blue alliance"
lawmakers of the KMT and the People First Party, Chen said.</P>
      <P>If the KMT has faith in Taiwan, it should take part in an
economic conference on sustainable growth to be convened by the
Executive Yuan in June, he argued.</P>
      <P>The 15 measures offered by Beijing in bilateral trade and
economic exchanges are part of China's united front strategy aimed at
Taiwan under its "one China" precondition, he claimed, urging Taiwan
businessmen not to go overboard when facing Beijing's enticements.</P>
      <P>Lien and the more than 30 KMT lawmakers that traveled to China to
attend the Beijing forum should report on their trip to the public,
as the Taiwan people will never accept such a closed-door meeting
that would sell Taiwan out, said DPP legislative caucus members.</P>
      <P>Lien said Sunday in Beijing that the results obtained during the
KMT-CPC forum, the first of its kind in nearly 60 years, have been
"more handsome than expected."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien and his 170-member delegation of KMT lawmakers,
experts and business leaders are slated to return to Taipei April 25
from Shanghai. Meanwhile, Lien will travel to Fuzhou, Zhangzhou, and
Hangzhou for family visits and tourist purposes.</P>

      <P>The non-profit Modern Women's Foundation

for women who are victims of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>While calling on the public to care for these women, the

level of five years ago.</P>

domestic violence around the country who have not yet been listed in
the government's protection and aid program.</P>
      <P>Such women suffer more than just the physical pain of the abuse,
the MWF said, noting that the foundation's research has found that on
average, each domestic violence victim has to pay NT$500,000
(US$15,405) per year for medical treatment, lawsuits, work losses,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Around 100 underwater photographers taking
part in a competition titled "looking for fish stars in Kending"
failed to get shots of any fish longer than 50 cm because rampant
overfishing has decimated stocks.</P>
      <P>The event, held from April 8-16, was sponsored by Taiwanese Coral
Reef Society in conjunction with the coral spawning season in the
area around Hengchun in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Competitors were asked to record 10 kinds of fish that live at
the bottom of coral reefs, with a prize of NT$10,000 (US$307.7) for
the winner.</P>
      <P>However, despite the fact that the photographers made four dives
during the period, none of them managed to photograph any fish over
50 cm long.</P>
      <P>Only Taiwanese Coral Reef Society President Tsai Yung-chun, who
knows the area well, was able to use a videocamera to record a vague
photo of a grouper of more than 80 cm at a depth of 34 meters.</P>
      <P>Cheng Cheng-yi, president of an underwater photography society,
said he caught a glimpse of a small group of nearly 1-meter barracuda
for a fleeting moment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the coral reef spawning entered its second day Monday
with two kinds of coral releasing their eggs, Tsai said Monday.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the spawning will enter its peak period in the
next two days, during which visitors will be able to see spawning by
more than 20 out of the 300 species of coral found in the Kending

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) said Monday
that it will publish the names every month of media outlets that fail

      <P>The DOH cited statistics from the suicide prevention center as
indicating that as of April 17, the print media had published 114
attempted suicide stories, 74 of which were fatal. Three of the 114
stories were placed on the front pages, with the suicide notes and
photos of the deceased also displayed, it said.</P>
      <P>In a bid to prevent the media from fueling a "suicide copycat
tide, " such as a spate of suicides using charcoal to create deadly
carbon monoxide gas, the DOH called a news conference to call for the
media to exercise ethical responsibility.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Jui-yuan, director of DOH's Department of Medical Affairs,
took two mass-circulation papers -- China Times and Apple Daily -- to
task in their reporting of suicides Monday.</P>
      <P>The two newspapers not only published photos of the deceased,
they also oversimplified the reasons why the deceased took their own
lives, which he said were "inappropriate reports" over which he "felt

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office denied a claim by
a TV commentator Monday that Ma Yung-cheng, the office's deputy
secretary-general, has tendered his resignation to President Chen
Shui-bian because of his involvement in a series of scandals.</P>
      <P>David Lee, director-general of the Department of Public Affairs
at the Presidential Office, said the claim made by political analyst
Hu Chung-hsin about Ma's resignation was untrue.</P>
      <P>Hours after the Presidential Office issued the denial, Ma held a
press conference and denied all claims by Hu and Chiu Yi, a
legislator of the main opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Hu told a news conference earlier Monday that he received tips
from a reliable source in the Presidential Office that Ma had
tendered his resignation.</P>
      <P>Hu accused Ma of using his influence to help Lin Ming-cheng
become chairman of Hua Nan Financial Holdings Co. after Lin gave Ma
NT$2 million as a wedding gift in September 2002. Hu said it was
incredible that Lin, who owns less than 1 percent of the company's
shares, could become its chairman.</P>
      <P>At the same press conference, Chiu accused Ma of being involved
not only in the chairmanship battle of Hua Nan Financial Holdings,
but also in the ownership fight over Pacific SOGO Department Store
and a controversy over who should run China Development Financial
Holdings Corp., Waterland Financial Holdings Co. and Fuhwa Financial
Holdings Co.</P>
      <P>Chiu demanded that Ma explain to the nation whether he interfered
in Pacific SOGO's ownership fight on behalf of the president or the
first lady.</P>
      <P>Ma denied having offered to resign. He acknowledged that Lin had
attended his wedding but added Lin had not sent him a gift. He also
said he was not involved in the chairmanship battles of any financial
holding companies, nor was anyone else at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>On Pacific SOGO's ownership transfer, Ma said it was purely a
deal between businessmen and that the Presidential Office had nothing
to do with it.</P>
      <P>Former Finance Minister Lin Chuan, who accompanied Ma at the
press conference, backed Ma's claim and said the Presidential Office
had not given any instructions to the Finance Ministry on who should
be selected as the top executives of the partially state-owned
financial holding companies.</P>
      <P>Ma said he had already filed a lawsuit against Hu several days
ago, and that since Chiu had made similar allegations to defame him
at the press conference, he would file another slander suit against
Chiu.</P>
      <P>In the past few days, there has been mounting publicity over the
alleged involvement of the Presidential Office and the first lady in
Pacific SOGO's ownership battle.</P>
      <P>According to confidential depositions of witnesses leaked to a TV
program, contenders offering to buy the department store were told
that "the high level has already decided on who will have that
thing."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, news reports said the first lady has been busy
checking her shopping records in an attempt to prove she did not
receive any Pacific SOGO gift vouchers during the ownership battle
over the department store in 2002, and that the gift vouchers she
used for shopping there in early 2003 were purchased with funds
pooled by her and her friends.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER CALLS FOR REVISIONS TO FOREIGN SPOUSES' RESIDENCY RULES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmaker urged the government Monday to revise the current
immigration law to allow for foreign spouses with young children to
remain in Taiwan in the event of their being divorced or widowed.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Shu-shan made the call at a news conference
attended by a divorced Vietnamese woman and a widowed Cambodian
woman, both of whom are facing deportation.</P>
      <P>Under current immigration rules, Lin said foreign spouses who
arrive in Taiwan to reside with their Taiwanese mates are forced to
leave Taiwan once they divorce or upon the death of their partners,
as their resident permits are automatically invalidated.</P>
      <P>If they fail to leave within 15 days, Lin said, they may be
deported, forcing their children to travel to their mothers' home
countries and become "stateless, " or to live in Taiwan without the
care of their mothers.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics released by the Immigration Bureau, Lin said
there are currently 850 children of mixed marriages under the age of
12 in Vietnam and Indonesia having had their Taiwan household
registration revoked because they have not returned home for two
years. If young children of mixed marriages who have not yet been
abroad for two years are added up, Lin said the number may be between
3,000 and 4,000.</P>
      <P>Except for extraordinary circumstances, the U.N. Declaration of
the Rights of the Child prohibits the separation of young children
from their mothers, Lin said, adding that Taiwan's child welfare law
also stipulates that all public and private institutions must give
priority to the child's well-being while dealing with issues
involving children and adolescents.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan's current immigration rules are apparently in
violation of the basic humanistic concern for the well-being of young
children of mixed marriages.</P>
      <P>For her part, the divorced Vietnamese woman, surnamed Hoang, said
she faces a dilemma: if she leaves Taiwan without her young children,
nobody will be able to care for them; but if she takes them with her
to Vietnam, they will have difficulty obtaining Vietnamese
citizenship and receiving an education.</P>
      <P>The father-in-law of the widowed Cambodian woman said his
daughter-in-law will be deported because she has overstayed the
15-day limit following his son's death.</P>
      <P>"After her deportation, who will care for my two little
grandsons? Both my wife and I are old. The government should scrap
its inhumane immigration rules," said the man, surnamed Lai.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Lo Hou-hsiang, the National Police
Agency's alien affairs department chief, said the problems are partly
the result of foreign spouses' neglect in applying for an extension
15 days before the expiration of their residence permits. If they
fail to apply in time, they will overstay their visas, have to leave
Taiwan and apply for re-entry.</P>
      <P>Lo said the Ministry of the Interior is planning to extend the
grace period to 30 days from the current 15 days to benefit foreign
spouses of Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs consular official present at the
news conference said there is really a need for the government to
revise the immigration law to allow for foreign spouses to reside in
Taiwan with their children in case they are divorced or widowed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YILAN COUNTY'S INTERNATIONAL REGATTA MAY NOT BE HELD THIS YEAR</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual Yilan International Collegiate
Invitational Regatta involving men's and women's teams from renowned
world universities may not take place this year because of a shortage
of funds, the Yilan County government, the sponsor of the event, said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Yilan County Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua told reporters that it costs
more than NT$20 million to hold the annual boat race, and that in the
past, the country government only needed to put aside about NT$4
million each year, with the rest of the funds coming from the central
government.</P>
      <P>Lu said the county government had received only a symbolic pledge
of NT$1 million from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for this year's
event and nothing from the Ministry of Education or the Cabinet-level
National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.</P>
      <P>The county government, troubled by deteriorating financial
conditions in recent years, is unable to squeeze NT$20 million from
its budget to hold the boat race in September, he said, adding that
the event may have to be canceled this year.</P>
      <P>Yilan County's international regatta developed from a boat race
in 1995 between two well-known universities in Taiwan -- National
Taiwan University and National Taiwan Normal University.</P>
      <P>With the support of local residents, the county government
invited 10 teams from 10 universities in five countries to the race
in 1996, including Oxford and Cambridge from the United Kingdom and
Yale and Harvard from the United States.</P>
      <P>In 1999, the event was expanded by adding a competition in
the women's group. Last year, 25 teams from 12 countries participated

    <HEADLINE>CEC ENUMERATES LEGAL HURDLES TO PROPOSED 'TWO-IN-ONE' ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 17 (CNA)
(By Timothy Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) said
Monday it does not support a proposal to hold the next presidential
election and the legislative election simultaneously in early 2008
because there are legal hurdles to that goal.</P>
      <P>A simultaneous holding of the two elections will either require a
constitutional amendment to extend the current legislature's tenure
or electing a new president four months before the expiration of the
current presidential term, the commission said. </P>
      <P>The commission was responding to a media criticism that the CEC
has failed to actively promote the integration of the next
legislative and presidential elections. Under the current
regulations, the next legislative election must be held no later than
Jan. 21, 2008, and the next presidential election should be held
before April 19, 2008.</P>
      <P>If advancing the presidential election, the new president would
have to wait for four months before taking office May 20, 2008. No
major countries around the world have ever had such a long transition
period, the commission said. If the legislative election is
postponed until March -- the traditional month for the presidential
election, the commissioned said the present constitutional provisions
must be revised to extend the current legislature's term.</P>
      <P>Given all these legal hurdles, the commission said the
"two-in-one" election proposal advocated by opposition parties is not
feasible.</P>
      <P>As to the proposal to hold the next Taipei mayoral, city council
and borough chief elections simultaneously, the commission said it
has never voiced opposition to that suggestion.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the commission said it is only authorized to decide
the date for the Taipei mayoral and city councilor election, while
the date for Taipei borough chief elections must be determined by the
Taipei City Election Commission.</P>

Worry Rises After Iran Claims Nuclear Step

Iran President's assertion involving its

this week. The assertion involves Iran's claim
that even while it begins to enrich small
amounts of uranium, it is pursuing a far more

American officials and inspectors say could

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING REMAINS UNWAVERING ON 'ONE CHINA': ANALYSTS</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> 
By Flor Wang 
CNA Staff Writer
</P>
      <P>Taipei, April 17 (CNA) Although Chinese President Hu Jintao has
broached peaceful developments in cross-Taiwan Strait ties during a
recent meeting with Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang Honorary Chairman
Lien Chan, Hu is unlikely to soften his stance on Taiwan when meeting
with U.S. President George W. Bush Wednesday at the White House,
observers said Monday.</P>
      <P>Political analysts made the forecast on grounds that Hu's
firmness in upholding the disputed "1992 consensus" as the
cornerstone of building peaceful exchanges between Taiwan and China
was nothing more than an indication of Beijing's insistence on the
"one China" prerequisite in its dealings with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite Hu's acknowledgement that Taiwan and China are not
united, political analysts said Hu's insistence on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait fostering peaceful developmental links under the
so-called "one China" framework is a reflection of the Chinese
president's "iron will" toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing's stance has not wavered in this regard,
political watchers said that in the international arena, "one China"
automatically refers to the People's Republic of China, not Taiwan.
At the upcoming Hu-Bush meeting, for example, Beijing is unlikely to
accept the "one China, different interpretations" rhetoric -- the
focal point of the "1992 consensus" dispute between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, they pointed out, a favorable climate arising from a
two-day economic forum in Beijing between the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) last weekend
is expected to help boost Hu's profile in his meeting with Bush. They
added that it was worth watching to what extent the impact of the
KMT-CPC forum would have on the Hu-Bush meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, many analysts opined that a rally of more than 47
points Monday on the Taipei Stock Exchange could be viewed as a lift
fueled by bullish sentiment injected by the KMT-CPC forum, which put
forward 15 measures to boost cross-strait ties, ranging from tourism,
agriculture to health care following its closing Saturday.</P>
      <P>Therefore, observers said, the positive atmosphere from the
KMT-CPC forum should help Hu strengthen his standing in the upcoming
Hu-Bush meeting, which will serve as a stage for Hu to show Bush that
Beijing is a keen peacemaker in the Strait and that it has gained
support from Taiwan's largest opposition party.</P>
      <P>The alignment between the KMT and the CPC -- coupled with Hu's
visit to the United States -- are set to whip up strong pressure on
the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party government in
Taiwan, analysts pointed out, adding that the question of whether Hu
will bring the diplomatic battle of unification versus independence
to the United States and how Bush will react will be the focus of
attention. </P>
      <P>Lien, who led a KMT delegation to attend the event, met Hu Sunday
following the KMT-CPC forum. Lien expressed his satisfaction that
results of the event were "much more attractive" than expected.</P>
      <P>The Lien-Hu meeting was conducted in a cordial atmosphere and
with subtle interaction, which watchers said could be gauged from the
color of the two men's ties.</P>
      <P>Lien worn a red tie, the symbolic color of the CPC, while Hu wore
a blue one, the color representing the KMT, which lost power to the
independence-leaning DPP in 2000 after having ruled Taiwan for more
than 50 years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will absolutely not accept
China's "designation" of Taiwan-based travel agencies eligible to
receive Chinese tour groups, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu was commenting on China's newly unveiled management rules on
Chinese people's sightseeing trips to Taiwan. One of the provisions
prescribes that a list of Taiwan-based travel agencies to be allowed
to receive Chinese tourists will be announced after the
"confirmation" of China's National Tourism Administration.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government is trying to ascertain through proper
channels the exacting meaning of "confirmation" in Article 4 of
Beijing's Taiwan travel management regulations unveiled Sunday.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan-based travel agencies have to obtain China's prior
approval or designation to receive Chinese tourists, neither our
government nor our travel operators would accept such an insulting
demand which infringes upon our government's authority," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the government is entitled to decide on its own
which local travel agencies are qualified to receive Chinese tour
groups, Wu said the government will be willing to inform China of the
officially sanctioned list after it comes to a decision.
Nevertheless, he said, China is in no position to interfere with the
selection or screening process.</P>

with U.S. President George W. Bush Wednesday at the White House,
observers said Monday.</P>
      <P>Political analysts made the forecast on grounds that Hu's
firmness in upholding the disputed "1992 consensus" as the
cornerstone of building peaceful exchanges between Taiwan and China
was nothing more than an indication of Beijing's insistence on the
"one China" prerequisite in its dealings with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite Hu's acknowledgement that Taiwan and China are not
united, political analysts said Hu's insistence on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait fostering peaceful developmental links under the
so-called "one China" framework is a reflection of the Chinese
president's "iron will" toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing's stance has not wavered in this regard,
political watchers said that in the international arena, "one China"
automatically refers to the People's Republic of China, not Taiwan.
At the upcoming Hu-Bush meeting, for example, Beijing is unlikely to
accept the "one China, different interpretations" rhetoric -- the
focal point of the "1992 consensus" dispute between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, they pointed out, a favorable climate arising from a
two-day economic forum in Beijing between the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) last weekend
is expected to help boost Hu's profile in his meeting with Bush. They
added that it was worth watching to what extent the impact of the
KMT-CPC forum would have on the Hu-Bush meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, many analysts opined that a rally of more than 47
points Monday on the Taipei Stock Exchange could be viewed as a lift
fueled by bullish sentiment injected by the KMT-CPC forum, which put
forward 15 measures to boost cross-strait ties, ranging from tourism,
agriculture to health care following its closing Saturday.</P>
      <P>Therefore, observers said, the positive atmosphere from the
KMT-CPC forum should help Hu strengthen his standing in the upcoming
Hu-Bush meeting, which will serve as a stage for Hu to show Bush that
Beijing is a keen peacemaker in the Strait and that it has gained
support from Taiwan's largest opposition party.</P>
      <P>The alignment between the KMT and the CPC -- coupled with Hu's
visit to the United States -- are set to whip up strong pressure on
the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party government in
Taiwan, analysts pointed out, adding that the question of whether Hu
will bring the diplomatic battle of unification versus independence
to the United States and how Bush will react will be the focus of
attention. </P>
      <P>Lien, who led a KMT delegation to attend the event, met Hu Sunday
following the KMT-CPC forum. Lien expressed his satisfaction that
results of the event were "much more attractive" than expected.</P>
      <P>The Lien-Hu meeting was conducted in a cordial atmosphere and
with subtle interaction, which watchers said could be gauged from the
color of the two men's ties.</P>
      <P>Lien worn a red tie, the symbolic color of the CPC, while Hu wore
a blue one, the color representing the KMT, which lost power to the
independence-leaning DPP in 2000 after having ruled Taiwan for more
than 50 years.</P>

      <P>Fourteen U.S. senators jointly sent a
letter to World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Lee
Jong-wook last week to express their support for Taiwan's bid to join
the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer.</P>
      <P>The letter dated April 12 was jointly signed by Richard Lugar
(R-Ind.) , chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations;
George Allen (R-Va.) and Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) , co-chairmen of the
Senate Taiwan Caucus, a pro-Taiwan group in the Senate, as well as
other senators.</P>
      <P>The senators urged Lee to help Taiwan gain observer status at
this year's WHA gathering, slated to be held May 22-27 in Geneva. The
WHA is the highest decision-making body of the WHO -- the world's
leading organization in public health.</P>
      <P>In the letter, the senators said that Taiwan, with a population
of 23 million people, needs to be part of the world's joint efforts
in the control and prevention of avian flu outbreaks and part of the
global security network for public health.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has sought to join the WHA as an observer since 1997.

Families displaced by Hurricane Katrina are

prescription medication and health insurance at 
rates that are much higher than average, a new 
study has found. The study, conducted by the
Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia

the first to examine the health issues of those
living in housing provided by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. Based on
face-to-face interviews with more than 650
families living in trailers or hotels, it
provides a grim portrait of the hurricane's
effects on some of the poorest victims, showing
gaps in the tattered safety net pieced together
from government and private efforts.

Wall Street Journal: Oil Settles Above $70 a
Barrel, Despite Inventories at 8-Year High

Crude oil closed above US$70 a barrel for
the first time, highlighting a phenomenon
reshaping the petroleum world: Investment flows
into oil futures are supplanting nitty-gritty
supply-and-demand data as prime drivers of
prices. Oil at us $70 a barrel, if

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that
the launching of cross-Taiwan Strait chartered flights during the
upcoming Dragon Boat Festival is possible so long as negotiations
between the two sides on the issue are successful.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Taipei Airlines Association (TAA) has been
conducting talks with Chinese authorities under the commission of the
government on the opening of cross-strait charter flight services on
weekends and certain holidays, Su said that "if the talks bear fruit,
there will be provisional chartered flights during the Dragon Boat
Festival."</P>
      <P>The Dragon Boat Festival on the Lunar May 5 which falls on May 31
this year is one of the three most important holidays in Taiwan. The
other two are the Spring Festival, or Chinese New Year, and the
Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>While answering lawmakers' questions during an interpellation
session at the Legislative Yuan, Su reiterated that the government
has been open-minded toward the issue.</P>
      <P>At the same session, Transportation and Communications Minister
Kuo Yao-chi echoed the premier's remarks, saying that in principle,
it is possible for the two sides to operate chartered flights on
weekends and holidays.</P>
      <P>However, the government has been hoping the planned service could
be linked with tourism to "generate the greatest benefits, " Kuo
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu denied at

in California that the satellite is a milestone in Taiwan's space

      <P>Shieh noted that so far, Taiwan has completed three satellite
projects, 1999's FORMOSAT-1, 2004's FORMOSAT-2, and the
just-launched FORMOSAT-3.FORMOSAT-1 allows Taiwan to do ionospheric 
research, while FORMOSAT-2 enables Taiwan to do remote sensing and

research, he said.</P>
      <P>Shieh emphasized that FORMOSAT-3 is capable of collecting
enormous amounts of weather data and that through the sharing of this
vital data with other international partners, Taiwan can cooperate
more closely with other countries as well as promote Taiwan's
international profile.</P>
      <P>He further said that FORMOSAT-3, which incorporates 14 components
from five Taiwan-based manufacturers, also means much to local

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
will keep a close watch over developments regarding an upcoming
meeting between U.S. President George W. Bush and Chinese President
Hu Jintao, a MOFA official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>For this purpose, an inter-ministerial emergency response task
force headed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang
officially started operations Tuesday, according to MOFA spokesman
Michel Lu during a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan maintains regular communication with the United
States on major bilateral issues but he would not disclose the
details of the communication.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that issues likely to be addressed by the two leaders
during their April 20 meeting at the White House include
U.S.-China trade and China's democratization.</P>
      <P>He said the government will watch if the Taiwan issue is raised
for discussion and what Washington's and Beijing's stands are toward
the issue.</P>
      <P>Also Tuesday, Mainland Affairs Council Minister Joseph Wu said
the government is concerned about the Bush-Hu meeting although there
has been "intelligence" indicating the two leaders will not issue any
joint statements after the meeting and that Bush will not make any
remarks critical of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu urged the U.S. government to heed the voice of Taiwan's people
and to treat democratic Taiwan fairly.</P>
      <P>While the United States has made freedom and democracy the
central values of its diplomatic policy, it will make people around
the world doubt the consistency of U.S. policy if Bush makes remarks
that are harmful to a democratic country or critical of a popularly
elected leader, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks during a news conference hosted by the
Peacetime Foundation of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu pointed out that resuming cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue is
expected by Taiwan's people and is also the government's goal, but
that goal is difficult to achieve because China has set the "one
China" principle as its precondition for restoring talks with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, the government is seeking to restart
cross-strait talks on economic issues to try to transform
cross-strait conflict into cooperation.</P>
      <P>Wu called on Beijing to pay close attention to the voice of
Taiwan's people, whom he said are expecting China to remove its
deployment of missiles targeting Taiwan and renounce the use of
force.</P>
      <P>Predicting that it will be increasingly difficult for Chinese
leaders to suppress the strong call for freedom and democracy within
Chinese society, Wu said the government is concerned Beijing might
make Taiwan its "scapegoat" in an attempt to divert internal
pressure.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan's peaceful transition from authoritarianism to
democracy can be a reference point for China in transitioning to a
democracy.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan should fight for international support because a
democratic Taiwan deserves more recognition and backing from the
international community, he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's sovereignty must be factored in
when the government makes a decision on whether to recognize
educational degrees issued by China, Premier Su Tseng-chang said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Replying to opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Hsieh
Kuo-liang's questions, Su said that recognizing Chinese degrees is
not just an educational issue.</P>
      <P>"It involves Taiwan's education industry as a whole and the job
market. The interest of Taiwan's students must not be sacrificed.
Therefore, the government must thoroughly consider the issue before
making a decision," he said.</P>
      <P>In answer to questions from Liu Sheng-liang, another KMT
lawmaker, Su said "we will never accept" Chinese President Hu
Jintao's "one China" principle if it does not allow for Taiwan's
interpretation but only means "the People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>The KMT interprets "one China" as the Republic of China, an
interpretation that Su's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will not
accept until China says it does. Even if China says so, President
Chen Shui-bian has only promised that he will "absolutely respect"
"one China, respective interpretations."</P>
      <P>Liu asked Su if the government was opposing the KMT-Communist
Party of China forum just concluded in Beijing because it feared the
credit for promoting cross-strait trade and economic exchanges would
be taken by the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Su said, "it is not so, " adding that the forum was conducted
between political parties whose conclusions involve public authority
and will require "government-to-government talks" before they can be

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of a civic group urged Tuesday
that the true voice of the people be taken fully into account in
future cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chien Hsi-chieh, executive director of the Peacetime Foundation
of Taiwan, made the remarks during a presentation of a documentary
recording a discussion on cross-strait relations by 60 participants
with different years of age, educational backgrounds and
political viewpoints at a three-day workshop last month.</P>
      <P>Chien, a former legislator, said the foundation was pleased
with China's goodwill overture at the conclusion of an economic and
trade forum between main opposition Kuomintang and the Communist
Party of China in Beijing last weekend.</P>
      <P>"Any efforts made to promote cross-strait relations should be
respected," Chien said.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait exchanges should return to rational debates,
replacing past ideological vilification, and listen to the true
voice of the people," he continued.</P>
      <P>This is why the foundation has created the workshop, an
independent program funded by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, albeit without any interference, Chien said.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials noted that the tone regarding
mainstream discourse on cross-strait relations has been set by the
government over the past years, with voices from the private sector
rarely receiving any attention.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's people haven't felt so strongly about disputes on the
issue of independence versus unification," the officials said.</P>
      <P>They urged the government to seek domestic consensus on
cross-strait issues based on the basic needs and values of Taiwan's
people, and to try to seek common ground on which Chinese government
and private sectors can also agree. </P>
      <P>All of the workshop's 60 participants exchanged views on
cross-strait peace and tried to find common ground despite wide
differences, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Other wishes expressed by participants include a deepening of
democracy in Taiwan, resumption of a stalled cross-strait
negotiations, the international community helping Taiwan join
governmental and non-governmental organizations, and China's removal
of its 800 missiles targeting Taiwan and its renouncement of the use
of force against Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS TO LAUNCH EARTH DAY BATTERY RECYCLING CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic environmental groups will launch
an Earth Day campaign April 22 around the island to invite the public
to recycle used batteries and ink cartridges for computer printers.</P>
      <P>In response to the main theme of this year's Earth Day --
"Climate Change Solutions Campaign, " the Society of Wilderness will
launch the recycling program April 22 in nine cities and counties
around the country, including Taipei City, Taipei County, Taoyuan
County, Hsinchu County, Taichung County, Chiayi County, Tainan
County, Yilan County and Hualien County.</P>
      <P>Chang Hung-lin, secretary-general of the Society of Wilderness,
said they will promote 10 ways people can do something for the sake
of environmental protection, such as carrying their own chopsticks
while dining at restaurants, paying attention to pro-environment
news, and paying heed to candidates' environmental policies during
elections so the public can enjoy a healthy and more eco-friendly
life.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Yung-jen, director of Taipei City Government's
Environmental Protection Bureau, noted that less than 20 percent of
Taiwan's used batteries are recycled.</P>
      <P>Chen cautioned the public not to underestimate the impact on the
environment when they throw out a little battery.</P>
      <P>A series of activities held that day at Sungshan Tobacco Factory
in Taipei will allow the public to learn about a more eco-friendly
life, including a demonstration on how to recycle paper and a test
ride on electric bicycles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WASHINGTON URGED TO ASK BEIJING TO REDUCE CROSS-STRAIT TENSIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior U.S. senator urged President
George W. Bush Monday to seize the opportunity of his forthcoming
meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao to press Beijing to take
action to reduce tensions with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It is imperative that you impress upon President Hu the
importance of diffusing tensions and enhancing stability in the
Taiwan Strait by avoiding further provocations with Taiwan, and
committing to a peaceful resolution on the question of Taiwan's
status, " Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev) said in a letter
addressed to President Bush.</P>
      <P>Also, Reid said, it is essential that Hu's visit produce "real
and lasting" progress on ending the nuclear weapons ambitions of Iran
and North Korea, in light of the fact that China is opposed to the
U.N. Security Council action against Iran and that the Bush
administration's decision to rely on China to exert influence over
North Korea's nuclear weapons ambitions through six-party talks has
failed to yield satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>Reid further criticized the Bush administration as having "badly
mishandled" its protection of U.S. economic and trade interests,
saying the administration has not taken any real action to address
issues such as China's unfair manipulation of its currency, its
rampant intellectual property piracy and its lack of compliance with
its WTO obligations.</P>
      <P>"You must use this visit to make clear to President Hu that your
administration will no longer accept 'get tough' rhetoric and
occasional press release progress instead of strict compliance by
China with global rules," Reid said.</P>
      <P>Also Monday, a group of 12 members of the House of
Representatives sent a joint letter to President Bush urging him to
use the April 20 meeting with Hu to request that China remove its
missiles targeting Taiwan and open dialogue with the duly elected
government of Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of state-owned enterprise
Taiwan Sugar Corp (TSC) , Yu Cheng-hsien, said Tuesday that seven
divisions of the corporation will be privatized in 2007, except the
Sugar Business Division and company assets.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks during an inspection tour of the construction

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT OPEN TO CHINESE TOURISTS COMING TO TAIWAN: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has been consistent in
welcoming Chinese people to Taiwan for sight-seeing purposes, and "it
is China, not Taiwan," that has stood in the way, Premier Su Tseng-
chang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks while answering questions from ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker Lee Chen-nan, who asked
the government to work out complementary measures before opening
Taiwan to Chinese tourists, and released the results of an Internet
survey indicating that 33 percent of Taiwan's people hope that the
government will do so out of concern over national security, public
health and the spread of contagious diseases.</P>
      <P>The government welcomes tourists from around the world to Taiwan,
including those from China, but Beijing has yet to include Taiwan on
its list of approved outbound travel destinations, Su said, adding
that the government is poised to hold negotiations with China to
settle some relevant issues.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Japan-based Senkei Shimbun cited Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) Minister Joseph Wu in its Tuesday edition as saying
that the Taiwan government is set to commission a private sector
group to hold bilateral talks on cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight
services with Chinese authorities, modeled after the Lunar new year
holiday charter flight services earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Speaking to Japanese media Monday in Taipei, Wu said that Taiwan
welcomed the beneficial overtures offered by Beijing following a
two-day economic forum held by the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist
Party of China (CPC) in Beijing last weekend, including allowing
Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu did not specify when such two-way talks would begin but
expressed optimism about the issue.</P>
      <P>But Wu criticized Beijing's "one China" framework in its dealings
with Taiwan and said that he was pessimistic that progress would be
made to solve the political differences between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Wu reiterated the Democratic Progressive Party government's basic
stance on cross-strait relations, saying that Taiwan will not rule
out the possibility of holding negotiations with China on any topic
as long as they are based on reciprocity and equality.</P>
      <P>Wu lashed out at the KMT-CPC forum, claiming the KMT's approach
to the CPC has created chaos at home and confusion abroad, and he
argued that Beijing should talk to the DPP government instead of an
opposition party.</P>
      <P>The MAC chief also expressed displeasure when blaming KMT
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan for failing to stand up on behalf of the
Republic of China during his Sunday meeting with Chinese President Hu
Jintao, pointing out that Lien did not even dare mention the nation's
official title when Hu talked about the disputed "1992 consensus"
without displaying agreement on the attached "respective
interpretations of 'one China'" statement.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office Tuesday dismissed
as "unfactual" recent allegations by a former legislator that first
lady Wu Shu-jen is a woman who attaches great importance to money.</P>
      <P>In a statement, the Presidential Office said the accusations have
defamed the public image of the wheelchair-bound Wu and are extremely
unfair to the physically challenged.</P>
      <P>During a TV talk show Monday, former Legislator Ju Gau-jeng said
Wu pays great attention to money because, he said, money is the best
protection for a handicapped person.</P>
      <P>Ju also claimed that President Chen Shui-bian's political career
is determined by Wu's attitude and he insinuated that Wu is from a
snobbish family, claiming that Chen's father would not visit his
in-laws again after visiting them once.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office stressed that none of these accusations
are grounded in fact.</P>
      <P>Especially regarding Wu's attitude toward money, the Presidential
Office pointed out that before entering politics, Chen was formerly a
lawyer who earned a high salary, and that it was Wu who encouraged
Chen to contribute toward Taiwan's democracy and supported Chen's
decision to provide pro bono work for victims of the 1979 Kaohsiung
Incident.</P>
      <P>"This shows the first lady is a person of principle, rather than
one who pays attention to money," the Presidential Office said.</P>
      <P>Ju's accusations have come in the wake of allegations by
opposition Kuomintang Legislator Lee Chuan-chiao more than one week
ago that Wu received NT$8.8 million in gift vouchers from Pacific
Sogo Department Store.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors at Taipei District Court
questioned a former senior aide to President Chen Shui-bian Tuesday
over his roles in two scandals that continue to rock the Chen
administration.</P>
      <P>Chen Che-nan, a former Presidential Office deputy
secretary-general who is in detention on suspicion of defrauding
Liang Po-hsun, a bankrupt construction businessman, was questioned on
his role in buying and selling stocks while he was serving at the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>He was also questioned for suspected involvement in taking
political "contributions" from former Tuntex Group's Chen You-hao, a
wanted economic criminal who accused Chen Che-nan of taking NT$10
million (US$308,000) in cash from him Sept. 5, 2000 at a hospitality
center run by Liu Tai-ying, a confidant of former President Lee
Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Tuntex political donations became a top story that was widely
reported during the 2004 presidential election, but the prosecution
closed the case because the chief suspect, Chen You-hao, fled the
country.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors are now re-investigating the Tuntex case -- because
Chen Che-nan was found to have been involved in quite a number of
other corruption scandals, including an ownership fight over Pacific
Sogo Department Store -- in the hope of getting new evidence on the
political donations controversy.</P>
      <P>Another focus of the prosecution investigation Tuesday was bank
accounts and the flow of funds suspected to have been used when Chen
Che-nan directed stock transactions at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>While probing the allegations, the prosecution discovered that a
large part of the political donations that Chen Che-nan had received
flowed into the accounts of Liu Hsing-yi, Yang Chen-feng's girl
friend, which were used by Yang to invest in the stock market.</P>
      <P>Yang stands accused of perjury in the Liang case. Investigators
suspect that Yang had been laundering money for Chen Che-nan.</P>

      <P>A U.S. senior official Monday again
urged China to engage in dialogue with the elected government of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The official was responding to a query on whether the meeting in
Beijing Sunday between Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the main
opposition Kuomintang, and Chinese President Hu Jintao, would be a
new factor in U.S.-China relations and whether the U.S. welcomed this
type of dialogue.</P>

authorities in Beijing and authorities -- all authorities in Taipei,"
the official said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has frequently said to the Beijing authorities -- and
will say it again -- that it is important for the central government
in Beijing to "engage directly with the elected government in Taiwan,"
the official said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. stance with the Chinese government has been that
"dialogue is good, but dialogue with the elected government in Taipei

    <HEADLINE>HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY TO OPEN IN OCTOBER: TRANSPORTATION MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April   18  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and
Communications Kuo Yao-chi gave her assurance Tuesday that the
high-speed railway undergoing test runs will open -- at least between
the southern port city of Kaohsiung and Panchiao City in Taipei
County -- by the end of October, or she will resign to take
responsibility.</P>
      <P>Kuo gave the assurance while answering questions from a
legislator of the main opposition Kuomintang during an interpellation
session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>She said the Taiwan High-Speech Rail Corp. (THSRC) has been
conducting test runs recently, with results up to April 17 showing
that the train can run smoothly between Kaohsiung and Taoyuan in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kuo acknowledged that while the target is for THSRC to open the
entire railway line by the end of October, there is no guarantee that
a "bottleneck" problem relating to the section between Taipei and
Panchiao can be sorted out in time.</P>
      <P>Kuo reiterated her promise made previously at the legislature
that if the high-speed railway again fails to open as scheduled -- it
is already running years behind schedule -- she will step down.</P>
      <P>Observers noted that while it might seem unusual for a Cabinet
minister to risk her political future to guarantee the smooth
operation of a transportation project undertaken by a private
company, the Democratic Progressive Party government has been under
fire for providing NT$308.3 billion (US$9.5 billion) in government
loans to THSRC without oversight, against the NT$130 billion capital
invested by the company's five shareholders.</P>
      <P>THSRC Chairwoman Nita Ing has twice disappointed the nation by
delaying the scheduled launch of the high-speech train service --
from June 2003 to October 2005 and again to October this year.</P>
      <P>The construction of the 345-km railway linking Taipei and
Kaohsiung -- Taiwan's two largest cities -- is about 96 percent
complete.</P>
      <P>THSRC has ordered 30 sets of the 700T trains from Japan, with
each set consisting of 12 carriages that can seat 986 passenger.
Running at 200 kph, the train could potentially reduce the time for
the journey between Taipei and Kaohsiung to 90 minutes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang expressed his
support Tuesday for a "standardized" model for direct charter flights
across the Taiwan Strait, saying that the government has been talking
with China on the issue.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks while answering questions from opposition
People First Party lawmaker Feng Ting-kuo, who urged the government
to work out a set of standardized mechanisms to operate direct
charter flight services between Taiwan and China in the future,
including on weekends and holidays.</P>
      <P>Giving his assurances that the government has been working with
the Chinese side toward that end, Su said a decision will be made
pending bilateral negotiations and that the government will do its
best to handle relevant issues.</P>
      <P>The premier also promised that the government will not impose
unnecessary limits on arriving Chinese tourists, adding that the
government stands firm and clear on fully opening up to Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>Tainan Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair, who is a DPP member, said later the
same day that setting up direct air and shipping links between Taiwan
and China is an inevitable trend fueled by strong market demand,
and he added that it should benefit the Taiwan economy over the long
term as it will help reduce production costs for Taiwan companies.</P>
      <P>But Hsu voiced concern over the impact of such flights on
Taiwan's national security in the near term and called on the
government to hammer
out complementary measures before opening direct
transport links across the strait. "The economy should not be
compromised by politics or vice versa," he said.
</P>
      <P>Although Beijing has made many overtures to Taiwan following an
economic forum in Beijing between the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) April 14-15, Hsu warned
that they are politically motivated cover-ups designed to hoodwink
the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>History will prove that the April 16 meeting between KMT honorary
Chairman Lien Chan and Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing was
only a show in Hu's interest, he claimed, reiterating that Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>AD HOC GROUP FORMED TO PREVENT MANIPULATION OF COMMODITY PRICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An ad hoc group was formed Tuesday by the
Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission (FTC) to prevent manipulation of
commodity prices, according to an FTC official.</P>
      <P>According to the official, prices of several commodities in the
domestic market moved up recently, in anticipation of rises in fuel
prices expected to be announced soon by the state-owned Chinese
Petroleum Corp. (CPC).</P>
      <P>The official said the ad hoc group will keep a close eye on the
prices of several commodities in the initial stage, such as oil,
sugar, wheat, soybeans, electricity, gas, transport fees,
agricultural and livestock products, to see if there is anyone
involved in the monopolization or manipulation of the prices.</P>
      <P>The FTC will offer information related to commodities and the
market situation to the media in order to clear up any doubts among
the public concerning commodity prices, the official added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the FTC respects the price fluctuations in a free
market mechanism, the official stressed, however, that anyone
involved in manipulation of commodity prices will face fines of
between NT$50,000 (US$1,543) and NT$25 million, as stipulated by the
Fair Trade Law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS CLOSE TO FORMER PREMIER LEAVE FOR UNITED STATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several ruling Democratic Progressive
Party legislators close to former Premier Frank Hsieh left for the
United States Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The legislators, including Hsu Kuo-yung, Hsieh Hsin-ni and Lee
Chun-yi, said they will attend a speech Hsieh is to deliver at
Harvard University Wednesday.</P>
      <P>They said that Hsieh, currently on a short-term study program at
a school affiliated to the prestigious university, is concerned about
the nation's future and will give his views in his speech.</P>
      <P>Hsu said they will also convey to Hsieh the latest political
situation and developments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He denied that they will try to persuade Hsieh to run in the
year-end Taipei mayoral election, describing that as nothing more
than media speculation.</P>
      <P>Amid strong calls within the party to draft Hsieh for the Taipei
mayoral post, Hsu said he will convey the party's view to Hsieh but
that Hsieh had no intention to run for the post before he went to the
U.S. about two months ago.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsieh Hsin-ni said Hsieh advocated reconciliation
and symbiosis when he served as premier, but she said that
various factions within the DPP have been unable to reconcile.</P>
      <P>Faced with the crucial battles in the year-end Taipei and
Kaohsiung mayoral elections, the legislative elections in 2007 and
the presidential election in 2008, she said that reconciliation
within the party is crucial.</P>
      <P>She said that whether Hsieh will run in the year-end mayoral
election will depend on the party mechanism. The delegation is
expected to return to Taiwan April 22, while Hsieh will return April
29.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Hsieh has a "brilliant"
political record and qualifications, but whether he will run for the
top post of the capital city will depend on his wishes and the
nomination mechanism of the party.</P>
      <P>It is just media speculation that drafting Hsieh to run would
remove a hurdle for Su should he decide to run in the presidential
election in 2008, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BANKS SHOULD NOT LEND TO THSRC WITHOUT COLLATERAL: LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lawmaker urged the government Tuesday to see to it that
Taiwan's banks make no more loans to the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.
(THSRC) if its five private investors do not put their own assets up
as security for the loans.</P>
      <P>Chang Hua-kuan told Premier Su Tseng-chang at the legislature
that her voters in Chiayi County are not optimistic about the high
speed rail service being launched at the end of October, as Transport
Minister Kuo Yao-chi has guaranteed, vowing to step down if the
launch does not go ahead on schedule.</P>
      <P>THSRC has lied to the people by failing to fulfill its promise to
launch the service last October, it has been arrogant to the
government, but very luxurious to itself, Chang claimed.</P>
      <P>The THSRC is asking the government to help secure yet another
loan, this time of NT$65.5 billion, to make up for its financial
shortfall, and banks should not loan the money if its own five
initial investing conglomerates do not offer their own assets as
collateral, Chang said.</P>
      <P>In March, Su promised lawmakers that the government will not act
as a guarantor in THSRC's bid to secure that loan. In the event that
THSRC cannot launch services on schedule because it failed to get the
loan, the government has prepared "a set of measures" to handle it,
Su added.</P>
      <P>Chang accused the THSRC of violating the principle of build,
operate, transfer (BOT) and of trying to "sap Taiwan's financial
strength" without giving it anything in return.</P>
      <P>She expressed concern that if the high speed rail service cannot
be launched at the end of October, the DPP will be devastated and
there will simply be no chance for it to compete with other parties
in the year-end mayoral elections of Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>THSRC's five "original investors" are Continental Engineering
Corp., Pacific Electric Wire and Cable Co., Evergreen Group, TECO
Group and Fubon Financial, who together own 28 percent of THSRC's
shares.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC OFFICIAL: RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN STABLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Diplomatic relations between Dominican
Republic and Taiwan remain stable, although the Caribbean country
does intend to boost its economic ties with China, a Dominican
Republic official said Tuesday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"President Leonel Fernandez said that the relationship between
Taiwan and Dominican Republic is beyond the diplomatic level. It's up
to an ethical level, " said Jose Luis Corripio Estrada, an economic
adviser to Fernandez and the president of Grupo Corripio, one of the
biggest corporations in Dominican Republic.</P>
      <P>The Associated Press reported two weeks ago that Dominican
Republic Foreign Minister Carlos Morales Troncoso said in a TV
interview April 6 that his country would consider establishing
official diplomatic relations with China if it serves the country's
interests.</P>
      <P>A Spanish proverb says that when one faces a crossroads, taking
both routes the best way, Corripio said, adding however that "the
proverb is not suitable for describing the relations between
Dominican Republic, Taiwan and China."</P>
      <P>Dominican Republic is determined to maintain official relations
with Taiwan and this can easily be seen, he said.</P>
      <P>"First of all, President Fernandez is visiting Taiwan in June and
will meet high-ranking officials here. He would not come such a long
way to cut the ties between two countries. Also, Dominican Republic
and Taiwan are about to launch a massive cooperation plan that has
been worked on for many years. Why would we give it up for the sake
of establishing relations with China? " he asked.</P>
      <P>Speaking on China, Corripio said his country has been trading
with China for decades, including the years during which the
U.S. imposed an embargo on China. With China's rapid economic
development, it's only natural for Dominican Republic to increase
trade with China.</P>
      <P>Dominican Republic is looking to maintain relations with Taiwan,
Corripio said. But "a good relationship takes more than government
administration. It takes more cooperation from the private sector to
form a more solid bond between us, " he added as an encouragement for
more Taiwanese businessmen to invest in Dominican Republic through
joint ventures.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A foreign couple who have visited for
three days to get a feel about the longstay program offered by Puli
township in Nantou County, said Tuesday they are very satisfied with
life in the central Taiwan town.</P>
      <P>The Japanese-American couple, who happen to have the same family
name -- Nagamura -- as another Japanese couple who left Puli in
disgust, said their first impression of Puli is "very good." They
went as far as praising the town for having "the best living
environment and quality of life in the world."</P>
      <P>Mrs. Nagamura's is Taiwanese. The couple moved back to Taiwan to
experience the longstay program after learning about the earlier
Japanese couple's bad experience of dog feces on the streets and
chaotic traffic, among a host of other complaints.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Nagamura said her husband likes Puli very much and that they
both feel prices for daily necessities and services are quite low.</P>
      <P>"We intend to stay just 10 days this time. When more Japanese
come and stay, we will consider joining them," she said.</P>
      <P>She said it was "rude" for the former Nagamuras to spread a
message on the Internet warning people not to come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Like Puli or not, it's a personal decision. They should not have
warned other Japanese not to come," she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION'S PRIORITY: APPROVE RIGHT PERSON AS TOP PROSECUTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) regards the
selection of a qualified person to fill the nation's top
prosecutorial post as an issue that should take precedence over all
other issues, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang told reporters that when he meets with KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and PFP Chairman James Soong later this week -- probably on
April 20 -- their discussions will center on potential hopefuls
President Chen Shui-bian might nominate for the post of state public
prosecutor-general.</P>
      <P>The top prosecutorial post has been left vacant after former
State Public Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao resigned Dec. 27 last
year to take responsibility for failing to stamp out bribery during
the Dec. 3 local government elections.</P>
      <P>Wang acknowledged that the KMT and the PFP believe that filling
the post with the right person is more important than other issues,
such as completing legislation for the military procurement plan and
approving the president's list of nominees as members of the Control
Yuan -- the nation's highest watchdog body.</P>
      <P>A week ago, the opposition-controlled legislature rejected the
president's nomination of Hsieh Wen-ting, prosecutor-general of the
Taiwan High Court, to be the next state public prosecutor-general.</P>
      <P>According to a newly enacted law, the president must submit the
name of another nominee to the legislature for approval within a
month, or before May 11.</P>
      <P>If approved, the new state public prosecutor-general will serve a
single four-year term only -- a measure designed to rid the
prosecutorial system of political interference from the executive
branch of the government.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet announced Tuesday that
effective immediately, customs duties for imported gasoline will be
lowered from 10 percent to 5 percent.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance indicated that the new measure will not
affect the government's tax revenue to any large measure. Official
statistics show that tax revenues from gasoline tariffs totaled only
NT$370,000 last year, with the total imports worth NT$3.71 million.</P>
      <P>Finance officials estimate that a 5 percent reduction in gasoline
tariffs will only cut the revenue by less than NT$200,000. They said
it is likely that the revenue might even rise as a result of
increased gasoline imports under the new tariff.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development said the
gasoline tariff has been lowered in an attempt to stabilize prices
and encourage the private sector to import more gasoline so that the
market will see more competitive prices.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan's gasoline comes mainly from the refineries of

    <HEADLINE>BUSH WON'T SHY AWAY FROM RAISING QUESTION OF CHINESE MILITARY BUILDUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 18 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush will not
shy away from raising the question of China's military buildup across
the Taiwan Strait when he meets with Chinese President Hu Jintao
April 20, a senior U.S. official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks during a press briefing on Hu's
visit to the U.S. April 18-22.</P>
      <P>The Chinese military buildup is of concern to the United States,
the official said, noting that Beijing claims that its desire is for
peaceful settlement of the cross-strait dispute, but "there is no
doubt that since 1995 there has been a large increase in military
capabilities opposite Taiwan," the official said.</P>
      <P>He noted that while Taiwan's military spending has been rather
"flat" in recent years, Beijing has continued to increase its defense
spending at double-digit rates.</P>
      <P>"So this is an issue that we have to raise with the Chinese
president, that he needs to know it is of concern to us, " the
official said.</P>
      <P>Beijing has often urged Washington to end its military assistance
to Taiwan, but "there is no possible way we can end our military
assistance to Taiwan under these circumstances," the official said.</P>
      <P>"We have the Taiwan Relations Act. We will help Taiwan defend
itself. This is part of our policy, and we enunciate that to the
Chinese," he said.</P>
      <P>The official stressed that the U.S. is not sure whether it will
obtain any breakthroughs during Hu's visit, "but we don't shy away
from the issue."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Around 50 percent of fresh graduates in
Taiwan think jobs are harder to find than expected this year, and a
similar percentage of the graduates are considering joining
professions that are different from their fields of training,
according to the results of a recent survey.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Career magazine April 7-12 on
2,371 students who are set to graduate this summer.</P>
      <P>While 60 percent of senior high school graduates think that jobs
are harder to find than expected, 40 percent of master's graduates
share this view.</P>
      <P>Fifty percent of the respondents expect their starting salaries
to range between NT$24,000 and NT$30,000, with those having a
master's degree expecting NT$36,000 on average, those having a
bachelor's degree expecting no more than NT$30,000, and those having
a technical college diploma expecting no more than NT$28,000.</P>
      <P>The magazine said that the starting salaries expected by the
fresh graduates are NT$2,000 to NT$4,000 higher than market levels.</P>
      <P>Forty-seven percent of the fresh graduates said they are thinking
about entering professions that are different from their field of
training, with master's graduates registering the lowest ratio at 34
percent.</P>
      <P>The survey shows that graduates from the fields of agriculture,
tourism and leisure as well as education have the strongest desire to
switch professions, while graduates from the fields of art and
design, mass communications, and science and technology have the
least desire to do so.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, if their job search is unsuccessful, 40 percent of the
respondents said they will further their studies in Taiwan, and
approximately 20 percent of the respondents said they will further
their studies abroad.</P>
      <P>The survey indicates that graduates of private schools and
technical colleges have the strongest motivation to advance their
education or acquire a second expertise.</P>
      <P>By discipline, graduates from the field of education have the
highest motivation to further their studies, and those from the field
of tourism and leisure have the least motivation to do so.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FLEXIBLE ON OPENING DOOR WIDER TO CHINESE TOURISTS: MAC HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's policy of allowing no
more than 1,000 mainland Chinese citizens a day to make sightseeing
trips to Taiwan remains unchanged, although this policy is flexible
and the government does not exclude the possibility of allowing a
greater number of Chinese tourists in the future, the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) chairman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a meeting at the legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , Joseph Wu said that as long as Beijing engages in
talks with the Taiwan authorities to reach consensus on the issue,
Taiwan will not oppose a full opening to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Wu claimed that the MAC published a policy of allowing mainland
Chinese citizens to make tourism trips to Taiwan conditionally in
2001.</P>
      <P>Actually, Taiwan has allowed mainland citizens studying abroad
and those who have obtained permanent resident status overseas to
come to Taiwan since 2002, and it further eased restrictions later
that year to allow mainland Chinese living overseas -- including in
Hong Kong and Macau -- for more than four years and who have work
permits, to visit Taiwan, along with their spouses and immediate
relatives under a principle of "groups in, groups out."</P>
      <P>The regulations were later further relaxed to allow mainland
citizens to make group tours to the island after visiting third
countries.</P>
      <P>To prevent mainland Chinese tourists from absconding en masse
after entering Taiwan -- as happened on several occasions in 2005 --
the government has imposed a number of restrictions on this special
group of visitors, including the requirement that they report to the
local police each night of their stay.</P>
      <P>Wu said this "daily report" requirement has already been relaxed
to prevent Taiwan from being considered "a country where martial law
is still imposed."</P>
      <P>Beijing issued "15 incentives" to Taiwan at the conclusion of an
economic forum in Beijing between the KMT and the Communist Party of
China April 14-15. One of the "incentives" was a promise to allow
Chinese citizens to make sightseeing trips to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Michael
Ying-mau Kao has not instructed media outlets stationed in
Washington, D.C. to cover the meeting between U.S. President George
W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao Thursday, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman clarified Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu was responding to a local news report that said Kao
instructed the nation's representative office in the U.S. to ask
Taiwan media outlets in the U.S. capital to do everything possible to
enter the venue of the Bush-Hu meeting, the Oval Office of the White
House, to pose questions and "defend Taiwan's rights."</P>
      <P>"Kao has not issued any such instructions," Lu said.</P>
      <P>The ministry respects freedom of the press and has smooth
communications with the media, Lu added.</P>
      <P>According to the news report, it will be almost impossible for
Taiwan news media to enter the venue of the Bush-Hu meeting, as both
sides will each only designate five to six members of the media to
enter for a question and answer session after the meeting due to the
limited space.</P>
      <P>The report said that the ministry came up with the idea because
of concerns about a repetition of the public rebuke of President Chen
Shui-bian by President Bush when he received Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao in late 2003 to convey his sense of displeasure over Chen's
insistence on holding a national referendum.</P>

      <P>The bottom-up approach of constitutional

      <P>Imagine the fun of keeping a flock of 
chickens without actually getting your hands dirty feeding them. A

combines the idea of "virtual farm" and "actual farm." In the 
virtual farm, the customer can choose the chicken they want to raise 
and then monitor the growth of their "pet chicken" through computer or
mobile phone, while staff at the actual farm take care of the 
chickens.</P>
      <P>"The best thing about this project is that the customers don't 
need to really have a farm in order to enjoy the fun of raising a

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TOURISM A 'NATION TO NATION' MATTER: PRIVATE GROUPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tourism exchanges across the Taiwan Strait
are a "nation to nation" matter, and visiting Chinese tourists should
present their PRC passports for ROC visa stamps upon their entrance
into Taiwan, a group of civic organizations said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The seven pro-independence groups, including the Taiwan Society
South, issued a joint statement to call for the government to be on
the watch for the expected flood of Chinese tourists into Taiwan
after Beijing unveiled a set of management rules last week in
preparation for mainland citizens to make sightseeing trips to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese tourists should present their PRC passports,
rather than simply travel documents, when entering Taiwan, for
immigration authorities to stamp with official ROC visas, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>To date, according to the statement, special groups of Chinese
citizens -- including Chinese officials visiting Taiwan via third
countries, mainland citizens studying abroad, and those who have
obtained permanent resident status overseas -- have been allowed to
visit Taiwan for tourism but have all used travel documents issued by
Taiwan without the printing of ROC stamps on their documents upon
entrance.</P>
      <P>Noting that illegal Chinese immigrants -- many of whom absconded
en masse while traveling in tour groups -- have been a headache
internationally, the statement said Taiwan's situation can only be
worse. Since Chinese spies, or "Fifth Column" members, could sneak
into Taiwan under the guise of being tourists, all Chinese citizens
should be required to have their fingerprints taken upon entering the
country for the sake of safeguarding Taiwan's national security.</P>
      <P>In addition, the statement called for tighter complementary
policies in terms of welcoming Chinese tourists to Taiwan, saying
that Taiwan cannot be too careful, particularly with the bird flu
threat in China.</P>
      <P>Beijing issued "15 incentives" to Taiwan at the conclusion of an
economic forum in Beijing between the main opposition Kuomintang and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) will
assist the Taiwan Farmers' Association to register Taiwan farm
produce in China to protect the rights of Taiwan farmers, a COA
official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Minister Lee Jen-chyuan made the remarks in a seminar on
cross-strait agricultural exchanges and cooperation convened by the
main opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) legislative caucus. Officials
from the Mainland Affairs Council and the Intellectual Property
Office under the Ministry of Economic Affairs also attended the
seminar.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislators Chu Feng-chi and Wang Yi-ting noted that although
China announced the opening of its market to Taiwan agricultural
imports a year ago, the actual amount of Taiwan farm produce sold in
China has been limited.</P>
      <P>However, Chinese farm produce falsely marketed as Taiwan produce
has been selling like hot cakes in China, they said, asking the
government to help Taiwan farmers solve the problem.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the government has created several designs for a
"Taiwan fruit" logo and that it is now in the final stage of
selecting a design, a process he said he expects to be completed
within a month.</P>
      <P>The COA will then assist the Taiwan Farmers' Association to
register the logo in China in a bid to combat rampant counterfeiting
of Taiwan farm produce labels, Lee said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lee said, 13 Taiwan trademarks with Taiwanese
geographical names, such as "Alishan Mountain tea" and "Chihshan

    <HEADLINE>ARTIFICIAL REPRODUCTION APPLIES ONLY TO MARRIED COUPLES: BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators reached a consensus Wednesday
that artificial reproduction technology can be used only by married
infertile couples.</P>
      <P>This means that couples in homosexual and cohabitation
relationships, single parents, single individuals and widows will all
be prohibited from using the technology.</P>
      <P>The consensus was established during a review of the Artificial
Reproduction Bill in the Legislative Yuan's Health, Environment and
Social Welfare Committee.</P>
      <P>According to opposition Kuomintang Legislator Wu Yu-sheng, the
government should not encourage what he claimed is "irresponsible
behavior" such as single parenthood and having children without
getting married. He further claimed that the restriction is aimed at
"protecting the younger generation."</P>
      <P>Also, in a move aimed at preventing incest and the commercial
trading of reproductive cells, the legislators agreed that people can
only donate their reproductive cells once during their lifetimes, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the age of the donors is restricted to 20-50 for men
and 20-40 for women, because medical research has found that the egg
fertility rate of women over 40 is six times lower than when they are
20, Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHIEF WILLING TO HELP WITH TAIWAN FARM EXPORTS TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Wednesday that he is willing to work with the Ministry
of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and the Council of Agriculture (COA) to
help push for more exports of Taiwan farm produce to China.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while attending a seminar held by the
legislative caucus of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) on ways to
boost cross-Taiwan Strait agricultural exchanges, in which officials
from the MOEA, the COA and the Taiwan Provincial Farmers' Association
also took part.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the farmers' association voiced
dissatisfaction with what they called the government's "technical
boycotts" to stall the sale of Taiwan farm products to China, arguing
that the semi-official Taiwan External Trade Development Council
(TAITRA) , appointed by the government to take charge of local farm
exports to China, has failed to help protect local farmers' interests
in China.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that TAITRA is not an organization specializing in
agriculture, association representatives complained that TAITRA,
whose main task is to promote Taiwan's foreign trade, is not suitable
for the farm sales mission and that TAITRA has turned down their
offers of help several times.</P>
      <P>They questioned the government's motivation in allowing TAITRA to
play the role, saying that they suspect the government is using a
technical boycott to disguise its unwillingness to help Taiwan
farmers sell to China to resolve their overproduction problems.</P>
      <P>Wu denied their charges and claimed that the government has never
stood in the way to block Taiwan's farm exports o China, ascribing
the limited progress on the issue to political gridlock at home
between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the
opposition "pan blue alliance."</P>
      <P>The MAC head said that he is willing to help and coordinate with
the MOEA and the COA regarding the issue and he hailed the expertise
of the provincial farmers' association, promising to help push for
more local farm exports to China in cooperation with the association.</P>
      <P>Agricultural cooperation between Taiwan and China has always been
a major issue high on the cross-strait economic agenda.</P>
      <P>Beijing announced 15 measures that it claims are beneficial to
Taiwan following an economic forum last week in Beijing between the
main Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China, with Beijing
agreeing to open the Chinese market wider to Taiwan's agriculture and
fruit and to dispatch procurement groups to buy farm produce in
Taiwan.
P.K. Chiang, a vice chairman o f the KMT, said Tuesday while
taking part in an economic symposium on Taiwan's industrial upgrading
in Dongguan that Beijing's announcement that it will allow Chinese
tourists to sight-see in Taiwan and will push for two-way direct air 
and shipping links will be a great stimulus to Taiwan's flagging
economy.</P>
      <P>Setting up direct transport links across the strait is especially
important to Taiwan, Chiang said, claiming that it would help Taiwan
businessmen keep their operations at home while luring greater
foreign investment to Taiwan.</P>

Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) hope that opposition Kuomintang

long to facilitate the formation of consensus on issues concerning
Taiwan's economy and the people's livelihoods, the top presidential

      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen said he wrote
to KMT Secretary-General Chan Chun-po last week about the new
invitation, but had not heard from him.</P>
      <P>The holding of a second Chen-Ma meeting has been the hope of
Chen, the DPP hierarchy and the DPP legislative caucus since April 3,
when Chen met Ma at the Presidential Office, said Tan Sun Chen.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen said, however, that the KMT has been cool in its
reaction toward the notion of a second meeting, which he claimed
would be conducive to boosting harmony between the ruling and
opposition parties. Harmonious engagement is not only the mainstream
opinion in Taiwan, but the first Chen-Ma meeting was also received
favorably by the Bush administration in the United States, he said.</P>
      <P>During the first, unprecedented Chen-Ma meeting, the two men
talked about a wide range of topics, including the definition of the
controversial "one China" policy and the cessation of the National

    <TEXT>
      <P>All Taiwan foreign aid measures, including
goods and infrastructure projects, should carry a mark indicating
that it comes from "the Republic of China (Taiwan) , " Premier Su
Tseng-chang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Su said it might seem "ideological, " but the "ROC (Taiwan) "
mark carried on foreign aid measures taken or contributed by Taiwan
to other countries is essential to avoid Taiwan's assistance efforts
from being misunderstood or simply "erased."</P>
      <P>Taking some cases in Africa as an example, Su said that when the
African people offered their gratitude toward Taiwan for the
country's aid or assistance, they used the term "China" instead of
"the Republic of China," apparently unwittingly, according to Su.</P>
      <P>In those cases, he claimed, Taiwan's efforts seemed to have "gone
to waste" or Taiwan had been on a "fool's errand, " contributing
"only to China's publicity."</P>
      <P>Taiwan should build up its own image and reputation in the
international community by clearly spelling out the country's name,
which he said is "the Republic of China on Taiwan, " adding that
Taiwan should let the world know that Taiwan is not China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CAP ON CHINESE TOURIST NUMBERS TO BE RAISED GRADUALLY: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Timothy J. Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's policy of allowing
Chinese citizens to visit Taiwan is not only a matter of tourist
numbers or national security but also the overall benefit to Taiwan's
economy, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Wednesday at a weekly Cabinet
meeting.</P>
      <P>Su also noted that some other factors should be considered, such
as sufficient preparations, management measures and tourist numbers,
adding that "we want to keep them coming over and over again."</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks in response to media speculation that there
will be no limits on the number of Chinese tourist arrivals in
Taiwan. It would be impossible for Taiwan to accommodate even half a
million Chinese tourists in the initial stages, the premier said.</P>
      <P>"In order to maintain standards of hotel accommodation, we must
know how well our hotels can manage the numbers and related
ministries should make plans in advance, especially how many Chinese
citizens can enter Taiwan per day," Su said.</P>
      <P>Su said that the policy of allowing Chinese citizens to come to
Taiwan for sightseeing should be carried out gradually with an
open-minded attitude, adding that "we should regard tourists from
China as part of our worldwide tourism policy."</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said the government's policy of allowing no more than 1,000
Chinese citizens a day to make sightseeing trips to Taiwan remains
unchanged, although he added that the policy is flexible and that the
government does not exclude the possibility of allowing a greater
number of Chinese tourists in the future.</P>
      <P>Speaking in a meeting at the legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , Wu said that as long as Beijing engages in talks
with the Taiwan authorities to reach consensus on the issue, Taiwan
will not oppose full opening to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>Regarding Beijing's new "15 incentives" offered to Taiwan at the
conclusion of an economic forum in Beijing between the KMT and the
Communist Party of China (CPC) April 14-15 -- one of which is to
allow more Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan -- Wu responded that
implementation of those incentives should be negotiated under the
existing rules. The incentives are merely KMT-CPC bipartisan
conclusions that have no government authority, he pointed out.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A presentation to promote investment in an
industrial park in El Salvador was held at the Taipei International
Convention Center Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The presentation, sponsored by the Industrial Development and
Investment Center under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was the
first of three presentations held in Taiwan to promote investment in
the Taiwan Park in the Central American country. Two other
presentations will be held in central and southern Taiwan.
</P>
      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Chen Ruey-long said that trade and
economic relations between Taiwan and El Salvador are close. Taiwan
will start free trade agreement (FTA) negotiations with El Salvador
later this year and if the two countries sign an FTA, El Salvador
will become a crucial link in Taiwan's globalization.</P>
      <P>El Salvador Ambassador to the Republic of China Francisco
Ricardo Santana Berrios noted that the U.S.-Central America Free
Trade Agreement (CAFTA) was put into effect in March, making the
Taiwan Park the best springboard for Taiwan businessmen making
inroads into the American market.</P>
      <P>The agreement promotes trade liberalization between the United
States and the Central American countries of Costa Rica, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that after the U.S.-CAFTA is put into effect,
agricultural and industrial products exported to the United States
will enjoy tariff incentives, with textile products enjoying the
highest tariff incentive of 32 percent.</P>
      <P>The government will also help manufacturers invest in and set up
plants in Central America through a "co-prosperity" project that was
first broached by President Chen Shui-bian during his visit to ROC
allies in Central America last year.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Park, a brainchild of Vice President Annette Lu, is
being planned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the National
Science Council, based on the model of the Southern Taiwan Science
Park.</P>

vote-buying by releasing commercials, imposing stiffer penalties on
violators and increasing the rewards for those who report
vote-buying.</P>

China's Rising Need for Oil Is High on U.S. 
Agenda 

The competition for access to oil is
emerging high on the agenda for President Hu
Jintao's visit to the White House this week.
President Bush has called China's growing demand
for oil one reason for rising prices, and has
warned Beijing against trying to "lock up"
global supplies. With crude oil selling for more
than US$70 a barrel and American motorists
paying US$3 a gallon for gasoline, American
officials say the subject cannot be avoided at
Thursday's meeting in the Oval Office, as it was
sidestepped when Bush visited Beijing last fall.
In 2004 China used some 6.5 million barrels of 
oil a day and overtook Japan as the world's 
second largest user of petroleum products. The 
largest, the United States, consumes about 20 
million barrels a day.

    <HEADLINE>NO WAY CHINA A RESPONSIBLE STAKEHOLDER: CHINESE ACTIVISTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 19 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no way that China can play the
role of a "responsible stakeholder" in the international community
because of its autocratic nature and resistance to political reform,
a group of Chinese democracy activists said in a seminar Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"People expect China to become a democratic country and
responsible stakeholder after its economical development. It's a
fantasy," said Ruan Ming, an advisor to President Chen Shui-bian and
a former Communist Party of China (CPC) spin doctor in the 1970s
before fleeing China.</P>
      <P>The activists were responding to a 2005 statement by U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Robert Zoellick in which he said: "As it
becomes a major global player, we are now encouraging China to become
a 'responsible stakeholder' that will work with the United States and
others to sustain, adapt, and advance the peaceful international
system that has enabled its success."</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao insisted on a policy that "opens up
the economy but retains political suppression," Ruan said, adding
that he calls it an "open slavery system."</P>
      <P>"Regardless of what attention it gets or doesn't get, the
CPC will not be a responsible party, and this has always been the
case," said Paul Lin, a New York-based political commentator.</P>
      <P>The world is seeking a "new definition -- economically or
politically" of the current China, said Hu Ping, the chief editor of
Beijing Spring since 1996. But he said the world should also look at
"the dark side behind China's peaceful rising."</P>
      <P>"Economists offer praise and are amazed at China's economic boom.
However, if China does not develop comprehensive political reforms,
we'll be seeing an evil superpower ten years from now," Hu warned.</P>
      <P>"The CPC will not be responsible to anything because it's a
totalitarian regime, which is not being supervised by elections or
the media as it is in democratic countries. You just can't trust
them," said U.S.-based political commentator Cao Changqing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN URGES KMT HEAD TO 'RESTRAIN' LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun Wednesday urged Ma Ying-jeou -- his counterpart
in the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- to "restrain" the party's
lawmakers from making accusations against other politicians without
evidence.</P>
      <P>Yu was referring in particular to several KMT legislators who
recently hinted that President Chen Shui-bian and First Lady Wu
Shu-jen might have received political donations from entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmakers also alleged that Ma Yung-cheng, a Presidential
Office deputy secretary-general, received bribes from local
businessmen as payment for his "manipulation" in some business deals.</P>
      <P>Stressing that such unfounded statements will cause anxiety in
society, Yu urged Ma to restrain KMT lawmakers from such behavior.</P>
      <P>Ma has in fact made comments on the phenomenon, saying Tuesday
that lawmakers should provide evidence when making accusations
against other politicians; otherwise, he said, it will not only
damage the lawmaker's reputation, but also that of the party.</P>
      <P>Ma said he would forward the suggestion to the KMT's legislative
caucus for party lawmakers to review.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT BEGINS CRACKDOWN ON HIRING OF ILLEGAL MIGRANT WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Employers who illegally hire absconded
migrant workers will receive a maximum fine of NT$750,000 starting
April 20, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) , the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) , and the National Police Agency (NPA) announced
Wednesday in a joint press conference.</P>
      <P>"Undocumented migrant workers have become a critical concern
affecting the public order in Taiwan. If employers obey the law and
refuse to hire migrant workers who absconded from their legal jobs,
we believe the number of unaccounted-for foreign workers and illegal
recruitment agencies will gradually decrease, " said CLA Minister Lee
Ying-yuan.</P>
      <P>First-time offenders will face a maximum fine of NT$750,000,
while repeat offenders within a period of five years will receive a
sentence of three years or less or a maximum fine of NT$1.2 million,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Under the current circumstances, undocumented migrant workers are
easily exploited by their employers, for instance by working overtime
or without labor insurance, Lee noted. And it is a problem the CLA is
very concerned about.</P>
      <P>Undocumented migrants workers are encouraged to turn themselves
in to the authorities. Those who wish to do so can use toll-free
telephone numbers of 0800-885885 (English) , 0800-885995 (Thai) ,
0800-885958 (Indonesian) and 0800-017858 (Vietnamese).</P>
      <P>The CLA has vowed to streamline the process of returning illegals
home to their countries of origin and re-issuing missed passports for
migrant workers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic overtures made by Beijing to
Taiwan following a forum held jointly by the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) last week in
Beijing were politically motivated moves aimed at crippling the
government, China Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Minister Huang Wei-feng
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks at a seminar sponsored by the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that the 15 measures Beijing released after
the KMT-CPC forum are all small favors too highly charged with
political considerations to be dealt with by Taiwan's
authorities.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, Beijing's zero tariff treatment for
Taiwan's top-notch fishery products is purely superficial as the
value of Taiwan's exports to China of this kind accounts for only
0.07 percent of the country's total.</P>
      <P>Another of the 15 "incentives" from the forum proposes
that private groups from the two sides handle issues that
normally require government authorities, and is just a way to
paralyze the government, he added.</P>
      <P>Huang also said he does not think Beijing has made bold moves
toward a "real opening," and that the time has not yet come to push
China's political elite to do so until they have met with aggressive
pressure to give up their privileges.</P>
      <P>Dong Lee-wen, former head of the China affairs department of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party, forecast that Chinese President
Hu Jintao will not talk about his April 16 meeting in Beijing with
KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan now that the U.S. government has
recently asked Beijing again to enter dialogue with the DPP
government.</P>
      <P>Dong opined that conclusions reached by Lien and Hu were
actually directed at KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou in hopes of having
the KMT incumbent toe Lien's pro-unification line regarding
Taiwan's future ties with China.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of Taiwan are worrying about
the possibility of U.S. President George W. Bush making statements
unfavorable to Taiwan during his upcoming meeting with Chinese
President Hu Jintao, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu made the
remarks while meeting with a group of exiled Chinese pro-democracy
dissidents, including Cao Changqing, Lin Baohua and Hu Ping.</P>
      <P>Hu is currently on a high-profile U.S. visit and is scheduled to
meet with Bush at the White House Thursday. The Taiwan Strait issue is
expected to be high on the agenda of the Bush-Hu huddle.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has emerged as a liberal democracy, Wu
lamented that democratization has not visibly aided Taiwan's quest
for representation in major international organizations or in the
creation of a higher international profile. On many occasions, he
said, the international community tends to misinterpret Taiwan's
political reforms as signs of a change being made to the cross-strait
status quo while ignoring China's human rights violations.</P>
      <P>Take the government's recent decision to cease the function of
the National Unification Council and its guidelines. Wu said many
countries expressed concern about such a decision on grounds that it
might alter the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>"In fact, the decision conformed to the basic democratic
principle of respecting the Taiwan people's will in determining the
nation's future," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Over the past few decades, Wu continued, Taiwan has been actively
promoting wide-ranging exchanges with exiled Chinese dissidents
through various channels as part of its efforts to push for China's
democratic reform so the Chinese people can enjoy freedom and
democracy like their cousins in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Ing-san
ruled out Wednesday the possibility of raising water rate this year.</P>
      <P>Hwang's remarks came amid concerns about possible domestic
consumer prices fluctuation following a steep 9.2 percent hike in
gasoline prices announced by state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp.
(CPC) a day earlier.</P>
      <P>As the international crude oil prices have surged to historical
highs, Hwang said another state-owned utility, Taiwan Power Co.
(Taipower), is also reviewing its electricity pricing formula.</P>
      <P>"It remains uncertain whether Taipower will raise its electricity
rates before the implementation of its summer power rates in June, "
Hwang said, adding that the Ministry of Economic Affairs will decide
whether to adjust domestic electricity rates after Taipower presents
a comprehensive report or adjustment scale.</P>
      <P>Despite the CPC's latest decision to raise its gasoline and
diesel prices by NT$2 per liter from Wednesday, Hwang said he
believes that the nation will still be able to realize the goal of
keeping the domestic inflation rate at bay.</P>
      <P>"I think there should be no problems with the goal of keeping the
annual growth rate of the consumer price index below 2 percent this
year," Hwang added.

      <P>Hwang made the remarks in response to media questions at the
Legislative Yuan amidst concerns about possible inflation following a
steep 9.2 percent hike in gasoline prices announced by state-owned
Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As international crude oil prices have surged to historical
highs, Hwang said Taipower, a state-owned utility, estimates that it
will suffer losses totalling NT$25 billion this year and that the
figure could rise to as high as NT$30 billion if oil prices continue
to climb.</P>
      <P>"Consumers use electricity in different ways, and it wouldn't be
fair for Taipower to pay for the loss alone," Hwang said, adding that
the Ministry of Economic Affairs will decide whether to adjust
domestic electricity rates after Taipower submits a comprehensive
report on adjustments.</P>
      <P>Hwang said that Taipower has its own adjustment mechanism for
evaluating electricity rates.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Hwang said that "it remains uncertain whether
Taipower will raise its electricity rates before it adopts the summer
power rates in June."

      <P>Taiwan orchids will blend into this year's
Canadian Tulip Festival in Canada's capital city of Ottawa May 4-22
when over three million tulips are expected to create an exotic
mosaic of color and beauty in the world's largest tulip festival.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsin-hsiung, director of the Science and Technology
Division of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) in Canada,

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's efforts to promote
exchanges of specialized talent across the Taiwan Strait have been
ineffective because China has imposed strict controls over such
exchanges, a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Minister Johnnason Liu pointed out that the government
long ago announced measures allowing Chinese students to visit Taiwan
for up to four months for short-term exchange activities, but only 10
people have applied to join the program so far.</P>
      <P>While the government has also made available measures
facilitating Chinese technological talent to work in Taiwan, with
their duration of stay extending up to six years, this program has
seen no progress, either, owing to China's restrictions preventing
the drain of its technological talent, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks during a seminar hosted by a group of
opposition Kuomintang legislators, who were pressing the government
to recognize mainland Chinese academic degrees and promote
cross-strait medical and health exchanges and cooperation.</P>
      <P>The legislators claimed that the government should encourage
mainland Chinese students to study in Taiwan to resolve the
oversupply of higher education resources in the country.</P>
      <P>Also, they said the government should allow medical institutions
to set up operations in China and allow medical workers to work in
China to resolve the problem of the surplus of medical workers owing
to the declining fertility rate in Taiwan.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  20  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Blocked and illegal occupation of
pedestrian areas and poor sidewalk design and construction are common
causes for pedestrians being forced into the road, often causing them
serious injury, advocacy groups for the disabled complained Thursday.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, these groups -- including the Federation
of the Disabled of the Republic of China -- urged the government and
the public to "return the sidewalks to pedestrians."</P>
      <P>Wen Chi-hsiang, secretary-general of the Federation of the
Spine-Wounded, told how he was injured four years ago at an
intersection of two major roads in Banqiao, suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Because the sidewalk was filled with motorcycles and vendor
stands, he had to drive his electric wheelchair in the slow-traffic
lane of the road and was hit from behind by a taxi, he said, adding
that he suffered a dislocated left shoulder, broken pelvis and facial
injuries when his wheelchair was overturned.</P>
      <P>Left-handed Wen said he could no longer use his left hand to
write or do other things. In order to protect himself, he has
installed a flashlight on his wheelchair.</P>
      <P>Eden Social Welfare Foundation's deputy CEO, Lin Chin-chuan, who
also relies on an electric wheelchair, said, in March last year he
had to "fight with cars" in order to cross ZhongXiao Bridge in Taipei
because there was no access to the sidewalk.</P>
      <P>It was when he was using a car lane that he was seriously injured
in an accident. He had tens of stitches on his head and was
hospitalized for three months; his brain injury continues to pose
problems with his sense of smell, he said.</P>
      <P>Another story of a disabled person suffering an injury on the
streets was told by Lu Hung-wen, chairman of the Taipei Association
for the Promotion of Welfare for the Blind.</P>
      <P>Lu said one of the association members was also forced to walk in
the slow traffic lane two years ago because the sidewalk was
occupied. The road was being repaired, but the warning signs were
beyond the reach of a blind person's white stick.</P>
      <P>The sightless person fell into sewage that was five floors deep
and had to stay in the hospital for two weeks as he had absorbed too
much sewage water, Lu reported.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Tung-ju, secretary-general of the Federation of the
Disabled, suggested that government officials regularly update their
knowledge about laws and regulations that can help ensure the safety
of the disabled on the road.</P>
      <P>If they find laws and regulations that are outdated, they should
take the initiative to propose amendments in order to keep similar
unfortunate stories from happening again, Hsieh added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  19  (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is ridiculous that Communist
China's dictator Hu Jintao receives a 21-gun salute when he visits
the White House while Taiwan's democratically elected president --
one of the strongest allies of the United States -- cannot even visit
Washington, Congressman Steve Chabot (R-Cincinnati) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is an independent, sovereign nation. No amount of
diplomatic doubletalk can obscure this fact. It's time to recognize
this reality fully and welcome our democratic allies to our nation's
capital," Chabot said in a news release Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Pressure from Communist China to isolate Taiwan is a direct
result of our failed 'One China' policy that curries favor with a
dictatorship while belittling our democratic ally," Chabot said.</P>
      <P>"The travel ban [on Taiwan's democratically elected leaders] is
an excellent illustration of that discredited policy, " Chabot
claimed.</P>
      <P>Chabot, co-founder and chairman of the Congressional Taiwan
Caucus, said he has recently introduced a resolution in the House of
Representatives urging the Bush administration to permit official
visits to the United States by high-level officeholders from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Current U.S. policy prohibits official travel to the United
States by Taiwan's president, vice-president, foreign minister and
defense minister.</P>
      <P>Chabot introduced House Resolution 381 along with Ohio
Congressman Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) . Chabot and Brown, both senior
members of the House International Relations Committee and its
Asia-Pacific subcommittee, are co-founders and chairmen of the
Congressional Taiwan Caucus.</P>
      <P>"I think our resolution is long overdue and believe it sends the
right message at the right time, " Chabot said, adding that travel to
the United States by senior Taiwanese officials has occasionally been
allowed, but only for "transit visits" permitting a short layover
before traveling to another country.</P>
      <P>Chabot recalled having to travel to New York with other
pro-democracy Members of Congress to meet with Taiwan's President
Chen Shui-bian during one such visit. Most recently, he and others
spoke to Chen via video teleconference when the Taiwanese leader had
a stopover in Miami.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Timothy J. Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman
Michel Lu said Thursday that Taiwan was not involved in unrest
surrounding the Solomon Islands' elections, and "we will find
out why Taiwan is rumored to have been involved."</P>
      <P>According to media reports, a curfew in the Solomon Islands
capital Honiara will be enforced for a second night Thursday. The
rioting followed the election Tuesday of Snyder Rini as prime
minister, a move which angered supporters of rival Job Dudley
Tausinga. Rioters targeted Chinese businesses because they were
believed to be backing Rini.</P>
      <P>Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Tuesday that
the riots in the streets of Solomon Islands' capital are related to
China-Taiwan powerplay in the South Pacific region.</P>
      <P>At a press briefing, Lu said there were only two Taiwanese
businessmen in the Solomon Islands -- one is running a restaurant,
and the other owns a garage. Both are safe, and the ROC Embassy and
the agricultural missions of the International Cooperation and
Development Fund (Taiwan ICDF) have not been affected.</P>
      <P>"The burnt-out area is the Chinatown where most overseas Chinese
came from China," said Lu, stressing that the riot had nothing to do
with Taiwan, as the Solomon government has confirmed.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's diplomatic ties are based on mutual trust for the
purpose of long-term development, and we love to see democratic
elections held in those countries," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Since Australian-led peacekeeping troops now remain in the
Solomon Islands, Lu said the riots should be quelled soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRACY IS TAIWAN'S BEST PROTECTION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 20 (CNA)
(By Y. F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian asserted Thursday
that the country's wave of democracy and freedom can never be halted
by nuclear weapons, missiles or dictatorship because democracy is
"the best TMD [theater missile defense] for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The purpose of the government's move to introduce a referendum
system in Taiwan and cease the function of the National Unification
Council is precisely to cement and deepen the country's democracy and
realize the principle of "sovereignty lying with the people, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He said the roots of the cross-Taiwan Strait dispute are not in
ideological differences but in the divided choices of the two sides
in terms of lifestyle and political system.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that democracy means the people are the masters of the
country, and that they should be entitled to freedom of choice and
the right to a referendum.</P>
      <P>In line with this principle, "ultimate unification" with China
should not be predetermined as the sole option available to the
people of Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while receiving Chinese democratic
activists -- including Ruan Ming, Lin Baohua, Cao Changqing, Hu Ping
and Wang Ce -- in Taipei, ahead of a high-profile meeting between
U.S. President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao in
Washington D. C.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Bush previously said that only when China becomes
free and democratic will it stop being a threat to its neighboring
countries, and that U. S. officials have repeatedly expressed the
expectation that China will act as a responsible stakeholder.</P>
      <P>Chen said he also hopes the rise of China will be accompanied by
an awakening to peace and democratic development, and that when the
"sleeping lion" of China wakes up it will become a truly responsible
stakeholder in the world.</P>
      <P>Although such expectations appear illusory and naive, he is
willing to dream this dream and work with others to try to attain
that goal, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that he is not against the Chinese people, but
against the one-party totalitarian rule of the Chinese Communists,
because "China itself is not a problem, but Chinese communism is."</P>
      <P>Describing China as a country with one of the worst human rights
records in the world, Chen said Taiwan has traveled a similar path --
transforming itself from authoritarianism to democracy.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan is willing to share this precious experience
with the 1.3 billion people in China so that Taiwan's success story
will serve as a beacon inspiring China toward democratization.</P>

(By Taijing Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The consumer price index (CPI) might rise
0.6 percent if electricity rates go up 10 percent as a result of
gasoline price hikes, a scholar at the Taiwan Research Institute
(TRI) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Tang-yu, a leading scholar at the TRI, said that if the cost
of electricity goes up 3 percent, the CPI will roughly increase 0.2
percent this year, and if electricity prices rise 10 percent, the CPI
rise will possibly reach 0.6 percent this year, causing the CPI
adjustment to exceed the 2 percent target.</P>
      <P>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
(DGBAS) previously predicted the annual CPI rise this year would be
1.7 percent.</P>
      <P>Lin said that it will be quite difficult to keep the CPI increase
under 2 percent this year when electricity costs are taken into
account.</P>
      <P>However, Lin said that expenditure on electricity only represent
10 percent of the total cost of the country's energy-intensive
industry and is not expected to greatly affect industrial
competitiveness or people's everyday life.</P>
      <P>Lin suggested that the cost of electricity should reflect the
cost of its fuel, but that each time its price adjustments should not
exceed 6 percent.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In contrast to the clear notion the
American people possess of China, China remains something obscure to
the people of Taiwan, according to President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Compared to more than half of Americans who view China both as an
economic and military threat to the world, Taiwan's people are
sharply divided over the question of whether China is an "enemy" or a
"friend, "a motherland" or a "foreign country" to Taiwan, Chen said
in an electronic newsletter published Thursday by the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>As Chinese President Hu Jintao is soon to meet with U.S.
President George W. Bush Thursday at the White House, a "China fever"
is also emerging in the United States in response to the question of
whether China brings opportunities or threatens the world, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Citing results of a public opinion survey by thinktank Rand
Corp., Chen pointed out that 64 percent of Americans view China as an
economic threat to the United States while 50 percent think it poses
a military threat to the country.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that some 55 percent believe China obtains
its economic growth through unfair competition, and many among the U.
S. public feel resentment toward China, mainly due to its poor human
rights record, military buildup, unfair trade practices, commercial
piracy and currency manipulation.</P>
      <P>Compared to Americans who have a clear picture of China in their
minds, Taiwan's 23 million people lack a profound understanding of
what China means to this country, the president said, adding that
many Taiwanese don't even know whether China is a "foreign country"
or "the motherland."</P>
      <P>Taiwan must gain a clear concept of its national standing in the
world and of what it wants and believes in amid rapidly changing
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, the president said. China is an
important market, but by no means the sole or the last outlet for
Taiwan, he asserted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan can never turn a blind eye to China's atrocities and its
hegemonic mindset while engaging in trade and economic exchanges with
the neighboring country, which is hostile and a threat to Taiwan, he

Straining Texas Hosts

Seven months after two powerful hurricanes blew through the Gulf
Coast, elected officials, law enforcement agencies and many residents
say Texas is nearing the end of its ability to play good neighbor
without compensation. Houston is straining along its municipal seams
from the 150,000 new residents from New Orleans, officials say. 

Crime was already on the rise there before the hurricane, but the
Houston police say that evacuees were victims or suspects in
two-thirds of the 30 percent increase in murders since September. The
schools are also struggling to educate thousands of new children.

    <TEXT>
      <P>A national conference on sustainable
development is set to open Friday in Taipei and environmentalists are
threatening to stage a protest against government projects which
they claim will take a heavy toll on the environment.</P>
      <P>In a news conference held by the conference's organizer, the
National Council for Sustainable Development under the Executive
Yuan, Minister without Portfolio Lin Si-yao -- who doubles as the
chief executor of the council -- said the two-day conference will
focus on four themes: major transportation projects, the development
of water resources, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and
restructuring industry.</P>
      <P>He said the Executive Yuan will consult with environmental
groups for their opinion on these four themes without prejudice,
adding that he believes these groups will exchange views with
government officials rationally and reasonably during the conference.</P>
      <P>The conference results will be submitted to the
National Council for Sustainable Development as guidelines for
revising the country's sustainable development action program, the
minister said. Issues that cannot be solved at the conference through
consensus will be discussed further in public hearings or citizen
conferences to be organized afterward, Lin went on.</P>
      <P>However, several environmental groups -- including the Taiwan
Ecosystem Association -- have threatened to organize a protest rally
outside the conference venue Friday to protest the government's
insistence on pushing for several economic projects, which they claim
would serious damage the island's environment.</P>
      <P>Chen Ping-heng, secretary-general of the Taiwan Ecosystem
Association, said the conference would be meaningless as the

    <HEADLINE>RECORD-HOLDING BRITISH YACHTSWOMAN VISITS KEELUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Keelung,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Pien Chin-feng and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ellen MacArthur, the fastest ever sailor
to complete a solo non-stop circumnavigation of the globe, arrived in
Keelung Harbor Thursday aboard her solo racing 23-meter trimaran the
B&amp;Q Castorama for a short visit.</P>
      <P>MacArthur, who completed her single-handed round-the-world voyage
in a record-breaking time of 71 days and under 15 hours in February
2005 and was made a Dame by Queen Elizabeth in honor of her
achievement, said upon anchoring off Keelung at around 3:30 a.m.
that she was overwhelmed by the kindness and warm welcome that the
Taiwan people extended to her.</P>
      <P>The 28-year-old Briton was scheduled to depart Keelung for Hong
Kong at around 6 p.m. Thursday after renewing her supplies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is one of the stops on her current Asian voyage, which
began in Yokohama, Japan in mid-March and is expected to conclude in
Singapore in mid-May. The two-month Asian voyage will also take
MacArthur and the B&amp;Q Castorama to China's Hainan Island, Hong Kong,
Vietnam and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>MacArthur beat the previous record of 72 days and 22 hours set by
Frenchman Francis Joyon to break the round-the-world sailing record.</P>
      <P>Joyon's achievement in February 2004 raised the bar in solo
non-stop circumnavigation of the globe. He smashed the previous
record by a massive 20 days and it was widely believed in the sailing
world that his mark would go unchallenged for several years.</P>
      <P>MacArthur chased Joyon's record with a boat that is smaller, and
therefore slower than his, although its lighter weight helps
counterbalance that disadvantage.</P>
      <P>However, the vessel she has guided across more than 27,000 miles
was specially built with this task in mind. She had to contend with
extreme weather conditions and technical problems in her bid to
better Joyon.</P>
      <P>Mountainous seas, icebergs and gale force winds had threatened to
capsize her boat and she narrowly missed a collision with a whale
during the voyage.</P>
      <P>In breaking the latest record, MacArthur also broke five other
records -- beating Joyon's times to the Equator, the Cape of Good
Hope, Cape Leeuwin in Australia, Cape Horn and back again to the
Equator.</P>
      <P>She was conferred a Laurence Olivier Award for Extreme Sports and
was chosen as one of the world's 100 heroes by Time magazine late
last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA KEEPING WATCHFUL EYE ON MEETING BETWEEN U.S., CHINA LEADERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Thursday it is hoped that the forthcoming meeting between U.S.
President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao will not
harm Taiwan's national interests in any way.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks on the same day that Hu
was scheduled to arrive in Washington, D.C. for a meeting with Bush
at the White House.</P>
      <P>Noting that MOFA attaches great importance to the Bush-Hu
tete-a-tete, Lu said the ministry has activated a contingency
response task force to keep close tabs on the developments in Hu's
visit.</P>
      <P>Lu said there has been a smooth communication mechanism between
Taiwan and the United States to deal with major issues of mutual
concern.</P>
      <P>As to the topics to be brought up in the Bush-Hu meeting, Lu said
the U.S.-China trade issue, China's human rights conditions, its
suppression on religious freedom and slow progress in democratic
reform as well as the Taiwan Strait issue are expected to be high on
the agenda.</P>
      <P>Asked about the possibility of Bush expressing his hope during
the meeting that President Chen Shui-bian will uphold his now famous
"five noes" pledge, Lu said he would not respond to any hypothetical
questions. Bush was quoted by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert
Zoellick as having expressed such a hope recently.</P>
      <P>"We should have confidence in ourselves. We have maintained
smooth communications with the United States and it's a matter of
fact that both sides understand and respect each other's stances on
all relevant issues," Lu said.</P>
      <P>The "five noes" pledge refers to the promises Chen made in his
2000 inaugural speech that if China has no intention of using force
against Taiwan, he will not change Taiwan's national title and flag
nor declare independence during his term.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 27, Chen announced the cessation of a government body
responsible for eventual unification between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, provoking an angry reaction from Beijing and
consternation in the United States, Taiwan's most important ally.</P>
      <P>Chen said in an article published in the Asian Wall Street
Journal that day that Taiwan is not moving toward formal independence
but is trying to shore up the status quo in the Taiwan Strait as
rival China tries to change the situation in its favor.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that China's deployment of more than 800 missiles
aimed at the island and its passage in 2005 of its Anti-Secession Law
codifying the use of force against Taiwan required the country to act
decisively.</P>
      <P>"It is unfortunate that the process of shoring up such efforts
has been interpreted by China as evidence of moving toward formal
independence, " Chen wrote. "At times I also hear concern from the
U.S. and the international community suggesting that developments in
Taiwan... are aimed at changing the cross-strait status quo, or
worse, provoking confrontation with China. That certainly is not the
case," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Developing character and the appropriate
personal values of students and employees is important in both
university education and business, representatives from universities
and local corporations said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"For National Taiwan University (NTU), developing personal values
through a whole-person education is one of our priorities, " said
Joyce Feng, Dean of NTU's Student Affairs Division, in a press
conference held to announce the survey results of local businesses'
school preference in hiring fresh graduates.</P>
      <P>"Of the three key components we look for in an employee, we think
character is even more important than soft skills, which means
communication skills, and hard skills -- the domain of knowledge, "
said Kuo Keng-tsung, special assistant to the president of Mediatek
Inc.</P>
      <P>"We don't expect employees to change their character to
accommodate the company. On the contrary, we look to place employees
in the most suitable positions for them, " Kuo added.</P>
      <P>In the days of "knowledge explosion" and "chaotic" values,
professional knowledge is no longer the most important segment in
business hiring and college education, they agreed, which is why NTU
has declared its core elements of "TAIDA" -- teamwork,
accountability, integrity, diligence and ambition/vision, Feng said.</P>
      <P>Mediatek Inc. also looks for six characteristics it calls
"TICTIC, " in its employees -- trust, integrity, courage, teamwork,
innovation and continuous learning.</P>
      <P>"People can always learn because learning takes a lifetime. We
believe, however, that once the character is shaped, it's hard to
change," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>"Even today, the key to success for a person or corporation still
lies in the fundamentals," Kuo said.</P>

      <P>Graduates from National Cheng Kung
University (NCKU) are those most sought by local corporations,
according to the results of a poll released Thursday, the 10th
consecutive year the public school has topped the poll.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by Cheers magazine to explore the top
1,000 corporations' manpower recruitment plans and their school
preferences. The corporations were selected in terms of ratings
compiled by the CommonWealth business monthly.</P>
      <P>The poll found that while NCKU, located in the southern city of
Tainan, leads the overall ratings in seven categories, National
Taiwan University (NTU) ranks top in terms of producing graduates
with leadership and global vision.</P>
      <P>Tamkang University has the most sought-after graduates among
private universities for the second consecutive year.</P>
      <P>In the overall ratings, NTU graduates came in second, followed by
those from National Chiao Tung University, National Tsinghua
University and National Chengchi University. National Taiwan
University of Science and Technology, National Taipei University of
Technology, Tamkang University, National Sun Yat-sen University and
Chung-yuan Christian University rounded out the top 10.</P>
      <P>Among other findings, the survey shows that compared to five
years ago, fresh graduates are better in terms of innovation, global
vision and foreign language proficiency but worse in stability,
problem-solving ability, professional knowledge and teamwork.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 73.2 percent of the companies surveyed

    <TEXT>
      <P>South Korea has outperformed Taiwan since
the beginning of this year to become China's second-largest import
source, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER), a
private think tank, reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>CIER researchers quoted the latest report released by the Korean
Trade Investment Promotion Agency as indicating that South Korea has
enjoyed growth in its exports to China since January, while exports
to China from Taiwan, Japan and the United States have continued to
decline.</P>
      <P>The researchers said South Korea's exports to China have
continued to expand over the past three years, with China's eastern
province of Jiangsu being the biggest recipient among China's 31
provinces and cities. The amount that Jiangsu Province imported from
South Korea over the past three years was twice as much as South
Korea's entire exports to Germany in the same period and four times
as much as South Korea's exports to the United Kingdom, the
researchers said.</P>
      <P>The CIER researchers attributed South Korea's soaring exports to
China mainly to rising economic performance in the Yangtze River
Delta Economic Circle and increasing two-way trade between China and
South Korea, as well as expanding Korean investment in China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Behind China's rapid economic growth is
its industrial overcapacity, which is shrinking the industry's
profitability, a Taiwan scholar said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kao Chang, dean of National Dong Hwa University's School of
Humanities and Social Sciences, called for attention to China's
industrial overcapacity in an article he contributed to the
electronic newspaper of the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>The article quoted a State Council research center as saying that
in 2006, China's domestic steel products supply will reach 450
million tons, up 48 percent from a year earlier, while its demand
will be 337 million tons, creating a surplus of almost 120 million
tons.</P>
      <P>Another metal industry research center in China has estimated
that the oversupply will be between 50 million tons and 60 million
tons. Kao said that although the estimates are different, both point
to an overcapacity of China's steel industry.</P>
      <P>Similar statistics show that the capacity of China's aluminum
industry has reached 10.3 million tons, with an idle capacity of 2.6
million tons, the metal alloy industry has a capacity of 22.1 million
tons, coal mining has created a surplus of 100 million tons and the
cement industry is also in surplus.</P>
      <P>This has led to a slight decline in prices, blunting the
industry's profit margin and increasing losses, according to the
article.</P>
      <P>Kao further pointed out that even in China's booming auto
industry, the overcapacity problem is deteriorating. At present, only
55 percent of China's auto production facilities are in use.</P>
      <P>Quoting official Chinese tallies, Kao said the Chinese auto
industry can now churn out 8 million cars a year and its annual
production capacity will reach 10.2 million units when production
lines currently under construction are completed. But in 2005, only
about 5.5 million vehicles were sold in China, indicating that 45
percent of its capacity was left idle.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BENEFITS OF TAIWAN FISHERY EXPORTS TO CHINA REMAIN TO BE SEEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Whether and how China's plans to import
Taiwan fishery products duty free will benefit Taiwan's fishing
sector remains to be seen, a fishery industry source in Keelung said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>China issued "15 incentives" to Taiwan at the conclusion of an
economic forum in Beijing between Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang
and the Communist Party of China April 14-15. One of the "incentives"
was a promise to allow eight categories of Taiwan fishery products,
including mackerel and shrimp, to be exported to China duty free with
speedy quarantine procedures.</P>
      <P>In response, You Jih-hsing, chairman of the Keelung Fishermen's
Association, said that although it is better than nothing, it will be
of more benefit to deep-sea fishing operators than to coastal fishing
boats.</P>
      <P>Most of the Keelung Fishermen's Association members operate
coastal fishing boats, whose catches barely meet domestic demand, You
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, Taiwan's coastal fishing boats have met
increasing difficulties in their daily operations, given that fishery
sources in these regions have continued to decline, while Taiwan
fishing boats have fishery disputes with their Japanese counterparts
due to overlapping fishing grounds and increasing numbers of Chinese
fishing boats are poaching in Taiwan territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, You said, if the Beijing incentive is put into
practice, it would mean that Taiwan fishing boats can sail directly
from the open seas to China to sell their catches instead of
returning to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This scenario could cause Taiwan's fishing sector to shrink from
the roots -- a situation that could concern national policy and which
the government should not ignore, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Ling, an official with the Yilan Braided Twine
Fishing Association, said China's offer to allow mackerel caught by
Taiwan fishing boats to be exported to China duty free is not
attractive to Yilan fishing boats at all, since Taiwan fishing boats
can export this catch to Europe at a price higher than NT$20 per
kilo, compared with only around NT$10 per kilo for export to China.</P>

in charge of constructing the plant, has requested the Executive Yuan
to provide two supplementary budgets of NT$19 billion and NT$54. 3
billion, causing the original budget to balloon to NT$243 billion and
making the plant "the most expensive nuclear power plant in the
world."</P>
      <P>She said Taipower has acknowledged that even if the
2,700-megawatt nuclear power plant is in operation for 40 years, it
will not be able to recover the construction cost, let alone the cost
of nuclear waste disposal and subsequent expenses to retire the plant
when it becomes obsolete.</P>
      <P>The DPP government indicated recently that it will not abandon
the project or purposely delay its construction. The Ministry of
Economic Affairs has said it regards the plant as essential to
Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>In October 2000, the DPP government suspended construction of the
plant under its policy of a nuclear-free Taiwan, resulting in
billions of dollars-worth of losses. The work resumed 110 days later
after political wrangling among the ruling and opposition parties.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
heightened its travel advisory for Chad Thursday as the political
situation in the north-central African country remains precarious
after a recent rebel attack on its capital.</P>
      <P>The MOFA issued a "yellow" travel advisory for Chad earlier this
year and raised the advisory to the more serious "orange" level
Thursday, urging local people to refrain from traveling to the
country for the time being.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said that although Chadian government troops have
crushed rebel forces that attacked N'Djamena recently, the country's
political situation remains tricky, with a presidential election
scheduled to take place May 3.</P>
      <P>For safety concerns, the officials said, local people should
postpone any non-essential Chad-bound travel plans until after the
political situation stabilizes.</P>
      <P>Chad is one of Taiwan's diplomatic allies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CONCERNED OVER POSSIBLE U.S.-CHINA ALIGNMENT AGAINST TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 20 (CNA)
(By Flor  Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As China and the United States are seeking
cooperation in handling controversial global issues and both wish to
maintain the current policy framework regarding the Taiwan Strait, it
is worrisome the two countries' leaders might work together in an
upcoming meeting to contain Taiwan, a lawmaker of the opposition
People First Party (PFP) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Hsien-yau, who concurrently chairs the PFP's
policy research center, expressed worry that U.S.
President George W.
Bush may join forces with Chinese President Hu Jintao to deal
with Taiwan in a meeting at the White House scheduled for that day,
after President Chen Shui-bian announced in late February the
cessation of the National Unification Council -- a move that drew
criticism from both Washington and Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chang forecast that Bush and Hu will reiterate their "one China"
and anti-Taiwan independence positions at the meeting.</P>
      <P>It would be greatly damaging to Taiwan if Bush -- when commenting
on cross-strait policy -- were to focus only on the three communiques
signed between Washington and Beijing and fail to mention the Taiwan
Relations Act during his meeting with Hu, Chang said.</P>
      <P>As China has responded to the U.S. call for reducing its huge
trade surplus in bilateral trade and for stepping up law enforcement
in order to protect U.S. intellectual property rights, Chang
speculated that the two sides are likely to express hope for
maintaining the current cooperation framework, further limiting
Taiwan's role in the development of Washington-Beijing ties.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said
Thursday the phrase "foreign spouses" will continue to be used in
official and legal documents, as the term is now commonly used in
local society.</P>
      <P>The decision was reached after the ministry called a meeting of
relevant government officials, academics, experts and representatives
from foreign spouses associations and advocacy groups.</P>
      <P>The ministry held the meeting in response to calls from some
social quarters that a more circumspect term should be coined to
replace the phrase "foreign spouses" because the word "foreign" seems
to distance them from Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>After open and candid discussions at the two-hour meeting, MOI
officials said it was decided that the term "foreign spouses" will
continue to be in use because they said it does not imply any
discrimination.</P>
      <P>The officials said the term "foreign spouses" refers to foreign
citizens as well as people from China, Hong Kong and Macau who marry
Taiwan citizens, regardless of their gender.</P>
      <P>As some social groups like to use phrases such as "new
immigrants, " "new residents, " "daughters-in-law of Taiwan " and
"international immigrants" to refer to the foreign mates of local
citizens, the officials said the ministry will respect their choices.</P>
      <P>The officials also called on local people to always help foreign
spouses adapt to local lifestyles and customs, while respecting the
cultures and habits of their countries of origin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT: CHINA'S GROWING INFLUENCE CHANGES STATUS QUO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April  20  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said in an
article published in the Wall Street Journal Thursday that China's
growing influence in terms of its economic and military strength is
gradually changing the status quo in the Taiwan Strait in a way that
his government "cannot afford to ignore."</P>
      <P>"While we may not be able to curb this trend completely, we still
strive to maintain a peaceful status quo in the Taiwan Strait, " he
said, adding that as Taiwan's president, he is trying to find ways to
prevent this trend from hurting the interests of his people.</P>
      <P>Chen criticized Beijing for refusing to interact with Taiwan's
democratically elected government during the past six years, while
inviting Taiwan's opposition party leaders to visit China, in an
attempt to undermine the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>"These visits were very cynically timed to draw attention away
from the passage of China's so-called 'Anti-Secession Law,'" he said.</P>
      <P>He deplored the fact that despite criticism from the
international community and strong public opposition in Taiwan,
Beijing passed the law to codify non-peaceful means against Taiwan,
unilaterally changing the status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated that the DPP government is willing to have direct
dialogue with Beijing without preconditions to work out peaceful
solutions to bilateral problems.</P>
      <P>"Meaningful reduction of the military threat and dealing directly
with Taiwan's duly elected leaders would be a good foundation on
which to start," he said.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that China has deployed more than 800
missiles targeting Taiwan and that the number is increasing by 100 to
125 per year.</P>

Ogi, an influential Japanese politician, exchanged views on the

    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush
reiterated that the United States does not support independence for
Taiwan during his meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao Thursday
at the White House.</P>
      <P>Bush told a news conference after the meeting that although he
and Hu do not agree on everything, they are able to discuss their
disagreements "in a spirit of friendship and cooperation."</P>
      <P>"We spent time talking about Taiwan, and I assured the president
my position has not changed. I do not support independence for
Taiwan," Bush said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Hu noted that Bush said during the meeting that he
hopes the Taiwan authorities do not make any moves to change the
status quo which would upset the China-U.S. relationship.</P>
      <P>"We have the utmost sincerity, and we will do our utmost with all
sincerity to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification. This
being said, we will by no means allow Taiwan independence, " Hu said,
reiterating China's long-standing position that "Taiwan is an
inalienable part of Chinese territory."</P>
      <P>"We maintain consistently that under the basis of the one-China
principle, we are committed to the safeguarding of peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait and to the promotion of the
improvement and development of cross-strait relations," Hu said.</P>
      <P>Addressing an arrival ceremony for Hu held earlier that day at
the South Lawn of the White House, Bush said the United States
maintains its one-China policy based on the three U.S.-China
communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act.</P>
      <P>"We oppose unilateral changes in the status quo in the Taiwan
Strait by either side, and we urge all parties to avoid
confrontational or provocative acts. And we believe the future of
Taiwan should be resolved peacefully," Bush said.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a brief
statement that Bush's remarks indicate that the United States'
long-standing position on cross-strait issues has remained unchanged.</P>

      <P>For decades, scientists have used mass spectrometry to weigh
minute substances, such as molecules or particles, but it has never
been successfully applied to "larger" ones like cell or viruses.</P>
      <P>A mass spectrometer weighs a substance in the following way.
First, a laser is used to turn the sample into ionized particles,
which are then accelerated in a vacuum toward a detector. Then,
researchers can determine the weight of the particles by recording
the time elapsed between the particles departing and reaching the
detector. By targeting characteristic particles of the viral coat
protein, the virus can be identified by matching the results to
entries in genetic databases.</P>
      <P>However, when it comes to micron-sized substances without rigid
walls, like cells or viruses, the ionizing process will usually
destroy them, which makes it impossible to weigh them.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the team at Academia Sinica refined their mass
spectrometer by targeting the laser on a silicon wafer to cause
acoustic waves, which can "push" the cell or virus out of the sample
without destroying it. Then, a quadruple ion trap is applied to catch
the subject of interest for mass determination.</P>
      <P>The team's research paper, titled "Laser-Induced Acoustic
Desorption Mass Spectrometry of Single Bioparticles," was accepted by
the renown periodical "Angewandte Chemie" as "very important," a term
it has used for only 5 percent of all the research papers it has
published.</P>
      <P>Dr. Chang Huan-Cheng, the head of the team, said they have
already used the method to measure several kinds of cells and
viruses, including erythrocyte, vaccinia virus, Escherichia coli, and
some cancer cells. Once they finish the study of several other cells
and viruses, he said, the complete database can be applied to medical
practice, helping doctors to identify the real pathogen of epidemics.</P>
      <P>Chang explained that in practice, if there is any epidemic,
doctors can now isolate the suspected pathogen and weigh it, then
compare the weight to the entries in the database to identify what it
is.</P>
      <P>"Since the database will also show the normal weight of a
particular cell, the doctor can also identify if there is cancer
metastasis by noticing that the weight of certain cells are
changing," Chang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) legislator said Friday that both Taiwan and China should change
their national designations to avoid confusion or fiascos from
occurring on international occassions again.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a meeting at the Legislative Yuan on affairs of
the state, DPP Legislator Chen Chung-hsin said that when U.S.
President George W. Bush met with his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao
on the lawn outside the White House for an official meeting Thursday,
the People's Republic of China was incorrectly referred to by the
announcer as the Republic of China prior to the playing of the
national anthems of the United States and China.</P>
      <P>Chen attributed the fiasco to the fact that Taiwan's official
title of "The Republic of China" is too similar to China's.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that China and Taiwan discard their confusing
national designations altogether and simply call themselves China and
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Lo Chih-ming from the Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU), which together with the DPP forms the "pan-green camp, "
said that the mistake by the announcer at the White House reflects
the fact that it is imperative and justifiable that Taiwan change its
official name.</P>
      <P>The "pan-green" legislators also unanimously condemned the
"Bush-Hu" meeting for downgrading Taiwan's status.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Mark Ho claimed that while talking about Taiwan
during their meeting, the two heads of state actually voiced
different positions on the Taiwan issue, with Bush stressing that
cross-Taiwan Strait issues should be solved peacefully and the
cross-strait status quo should not be changed, and Hu stressing that
Taiwan is "an inalienable part of China"</P>

      <P>The Chung Hua Institution for Economic
Research (CIER) on Friday revised its forecast for Taiwan's economic
growth to 5.39 percent for the first quarter of this year and 4.17
percent for the whole of 2006 in light of the country's excellent
foreign trade performance.</P>
      <P>The think tank predicted that economic growth will reach 4.55
percent for the second quarter of this year, 3.74 percent for the
third quarter and 3.09 percent for the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's export orders are valued at more than US$20
billion per month and have posted a growth rate of over 20 percent
for seven consecutive months, the country's foreign trade is expected
to continue to see strong growth this year, according to the CIER.</P>
      <P>It projected that private-sector spending will expand by a
moderate 3.12 percent this year, owing to the negative growth in
salaries and the problem of "credit card slaves, " which has prompted
local banks to tighten their credit services.</P>
      <P>The CIER predicted that domestic investment will rise 4.57
percent this year, up 4.1 percentage points over last year.</P>
      <P>Exports are expected to reach US$215.51 billion this year and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian expressed the
hope Friday that he can meet with opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou again before long to facilitate Taiwan's
pursuit of sustainable economic, environmental and social
development.</P>
      <P>Speaking duing a ceremony marking the opening of a national
sustainable development conference, Chen said that he remains open
regarding the time and venue for a second Chen-Ma meeting.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was enormously impressed and grateful to Ma for his
explanations made during their first meeting held at the Presidential
Office April 3 about his U.S. trip in March and his suggestions to
the government.</P>
      <P>For his part, Ma said he has let the Presidential Office know
that he will not attend a second Chen-Ma meeting.</P>
      <P>He added that the country has come to understand clearly the
president's stance on several key issues via the televised Chen-Ma
meeting. For other matters in the future, he said, should they be
matters concerning the Executive Yuan or the Legislative Yuan, they
should be referred to the two yuans for resolution, tacitly implying
that a second Chen-Ma meeting is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen said earlier
this week that he wrote to KMT Secretary-General Chan Chun-po days
earlier about the new invitation but had not received any response.</P>
      <P>The holding of a second Chen-Ma meeting has been the hope of
Chen, the DPP hierarchy and the DPP legislative caucus since April 3,
when Chen met Ma at the Presidential Office, Tan Sun Chen said.</P>
      <P>However, he continued, the KMT has been cool in its reaction to
the notion of a second meeting, which he claimed would be conducive
to boosting harmony between the ruling and opposition parties.
Harmonious engagement between the parties is the mainstream opinion
in Taiwan, he said, adding that the first Chen-Ma meeting was also
received favorably by the U.S. administration.</P>
      <P>During the first, unprecedented Chen-Ma meeting, the two men
talked about a wide range of topics, including the definition of the
controversial "1992 consensus" and the cessation of the National
Unification Council and its guidelines.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, President Chen's approval ratings soared by 11
percentage points, while Ma's dropped by nine percentage points,

    <TEXT>
      <P>In Taiwan's political environment,
elections decide everything, said a former Taiwan lawmaker and
governmental official Thursday.</P>
      <P>However, "elections aren't everything in a democratic nation, "
Lou Wen-chia said in an interview with CNA on the campus of Harvard
University. Lou was once praised as the best-performing lawmaker at
the Legislative Yuan by journalists stationed there.</P>
      <P>"People's self-discipline and knowledge of democracy, as well as
a culture of democracy, are the crucial factors that decide the
quality of democracy," Luo said, claiming that these are things that
Taiwan lacks.</P>
      <P>Luo said that Taiwan does not lack an election system, which he
claimed is even more complete than that in the United States.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan does not lack freedom of speech, either; what Taiwan's
democracy does not have is quality, " Lou said, underscoring that
what Taiwan needs now is to upgrade its democratic practices and
political culture.</P>
      <P>Luo arrived at Harvard University two weeks ago to pursue further
education in his capacity as an international scholar of the Fairbank
Center for East Asian Research.</P>
      <P>During his planned eight-month stay at Harvard, Luo said that he
intends to engage in research on cross-Taiwan Strait relations,
explaining that he wants to know the political perspectives and the
possible political structure of Taiwan in the next five or 10 years.</P>
      <P>Luo, one of the most popular members of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, was defeated by Chou Hsi-wei of the opposition
Kuomintang in the Taipei County magistrate election last December.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the setback, the 40-year-old politician said that "it
was no more than an election; life still goes on."</P>
      <P>Luo said his life on campus is relaxing, although his schedule is
filled, with reading, surfing the Internet, jogging and chatting with
Taiwanese students. "Suddenly I've become a lot younger," he said.</P>
      <P>Mentioning his experience of going to see a professional baseball
game in Boston and witnessing the passion the American people have
for sports, Luo said he wonders why Taiwan uses all of its energy on
vicious political conflicts.</P>

      <P>The meeting between U.S. President George
W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao can be seen as marking an end
to the two countries' dealings with the controversy surrounding
President Chen Shui-bian's cessation of the National Unification
Council (NUC), Legislator Su Chi of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) claimed Friday.</P>
      <P>Su, a former chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made the
remarks after the Bush-Hu meeting at the White House a day earlier
during which Bush reiterated that the U.S. does not support
independence for Taiwan, while Hu claimed that Taiwan is an
inalienable part of Chinese territory and that China will promote
peaceful unification with the utmost sincerity.</P>
      <P>In contrast to the serious concerns expressed by both China and
the United States following Chen's February "ceasing of the function"
of the NUC, a body that envisioned eventual unification with China,
Su said that remarks made by Bush and Hu Thursday were "quite
standardized."
</P>
      <P>Su said that as he expected, they did not use harsh words.</P>
      <P>He said the U.S. accorded KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou with
high-level treatment during his visit to the United States last
month. The U.S. also expressed the hope for stable cross-strait
relations to let the Taiwan people know clearly where the U.S.
stands.</P>

attaches importance to cross-strait trade, economy and peace, and
even offered 15 "goodwill measures" to Taiwan, according to Su.</P>
      <P>The U.S. and China's way of dealing with Chen's announcement has
been "indirect, " but has "embarrassed the DPP administration, " Su

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian pledged Friday
that the government will continue to enhance social justice and
fairness by promoting tax reforms.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that measures taken by the government under the
reforms include introducing a minimum tax rate targeting high-income
earners and shaping up the retirement benefit program for civil
servants, military personnel and public school teachers.</P>
      <P>"While pursuing economic development, we must not neglect the
promotion and realization of social fairness and justice," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"By the same token, when seeking national development, we must
not focus on economic development only, but we must also pay
attention to sustainable development," he added.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while addressing a national
sustainable development conference hosted by the National Council for
Sustainable Development.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan has a stronger need than other countries to
sustain its development because it is a small yet populous country
with scant natural resources and a fragile geographic environment.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Taiwan should develop its economy on the basis of
protecting its environment and natural resources, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has created a world-acclaimed economic miracle
with the collective efforts of the people over the past five decades,
but that the country has also paid a great price.</P>
      <P>While the over-emphasis on economic growth has led to severe
pollution and damage to the environment, such excessive exploitation
is now meeting backlashes from nature, he noted.</P>
      <P>For example, the over-development of hillside land has resulted
in the loss of topsoil and water resources, with the lifespans of
reservoirs having declined significantly and the problem of water
shortages becoming more and more severe year after year, he said.</P>
      <P>The over-development of coastal land has caused the ratio of
artificial coastline to exceed that of natural coastline in Taiwan,
and the over-drainage of underground water has led to subsidence and
in-flow of sea water, he went on.</P>
      <P>Also, illegal gravel extraction and waste dumping on fallow
farmland are seriously jeopardizing the use of land resources, he
said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, the country needs to seek to improve its
environmental protection to balance the economic development and
enhance the quality of life.</P>

      <P>In addition, Hu also reiterated China's position that "Taiwan is
an inalienable part of Chinese territory, " ruling out the Taiwan
people's option of independence, Yu added.</P>
      <P>Hu's intention to make Taiwan one of China's local governments is
very clear, which the DPP also protested.</P>
      <P>Claiming that recognizing democracy and liberty is the basis for
the two sides of Taiwan Strait to develop peacefully, Yu said Hu
should recognize Taiwan's existence, accept the Taiwan people's right
to choose their future, and present firm promises to promote China's
democracy and human rights so that the two sides can co-exist
peacefully.</P>
      <P>"Democracy is democracy, and there is no debate on this," Yu
said, adding that any movement to harm democratization, religious
freedom and the freedom of speech will be renounced by history. Yu
expressed hope that Hu will not stand on the wrong side of history.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he also urged the Taiwan people to distinguish between
the opportunities and threats from China, claiming that "even
American people will not blindly embrace China" for economic
benefits.</P>
      <P>However, Yu added, some politicians in Taiwan, including
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, have been
"kowtowing" to China under the excuse of promoting cross-strait
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lien recently headed a 170-member delegation of lawmakers and
business leaders to participate in a two-day economic forum held
between the KMT and the Communist Party of China in Beijing, in which
he received a high-profile welcome from Hu.</P>

      <P>The government will support the
conclusions reached during a recent meeting between the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) as long as
they are beneficial to the people of Taiwan and do not compromise
Taiwan's identity, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Su said the government will not resist the conclusions just
because they were announced by the KMT or Beijing, and that President
Chen Shui-bian also shares this view.</P>
      <P>Su was referring to a package of 15 measures announced by Chinese
officials during the KMT-CPC economic forum held last week in
Beijing. These include the recognition of academic degrees conferred
by accredited Taiwan universities, allowing Chinese citizens to
travel to Taiwan for sightseeing purposes and permitting qualified
Taiwan physicians to practise in China.</P>
      <P>Su noted during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan

    <HEADLINE>NUCLEAR PLANTS SHOULD BE KEPT: ACADEMIA SINICA HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Until recycled energy technology matures,
Taiwan will have to rely on nuclear power as long as clean air and
sustainable development issues are concerned, Academia Sinica
President Lee Yuan-tseh said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech delivered at the National Sustainable
Development Conference, Lee, a 1986 Nobel laureate in chemistry, said
Taiwan should continue developing nuclear power in the next one to
two decades and that construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant
should not be further stalled.</P>
      <P>Lee said that so long as radioactive waste is "properly handled,
" Taiwan basically faces no problems as regards nuclear safety
protection, adding that the existing second and third nuclear power
plants should continue to function, while the fourth should continue
to be built.</P>
      <P>He speculated that Taiwan's dream of becoming a nuclear-free
country will probably not come true for another 50 years, when
optoelectronic technology and technologies of solar energy and other
recyclable energy become truly mature.</P>
      <P>After the Kyoto Protocol entered into force in February 2005, he
said, the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has become an
imperative task globally and Taiwan should not slack off in this
effort. Consequently, he said, Taiwan should strive to lessen its
reliance on coal and fossil fuel for energy so as to reduce emissions
of greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>Emissions of CO2 have continued to increase worldwide and in
Taiwan as well, Lee said, adding that per capita CO2 emission in
Taiwan averages 12.4 tons annually, second only to the United States'
19.95 tons and Australia's 19.1 tons, serving a "tremendously bad"
example for the world.</P>
      <P>However, Professor Shih Hsin-min from National Taiwan University
discounted Lee during the conference, saying that all of Taiwan's
nuclear power plants should be closed down immediately.</P>
      <P>Shih pointed out that problems concerning Taiwan's nuclear waste
management are rife, the safety of Taiwan's existing nuclear power
plants remains to be examined and the world trend of reducing
greenhouse gas emissions is by developing recyclable energy and
optoelectronic technology, rather than pushing for nuclear power.</P>
      <P>He called for the government to push for nationwide energy-saving
regulations and come up with policies soon to encourage the
development of optoelectronic and renewable energy, rather than
continuing to build the fourth nuclear power plant.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI COUNTY SCRAPS BOT MODEL FOR BELT LINE MRT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei County's belt line rapid transit
railway project will no longer follow the build-operate-transfer
(BOT) model in view of the corruption scandal involving the Kaohsiung
mass rapid transit (MRT) railway project, Taipei County Magistrate
Chou Hsi-wei said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chou told a press conference that the county government has
decided to build, own and operate its own MRT system after seeing how
the BOT model adopted by the Kaohsiung city government for its MRT
railway project has been used for illegal profiteering by officials
working in collusion with contractors.</P>
      <P>Another reason for the policy reversal is that the county
government wants to ensure the quality of the construction project
and give Taipei County residents a safe MRT system.</P>
      <P>He said the central government has approved the route of the belt
line for the first stage of the project and that the county
government's reversal of its policy will not affect the progress of
the construction.</P>
      <P>Chou acknowledged that the change will cause the budget to rise
by NT$16 billion, of which the county government hopes that NT$3.1
billion can come from a central government subsidy.</P>
      <P>As for the remaining NT$12.9 billion, the county government
estimates that benefits accruing from land development projects
surrounding the belt line will total NT$13.5 billion within 12 years
-- more than enough to cover the added cost.</P>
      <P>Chou urged the central government to support the Taipei county
government with additional funds. He said that if the central
government denies his request, he will appeal to the Legislative Yuan
for help.</P>
      <P>The county government will work out a new budget plan and a
detailed feasibility analysis, Chou said, adding that the entire
project is expected to be completed in 2013.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA ACCEPTS U.S. STATEMENT ON TAIWAN `GRUDGINGLY:' ACADEMIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush set the tone
on the Taiwan issue during a welcome ceremony for Chinese President
Hu Jintao, and although Hu was discontent, he could only grudgingly
accept it, a professor at Tamkang University said Friday.</P>
      <P>Professor Pan Hsi-tang of the university's Institute of China
Research was giving his take on a meeting between Bush and Hu a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>During a welcome ceremony held on the South Lawn of the White
House, Bush reiterated that the U.S. policy toward Taiwan is based on
the three comuniques and the Taiwan Relations Act. The U.S.
opposes unilateral changes in the status quo in the Taiwan Strait by
either side and it believes that the Taiwan issue should be resolved
peacefully, Bush said.</P>
      <P>According to Pan, Bush "thinks that he has had the controversy
surrounding President Chen Shui-bian's cessation of the National
Unification Council well under control" and wants Beijing to stay
calm.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Beijing exercised a great deal of
"self-restraint" after President Chen Shui-bian's announcement of the
cessation of the National Unification Council in late February,
fearing that any "strong reactions" would only backfire.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the United States has continued to use various
ways to display its strong displeasure since Chen's announcement, but
in the end Beijing's hopes of the U.S. "reining in" Taipei were
dashed after seeing the U.S. "saying much but doing little."</P>
      <P>Bush made known his stance on Taiwan during Hu's visit mainly
because he hopes to dispel suspicion on the part of the Beijing
authorities that Taiwan and the U.S. were complicit in the
controversy, or that the U.S. was indulging the advocacy of Taiwan
independence, Pan said.</P>
      <P>But Bush also hoped that China would not overreact or made a fuss
about it, and that the focus of the meeting would not be the Taiwan
issue, according to Pan.</P>
      <P>Pan analyzed that Bush believed the U.S. had done everything
it could after Chen's announcement. This, coupled with the fact that
the Taiwan government has not made any follow-up moves toward de jure
independence, has made Bush think it is not meaningful to "continue
to stall on the issue."</P>
      <P>The U.S. approach is to keep an even keel in its cross-strait
approach, avoiding a tilt toward Beijing and hoping that China
will resume its dialogue with the elected government of Taiwan soon,
according to Pan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RECOGNITION OF CHINA'S DIPLOMAS NEEDS CAREFUL REVIEW: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,    April   21   (CNA)
(By Timothy J. Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Recognizing China's academic
accreditations would require comprehensive review because the move
could impact Taiwan's education policy, job market and even national
security, Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during a legislative interpellation session
in which main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Kao Su-po
questioned the rationale behind the government's refusal to recognize
China's university diplomas.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the rampant use of fake school diplomas in China
is only a minor factor in the consideration of the issue.</P>
      <P>The main cause of the government's reluctance to recognize
China's tertiary academic accreditation lies with other concerns,
including whether the recognition would have a negative impact on
Taiwan's education policy, industrial development, job market and
national security.</P>
      <P>Noting that academic accreditation is done at administrative
discretion, Su said the KMT's inclusion of promoting mutual
recognition of university diplomas in its 15-point consensus reached
with the Communist Party of China at the end of an economic forum
sponsored by the two parties in Beijing last week is not binding to
Taiwan's government.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that Taiwan has a glut of tertiary education
institutions, Su said the Ministry of Education is working on a
supervisory mechanism that would require poorly managed colleges or
universities to shut down. However, he added that the reluctance to
recognize China's diplomas has nothing to do with the glut of local
schools as has been claimed by some opposition political figures.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A student at Pingtung Senior High School
who suffers from the incurable disease of muscular dystrophy, was
presented with a medal Friday by a private charity for his courage in
facing life's challenges.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony held at the school, 18-year-old Lin Yu-wei was
awarded with the Loving Life Medal by the Chou Ta-kuan Foundation, as
well as an iPod from Lin's idol -- Vice Premier Tsai Ing-wen -- who
attended the ceremony in southern Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>Muscular dystrophy covers a group of more than 30 genetic
diseases characterized by progressive weakness and degeneration of
the skeletal muscles that control movement. Few sufferers attain the
age of 20.</P>
      <P>Lin, whose two sisters died from the disease at the ages of 14
and 15, respectively, cannot even eat or brush his teeth without
assistance.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the ceremony, Lin said he felt anger and pain during
his childhood because he could not play with the other children, but
he added that he learned to come to terms with his physical
restrictions, knowing that some facts in life cannot be changed and
that complaining would not make his life any better.</P>
      <P>"Although I can't determine how long I will live, I have decided
to face each day with courage and value it as a precious gift from
God," he said.</P>
      <P>He said he appreciates his parents for their care and his
teachers and classmates for their support, which not only makes his
life colorful but has also become a part of his life.</P>
      <P>Wang Che-hua, one of his classmates, said Lin is the wiseacre of
his class, who broadens the horizons of everyone around him and
encourages them.</P>
      <P>"He helps us more than we help him," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Tsai, who had not met Lin until Friday, said she presented him
with an iPod, which she has begrudged buying for herself because she
knew it would be more useful to Lin than to herself.</P>
      <P>The Chou Ta-kuan Foundation was originally set to present the
medal to Lin in May but moved it ahead to Friday to coincide with his

    <HEADLINE>MAC URGES PEACE, DEMOCRACY TO RESOLVE CROSS-STRAIT DISPUTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Only peace and democracy will resolve
cross-Taiwan Strait disputes, an official of the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Teh-shun made the remarks one day after 
U.S. President George W. Bush told Chinese President Hu Jintao that
the U.S. opposes unilateral changes in the status quo
in the Taiwan Strait and that differences between the two sides
should be resolved peacefully.</P>
      <P>Liu lauded Bush's statement, saying that it conforms with the
United Nations' charter, which says peace is the only way to settle
international disputes and which is also in line with the
government's policy.</P>
      <P>He noted that China has engaged in a rapid military buildup in
recent years despite the lack of an outside threat, which he said has
caused widespread misgivings in the international community.</P>
      <P>The large number of missiles and submarines China has deployed
threatens peace-loving Taiwan and its neighbors, he continued.</P>
      <P>China also enacted the Anti-Session Law, which codifies the use
of force against Taiwan should the nation move toward de jure
independence. This law grossly violates the international convention
regarding peaceful resolution of disputes, he added.</P>
      <P>He said the status quo in the Taiwan Strait is that the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait are independent of one another, the sovereignty
of Taiwan lies with its people and only the Taiwan people have the
right to decide their future.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will not rule out the possibility of developing any types
of relations with China," he said, adding, however, that Taiwan is
already a democratic country and that the resolution of cross-strait
disputes will have to be agreed by the Taiwan people through the
democratic process.</P>
      <P>Hu's statement that "Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's
territory" has been a serious threat to changing the status quo in
the Taiwan Strait and the international community should express
serious concern, Liu said.</P>
      <P>This will help avoid any misjudgment on the part of China and
will help it avoid sabotaging the current status quo in the Taiwan
Strait, Liu added.</P>
      <P>Liu said it is government policy to promote democracy in China
and that the MAC will urge the international community to ask the
Chinese government to lift its ban on certain newspapers, remove
censorship and release all prisoners of conscience.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang
Chih-fang said Friday he believes that China's democratization was
the key issue during a meeting between U.S. President George W. Bush
and Chinese President Hu Jintao a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Huang, who kept a close watch Thursday on Hu's first official
visit to the United States since assuming office, noted that the
issue of China's democratization is the core problem in the
triangular relations among the United States, China and Taiwan as
well as relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We are pleased to see that Bush reaffirmed the U.S. government's
opposition to unilateral changes in the status quo in the Taiwan
Strait by either side, " Huang said, adding that Bush's remarks were
consistent with Taiwan's stance.</P>
      <P>In addition, both U.S. and Taiwan concerns over China's
democratization are also consistent, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that when Hu was asked by a journalist when
China will implement democratization, he answered that he did not
quite understand the meaning of "democracy" as defined by the
reporter, and then he talked about what he described as "Chinese
style" democratization.</P>
      <P>On this question, Huang said it is quite simple for many people.
Basically, democracy means that people can choose their leaders
freely, that people can participate in the policy-making process of
their country, and that both the people and the government can
respect and protect the opinions and the rights of the minority,
Huang added.</P>
      <P>"While China has always said that the 'Taiwan problem' is the
most sensitive issue in its relations with the United States, we
believe that the democratization issue is the core problem in the
trilateral relations," Huang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S MEDICAL GROUP IN PANAMA TO OFFER FREE TREATMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama  City,   April  21  (CNA)
(By Ramon Huang and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China medical
delegation headed by presidential adviser Twu Shing-jer is in Panama
to offer free treatment to Panamanians.</P>
      <P>According to ROC Ambassador to Panama Hou Ping-fu, the medical
group, organized by the International Cooperation and Development
Fund under Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, will conduct five
medical trips to Panama's capital city and its hinterland.</P>
      <P>In addition to free medical services, Taiwan will also donate
toys, clothes, shoes, bicycles, and wheelchairs to Panama's poor
families and the disabled.</P>
      <P>After its trip to Panama, the medical delegation will proceed to
Guatemala to offer free medical services there.</P>
      <P>Twu, a former minister of the Department of Health, said the
delegation forms part of Taiwan's medical services to its diplomatic
allies and that the ROC government may consider strengthening its
cooperation with biotechnology industries in these countries in the
future.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will send 12 medical delegations abroad this year and
donate medical equipment to countries in need, as well as strengthen
cooperation with hospitals and clinics of ROC's diplomatic allies,
Twu said.</P>
      <P>Twu stressed that Taiwan has not been permitted to join the World
Health Organization (WHO) and as a result fell victim to the severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003.</P>
      <P>Although more and more countries are supporting Taiwan's bid to
enter the WHO, Taiwan continues to be excluded from the world
organization due to China's objections, Twu added.</P>
      <P>Blocking Taiwan from entering the WHO is unfair to the health of
its 23 million citizens, and unfair to those underdeveloped countries
that need Taiwan's assistance, he said.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the help of many other countries Taiwan's medical
achievements rank among the world's best, Twu said, adding that
Taiwan is willing to share its medical expertise with other

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NEEDS A NEW APPROACH IN LATIN AMERICA: MOFA OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan needs to explore a new approach in
cooperating with its Latin American allies in order to prevent China
from infiltrating a region where Taiwan has enjoyed international
amity, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>China has had its sights set on Latin America since its
economic boom, hoping to use financial aid and trade agreements to
squeeze Taiwan's dipomatic space in the region, said Jason Ko,
Director of the MOFA's Department of Central and South America
Affairs, at the 2006 Taiwan-Latin America Forum.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must hold its ground in Latin America, where 12 of its 25
diplomatic allies are located, and devise a new approach to
replace the traditional way of "dollar diplomacy," Ko stressed.</P>
      <P>"Our allies in Latin America wanted a brand new cooperation
format instead of simply receiving financial aid. They hope to see
more investment from Taiwanese businesses," he said.
The "Jung Pang Project," an initiative President Chen
Shui-bian proposed during his 2005 trip to Latin America, may be a
good start. The NT$7.5 billion (US$250 million) project is aimed
at encouraging Taiwanese investment in the region and represents a
new diplomatic strategy.</P>
      <P>The project was welcomed by foreign representatives who attended
the annual forum: Costa Rican Ambassador Oscar Alvarez, Ambassador of
the Republic of Paraguay Ramon Diaz Pereira and Guatemalan Ambassador
Jorge Ricardo Putseys Uriguen.</P>
      <P>"I would describe the relationship between Taiwan and Latin
America as 'both getting what they want.' Latin America needs
economic assistance while Taiwan needs help in the political arena,"
said Elisa Wang, Dean of Tamkang University's Graduate Institute of
Latin America Studies, which organized the forum.</P>
      <P>"With a brand new thinking and approach, I believe Taiwan and
Latin America can create a 'win-win' situation," Wang said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Friday he has
asked relevant government agencies to study the feasibility of a pay
raise for civil servants, military personnel and public school
teachers amid an upward spiral of domestic consumer prices.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks during a legislative interpellation session
in which opposition People First Party Legislator Lin Hui-kuan asked
the premier to clarify whether the government is likely to raise
salaries for government employees, military members and public school
teachers July 1.</P>
      <P>The government has usually adjusted its payroll Jan. 1 to
coincide with the start of the new year and has seldom made
adjustments from July 1, Su said.</P>
      <P>As the domestic inflationary pressure is gaining momentum
following a steep 9.2 percent rise in gasoline prices announced by
state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp. earlier this week, Su said he has
directed the Central Personnel Administration and financial
departments to keep a close watch on the local market situation and
evaluate the feasibility of raising the government's payroll.</P>
      <P>"Key elements to be gauged will include the government's
financial status, the general economic situation and the payscale of
major private industries," Su said.</P>
      <P>While the premier didn't rule out the possibility of a pay raise
for all public functionaries and school teachers, Su said the
government should consider its finances before making a final
decision on any pay raise proposals. The timing and the range of
adjustments must also be considered, Su added,

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 57-year-old woman passenger died Friday
afternoon after jumping in front of a moving train at the Chiyen
station on the Tamsui Line of the Taipei rapid transit system.</P>
      <P>Close-circuit cameras show that the woman, surnamed Hsu,
apparently jumped onto the track deliberately as the Tamsui-bound
train pulled into the station at 4:03 p.m.</P>
      <P>The train conductor and station workers managed to carry the
woman from under the train onto the platform. After finding she was
still alive, they called an ambulance to rush her to the Veterans
General Hospital. She died in the hospital despite doctors' efforts
to save her.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. urged members of the public to
treasure their lives and respect other people's right to a
smooth-running mass rapid transportation system.</P>
      <P>Figures compiled by the Taipei Rapid Transit Corp. show that

accidents have occurred after passengers jumped or fell onto the
tracks, resulting in eight deaths -- mostly on the Tamsui Line.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's "Jung Pang
Project" initiative will facilitate relations with Latin American
allies but its implementation requires respect for each ally's unique
situation, ambassadors and experts said at an international forum
Friday.</P>
      <P>The project, proposed by President Chen during a 2005 Latin
American trip, budgeted NT$7.5 billion (US$250 million) and aimed at
encouraging Taiwanese investment in Central and South America. It
serves as a strategy to neutralize China's increasing impact in the
region.</P>
      <P>Paraguay welcomed the project and hopes to be Taiwan's "gateway"
to enter the Latin American market, Ambassador of the Republic of
Paraguay Ramon Diaz Pereira said at the 2006 Taiwan-Latin America
Forum, which was organized by Tamkang University Graduate Institute
of Latin America Studies. Paraguay is one of 12 Latin American
countries that have established official relations with Taiwan, which
currently has 25 diplomatic allies.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can use this project to developing better ties with Latin
American countries. For example, high-caliber Costa Rican employees
will be helpful to Taiwan in developing the Spanish-version of
computer software," said former ambassador to Costa Rica Mao Kao-wen.</P>
      <P>"Every country has different needs, environment and background.
Different detailed plans are needed to make the most out of the
project," Mao noted.</P>
      <P>The US$250 million pales in comparison with the US$10 billion
China invests in Latin America every year, said Juan Hung Hui, a
professor at Tamkang University. This is why Taiwan needs to improve
its relations with China -- to avoid such diplomatic competition, he
said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should cooperate with the United
States in galvanizing China to move toward democratic reform,
otherwise its regional strategic status could be diminished, a local
academic said Friday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chieh-cheng, deputy executive director of the private think
tank Foundation on International and Cross-Strait Studies, was
speaking at a seminar on the just-concluded meeting between U.S.
President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao and its
possible impact on Taiwan-U.S.-China relations.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, bilateral relations between the United States
and China will develop in a more "stable and mature" fashion
following Thursday's Bush-Hu huddle at the White House, with both
sides stressing "common interests" in their interaction.</P>
      <P>As a democratic country, Huang said, Taiwan tends to emphasize
its "common values" with the United States in their bilateral
exchanges. But Huang said Taiwan's government should pay attention to
whether its major policy line -- particularly issues related to
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges -- will undermine U.S. interests.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Huang said, Taiwan's strategic status may be affected
once the United States feels it no longer needs Taiwan's assistance
in shaping a climate or environment favorable to China's democratic
evolution.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Huang said, Taiwan should consider whether
it's wise or beneficial to choose a completely confrontational
strategy toward China.</P>
      <P>In his view, he said, pursuing sustainable economic growth is
most conducive to Taiwan's well-being and best conforms to the
Taiwanese people's expectations. He urged the Democratic Progressive
Party government to adopt a more pragmatic policy toward China.</P>

and China will develop in a more "stable and mature" fashion
following Thursday's Bush-Hu huddle at the White House, with both
sides stressing "common interests" in their interaction.</P>
      <P>As a democratic country, Huang said, Taiwan tends to emphasize
its "common values" with the United States in their bilateral
exchanges. But Huang said Taiwan's government should pay attention to
whether its major policy line -- particularly issues related to
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges -- will undermine U.S. interests.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Huang said, Taiwan's strategic status may be affected
once the United States feels it no longer needs Taiwan's assistance
in shaping a climate or environment favorable to China's democratic
evolution.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Huang said, Taiwan should consider whether
it's wise or beneficial to choose a completely confrontational
strategy toward China.</P>
      <P>In his view, he said, pursuing sustainable economic growth is
most conducive to Taiwan's well-being and best conforms to the
Taiwanese people's expectations. He urged the Democratic Progressive
Party government to adopt a more pragmatic policy toward China.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is willing to listen to public criticism and reflect upon
itself with an open mind, a DPP caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan
said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yeh Yi-jin was responding to a recent poll conducted
by a local newspaper showing approval ratings for President
Chen Shui-bian hovering around 26 percent, with about 50 percent
casting doubt on the integrity of the Presidential Office in the wake
of an ownership battle scandal for a Taipei department store
allegedly involving an aide of the Presidential Office and the
first lady.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that given the present "expose culture," some
news is blown out of proportion by the media, a reference to
a series of sensational "revelations" made recently by political
figures and the media without providing substantive evidence.</P>
      <P>"This has led to the public forming a stereotyped impression of
the government," Yeh said. </P>
      <P>For this reason, the poll -- conducted by the media -- can only be
used as a reference, she said, although the DPP will engage in
serious soul-searching to address any possible wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Wei-cher also said that all DPP members are in

      <P>In response to media queries, Hsu also conveyed Hsieh's message

    <HEADLINE>SATISFACTION WITH SOCIAL ORDER UP SLIGHTLY: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Public satisfaction with domestic social
order in Taiwan has increased slightly -- by three percentage points
-- to 19 percent this month, according to a survey released Saturday
by th Institute for National Policy Research (INPR), a private tank.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted via telephone interview April 16-17 by
the Master Survey and Research Co. at the request of the INPR. It
received 1,069 valid samples from around the island, with a margin of
error of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The press conference was presided over by Academia Sinica
researcher Lin Cheng-yi with the attendance of experts and professors
in crime prevention and law enforcement from National Taipei
University and Central Police University who were invited to analyze
the survey's results.</P>
      <P>The survey, the second of its kind this month, was made in
response to Premier Su Tseng-chang's pledge to improve social order
within six month after assuming office in late January.</P>
      <P>Although the social order satisfaction rate has moved up
slightly, the dissatisfaction rate still registers as high as 77.3
percent, with only 22.53 percent of respondents having confidence in
the government's initiatives, while 65.17 percent indicated
pessimism.</P>
      <P>Compared to the previous survey conducted on April 1, the public
believed social problems such as illegal firearms possession,
kidnapping and circulation of substandard food products have all
improved slightly, while fraud, theft, robbery and drug abuse have
not yet shown signs of improvement.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, more than 83.5 percent of respondents
said they have received fraudulent phone calls in the past month,
28.53 percent have had possessions stolen and 13.13 percent have been
robbed.</P>
      <P>When asked which social problems the government should address
first, the respondents said they hoped the government would
prioritize drug addiction and the drug trade, fraud, and robbery --
in that order.</P>
      <P>Regarding the performance of law enforcement officers, 49.17 of
respondents said they were "too weak" in the exercise of public
authority, with 8.6 percent responding that police are "too
bullying."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR GRANTING 'BASIC DUE RESPECT' TO FIRST FAMILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang urged the public
Saturday to grant the first family "the basic due respect" inherent
in the country's rule of law, and called on legislators and the media
to refrain from making sensationalistic accusations.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks on the sidelines of a ceremony
marking the Executive Yuan's inauguration of a children's Web site
when asked about a recent poll conducted by a local newspaper
showing President Chen Shui-bian's approval ratings hovering at
around 26 percent, with half of respondents casting doubt on the
Presidential Office's integrity.</P>
      <P>Su noted that recently some political figures had made a number
of "sensational revelations" under the guise of whistleblowing, and
that they used the pretext of "reasonable doubt" to point the finger
at President Chen and members of the first family.</P>
      <P>On allegations that the first lady inappropriately received
and used Pacific Sogo Department Store gift vouchers, Su said the
president had categorically denied the claim, saying that if he or
any members of his family had been involved in the gift voucher
scandal, he would be willing to step down.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the premier urged a halt to unfounded smear
campaigns and sensationalistic rumormongering simply because the
president holds "the top [leadership] position and is very visible."
</P>
      <P>With the president willing to put his post on the line if he or
any of his family members were involved in the gift voucher scandal,
the public "should give the first family the basic due respect of
their position," he said.</P>
      <P>As a country ruled by law, political figures should adhere to the
basic democratic principle, the premier said, adding that if there is
any substantive evidence it should be presented to judicial
authorities for further investigation.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, people should refrain from making irresponsible
sensationalistic allegations which only reveal their own political
motivations, the premier added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT COLLECTS NEW VERSION OF NATIONAL ID CARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian picked up the new
version of his identification (ID) card Saturday at the borough chief
office of Taipei's Minsheng community where he legally resides.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied by Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang when
he arrived at the office on Mingsheng E. Road to receive his new ID
card.</P>
      <P>The president was all smiles while posing for an army of photo
journalists with his new card, even jubilantly kissing it before the
camera.</P>
      <P>First lady Wu Shu-jen was not present. When asked how the
wheelchair-bound first lady would receive her new ID, Hsieh Ai-ling,
director of the Population Administration Department under the
Ministry of the Interior (MOI), said Wu could apply for home delivery
service by household registration staff.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Lee said, however, that all local citizens are
required to pick up their new ID cards in person. Comatose, seriously
ill and physically challenged people may be eligible for home
delivery service, but registration officials must see applicants
before handing over the new ID cards -- to them or to their family
members, the minister added.</P>
      <P>Lee said distribution of the new ID card is ahead of schedule. As
of Friday, 6.5 million citizens had already received new ID cards --
35.2 percent of the more than 18.46 million people eligible to
receive them.</P>
      <P>After many twists and turns, population administration offices
around the country began issuing the new ID cards Dec. 21, 2005, with
distribution scheduled to conclude by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>According to MOI regulations, local citizens can have others
apply on their behalf for ID card renewal, but the new cards must be 
picked up in person so that administrators can confirm the
authenticity of ID photos. Nevertheless, population staff offer home
delivery for the frail and elderly, seriously ill patients and those
with major disabilities.</P>
      <P>About the size of a credit card, the new ID has 21 forgery-proof
features. For example, the shapes of Jade Mountain, Taiwan and the
MOI emblem are imbedded images, while a butterfly hologram can be
observed from viewing the card at a different angle.</P>
      <P>The new ID's name column has room for either 15 Chinese
characters or 20 romanized letters, making it more convenient for
aboriginal people to use their indigenous names.</P>
      <P>The government has renewed ID cards before -- in 1947, 1954,
1966, 1976 and 1986, respectively.</P>
      <P>The MOI had initially planned to renew the ID cards starting July
1, 2005 and to require fingerprinting from all applicants, but the
plan was postponed until December after some ruling Democratic
Progressive Party legislators requested a constitutional
interpretation by the Council of Grand Justices over the
controversial policy.</P>
      <P>The grand justices ruled on Sept. 28, 2005 that the
fingerprinting policy was unconstitutional, prompting the MOI to drop
the plan.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday that
former President Lee Teng-hui is covering from a mild case of
tuberculosis and requires a period of recuperation, urging the public
not to disturb Lee at present so he can enjoy a full recovery.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Kuang-ming, a doctor at Taipei Veterans General Hospital
specializing in respiratory diseases, confirmed the same day that Lee
was discharged from the hospital Friday after receiving treatment for
a mild case of tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>The 83-year-old Lee went to the hospital in mid-March after
suffering from fever and a cold, but a later medical checkup found
that Lee had tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>Hsiao noted that after two weeks of treatment, Lee's fever and
cough had receded and the tuberculosis was no longer contagious,
adding that Lee is now well on the road to recovery.</P>
      <P>However, the hospital did not mention where Lee's tuberculosis
had originated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) under the Department of Health (DOH) , refused to
comment on Lee's case to protect patient confidentiality.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lee is only one of 15,000 annual cases of
tuberculosis in Taiwan, Shih said local health agencies will carry
out follow-up epidemiological survey and quarantine work.</P>
      <P>According to CDC statistics, tuberculosis is Taiwan's No. 1
contagious disease, with an annual case load of 15,000 -- more than
the number of AIDS cases and other infectious diseases combined.</P>
      <P>With some 1,000 people dying from tuberculosis each year, the DOH
has been working on a plan to cut the tuberculosis death rate in half

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PREMIER TALKS ABOUT CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS IN U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Boston,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng &amp; Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday in
a speech to some 200 students in the New England area that he agrees
with the idea of opening direct transport, postal and trade links
across the Taiwan Strait because it would be beneficial to Taiwan's
economy.</P>
      <P>The reason the "three links" idea failed to be implemented during
his barely one-year service as premier ending in January, 2006, was
that only the president-chaired National Security Council has the
right to decide on the matter, Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>However, touching on the standoff between Taiwan's ruling and
opposition parties, Hsieh said he believes issues concerning national
security should never be used as a weapon in the service of
party-to-party competition.</P>
      <P>In his speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),
Hsieh spent most of the time conveying his views on how to settle
nasty disputes on cross-strait issues between Taiwan's two major
political parties -- the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
and the opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that there are issues -- such as maintaining the
cross-strait status quo, Taiwan's future being decided by the
Taiwanese, dismantling China's missiles targeting Taiwan, and
promoting dialogue with Beijing -- on which the two parties can
easily produce a consensus, suggesting they would be a good starting
point for the DPP and KMT to defuse hostilities.</P>
      <P>However, the DPP heavyweight also suggested cross-strait talks be
conducted on a government-to-government base, describing the 15
promises Communist Party of China (CPC) General-Secretary Hu Jintao
made during his recent meeting with KMT honorary Chairman Lien Chan
in Beijing as no more than consensus reached "between two good
friends" which would not be legally binding.</P>
      <P>Only results produced in government-to-government negotiations
can truly protect the people's interests, Hsieh underscored.</P>
      <P>Calling for cross-strait cooperation, Hsieh stated that even
without an agreement on the two sides' "ultimate goals" -- China
wants unification and Taiwan seeks independence -- efforts could
still be made to promote friendly dialogue between the two.</P>
      <P>Hsieh recently concluded his short-term research program at
Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government, where he
gave his first lecture in the U.S. April 19. The MIT speech was his
third during his U.S. visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH COULD BE CUT TO 3.79% THIS YEAR: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth will be adjusted
downward to 3.79 percent this year if soaring oil prices affect
exports and dampen willingness to invest, a local think tank said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Analysts from the Chung-Hwa Institution for Economic
Research unveiled the latest economic forecast amid reports that
crude oil has topped US$75 per barrel in New York.</P>
      <P>The researchers said that based on calculations with oil
prices between US$50 and US$60 per barrel this year, Taiwan's
economic growth should be around 4.1 percent.</P>
      <P>But with a looming nuclear crisis in Iran and the decrease in
stockpiled oil in the United States, crude oil has just hit US$75
per barrel in New York, they noted.</P>
      <P>If soaring oil prices affect the global economy -- which in
turn affects Taiwan's export performance -- it is estimated that
exports for each of the two seasons in the latter part of the year
will be cut by US$20 billion, and that the willingness to invest
during each of the two quarters may be cut by NT$10 billion.</P>
      <P>If such is the case, economic growth this year will be
adjusted downwards to 3.79 percent, and the consumer price index will
be upgraded to 2.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the analysts called attention to the fact
that momentum for continued economic growth is gradually losing
steam.</P>
      <P>They said that investment in Taiwan decreased 11.85
percent in the fourth quarter of 2005, a sharp contrast
to the economic growth of 6.4 percent of that season, showing that
investment in Taiwan is slowing down, especially for small- and
middle-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>The analysts noted that 2,810 plants closed their doors
during the first two months of this year, showing that small- and
medium-sized enterprises are still facing difficulties.</P>
      <P>They noted that equipment imports amounted to only US$3.93
billion in the first quarter -- down 18.1 percent from the same
period last year -- and that since investment in machinery
equipment has been a staple for Taiwan, the decrease has
reflected a doldrums trend.</P>
      <P>They said that soaring oil prices may slow down the economic
rebound. This, coupled with some major domestic construction
projects -- such as high-speed rail construction entering the
final stages of contruction -- will all be unfavorable factors that
may slow investment.</P>

      <P>The just-concluded meeting between U.S.
President George W. Bush and Chinese President Hu Jintao showed that
there are many contradictions between the two powers and that
the time is right for Taiwan to furthur boost relations with
the U.S., scholars said at a forum Saturday.</P>
      <P>U.S.-China relations are not expected to change dramatically in
the near future, scholars agreed at the forum which was
organized by Taiwan Thinktank to discuss Taiwan-U.S.-China
relations after the Bush-Hu huddle.</P>
      <P>"I really don't think the U.S. and China will be 'strategic
partners' because the two sides don't share common values, although
they do have common interests," said Raymond Wu, deputy chief
executive officer of the Cross-Strait Interflow Prospect Foundation.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan can combine its interests with those of the U.S., the
two sides' relations would greatly improve, as Taiwan
and the U.S. both share common values of democracy, human rights and
freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>By working with the U.S. to advance "transformational
diplomacy" -- a strategy advocated by U.S. Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice aiming to "work with our many partners around the
world to build and sustain democratic, well-governed states that will
respond to the needs of their people" -- Taiwan will integrate its
interest with that of the U.S., Soochow University professor Lo
Chih-cheng said.</P>
      <P>"Helping China move toward a democratic and human
rights-respecting country serves U.S. and Taiwan's interests at the
same time," Lo said.</P>
      <P>Two major points of contention between China and the U.S. are
coming up shortly, said Lin Wen-cheng, a professor at National Sun
Yat-sen University.</P>
      <P>The Iran issue will be discussed in the Security Council of the
United Nations next week and the U.S. is seeking China's
support. The annual report of the U.S. Treasury Department, which is
expected to bring up China's currency control issue, will also be
released soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER INSPECTS HSUEHSHAN TUNNEL TESTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang tested traffic
control and emergency response systems in Hsuehshang Tunnel Saturday
to see whether the tunnel will be ready for a formal opening in June
as scheduled.</P>
      <P>Noting that 14 years have passed since construction began on the
12.9km tunnel, the centerpiece of the 55-km Peiyi Expressway linking
Taipei to the northeastern county of Yilan, Su said the government
must be assured that all professional requirements and safety
considerations are fully met before the tunnel formally opens.</P>
      <P>Because of the special terrain of Mount Snow -- under which the
tunnel is located -- construction on the tunnel has encountered many
tough challenges. With the perseverance of a large number of domestic
and foreign engineers and construction workers, the tunnel was
completed late last year, but testing on its traffic control system
and emergency response networks is an ongoing process.</P>
      <P>While many have been urging the government to complete all
preparations and open the tunnel by Dragon Boat Festival, which falls
on May 31 this year, Su said the public's safety remains the primary
concern.</P>
      <P>In addition to ensuring that all safety details are up to
professional requirements, Su said the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications must step up a publicity campaign to help drivers get
familiar with the tunnel's special traffic rules and emergency
response measures in preparation for its formal opening.</P>
      <P>The Toucheng-Suao section of the Peiyi Expressway opened to
traffic Jan. 22 this year with little celebrations as it came a day
before a major Cabinet reshuffle. Both Toucheng and Suao are coastal
town in Yilan County.</P>
      <P>With a price tag of more than NT$100 billion, the expressway is
expected to cut the travel time between Taipei and Yilan when it
fully opens to the traffic.</P>
      <P>The Hsuehshan Tunnel, reputed as the "tunnel beneath troubled
water" due to the engineering difficulties encountered during its
construction, was originally scheduled to open to traffic in late
January to coincide with the lunar New Year holiday. </P>
      <P>The plan was scrapped because some construction work inside the
tunnel had yet to be fully completed, including its mechanical,
electrical, fire-fighting, ventilation and monitoring systems.
Engineering experts said at the time that the inauguration of the
tunnel would only be possible by June at the earliest.</P>

C.I.A. Fires Senior Officer Over Leaks 

The Central Intelligence Agency has
dismissed a senior career officer for disclosing
classified information to reporters, including
material for Pulitzer Prize-winning articles in
The Washington Post about the agency's secret
overseas prisons for terror suspects,
intelligence officials said Friday. The C.I.A.
would not identify the officer, but several
government officials said it was Mary O.
McCarthy, a veteran intelligence analyst who
until 2001 was senior director for intelligence
programs at the National Security Council, where
she served under President Bill Clinton and into
the Bush administration. The dismissal of Ms.
McCarthy provided fresh evidence of the Bush
administration's determined efforts to stanch
leaks of classified information.


Wall Street Journal: As Energy Costs Soar, 
Companies Retool Operations

Soaring energy prices have yet to take a big
bite out of economic growth, but already, the
high cost of energy is changing corporate
behavior. In industries from airlines to
glassmaking, companies are curbing usage,
revamping machinery and shifting production
schedules to offset energy costs. 
But most indications are that companies still 
aren't passing on the bulk of higher oil prices 
to consumers. "Some sectors, such as trucking, 
are passing higher energy costs on to 
customers, but most sectors just have to increase
their efficiencies to cover those costs," says 
Stephen Brown, director of energy economics at 
the Dallas Federal Reserve.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao not only
failed to get what he anticipated but also "lost face" during his
not-so-successful U.S. visit, some local international relations
scholars said Saturday at a forum organized by Taiwan Thinktank.</P>
      <P>"If we can't say Hu's visit was a failure, it wasn't a success,
either. China didn't get anything it wanted. And the protest [on the
South Lawn of the White House by a Falun Gong member] humiliated Hu,"
said Lin Wen-cheng, a National Sun Yat-sen University professor.</P>
      <P>The U.S. refused to consider the trip a state visit and
reiterated that it would deal with the Taiwan issue based on the
three communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act, Lin explained.</P>
      <P>China "made a huge investment in the trip but gained little in
return, " said Paul Lin, a New York-based political commentator who
relocated to Taiwan in March.</P>
      <P>Lin said China had made every effort before the Bush-Hu meeting
at the White House Thursday -- including signing a US$16 billion
procurement deal, holding forums with Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) and
setting up an international Buddhism forum -- to ensure the visit's
success.</P>
      <P>China's wishes did not materialize, Lin said, as U.S. President
George W. Bush pressured China on the trade deficit, Iran and
currency control, but would not make any concessions on the
cross-Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>"Obviously, the U.S. was in the offensive mode from the beginning
and made Hu play defense, " said Cheng Tuan-yao, acting director of
the Institute of International Relations at National Chengchi
University.</P>
      <P>"I didn't see any major breakthrough in China-U.S. relations.
Moreover, China's promise to work with the U.S. on major
international issues will come on a test next week when the U. N.
Security Council will begin to address the Iran nuclear controversy,"
Cheng said.</P>
      <P>"Compared to former Chinese President Jiang Zemin's U.S. visit in
1997, Hu did not do a good job this time," Lo Chih-cheng, a Soochow
University professor, said, adding that future U.S.-China relations
will become even more complex.</P>
      <P>"As expected, the Bush-Hu meeting was more symbolism than
substance," summed up Raymond Wu, deputy chief executive officer of
the Cross Strait Interflow Prospect Foundation.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will be an "exciting" market if
relations across the Taiwan Strait improve, a legendary U.S.
investment expert said in Taipei Saturday.</P>
      <P>Jim Rogers, a co-founder of the Quantum Fund, one of the world's
most successful hedge funds, made the forecast after delivering a
speech to local fund managers and stock investors.</P>
      <P>Rogers is known to bear a strong confidence in the vast Chinese
market. He once famously predicted that China would emerge as the
world's largest economy in 20 years. He hires a babysitter of Chinese
descent to care for his 3-year old daughter to allow for her to grow
in an English-Chinese bilingual environment.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan maintains a good relationship with China, Rogers said
Taiwan will definitely be an "exciting" market for investors.</P>
      <P>Rogers also predicted that the current raw materials market boom
will continue gaining momentum in the coming decade. He attributed
the phenomenon in part to China's rise.</P>
      <P>For those intending to invest in China, Rogers said farm produce,
industrial raw materials and tourism-related industries could be the
best bets.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chinese people have been banned free movements for
nearly a century, Rogers said the travel service sector has an
amazing growth potential when their government lifts overseas travel
ban.</P>
      <P>Rogers said he plans to relocate to the greater Chinese region.
In addition to Shanghai, Singapore and Hong Kong, he said Taipei is
also a possible destination.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Rogers gave a pessimistic forecast on the U.S.
dollar's prospect. The astronomical U.S. trade deficit has dimmed the
greenback's value, he said, adding that at least 10 to 12 other
foreign currencies, such as the Chinese yuan, the Singaporean dollar

      <P>"As Harvard is bigger, richer and older, it stands a good chance

research and development in science and technology. Over the years,
MIT has maintained its own 'unique identity' while developing a close

can teach at Harvard and its students can attend Harvard classes and
vice versa. The two schools also maintain a close cooperative ties in
library resources and information exchanges.</P>

Hsieh said, adding that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAIWAN ENVOY TO E.U. VOWS TO DEVELOP STRATEGIC DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael
Ying-mao Kau, who was appointed by President Chen Shui-bian last week
to serve as Taiwan's representative to the European Union and
Belgium, said Sunday that he will strive to develop Taiwan's
strategic dialogue partnership with Europe.</P>
      <P>Kau said the government has decided to increase interaction
between Taiwan and European countries, as the region has become as
strategically significant as the United States and Japan have
traditionally been to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that as the development of Taiwan's relations with the
United States and Japan has become stable and mature, the country
should pay closer attention to and invest more resources in relations
with Europe.</P>
      <P>He added that after he assumes his new post -- probably in June
or July after this year's World Health Assembly (WHA) slated for May
22-27 -- he will strive to implement strategic dialogue between
Europe and Taiwan in a bid to keep Europe's governments fully abreast
of what is going on in East Asia.</P>
      <P>Kau claimed that "most European countries lack strategic
perspectives" toward East Asia, except for their colonial legacy and
history in this part of the world.</P>
      <P>Kau, who has been in charge of Taiwan's efforts to join the WHA
-- the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO) --
over the past five years, said that all European countries respect
democracy and human rights, a situation that provides a "niche" for
Taiwan in terms of cementing bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must let the European Union understand that after the Cold
War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, China's rise is a
tremendous challenge to the E.U. if the rise is not peaceful.</P>
      <P>Kau will succeed Chen Chien-jen, who is set to retire after a
long diplomatic career.</P>
      <P>Kau, 72, holds a bachelor's degree in politics from National
Taiwan University and a master's degree and doctorate in comparative
politics and international relations from Cornell University.</P>
      <P>Before joining the Foreign Ministry in 2002, he was a professor
of politics at Brown University in the United States, chairman of the
Association of Chinese Social Scientists in North America, an advisor
of the Institute of International Relations at National Chengchi
University, and a member of the Advisory Committee of the National
Security Council.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP URGES TAIWAN TO QUIT 'CULTURAL REVOLUTION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition
People First party (PFP) called on Taiwan's ruling and opposition
parties to renounce what it described as the "Taiwan-style cultural
revolution" and devote themselves to developing the nation's economy.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun, caucus secretary-general, claimed that Taiwan is
losing its economic advantages as a result of political instability.
"While China was engaged in its Cultural Revolution, Taiwan was
focused on developing its economy. Now China is focusing on
developing its economy, while Taiwan is engaged in a cultural
revolution," he claimed.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, excessive political populism and election
liberalization have restricted the power of public authorities and
many good policies cannot be implemented because of election
considerations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This is something to which politicians in and outside of the
government, in the ruling party and in the opposition, should give
serious thought," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee said a key to Taiwan's continued economic development is
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, whose smooth development relies on
"dialogue between the top leaders on both sides of the strait."</P>
      <P>Now that China has said it is willing to talk with Taiwan on an
equal footing, Taiwan has no reason to turn down the offer, he
claimed, adding that the government should "give up its ideology" and
seek to talk with China as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>"As long as the dialogue will not hurt Taiwan's interest and
national dignity, it should be held as soon as possible, " he said.
"What is important is to come to a conclusion that will create a
win-win situation for both sides," he went on.</P>
      <P>A media report quoted Lin Yifu, director of the Chinese Economic
Research Center at Beijing University, as suggesting that Taiwan and
China could beef up agricultural and fisheries exchanges.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, if Taiwan's economy remains stagnant, the
coastal provinces of China will catch up with Taiwan in about 10
years, and when Taiwan loses its economic advantages, "it will lose
everything."</P>
      <P>Lee said the top leaders of Taipei and Beijing must talk, because
only when a mutually acceptable conclusion has been reached will
Taiwan's economy gain a new push for further growth.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Japan or the United States could be invited to
mediate a resolution to settle the political differences between
Taiwan and China.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou scoffed Sunday at President Chen Shui-bian for reportedly
accusing the opposition of organizing an "intelligence war" against
his administration, saying that an object must become corrupt first
before worms can emerge from it.</P>
      <P>The opposition leader quoted the Chinese proverb in response to
media questions about his views of Chen allegedly charging the
opposition parties with gathering intelligence against his family and
senior aides in a "soft decapitation" strategy against him.</P>
      <P>Chen's remarks about ulterior motives of opposition politicians
who expose possible corruption on the part of senior Presidential
Office officials or the president's family show that the president is
not a "truly progressive democrat," said Ma.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Chen reflect on himself before accusing the
opposition of trying to expose possible irregularities in his
government.</P>
      <P>When he was an opposition lawmaker, Chen also exposed a lot of
government irregularities, but the government of the time did not
accuse the opposition legislators of "acting in an organized way" in
a bid to bring down the government, Ma continued.</P>
      <P>"It's natural for opposition parties to monitor the government,
so the government should not look at such activities from such a
perspective," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu denied through his aides Sunday a newspaper report that he
is expected to be appointed by President Chen Shui-bian as Taiwan's
top representative in the United States, replacing David Ta-wei Lee.</P>
      <P>Wu described as "sheer speculation" the report, which quoted what
it claimed was a "reliable source" as saying that Chen was
dissatisfied with Lee's ability to "precisely and effectively"
communicate with the U.S. government over Taiwan's policies and thus
has been hoping for Lee's replacement.</P>
      <P>The report also speculated that Lee is expected to be replaced by
Wu and that the vacancy left by Wu will be filled by Shi Hwei-yow,
currently a deputy director-general of the National Security Bureau.</P>
      <P>The personnel changes are expected to be finalized in late May or
early June after the legislature recesses, the report claimed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu also
dismissed the newspaper claim, saying that the Foreign Ministry has
no plans concerning Lee's replacement.</P>
      <P>Lu said Lee has been working hard and has given a commendable
performance as Taiwan's top representative in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the newspaper speculation, an opposition People
First Party legislative caucus whip said the problem in Taiwan-U.S.
relations is not a matter of "who is serving as Taiwan's
representative in Washington."</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun claimed that it is a matter regarding what the
Taiwan leadership is thinking.</P>
      <P>He said it is unfair to blame David Lee for Taiwan's setback in
its relations with the United States. The crux of the problem is the
Presidential Office's foreign policies and cross-Taiwan Strait
policy, he added.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the president is the sole decision-maker
concerning what role Taiwan plays in the international community, as
well as how Taiwan should deal with China.</P>
      <P>With a "waverer" as president, Lee Hung-chun claimed, even a god
cannot do his job for Taiwan in the United States, let alone Joseph
Wu.</P>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) official also commented on the
newspaper speculation.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT Central Policy
Committee, said that what he claimed are "deteriorating" Taiwan-U.S.
relations was the result of President Chen's announcement of the
cessation of the National Unification Council and its guidelines, as
well as the ineptitude and inefficiency of the Democratic Progressive
Party administration.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must strive to build mutual trust with the United States
and the problem cannot be solved simply by changing the
representative, Tseng said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, chairman of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Part (DPP), said Sunday that he will not take
part in the December Taipei mayoral election but will do his best to
invite qualified DPP members to run.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks in Taichung city, central Taiwan, where he
was taking part in a party affairs meeting.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that he has no intention of running for the post of
Taipei mayor on behalf of the DPP, Yu said that his major task now is
to lead the party and carry out party reforms. But he added that in
his capacity of DPP chairman, he will call on prospective candidates
to gain an understanding of their willingness to run, including
former Premier Frank Hsieh and former lawmaker Shen Fu-hsiung.</P>
      <P>In response to a media report that Hsieh said Yu should run, DPP
spokesman Tsai Huang-liang said that Yu does not plan to run but has
instead promised to help the DPP's nominees to run in both Taipei and
Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the DPP would welcome Hsieh to run in Taipei
because he is prestigious and a qualified candidate.</P>
      <P>No matter whether Hsieh or Shen will get the DPP's nomination,
the party will make all-out efforts to help whoever is nominated to
win, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh, who is slated to return to Taiwan later this
month after concluding a study tour at a school affiliated to Harvard
University, will open a workshop in early May in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>But it remained unclear if Hsieh is willing to run in Taipei,
where the voter base of the pro-independence "pan green camp" of the
ruling DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) is smaller than that
of the opposition "pan blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the
People First Party.</P>
      <P>The DPP's Central Standing Committee has recently decided to put
off the party's registration deadline for primaries from late April
to early May -- a move that has been widely viewed as a way of
leaving room for Hsieh to participate.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition TSU announced that it will nominate
Monday Chou Yoh-kow, a TV talk show host, and lawmaker Lo Chih-ming,
to run in Taipei and Kaohsiung, respectively.</P>
      <P>Lo, who also doubles as the TSU's secretary-general, said that
the TSU will not negotiate with the DPP over who should represent the
"pan green camp" in Taipei, as the TSU supports Chou.</P>
      <P>The TSU will not give way to the DPP no matter whether Shen or
Hsieh wins the DPP's nomination, Lo said, although he expressed the
hope that the two parties will work a way out to field a common
candidate to represent the "pan green camp" in Kaohsiung.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HUMAN RESOURCES KEY TO KEEPING TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the face of the rapid economic rise of
China and India, the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) under the Executive Yuan said Sunday that human resources is a
key for Taiwan to maintain its economic advantages.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials cited the example of the United States, saying
that America will double its expenditure on research and development
(R&amp;D) in the next 10 years. The United States, where R&amp;D spending
accounts for one-third of the world total, is one of the most dynamic
destinations for investment.</P>
      <P>U.S. R&amp;D expenses in fiscal 2007 will rise to US$137 billion, up
more than 50 percent from 2001 and the U.S. government has also
launched an action plan to boost American competitiveness by
enhancing R&amp;D abilities, innovation and human resources.</P>
      <P>In the R&amp;D field, the U.S. has transformed from the PC industry,
the Internet and communications technology to nanotechnology,
high-speed operations and new energy sources.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, America will also train 70,000 high school mathematics
and science teachers and hire 30,000 basic math and science
professionals to teach in high schools.</P>
      <P>In order to continually maintain its competitive edge, Taiwan
should enhance its own R&amp;D ability, create an innovative environment
and train its human resources, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the government budgeted NT$50 billion to
implement its "elite universities in the world" program to bring one
Taiwan university into the top 100 in the world within 10 years. In
addition, under a 2005-2008 program, the government will send a total
of 3,284 students overseas to study advanced technologies.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the government is planning to set up a "National
Education Academy" that will be responsible for drafting
forward-looking programs to promote innovative education for key
technologies, the officials said.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Premier Frank Hsieh said
Saturday here that he has no intention of running in the December
election for Taipei mayor and also denied a media report that some
heavyweights of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) have
asked him to run.</P>
      <P>Hsieh denied the speculation that some lawmakers and influential
figures from the DPP traveled to Los Angeles to persuade him to seek
the party's nomination, saying that "it is not the case." He said
that "he is unwilling to vie for the post, at least for the time
being."</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he would not consider running unless "the whole
country sees such a need" or "it is a strategy designed by the DPP."</P>
      <P>Hsieh flew into Los Angeles Saturday after concluding a study
tour at a school affiliated to Harvard University.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was greeted at the airport by officials from the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office in Los Angeles and hundreds of Taiwanese
supporters who chanted slogans encouraging him to take part in the
2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP lawmakers Hsu Kuo-yung and Hsieh Shing-ni said
Sunday in Taipei that Hsieh, who is a former premier, will set up a
workshop in Kaohsiung to help strengthen the public's confidence in
Taiwan's future by holding seminars on school campuses across Taiwan
after he returns from the United States.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a group of reporters in Taipei, Hsu Kuo-yung said
that idea of launching the "Safeguarding Taiwan" activity focuses on
building a notion among the public that Taiwan's fundamentals remain
healthy and sound and that the people should take care of the country
when facing persistent annexation threats from China.</P>
      <P>Although Hsieh called for Taiwan's wider opening toward China,
Hsu Kuo-yung said, however, that "co-existence" is the precondition
of this advocacy and that Taiwan's survival must be guaranteed along
with China's.</P>
      <P>Turning to the future of the DPP, Hsu Kuo-yung quoted Hsieh as
saying that the DPP should move toward the center.</P>
      <P>Although both the DPP and its "pan green camp" partner, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union, call for Taiwan independence, Hsieh was
quoted as saying that each party should walk its own path.

      <P>Ten schools of various levels were honored
by the Ministry of Education Sunday for their efforts to enhance
human rights awareness on their campuses.</P>
      <P>Notable among the award-winners is Sanchan Elementary School in
Hualien County, eastern Taiwan, which was ranked as the most
excellent among all the schools in instilling in its students the
concept of human rights.</P>
      <P>In a citation of the school, the Education Ministry said the
Sanchan school, most of whose students are aborigines, set up a
student autonomy group with its chief elected by the students for one
semester, which exposed the students to the ideas of human rights,
gender equality and the value of life.</P>
      <P>The ministry said the school has successfully taught its students
the vital concepts of a civil society through the autonomy group.</P>
      <P>Lotung Senior High School in Lotung, Yilan County, was honored
for setting up a student meeting in each class and a student council
for all students and a student court to handle students'
misbehaviours.</P>
      <P>The ministry said Lotung has succeeded in teaching students the
ideas of human rights through these self-ruling mechanism.</P>
      <P>National Tatung Agricultural and Industrial Vocational School was
honored for doing away altogether the restrictions on students'
hairstyles and the ban on mobilphones in classes and giving students
a freehand in choosing their own hairstyles and using mobilephones on
campuse without disrupting the classes.</P>
      <P>Through this experiment, the ministry said, students at that
school have learned to mind their outlooks and behaviour out of
self-respect.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Education Ministry, the Public Television
has filmed the ten award-winning schools' human-right promoting
campaign into a documentary which was showed on Sunday's

    <HEADLINE>THSRC GOAL UNCHANGED TO LAUNCH KAOHSIUNG-TAIPEI SERVICE IN OCTOBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) said
Sunday its goal remains unchanged to launch the high speed rail
service from Taipei to Kaohsiung at the end of October, 2006.</P>
      <P>THSRC made the statement in the wake of a Japanese newspaper
report that in the initial period, service will be provided only from
Kaohsiung to Banqiao, near Taipei, while the Kaohsiung-Taipei service
will have to wait until the end of January, 2007 at the earliest.</P>
      <P>The Banqiao-Taipei service will be delayed because of electric
engineering problems, according to the report. </P>
      <P>Without explaining why the problems can't be solved by October,
THSRC said it will "strive to reach the goal of launching the whole
345-km service from Kaohsiung to Taipei at the end of October."</P>
      <P>Informed sources said THSRC is negotiating with Taiwan Shingansen
Co. (TSC) over a contract to install the electrical systems between
Banqiao station and Taipei station.</P>
      <P>TSC is requesting that the job be completed by next January, but
THSRC will not agree to that, insisting that it be finished by
October so trains will travel from Kaohsiung to Taipei, and now both
sides are in a deadlock, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>After THSRC announced last year putting off the launch of service
for a year, its contract with TSC had to be extended. As TSC thought
that it needed time to study the new contract, it did not start
talking with THSRC until Feb., 2006, when penalty on construction
delays should begin. However, the sources noted, THSRC has not raised
the issue with TSC as of now.</P>
      <P>Transportation Minister Kuo Yao-chi has betted her political
future on starting Kaohsiung-Banqiao service by the end of October,
pledging that she would step down that if that does not come to pass.
She has not promised when to launch the full-line service from
Kaohsiung to Taipei.</P>

      <P>Chairman Ma Ying-jeou of the main

handle the issue of nominating a candidate for Taipei's mayoral

mayor, a move that will make pan-blue election campaigns more
complicated.</P>
      <P>"It will be better for Soong himself to proclaim that he wants to

For the second day in a row, more than 100,000 protesters flooded
the streets as police officers, backed by the Royal Nepalese Army,
for the most part stood by and let them pass through what was, even a
day before, the heavily fortified Ring Road encircling the city

under strict orders to keep protesters at bay. By midafternoon
Saturday, the coalition of Nepal's seven largest political parties,

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A labor union leader urged the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Monday to relocate to
the southern port city of Kaohsiung "to reflect current realities and
better meet laborers' needs."</P>
      <P>Chang Hsu-chung, chairman of the Chunghwa Telecommunications
Labor Union, one of the largest labor unions in Taiwan, called for
the CLA to relocate its headquarters from Taipei, northern Taiwan to
the south to better serve the country's blue-collar workers.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a hearing held to push for the CLA's relocation,
Chang said there are around 650,000 blue-collar workers in Kaohsiung
City, which is more than in Taipei County or Taoyuan County -- two
counties known for their large numbers of laborers.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung also has a serious problem with unemployment, making it
pressing for the government to come up with coping measures to help
the unemployed find jobs, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He also argued that the CLA could save a lot of the NT$80 million
(US$2.48 million) it currently spends each year on renting office
space in Taipei if it relocates to southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang called for parties across the political spectrum to jointly
establish an "action alliance to promote the CLA's relocation to the
south" to help materialize a slogan which has been said for years
without any action being taken.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the legislature first freeze the CLA's annual
budget so as to exert pressure on the council to relocate.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAPHIQ ESTABLISHES NEW BIO-DATABASE ON VERMIN, VIRUSES</HEADLINE>

(by Zep Hu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) under the Council of Agriculture
(COA) announced Friday that it has completed a new bio-database on
vermin and viruses.</P>
      <P>The BAPHIQ said that the database --with nearly 5 million entries
from Taiwan, China and several other countries -- can facilitate
cross-examination on possible infections of animals and plants.</P>
      <P>Once the pathogen is determined, the BAPHIQ said, the database
can also help in making the best decision, whether to exterminate the
infected fauna and flora or to use proper treatment against the
specific vermin or virus.</P>
      <P>The BAPHIQ said that the database already contains the following
items -- biological information on known vermin and viruses, an
interface allowing users to compare the known RNA and DNA to the
unknown ones, and a bibliography of past analysis and research on
vermin and viruses.</P>
      <P>The BAPHIQ emphasized that they will keep on expanding the
database to meet future needs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOSPITAL CRITICIZED FOR NOT REPORTING LEE'S TB CASE TO TAIPEI GOV'T</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 24 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that
Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH) had violated the law for
reporting former President Lee Teng-hui's tuberculosis case directly
to the central government and bypassing the Taipei City Government.</P>
      <P>The TVGH confirmed last Saturday that Lee was discharged from
hospital the previous day after receiving treatment for a mild case
of tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>The 83-year-old Lee went to the hospital in mid-March after
suffering from fever and a cold, but a later medical checkup found
that Lee had tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that as tuberculosis is a notifiable disease,
hospitals are required by law to report TB cases to the local
government.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Government will ask for an explanation from the
hospital and will not exclude the possibility of interviewing related
doctors to determine who should take responsibility.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the Center for Disease
Control (CDC) under the Department of Health (DOH) , said the TVGH
really mishandled the matter by not first reporting Lee's
tuberculosis case to the Taipei City Government.</P>
      <P>Although the TVGH's mishandling has not had a negative impact on
epidemic control efforts, the CDC will respect the decision of Taipei
City Government on whether to mete out punishment.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the CDC has checked some 20 people who had
close contact with the former president, and the results show that
none of them have been infected.</P>
      <P>As to the source of Lee's TB, Shih stressed that the incubation
period of TB may last several months, therefore it is quite difficult
to determine the source since Lee, as a popular former head of state,
has close contact with countless numbers of people on a regular
basis.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that Lee has been a good patient, following all the
rules of TB treatment, including temporary quarantine, and the CDC
may invite Lee to serve as the TB representative in the future to
help promote the campaign against tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>According to CDC statistics, tuberculosis is Taiwan's No. 1
contagious disease, with about 15,000 cases annually -- more than all
the other infectious diseases combined.</P>
      <P>With some 1,000 people dying from tuberculosis each year, the DOH
has been working on a plan to cut the tuberculosis death rate in half
within 10 years.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  24  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>There is absolutely no "Chinese
involvement, " "pan-blue alliance" "intelligence organization" or
"soft decapitation" attempts against the president and the first
family, the nation's top investigative officer said Monday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Sheng-mao, director of the Bureau of Investigation under the
Ministry of Justice, made the remarks in reply to a question from
opposition lawmaker Lee Ching-huan at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>A major newspaper reported a day earlier that President Chen
Shui-bian told his supporters in Changhua County Saturday that
allegations of wrongdoings involving his wife Wu Shu-jen and his
senior aides were part of a scheme crafted by the "pan-blue alliance"
led by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Under this scheme, Chen reportedly claimed, his political foes
have been concocting false allegations of wrongdoings involving his
senior aides and family members to tarnish his image as well as that
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Chen as describing the scheme as "intelligence
warfare" bearing the codename "soft decapitation."</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office denied the report as "groundless."</P>
      <P>Lee asked Yeh if government investigators have found any evidence
of Chen's reported allegations about the "pan-blue alliance's"
intelligence gathering organization or Chinese involvement in an
attempt at "soft decapitation, " to which Yeh replied: "absolutely
not." He said his bureau gathers valid information and investigates
facts only, and he called for support for the bureau's operations.</P>
      <P>In response to media questions about the president's reported
allegations, KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou scoffed at the president for
making the allegations.</P>
      <P>Ma quoted the Chinese proverb: "An object must become corrupt
before worms can emerge from it, " and urged Chen to reflect on
himself before accusing the opposition of trying to expose possible
irregularities in the government.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Transit stops in the United States for
President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Su Tseng-chang when they travel
to and from Latin America next month are being arranged, officials
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to visit Costa Rica and Paraguay for state
visits May 3-11, while Su is scheduled to depart in mid-May for Haiti
and several other Caribbean allies, according to MOFA officials.</P>
      <P>The MOFA expects that both Chen and Su will be able to make
stopovers in the United States on their way to and from Latin America
and the ministry is making relevant arrangements toward that end, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen was asked by opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
legislators Monday to declare his advocacy of the "one side, one
country" concept when he makes his stopovers in the United States.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Ching-hua chided Chen for pushing for Taiwan
independence by saying in a speech to a group of supporters two days
ago that one of his achievements as president has been the
establishment of the "one side, one country" concept as Taiwan's
stance on cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lee claimed that Chen's "one side, one country" concept is
tantamount to a declaration of Taiwan independence and added that
Chen should also make the stance known to Washington.</P>
      <P>He called on the president not to advocate Taiwan independence
only within the country, saying that Chen should "declare it loudly"
to U.S. President George W. Bush during his transit stops.</P>
      <P>Pan Wei-kang, a party whip of the KMT legislative caucus, claimed
that by establishing the "one side, one country" concept, Chen was
actually "inviting war" across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Pan claimed that Chen has been scheming with a series of
eyebrow-raising slogans and activities -- including talk about
constitutional engineering and intelligence exercises on crises and
war scenarios -- to draw the public's attention away from the string
of recent corruption scandals involving high-ranking government
officials.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Interior Minister Yen Wan-chin
pledged Monday to step up security control measures at the nation's
international airports following several embarrassing incidents of
inbound passengers slipping past security check points at the Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport.</P>
      <P>Yen made the remarks at the Interior Committee of the Legislative
Yuan during which National Police Agency (NPA) reported on security
control measures at international airports.</P>
      <P>Noting that the airports are the nation's gateways to the world,
Yen said the NPA will review any possible loopholes and make the
necessary improvements.</P>
      <P>Legislator David Huang of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
pointed out that in 2004, a spate of incidents involving Chinese
tourists took place when they fled en masse upon arriving in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since this year, four incidents involving inbound passengers
slipping past security check points at the CKS Airport were reported,
Huang continued, showing that security controls are alarmingly
lacking at the airport.</P>
      <P>At a time when the world is stepping up airport security controls
following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in 2001, Taiwan's security
controls are simply too lax, Huang claimed.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yun-sheng of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party said that although aviation policemen are equipped with guns,
they mostly avoid using them for fear of hurting innocent bystanders.</P>
      <P>For this reason, sticks and whistles may also not be helpful, Lin
said, suggesting instead less lethal weapons such as stun guns,
anesthetic guns or net guns to catch airport runners.</P>
      <P>NPA officials said that since the latest incident involving a
Vietnamese slipping through security checks at the CKS Airport April
18, the agency has increased aviation police deployment contingent on
the situation, installed additional remote-control video cameras, set
up alarm connection lines and automatic power shut-down facilities at
the airport.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Experts and academics in early childhood
education called Monday for the government to review its pre-school
education policy and integrate resources to address the problem that
many disadvantaged families cannot afford pre-school education,
despite being entitled to government subsidies.</P>
      <P>The call was made at a news conference held by the non-profit
Education Reconstruction Front and the Taiwan Provincial Education
Association to report their monthly reviews of educational reforms
the government began 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>During the news conference, the experts and academics expressed
doubt as to the effectiveness of the government subsidy of NT$5,000
(US$156) per school term per child. For wealthy families, the money
is a drop in the bucket, while for poor families, the subsidy is not
enough for them to send children to private kindergarten. Meanwhile,
there is an insufficiency of public pre-school institutues for such
children.</P>
      <P>Ou Tzi-hsiu, a member of the board of the Association of Early
Childhood Education Reform, suggested the government do more than
just throw money at the problem.</P>
      <P>Ou pointed out that the country lacks public kindergartens and is
also faced with an insufficiency of qualified pre-school teachers.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the government has failed to guide the development
of early childhood education, Ou claimed, citing statistics as saying
one-third of pre-school institutes around Taiwan are unlicensed and
are operating as cram schools.</P>
      <P>Her association has found that most parents would rather send
their children to public kindergartens than private ones, Ou added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's rising currency and surging oil
prices are adversely impacting Taiwan's export trade, a trade
association official warned Monday.</P>
      <P>The drastically appreciating NT dollar -- which rose at one point
to nearly NT$32 to the US$1 Monday morning -- coupled with surging
oil prices, is driving Taiwan exporters' spirits low, said Lo
Huai-chia, deputy secretary-general of the Taiwan Electrical and
Electronic Manufacturers' Association.</P>
      <P>Lo claimed that the NT dollar's recent appreciation does not
reflect Taiwan's economic fundamentals but has been caused by
speculation by international fund operators who believe cross-Taiwan
Strait relations might improve in the near future.</P>
      <P>Lo called for Taiwan exporters to take hedging measures against
variables and uncertainties and said that the association -- which is
comprised of companies that together form the backbone of Taiwan's
economy -- will also make the exporters' worries known to the
government.</P>
      <P>He also urged the Central Bank of China to try to keep the
currency stable.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tai Sheng-tung, chairman of the National Association
of Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises, said that should the NT
dollar continue to appreciate, it will seriously compromise the
international competitiveness of the country's export trade, which
will in turn drag down Taiwan's overall economic growth.</P>
      <P>Noting that export trade has been the prime mover behind Taiwan's
economic growth, Tai urged relevant government agencies to face this
crisis squarely and come up with useful policies soon.</P>

      <P>Vice Minister Su Li-chiung of the Council

of the CLA should be taken into account in any decision to relocate
the office to Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su made the statement in response to Chunghua Telecom Workers'
Union Chairman Chang Hsu-chung's call for the CLA to move its
headquarters from Taipei, the capital city in northern Taiwan and the
home of the central government, to Kaohsiung in the south, a move
that he claimed would better serve blue-collar laborers.</P>
      <P>Chang even called for a cross-party "action alliance to promote
the CLA's relocation to the south" and suggested that the Legislative
Yuan freeze the CLA's annual budget as a means of pressuring the
council to relocate.</P>
      <P>Su said that she was open to such a suggestion, but noted that if
there should be a relocation plan, it would have to be made in the
context of the Executive Yuan's government restructuring program.</P>
      <P>Su pointed out that most governmental departments are located in
the north, and "easy communications among departments" should be
taken into account if the CLA is to be relocated.</P>
      <P>She added that the CLA is increasing staff members in its offices
in southern Taiwan, an indication that the CLA values laborers in the
south.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Directorate-General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) show that there are 1.7 million
laborers in Taipei City, 1.32 million in Taipei County, 870,000 in

Kaohsiung City and 423,000 in Kaohsiung County.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS KMT-CPC CONCLUSIONS 'SUGAR-COATED POISON'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian accused the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Monday of "coercing everyone to swallow
sugar-coated poison" by demanding that the government accept recent
conclusions on cross-Taiwan Strait issues reached between the KMT and
the Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>Chen further accused the KMT of attempting to curry favor with
Beijing for the sake of partisan interests and carrying out a
"political struggle" against the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
"under the pretense of promoting economic and trade exchanges" with
China.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while receiving representatives of the World
Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce. He was referring to conclusions
reached at last week's KMT-CPC economic forum held in Beijing, in
which the two parties agreed to promote direct cross-strait transport
links, enhance cross-strait agricultural exchanges and cooperation,
strengthen cross-strait financial exchanges, encourage Taiwan's
services sector to enter the Chinese market, boost cross-strait
tourism and seek to establish a stable mechanism for cross-strait
economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government is not against China or the Chinese
people or cross-strait economic and trade exchanges, but that Taiwan
must not harbor any "wishful thinking" or turn a blind eye to the
potential danger and crisis underlying cross-strait economic
activities.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government hopes to engage in dialogue and
consultations with China but cannot accept any attempts by Beijing to
downgrade and marginalize Taiwan and to deny the legitimacy of the
government and sovereignty of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is part of China's united front tactics against
Taiwan to bypass the popularly elected government, which he said is
unhelpful to the development of cross-strait economy and trade.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that improving law and order,
preventing a bird flu outbreak and boosting the economy are the three
major goals of the Cabinet led by Premier Su Tseng-chang and he
praised Su as handling Taiwan-U.S. relations and cross-strait ties
very properly.</P>
      <P>On reports by local media that Su is at odds with Chen on the
government's cross-strait policy, Chen dismissed these as "unfactual
reports" aimed at driving a wedge between Su and himself.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Su's April 12 announcement regarding the
government's policy towards cross-strait charter flight services,
visits to Taiwan by Chinese tourists and the export of Taiwan's
agricultural products to China was based on Chen's instruction that
the government must take the initiative in cross-strait relations.</P>

      <P>Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman
Chang Cheng-hsiung said Monday that three months is the ceiling for a
president-elect to assume the presidency according to the spirit of
the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks while delivering a report to the
Committee on Organic Laws and Statutes at the Legislative
Yuan on a study of the transitional period between election day and
the inauguration of the president.</P>
      <P>Noting that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) has proposed to hold
the next presidential and legislative elections simultaneously in
January 2008, Chang said that the "two-in-one" election proposal does
not conform with the spirit of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, the next president cannot take
office until May 20, 2008. If the next president were to be elected
in January 2008, the president-elect would have to wait for four
months to take office.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the period between election day and inauguration
day is no longer than 80 days in the United States and between one
and two months in most other countries.</P>
      <P>The longest transition period is three months and 20 days in
Peru, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Under current constitutional provisions, the premier should
perform the duties of the president in the event of vacancies in both
the presidency and the vice presidency, but the period is limited to
three months, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Wu Chih-yang said that nearly 2,000
boroughs will only see one candidate in the borough chief elections
in June, and since the candidate will only need one vote to be
elected, and the candidates will surely vote for themselves, he asked
if the one-candidate boroughs can scrap the voting and counting
process of a poll to save manpower and resources.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the civil servant election and recall law indeed
has not set the threshold for the borough chief to be elected, mainly
because it is a grassroots election and if anyone is willing to
serve, the government is appreciative.</P>
      <P>But the campaign activities will still be held even if it is a
one-man election, Chang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT WARNS AGAINST OPENNESS TO CHINA WITHOUT RISK MANAGEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
openness without risk management toward China could result in high
unemployment, low income and low corporate benefits.
</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting with a delegation from the
World Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce, in which he also urged the
public to pay heed to the impact China's economic rise has caused on
the global economic system.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that China was the world's largest coal and steel
consumer and the second-largest importer of petroleum in 2003, and
that its endless demand for energy has pushed up commodity prices
around the world.</P>
      <P>In addition, China's cheap labor has grabbed employment
opportunities from many people around the world.
</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies complied by the U.S. Commerce Department, Chen
said 13 of Mexico's top 20 export industries saw their global market
shares shrink substantially between 2002 and 2003 due to fierce
competition from China's low-priced products.</P>
      <P>According to U.S. statistics, Americans lose some 400,000 jobs to
their Chinese counterparts each year, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The soaring commodity prices and unemployment rates have
squeezed the development space of both developed and underdeveloped
countries, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He further said although some economic problems are due to
domestic factors, most of the difficult economic situations could be
blamed on China's unbalanced development and unfair trade
competition.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also faced terrible ordeals, Chen pointed out, adding
that Taiwan's failure to properly manage its opening to China in the
past has resulted in a huge capital flow to China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LAWMAKERS URGED TO FREE BUDGETS FOR MAC, NSC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April  24 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged opposition legislators
Monday to free the budgets for the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) and
the National Security Council (NSC), warning that otherwise, their
operations will grind to a halt by late May.</P>
      <P>At a press conference at the Legislative Yuan, DPP caucus whip
Chen Chin-jun criticized the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) for having blocked
a motion to free the budgets eight times at the procedure committee.</P>
      <P>He expressed worry that if the budget freeze is not removed, the
MAC and the NSC will not be able to pay their utility bills in the
next couple of months, let alone salaries for their personnel.</P>
      <P>Chen urged the opposition legislators not to block the motion for
the ninth time when it is reintroduced in the procedure committee
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In early January, the opposition-controlled legislature slashed
the MAC's 2006 budget by 21 percent, totaling NT$96 million, and
froze one half of the approved part of its budget, in an apparent
move to show the "pan-blue alliance's" dissatisfaction with the MAC's
performance last year.</P>
      <P>KMT and PFP legislators passed a resolution requiring MAC
officials to appear at the legislature's Home and Nations Committee
and Budget and Final Accounts Committee to defend the MAC's China
policy.</P>
      <P>The MAC has been at odds with the KMT and the PFP on how to
handle relations with China. In December last year, the MAC refused
to allow Chen Yunlin, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under
China's State Council, to visit Taiwan to attend a cross-strait
economic and cultural forum sponsored by the KMT. More recently, the
MAC further angered the opposition by calling China's "goodwill"
gesture of offering a pair of pandas to Taiwan "a united front
tactic."</P>
      <P>The NSC also suffered a budget cut of NT$8 million, with
two-thirds of its NT$200 million budget frozen, mainly because
opposition lawmakers wanted to retaliate against NSC
Secretary-General Chiou I-jen for masterminding the DPP's campaign
prior to the mayoral and county magistrate elections in December last
year. To remove the freeze, Chiou will have to give an assurance that
the NSC will remain neutral in domestic politics in the future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKER CALLS FOR MEETING BETWEEN KMT HONORARY HEAD, PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Independent lawmaker Lin Wei-chou urged
Premier Su Tseng-chang Monday to meet with Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan to forge a consensus on Taiwan's future ties with
China after Lien returns from a visit there.</P>
      <P>Lin issued the call at a Legislative Yuan news conference prior
to Lien's slated return Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Su should invite Lien to discuss ways to
implement the 15 overtures made by Beijing following an economic
forum between the KMT and the Communist Party of China (CPC) April
14-15 in Beijing. He said Beijing and Taipei should also ink a pact
to assure the implementations of the 15 measures.</P>
      <P>If either Su or Lien refuses to meet, it would be clear that
their earlier remarks about building a better Taiwan are nothing more
than "political fireworks" concealing ulterior motives, Lin claimed.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
government sponsor a national affairs conference and invite KMT and
CPC officials to explore means of resolving cross-Taiwan Strait
disputes and problems.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside the opinion prevailing among DPP members that more
frequent and closer cross-strait exchanges might undermine Taiwan's
national sovereignty, Lin said that the DPP should bravely face up to
China's rise, as the results of various surveys show there is a
five-fold increase in the number of local people who now think of
themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip Chen Chin-jun said that the Executive
Yuan should consider taking the initiative in cross-strait affairs
that require government authority by putting forth complementary
measures to help implement Beijing's 15 overtures as long as Taiwan's
national sovereignty is fully safeguarded.</P>
      <P>The DPP legislative caucus would be happy to see a Su-Lien
meeting, as well as a second meeting between KMT Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou and President Chen Shui-bian, or even a meeting between the
president and Lien, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The central government's savings have been
in the red for three consecutive years and its outstanding debt has
hit a critical level, an academic said Monday.</P>
      <P>Professor Tseng Chu-wei of National Chengchi University made the
remarks in a speech titled "Financial Disciplines and the
Establishment of an Early Warning System on Debts" at a monthly
meeting at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>He described the two main indicators on the top limit of
outstanding debt as the "macro economics" indicator and the
"financial stability" indicator.</P>
      <P>He said that based on the ratio of budget surplus, most cities in
Taiwan, including Taipei and Kaohsiung, are showing yellow lights,
which is "tolerable" for the financial stability indicator. Only
Penghu, Chiayi, Taichung, Kinmen and Lienchiang counties are showing
"white" or safe lights, he added.</P>
      <P>The macro economics indicator is divided into two parts --
government savings and domestic net investment, while the financial
stability indicator is assessed by budget shortfalls and the surplus
ratios of the government's key budgets.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the savings of the central government were negative
for three years in a row starting from 2001, something that had never
happened before 1999. He noted that the 2001-2003 debts were NT$185.6
billion, NT$131.6 billion, and NT$50.4 billion, respectively,
indicating that the government is a net borrower of resources.</P>
      <P>Domestic net investment decreased for the five consecutive years
from 1999 to 2003, although government savings during the same time
did not, so the net investment indicator remained at a "white" or
safe level, he said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he warned that a warning light could flash for the
net investment indicator if the government's financial situation does
improve.

    <HEADLINE>DOH SAYS HEPATITIS-B VACCINE EFFECTIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has no
doubt about the protective power of hepatitis-B vaccine and will not
advise that people get additional shots, a DOH official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the DOH's Center for
Disease Control (CDC) , made the remarks amid reports that a
15-year-old teenager was recently diagnosed with acute hepatitis-B
despite having received four shots previously.</P>
      <P>Shih said that cases of people being infected with hepatitis-B
after receiving vaccinations are rare and that the center will
investigate the case.</P>
      <P>He noted that the CDC had previously commissioned National Taiwan
University for a study showing that at the most conservative
estimate, 20 percent of vaccinated newborns will lose the antibodies
in between 15 and 18 years.</P>
      <P>But whether this means that the protective power of the vaccines
is undermined will still have to be studied, he went on.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's public health environment has been upgraded
substantially, greatly reducing the hazards of the virus.</P>
      <P>Reported cases of acute hepatitis-B have not seen a dramatic
increase in recent years, Shih said, and Taiwan's achievement in
preventing the disease has been recognized internationally.</P>
      <P>Therefore, a vaccination consultation committee has concluded
that there is no need for people to get additional shots, he added.</P>
      <P>But medical staff or families that have members who are
hepatitis-B virus carries are still advised to consult with doctors
to see if they still have antibodies, CDC officials said. Even if
tests show negative, they can still get an additional shot at their
own expenses with the consent of their doctors, the officials added.</P>
      <P>They also said that in addition to getting shots, the public
should refrain from hazardous behavior such as unsafe sex or sharing
needles and razors. The officials also described getting tattoos or
piercings as "hazardous behavior."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will evacuate families of
the country's diplomatic and technical personnel from the Solomon
Islands if turmoil in the Pacific nation does not improve by April
28, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA spokesman Michel Lu, only about 10 people would
be affected in the event of an evacuation.</P>
      <P>Lu said he believes the situation in the Solomon Islands will
soon be brought under control because Australia and New Zealand have
increased their peace-keeping presence there.</P>
      <P>In response to China's claim that it will protect the safety of
all ethnic Chinese in the Solomon Islands -- including Taiwanese,
Hong Kong and Macau expatriates, Lu said Taiwan has an embassy in the
Solomon Islands and does not need any help from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Riots broke out in the Solomon Islands last week following the
election of Snyder Rini as prime minister, amid rumors the election
was swayed by influence from Taiwan or China.</P>
      <P>With rioters targeting ethnic Chinese businesses because they
were believed to be backing Rini, China has evacuated the country's
expatriates from the Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>Taiwan issued a travel alert Friday advising its people to
postpone their plans to visit the Solomon Islands for sightseeing or
business purposes.</P>
      <P>MOFA statistics show there are approximately 1,000 ethnic Chinese
in the Solomon Islands. While most of these ethnic Chinese are from
Hong Kong and China's Guangdong province, there are also some
immigrants from Southeast Asia and Chinese citizens who work there.
Of these ethnic Chinese, around 500 have obtained Solomon
citizenship. There are less than 20 Taiwanese expatriates in the
Pacific nation, according to the MOFA.</P>

single-month highs in March.</P>
      <P>Export orders in March for information and communications
products increased 50.08 percent year-on-year to US$1.78 billion

      <P>Puli township in central Taiwan's Nantou

      <P>Puli has also fixed the 10th day of each month as the township's

Japanese style to serve as a social gathering place for potential

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) said Monday
the requirement for visitors from China to have their fingerprints
taken upon arrival should be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Since the "fingerprinting" regulation is prescribed in the newly
revised Statute Governing the Relations between the People of the
Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, MOJ officials said they look
forward to its speedy implementation.</P>
      <P>The officials made the call during a meeting held by the Mainland
Affairs Council, in which the MOJ presented a report on the
prevention of criminal activities by people from China.</P>
      <P>At present, certain categories of Chinese citizens, including
professionals and technicians, can visit Taiwan. The newly revised
statute on cross-strait exchanges requires fingerprinting for them,
but the requirement has not been implemented because some
complementary measures have yet to be fleshed out.</P>
      <P>As the government is preparing to open the door for ordinary
Chinese citizens to sightsee in Taiwan, the officials said they will
push for a further law revision to require fingerprinting for Chinese
tourists as well as Chinese fishery workers aboard Taiwanese fishing
boats and seized illegal Chinese immigrants.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the lack of a databank on personal
information of Chinese people makes it difficult to investigate
crimes involving Chinese visitors, posing a major risk to local law
and order.</P>
      <P>As no personal data such as fingerprints, DNA files or criminal
records of Chinese visitors are available, it is very difficult for
investigation and police authorities to nab Chinese criminals here,
no matter whether they entered Taiwan legally or illegally, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The MOJ has, through the Taiwan High Court, notified local
district courts and prosecutors, if backed by solid evidence, to
detain or ask for jail terms for Chinese people who commit serious
crime in Taiwan, they noted.</P>
      <P>According to MOJ statistics, from 2001 to 2005, crimes
perpetrated by Chinese people in Taiwan were mainly related to
document forgery and violations of national security.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators from the "pan-green" camp
proposed Monday an amendment to a law with the aim of barring
businesses from discriminating against people based on age.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lu Tien-lin of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and his colleague David Huang of the Taiwan Solidarity Union made the
proposal to the Committee on Public Health, Environment and
Social Welfare at the Legislature Yuan when it was discussing
revisions to the Employment Service Act.</P>
      <P>Lu said that government statistics showed the jobless rate among
those aged 45-64 was 3.2 percent in 2004, compared to 2.92 percent
three years earlier.</P>
      <P>He said that during the same period, the jobless rate of those
aged 24-44 declined to 3.97 percent from 4.17 percent, indicating
that the unemployment situation has deteriorated for the middle-aged
and elderly.</P>
      <P>Noting that more and more countries have proposed bills against
age discrimination in employment, he said that Taiwan should
also revise its laws in line with the global trend.</P>
      <P>Huang proposed that the employment service law be amended, saying
that in addition to barring discrimination in hiring based on factors
of race, class, language, disability or gender, age should also be
included.</P>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs Vice Minister Su Li-Chiung said

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Science Council (NSC) said
Monday it was cooperating with prosecutors in an investigation of
suspected irregularities in awarding a contract for reducing train
vibrations at the southern Taiwan science park.</P>
      <P>Yang Hung-dun, a vice chairman of the NSC, said he believes the
council's staff members had acted in accordance with the law and
relevant rules throughout the bidding process three or four years
ago.</P>
      <P>Yang made the comments after Taiwan District Court prosecutors
and investigators searched NSC offices and left with boxes of
documents about the council's decision to select Hung Hua Engineering
Co. to carry out the NT$8.05 billion project.</P>
      <P>The project was necessary because the high-speed railway will
pass through the park, which is designed to accommodate high-tech
companies including top-notch chip makers who are sensitive to
vibrations over 48 decibels.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors said they have been investigating the case after some
lawmakers suspected irregularities may have occurred when the NSC was
awarding the contract.</P>
      <P>The NSC set a two-phase schedule to choose the best contractor
for the project. First, all contractors must submit a feasibility
proposal, which needs to be supported by lab evidence. Second,
eligible competitors must submit an engineering project to achieve
the stated purpose.</P>
      <P>Yang said the contract had been awarded and that construction is
expected to reach completion in August. The controversy may have been
raised by the company which failed to win the contract, he noted,
much like the controversy over the highway toll collection project.</P>
      <P>"The NSC will fully cooperate with the prosecution in its
investigation, as we believe our colleagues have acted legally and
that judicial authorities will clear up all the facts," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHORT-TERM CURRENCY SURGE HAS LITTLE IMPACT ON EXPORTS: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A short-term surge in the value of the New
Taiwan dollar will not have a major impact on Taiwan's exports,
Taiwan Thinktank Chairman Chen Po-chih said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen said he does not think a rising local currency would cause
any great damage to Taiwan's industries as long as its appreciation
remains a short-term phenomenon, because both local high-tech and
traditional businesses have turned profitable after having weathered
a recession over the past several years.</P>
      <P>Chen forecast that Taiwan's central bank will not rush to adjust
its monetary policy now that consumer product prices in the domestic
market haven't picked up markedly.</P>
      <P>Fueled by a strongly appreciating Japanese yen, the new Taiwan
dollar rose by NT$0.317 against the U.S. dollar on the Taipei Foreign
Exchange to close at a two-month high of 31.992.</P>
      <P>Market watchers said it was no surprise that the local currency
is gaining steam and picking up in value since the Chinese yuan has
continued moving up recently following a White House meeting between
Chinese President Hu Jintao and U.S. President George W. Bush last
week.</P>
      <P>The Chinese yuan once picked up to 8 against the U.S. unit prior
to the Bush-Hu huddle -- a record high in recent months.</P>
      <P>But they pointed out that a gradually rising new Taiwan dollar is
not expected to deal a heavy blow to Taiwan exports as long as it
does not rapidly rise to 32 against the U.S. unit on grounds that
most Taiwan companies should have taken hedging measures to avoid
currency exchange risks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, foreign stock analysts said the local currency will
jump to 30 or even 29 against the U.S. dollar by the end of this year
-- to be sustained by Taiwan's sound economic growth and also fanned
by keen anticipation of a even stronger Chinese yuan that is set to
push other Asian currencies to gain value.</P>
      <P>Golden Sachs predicted the new Taiwan dollar will appreciate to
30.5 against the U. S. currency in a year, while JP Morgan forecast
that it will rise to 29.5 against the U. S. dollar by the end of this
year, thanks to improved cross-Taiwan Strait ties.</P>
      <P>Merrill Lynch, however, called for attention to possible currency
exchange losses that could be made on Taiwan's high-tech exports as a
result of an appreciating local currency.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Chavez Plans to Take
More Control Of Oil Away From Foreign Firms

Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is planning
a new assault on Big Oil, potentially taking a
major step toward nationalization of Venezuela's 
oil industry that could hurt oil-company
profits, reduce production and put further
pressure on global oil prices. Venezuela's
Congress, made up entirely of Chavez's allies,
is considering sharply raising taxes and
royalties on foreign companies' operations in
the Orinoco River basin, the country's richest
oil deposit. Major oil companies like Exxon
Mobil Corp. and Conoco Phillips of the U.S. and
Total SA of France have invested billions of
dollars there to turn the basin's
characteristically tar-like oil into some
600,000 barrels a day of lighter, synthetic
crude.</TEXT>

      <P>International investments, or "hot money,"
will flow into Asian countries to take advantage of favorable return
prospects as the United States' economy is expected to slow down in
the next six months, an academic said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hwa Erh-chang predicted that Asian currencies will likely
appreciate in coming months amid speculation on the appreciation of
China's renminbi (RNB).</P>
      <P>The U.S. dollar lost ground against the new Taiwan dollar (NTD)
on the Taipei Foreign Exchange Monday, shedding NT$0.317 to close at
NT$31.992.</P>
      <P>Hwa, chairman of the Department of Economics at Shih Hsin
University, said that the U.S.' economic situation will slow down a
bit later this year after the bull market of several years runs its
course.</P>
      <P>He added that the market is expecting a more conservative policy
from the U.S. after the federal funds rate reaches five percent, and
international hot money will look for markets elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Moreover, speculation on the Chinese currency will lead Asian
currencies to appreciate, Hwa stressed. He said that Asian
currencies, including the New Taiwan dollar, should continue to rise
as hot money pours into Asian markets.</P>

not serious.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HARMONY IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES HELPFUL TO ARMS PURCHASE: KMT LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should not
provoke Beijing with negative statements if he really wants the
Legislative Yuan to pass arms procurement legislation, a legislator
of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, who has served in many key government posts including
chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council from 1999 to
2000 when the KMT was in power, said if the president hadn't
announced the scrapping of the National Unification Council and its
guidelines in his New Year's address, the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party would have proposed
its own version of the arms procurement plan in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Su told reporters that the opposition caucuses had to abort the
legislation for the arms deal because purchasing weapons at a time
when relations were tense between Taiwan and China would have further
diminished the already flimsy basis of mutual trust.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan's major arms purchases -- 150 F-16 jet
fighters and six Knox-class frigates from the United States and 60
Mirage fighter planes and six Lafayette frigates from France -- were
all carried out during 1992-1995 when the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait were engaged in peaceful dialogue.</P>
      <P>Opposition legislators hope the less controversial items on the
procurement list will pass the legislature at an earlier date, and
the president could help with the legislation's passage if he avoids
using negative comments to provoke Beijing, Su said.</P>
      <P>In the past two years, the opposition-controlled legislature has
blocked two government-proposed bills that ask for a special budget
of NT$480 billion (US$14.9 billion) to buy eight diesel-electric
submarines, 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft and six Patriot PAC
III anti-missile batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the KMT and the PFP have argued that
a 2004 referendum vetoed the proposed purchase of six Patriot PAC III
missile batteries, which would cost NT$140 billion, and that
according to law the issue of buying Patriot missiles batteries
should not be raised again until the end of 2007.</P>
      <P>The opposition lawmakers also believed there was no justification
for Taiwan to pay the exorbitant price of NT$299 billion (US$9.16
billion) for eight diesel-electric submarines. They indicated that
anti-submarine helicopters were the only item likely to gain their
approval.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOJ STEPS UP CRACKDOWN ON GRAVEL POACHING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has directed
local prosecutorial offices to step up efforts to crack down on
gravel poaching prior to China's suspension of gravel exports May 1,
an official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Domestic gravel prices have spiked in recent weeks due to an
imminent China export ban. Against this backdrop, the official said,
local criminal rings may speed up gravel and sand poaching in
environmentally protected areas.</P>
      <P>"Prosecutors' offices around the island should take the
initiative to investigate the gravel supply situation, including
looking into whether any underworld gangs have colluded with business
groups and grassroots administrative agencies in illegally digging
up gravel in off-limit areas," the official said.</P>
      <P>Noting that gravel poaching in certain areas has drawn public
resentment and led to many grievance cases, the official said the
MOJ is determined to take effective steps to wipe out the illegal
operations.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the MOJ has demanded the top
prosecutor at the Taoyuan Prosecutors' Office look into the
environmental disaster caused by long-term gravel poaching in the
Shihmen Reservoir catchment area.</P>
      <P>For years, underworld gangs have illegally snatched gravel from
the upper stretch of the Tahan River, leading to the river's
deformation and the accumulation of silt in the downstream area of
Shihmen Reservoir. The reservoir's high turbidity has resulted in a
chronic water shortage in the Taoyuan area, which relies on the
reservoir as its main source of drinking water.</P>

      <P>The government must play a leading role in

      <P>Noting that any agreement reached between the KMT and the CPC is
not legally binding, Cheng said the government's role in cross-strait
policy formulation can never be ignored or eschewed.</P>
      <P>"There is no point to argue whether the premier should meet with
Lien. The KMT is welcome to send representatives to attend a national
conference to be organized by the Cabinet in June on Taiwan's
sustainable economic growth, " Cheng said, adding that the Cabinet
will be more than willing to listen to the KMT's recommendations on
the development of cross-strait exchanges in various fields.</P>
      <P>Chen also denied speculation that President Chen Shui-bian and
Premier Su do not see eye to eye on cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>"The Presidential Office and the Cabinet maintain close contact
and are in perfect congruence from policy planning through
implementation. There has not been any disagreement between the
president and the premier on cross-strait policy," Cheng asserted.</P>
      <P>As far as cross-strait issues are concerned, he added, the
government must play a leading role and emphasize Taiwan's unique
identity while taking the initiative to address any problems arising

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government must play a leading role in
the cross-Taiwan Strait engagements, Cabinet spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsang said Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who concurrently serves as Government Information Office
minister, was responding to independent Legislator Lin Wei-chou's
call for a meeting between Premier Su Tseng-chang and opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan to discuss the 15
conclusions reached at a recent trade forum co-sponsored by the KMT
and the Communist Party of China (CPC) in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Noting that any agreement reached between the KMT and the CPC is
not legally binding, Cheng said the government's role in cross-strait
policy formulation can never be ignored or eschewed.</P>
      <P>"There is no point to argue whether the premier should meet with
Lien. The KMT is welcome to send representatives to attend a national
conference to be organized by the Cabinet in June on Taiwan's
sustainable economic growth, " Cheng said, adding that the Cabinet
will be more than willing to listen to the KMT's recommendations on
the development of cross-strait exchanges in various fields.</P>
      <P>Chen also denied speculation that President Chen Shui-bian and
Premier Su do not see eye to eye on cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>"The Presidential Office and the Cabinet maintain close contact
and are in perfect congruence from policy planning through
implementation. There has not been any disagreement between the
president and the premier on cross-strait policy," Cheng asserted.</P>
      <P>As far as cross-strait issues are concerned, he added, the
government must play a leading role and emphasize Taiwan's unique
identity while taking the initiative to address any problems arising
from bilateral engagements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOJ STEPS UP CRACKDOWN ON GRAVEL POACHING(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has directed
local prosecutorial offices to step up efforts to crack down on
gravel poaching prior to China's suspension of gravel exports May 1,
an official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Domestic gravel prices have spiked in recent weeks due to an
imminent China export ban. Against this backdrop, the official said,
local criminal rings may speed up gravel and sand poaching in
environmentally protected areas.</P>
      <P>"Prosecutors' offices around the island should take the
initiative to investigate the gravel supply situation, including
looking into whether any underworld gangs have colluded with business
groups and grassroots administrative agencies in illegally digging
up gravel in off-limit areas," the official said.</P>
      <P>Noting that gravel poaching in certain areas has drawn public
resentment and led to many grievance cases, the official said the
MOJ is determined to take effective steps to wipe out the illegal
operations.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the MOJ has demanded the top
prosecutor at the Taoyuan Prosecutors' Office look into the
environmental disaster caused by long-term gravel poaching in the
Shihmen Reservoir catchment area.</P>
      <P>For years, underworld gangs have illegally snatched gravel from
the upper stretch of the Tahan River, leading to the river's
deformation and the accumulation of silt in the downstream area of
Shihmen Reservoir. The reservoir's high turbidity has resulted in a
chronic water shortage in the Taoyuan area, which relies on the
reservoir as its main source of drinking water.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HARMONY IN CROSS-STRAIT TIES HELPFUL TO ARMS PURCHASE: KMT LAWMAKER(repeat)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should not
provoke Beijing with negative statements if he really wants the
Legislative Yuan to pass arms procurement legislation, a legislator
of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Su Chi, who has served in many key government posts including
chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council from 1999 to
2000 when the KMT was in power, said if the president hadn't
announced the scrapping of the National Unification Council and its
guidelines in his New Year's address, the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party would have proposed
its own version of the arms procurement plan in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Su told reporters that the opposition caucuses had to abort the
legislation for the arms deal because purchasing weapons at a time
when relations were tense between Taiwan and China would have further
diminished the already flimsy basis of mutual trust.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan's major arms purchases -- 150 F-16 jet
fighters and six Knox-class frigates from the United States and 60
Mirage fighter planes and six Lafayette frigates from France -- were
all carried out during 1992-1995 when the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait were engaged in peaceful dialogue.</P>
      <P>Opposition legislators hope the less controversial items on the
procurement list will pass the legislature at an earlier date, and
the president could help with the legislation's passage if he avoids
using negative comments to provoke Beijing, Su said.</P>
      <P>In the past two years, the opposition-controlled legislature has
blocked two government-proposed bills that ask for a special budget
of NT$480 billion (US$14.9 billion) to buy eight diesel-electric
submarines, 12 P-3C submarine-hunting aircraft and six Patriot PAC
III anti-missile batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucuses of the KMT and the PFP have argued that
a 2004 referendum vetoed the proposed purchase of six Patriot PAC III
missile batteries, which would cost NT$140 billion, and that
according to law the issue of buying Patriot missiles batteries
should not be raised again until the end of 2007.</P>
      <P>The opposition lawmakers also believed there was no justification
for Taiwan to pay the exorbitant price of NT$299 billion (US$9.16
billion) for eight diesel-electric submarines. They indicated that
anti-submarine helicopters were the only item likely to gain their
approval.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang announced Tuesday
that the targets and routes of the "mini three links" will be
expanded from next month.</P>
      <P>Beginning May 1, the dependents and close relatives of Kinmen and
Matsu residents will be allowed to travel across the Taiwan Strait
via the "mini three links," Su said.</P>
      <P>Also, a new route between Kinmen and Quanzhou in China's Fujian
Province will be launched in June, Su said.</P>
      <P>Su made the announcement in a news conference held at the
Sungshan air base in Taipei, after his plan to fly to Kinmen for an
inspection tour of the "mini three links" was canceled due to bad
weather.</P>
      <P>The "mini three links" refers to the ferry services currently
available between the Taiwan-held outlying islands of Kinmen and
Matsu and the Chinese ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou.</P>
      <P>While the services are applicable to people who have registered
their household in Kinmen or Matsu for at least six months, their
dependents and close relatives are currently only allowed to use the
service if they are traveling together.</P>
      <P>Others who can use the services include Taiwan businesspeople
with operations in China; veterans who were born in Fujian Province
and those of Fujian ancestry; and Fujian residents married to Taiwan
citizens.</P>
      <P>Su stressed that the policy to expand the "mini three links" was
based on a directive from President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Su said that while Taiwan has not restricted the destination
ports of the "mini three links" since the links were launched in
2001, China has refused to open up more ports other than Fuzhou and
Xiamen to operate the services.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Su invited China to hold a joint cross-strait sea
rescue exercise with Taiwan in September.</P>
      <P>Su said that as more and more passengers are traveling across the

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN EXPECTS PREPARATORY MEETING WITH JAPAN BEFORE FISHERY TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 25 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan hopes to hold a preparatory meeting
with Japan if formal talks between the two countries are impossible
in the near future because of the huge differences in viewpoint
between them, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Liao Ching-pang, vice chief executive officer of the MOFA's
Committee on Japanese Affairs, said the planned 16th round of
Taiwan-Japan fishery talks was originally scheduled to be held in
March but was postponed due to the huge differences in the positions
of the two sides.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan have held 15 rounds of fishery talks since 1996.
The focus of the disputes lies in the sovereignty dispute over the
the Tiaoyutai Islands -- known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan -- an
uninhabited island group in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>The waters near the Tiaoyutais northeast of Taiwan have been
considered by Taiwan fishermen as their traditional fishing grounds.
However, Japan demarcated the area as part of its 200-nautical mile
economic zone in 1996 and has since that time often chased Taiwan
fishing boats that enter the area and fined the owners of the boats.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Taiwan drew a provisional "demarcation line" or
"jurisdiction line" along the center line in the two countries'
overlapping economic zones in order to avoid further disputes.
However, neither country has recognized the demarcation lines drawn
by the other side, leaving the problem unresolved.</P>
      <P>Regarding waters around Okinotorishima, Japan's southernmost
island located 1,730 kilometers southeast of Tokyo, Liao noted that
Taiwan claims that the area is a disputed marine area and urged
Japanese authorities not to chase or detain Taiwanese fishing boats
operating in this area before a negotiated settlement is reached
between the two countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman
Johnnason Liu expressed Tuesday the hope that China would respond
with goodwill to Premier Su Tseng-chang's proposal of conducting a
joint sea rescue drill.</P>
      <P>Su made the proposal earlier while announcing the expansion of
current "mini-three links" operations with China on two offshore
islands, Kinmen and Matsu. He said he hoped such a drill would be
carried out before September, after which the seas would be too
rough.</P>
      <P>Describing the proposed joint drill as "pragmatic practice" since
both Taiwan and China have sea routes in the Taiwan Strait, Liu said
rescue operations in the strait would be more effective if the two
forged cooperative efforts and answered each other's call for
assistance.</P>
      <P>At present, the central government is building up an integrated
sea disaster rescue system with the collaboration of all relevant
government agencies, including the Coast Guard Agency, the Ministry
of National Defense, the Ministry of Transportation and

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE YUAN SWAP MULLED ON TAIWAN PROPER: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To prepare for the opening of Taiwan to
Chinese tourists, the government is planning to allow some domestic
locations to convert renminbis, a government official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, secretary-general of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) , made the revelation in response to questions from main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers Lai Shyi-bao and Yang
Chiung-ying at a seminar on cross-Taiwan Strait financial exchanges
held by the KMT legislative caucus at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lai and Yang asked Jan whether the government is considering
renminbi swaps to be allowed on Taiwan proper and cited a newspaper
report as pointing out that some shops at Alishan and Sun Moon Lake
-- two popular scenic spots in central Taiwan -- already accept
renminbis from Chinese visitors.</P>
      <P>They questioned the rationale of the government's policy of
permitting Chinese visitors to enter with renminbi but prohibiting
them from changing the Chinese currency into the local one, asking
Jan whether the government encouraged them to make deals on the black
market.</P>
      <P>At present, only Chinese living abroad and those flying into
Taiwan from a third country or area are permitted to visit Taiwan for
sight-seeing purposes. The Taiwan government is expected to announce
a full opening to general tourists from China.</P>
      <P>Although according to the Republic of China's law, only shops on
offshore islands of Kinmen and Matsu are allowed to convert renminbi
into the local unit, Jan admitted that the MAC and relevant
government agencies are mulling the possibility of setting up other
points in Taiwan, in line with the government's anticipated opening
to Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>But Jan added that the government still needs to work out
relevant details, such as deciding a maximum convertible amount and
the question of whether new Taiwan dollars could be swapped back into
renminbis by departing Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The government hopes to conclude tourist talks with the Chinese
side in six months and Taiwan is likely to announce the opening on
its own even if bilateral negotiations are not wrapped up by that
time, Jan said, adding that the renminbi-NT dollar swap measure will
be announced concurrently.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of passengers using the
transportation links between Kinmen, Matsu and China-based ports, or
the so-called "mini three links" has grown more than 20 times since
the service was launched Jan. 1, 2001, a spokesman for the Ministry of
Transportation and Communication (MOTC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MOTC statistics show that in 2001, 25,000 passengers traveled
using the mini three links between Taiwan's Kinmen and Matsu and
China's Xiamen and Mawei.</P>
      <P>The number more than doubled the following year to 58,000. In
2003, the mini three links served more than 167,000 people; the
number increased to 427,000 in 2004 and reached 555,000 in 2005.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the increases are due to the government's
easing of restrictions, allowing more people to take advantage of the
mini three links.</P>
      <P>Starting May 1 this year, those originating from Kinmen and Matsu
can also travel to China via the mini three links. Only Kinmen
residents were allowed to use the links when they began.</P>
      <P>Since the direct links were launched, ships using the route have
made a total of 15,000 port calls at Matsu and Kinmen as of October
last year. Among these, 44.3 percent were Taiwanese ships and 54.5
percent were Chinese ships, according to tallies compiled by the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Through a ruling party legislator, Former
Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that if the party loses year-end
elections for Taipei and Kaohsiung mayorships, the party's senior
leadership should take responsibility for the failure by not running
in the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Li Chun-yi made the
remarks as he and other lawmakers close to Hsieh met DPP Chairman Yu
Shyi-kun to discuss the possibility of Hsieh running for Taipei
mayor.</P>
      <P>Yu said he has confidence in the party's primary system and
believes the best candidates will be nominated through the party's
democratic mechanism.</P>
      <P>Li said that if the mayoral elections are regarded as most
important to the DPP, all ruling party members should put the DPP's
interests above individual political considerations, adding that
President Chen Shui-bian should be in charge of meetings to select
the best candidates.</P>
      <P>Li also said the DPP should make a decision on whether candidates
who are going to run for Taipei and Kaosiung mayor should be excluded
from the presidential election in 2008.</P>
      <P>He said, former premier Hsieh won't run in the mayoral election
unless the DPP's high-ranking officials reach a consensus on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Those party leaders must take political responsibility if the
party fails to win back people's confidence in the year-end municipal
elections and they should pledge not to run for the presidency in
2008, Li said.</P>

      <P>The number of drug addicts testing
positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Taiwan
experienced a large boost, driving up the overall growth rate of the
HIV-positive people last year to 70 percent from 10 percent in 2003,
a lawmaker said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Shu-san of the Democratic Progressive Party also
noted at a news conference that the number of AIDS patients increased
to 3,405 people in 2005 from 773 in 2003 -- a five-fold rate of

      <P>Among the people found to have contracted HIV last year, 2,434

    <HEADLINE>REPORTER FINED FOR REFUSING TO TESTIFY AT 'STOCK VULTURES' HEARING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A newspaper reporter was fined NT$30,000
Tuesday for refusing to reveal his source in a story that has become
part of a court hearing on the "stock vultures" case. His newspaper
vowed to appeal the court ruling.</P>
      <P>This is the second time Kao Nien-yi of the United Daily News was
fined; the first was on the first day of his appearance in the Taiwan
High Court Monday, for the same reason. The court is summoning him to
testify again Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The court handed down the fines because, it said, "the witness
does not have a legitimate reason to refuse" to reveal his news
sources, which have a strong bearing on the public interest.</P>
      <P>The prosecution suspects that Lee Chin-cheng, former director of
the Financial Supervisory Commission's Examination Bureau and a key
suspect in the insider trading case, might have leaked critical
information to Kao, whose report was used as a tool by Lee's
stock-trading friends, who have also been charged for making illicit
profits.</P>
      <P>The court said the public's interest in knowing who leaked the
information "is obviously larger than the interest involved in the
reporter refusing to testify."</P>
      <P>The UDN said that keeping its news sources confidential is key to
the media's operation, which aims to monitor the exercise of public
authority -- a right that should not be damaged by judicial
institutions.</P>
      <P>Whether a newspaper story has been used to commit a crime has
nothing to do with the identity of the story's reporter since it was
totally beyond the reporter's control, said the daily.</P>
      <P>Moreover, it continued, as the case is still in progress, the
court should not violate the principle of "not guilty until proven
so" by handing down a fine on the witness before a conviction has
been made.</P>
      <P>The daily called on the public to pay attention to this incident,
which it said involves the critical issue of press freedom and the
operation of the country's democratic system.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The best part of opening doors to Chinese
tourists is the effect of "culture shock" on mainlanders, who emerge
in an atmosphere of democracy and see the real face of Taiwan,
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Referring to Beijing's media block on the matter, Wu claimed that
most in China know about Taiwan and the democracy it has worked hard
to promote, despite insufficient information. Now, with the opening
in tourism, he said, mutual understanding between people on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait is expected to get a boost, and such a
development helps to improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Besides, such an outcome is far more beneficial to Taiwan than
the estimated yearly economic benefit of about US$500-600 million
generated from tourist-oriented visits by Chinese in Taiwan, Wu
noted.</P>
      <P>The official said the two sides need to sit down for talks
immediately, to discuss how there are currently only limited openings
for sightseeing visits available to a handful of Chinese tourists who
hold residency in a foreign country or travel via a third country to
Taiwan as part of a tour package. The official also said the two
sides need to work out issues such as the confirmation of Chinese
tourists' identity and ensuring Chinese tourists are well-treated
during their stay.</P>

Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo made the statement while inspecting anti-epidemic

      <P>He said once new rules are implemented May 1 this year, allowing

anti-epidemic mechanism to prevent avian flu from entering Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kuo said that China is one of Taiwan's largest sources of
infectious disease, so reinforcing the prevention of avian flu in
Kinmen and Matsu is of primary importance.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Tuesday that
President Chen Shui-bian is guiding and setting the tone on the
nation's major policies, including those concerning cross-Taiwan
Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks to clarify the decision-making process on
cross-strait policy amid reports that the premier is not on the same
page as the president in this regard after a recent trade and
economic forum between the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
Communist Party of China (CPC) in Beijing.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, Su did not dismiss the conclusions
reached at the April 14-15 KMT-CPC forum completely -- which include
the recognition by China of academic degrees conferred by accredited
Taiwan universities, allowing Chinese tourists to travel to Taiwan
and permitting qualified Taiwan physicians to practice in China --
when he said last Friday that the government will support the
conclusions as long as they are beneficial to the people of Taiwan

      <P>In response to reports that there is a gap between the president

this is the case, saying that Su's pronouncement on cross-strait

Secretary-General Chiou I-jen, based on the president's will.</P>
      <P>Su pointed out that relations between Taiwan and China are

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
Legislator Yin Ling-ying called for establishing a basic law for
agriculture to protect the rights and interests of Taiwan farmers
amid increased globalization.</P>
      <P>Yin, quoting former President Lee Teng-hui -- the TSU's
"spiritual leader" -- issued the call at a public hearing on Taiwan's
agricultural development sponsored by the TSU at the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to Yin, Lee is very concerned about the future of
Taiwan's agriculture and believes that it is necessary to set up a
basic law to help maintain continued growth in the domestic
agricultural sector in line with growing concerns over environmental
and consumer protection.</P>
      <P>She also criticized what she described as the inactivity of the
Democratic Progressive Party government in the face of the
deteriorating situation in the domestic agricultural industry due to
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>However, she claimed that the 15 overtures released by Beijing
directed at Taiwan following an economic forum between the leading
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC)
that ran from April 14-16 in Beijing will not benefit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan farmers might be hurt by the measures, " she claimed.</P>
      <P>As China has so far failed to work out measures to protect
Taiwan's farm products in the Chinese market, China's wider opening
to imports from Taiwan would just further fan commercial piracy
there, which is likely to deal a fresh blow to Taiwan farmers who are
already suffering under the onslaught of fake Chinese products, she
said.</P>
      <P>In addition, she expressed concern that an influx of Taiwan's
agricultural goods to China would allow Chinese farmers to learn from
Taiwan's know-how, eroding Taiwan farmers' competitive edge.</P>

      <P>The Water Resources Agency (WRA) under the

gravel dredging in order to cover a shortage, the director-general of

used each month.</P>
      <P>He added that there will be a 9 million cubic meter gravel
shortage once China suspends gravel exports to Taiwan May 1, which
has prompted the WRA to work out a plan to allow additional dredging
from the Lanyang, Dajia, Jhuoshuei and Gaoping rivers, as well as
several others, allowing an additional 4 million cubic meters of
gravel to be collected from these rivers.</P>
      <P>Chen said that according to tallies compiled by the Bureau of

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HIGH COURT BEGINS TO HEAR PACIFIC SOGO OWNERSHIP CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court began to hear the
case of an ownership fight over the Pacific Sogo Department Store
Tuesday, with Pacific Group former Chairman Chang Min-chiang seeking
to have 600,000 shares in the Pacific Distribution Investment Co.,
which owns Pacific Sogo, returned to him.</P>
      <P>Chang said he had entrusted the 600,000 shares to Lee Heng-lung,
landlord of Pacific Sogo and deputy chairman of the Pacific Group, in
May 2002 after Lee and Walter Lin, chairman of Waterland Financial
Holdings Co., promised to help him get bank loans to tide Pacific
Sogo over financial difficulties caused by a flood in the typhoon
season of 2001.</P>
      <P>Pacific Sogo, a subsidiary of Pacific Group at the time, has been
one of Taiwan's most successful department stores.</P>
      <P>Lee became chairman of Pacific Distribution Investment after the
shares were transferred to his name. However, instead of helping
Chang to obtain the needed loans, Lee and Lin stripped Chang of his
ownership of Pacific Sogo and replaced the entire management team.</P>
      <P>Sensing that Lee and Lin might have ulterior motives, Chang began
to let the word out that he wanted to sell Pacific Sogo. Tsai
Chen-yang, head of My Humble House Group, was among the first to
respond, offering to buy the department store for NT$10 billion, but
Lin and Lee, who were in full control of Pacific Sogo, refused,
saying that someone at "a high level" had a specific buyer in mind.</P>
      <P>The ownership fight became a tug-of-war among several business
leaders, each claiming to have support from either the Presidential
Office or the first lady.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed that Lee and Lin sold Pacific Sogo to Douglas Hsu,
chairman of the Far Eastern Group, by signing a secret agreement in
September 2002.</P>
      <P>After repaying NT$2.5 billion in debts due at the time for
Pacific Sogo, Far Eastern named Chung Chin, former head of the
Government Information Office, as chairwoman of the department store.</P>
      <P>Newspaper reports Monday quoted Lee as saying that Hsu hired
Chung as Pacific Sogo chairwoman because it was the decision of the
"high level."</P>
      <P>The secret agreement came to light only recently after Lee
claimed that Pacific Sogo was temporarily registered under Far
Eastern's name because the deal had not been completed. He said Hsu
had not fulfilled his part of the obligations and that according to
the agreement, he is entitled to 33 percent of Pacific Sogo's shares
-- estimated to be worth more than NT$15 billion.</P>
      <P>Lee told the court that it was Pacific Sogo, rather than Chang,
that entrusted the 600,000 shares of Pacific Distribution to him. He
insisted there was no written trust agreement between him and Chang
about the transfer of those shares and that Chang has no right to the
shares.</P>
      <P>As the court proceeding continued, media coverage was mounting
about a scandal implicating first lady Wu Shu-chen, who has been
accused of taking millions of dollars-worth of Pacific Sogo gift
vouchers during the ownership fight over the department store. She
has admitted shopping with such gift vouchers, but claimed they were
bought by her and her friends with pooled funds.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN PICTURE BOOK EXHIBITION HELD IN TAIPEI BOOKSTORES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  25 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A month-long exhibition of Australian
picture books will showcase the creativity of illustrators like Shaun
Tan, who is visiting Taiwan, and the diversity of Australian
children's literature, the Australian Trade and Industry Office
(ACIO) in Taipei announced at a press conference Tuesday.</P>
      <P>More than 40 picture books authored by well-known illustrators
like Alison Lester, Ron Brooks and Tan will be displayed in nine
Eslite Bookstores from April 25 to May 21.</P>
      <P>The exhibition provides a good opportunity to understand
Australian children's picture book publishing, which is different
from British and American picture books, said Evelyn Killick,
executive deputy director of ACIO's Economic and Policy Section.</P>
      <P>Australia is an incredibly diverse country and it shows in its
picture books, with illustrators coming from all walks of life, race
and age, said Tan, who is of Chinese descent.</P>
      <P>Tan provided two of his books -- "The Red Tree" and "The Lost
Thing" -- in the exhibition and has been giving speeches on various
campuses in Taiwan during his tour.</P>
      <P>"Australia has long been known for its picture book publishing, "
said Sarah Ko, a professor at National Taipei University. "But Taiwan
people often mistake Australian picture books for American or British
publications."</P>
      <P>"The stories and graphics of Australian picture books are not as
dramatic and eye-catching as American and British books. They are
more tender and subtle, and show a profound power," she claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JUDGES MUST BE COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT: JUDICIAL CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, April 25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Judicial Yuan President Weng Yueh-sheng
said Tuesday that judges must act independently and cannot allow
themselves to be influenced by their superiors, with "conscience and
instinctive moral sense" their criteria in making court decisions.</P>
      <P>Weng made the remarks when he presided over the Judicial Yuan's
first judicial reform seminar in Pingtung, southern Taiwan, which
will be followed similar functions in other counties and cities
around the country.</P>
      <P>The first order of work in judicial reform is winning the trust
of the people, he said. This should be followed by efforts to make it
easier for people to obtain services in the judicial system, Weng
added.</P>
      <P>Building a "pyramid" court trial system is another priority in
the reform project, so that the current system of three trials (first
trial for ascertaining facts, second trial for factual review and
third trial for legal sentencing) will become more efficient, he
said.</P>
      <P>The court's mediation function should also be strengthened and
civil suits handled in batches in order to increase the judges'
efficiency in resolving civil disputes, he said.</P>
      <P>Other work that needs attention is increasing prosecutors'
ability to produce evidence, which will speed up conclusion of
lawsuits, according to Weng.</P>
      <P>He said the Judicial Yuan is promoting a new system for
recruiting judges from among lawyers, prosecutors and academics
instead of by written tests.</P>
      <P>The new policy will be implemented in three or five years, as
more than 50 lawyers have applied to become judges, of whom 20 have
been selected, he noted.</P>
      <P>Weng and his senior staff members exchanged views with local
district court judges and leaders of advocacy groups, who made a list
of suggestions including the establishment of mediation organizations
for consumer complaints.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPORTER HAS RIGHT TO REFUSE TO TESTIFY: JOURNALIST GROUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Timothy J. Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Justice Journalists Association of
Taipei issued a statement Tuesday in protest over the Taiwan High
Court's refusing a reporter the right to refuse to testify in regard
to a news story that has become part of a court hearing on the "stock
vultures" case.</P>
      <P>The statement noted that freedom of speech is protected by the
Constitution and that reporters have the right to refuse to testify
at court hearings.</P>
      <P>They claimed that forcing a reporter to reveal his news sources
will not help find the truth in a lawsuit but will create strained
relations between the media and the judiciary.</P>
      <P>The association was responding to the case of a newspaper
reporter who was fined NT$30,000 for refusing to reveal the sources
of his news story.</P>
      <P>It was the second time Kao Nien-yi of the United Daily News had
been fined. The first was on the first day of his appearance at the
Taiwan High Court Monday, for the same reason. The court is summoning
him to testify again Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The statement said the "stock vultures" case has nothing to do
with national security and that the reporter's testimony is not the
only way to find the facts.</P>
      <P>The court is violating the principle of proportion by fining the
reporter over and over again instead of mobilizing the administrative
resources at its disposal, it said.</P>
      <P>Catching criminals is a basic responsibility of the judiciary,
and it will damage public's right to know and weaken the media's work
to monitor the government if reporters' news stories are seen as
helping criminals, the association said.</P>
      <P>It also noted that keeping news sources confidential is key to the
media's operation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The first family should clarify whether
they took NT$10 million in 2002 from the Tuntex Group through the
Presidential Office's then-deputy secretary-general, Chen Che-nan, in
return for helping the company obtain NT$60 billion in loans from
several state-owned banks, a legislator of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiu Yi said that during a trip he made to Beijing
last week, Tuntex Group former Chairman Chen Yu-hau authorized one of
his aides to provide him with information showing that Chen Che-nan
received NT$10 million as a "political contribution" to help finance
President Chen Shui-bian's campaign for re-election.</P>
      <P>Chiu said it is unlikely that Chen Che-nan kept the money for
himself and said the first family should tell the nation who took the
money.</P>
      <P>Noting that with Chen Che-nan's help, Tuntex was able to get
NT$60 billion in loans at favorable rates with extended periods for
repayment, Chiu said he suspects the loans were made possible because
of the campaign contribution.</P>
      <P>The opposition legislator said that if the president and first
lady are found to have played a role in granting the loans to Tuntex,
they will be liable for prosecution on charges of corruption because
some of the loans have become bad debts.</P>
      <P>In response to Chiu's remarks, the Presidential Office said
claims about monetary political contributions were nothing new and
that if Chiu has obtained new evidence, he should give it to the
Prosecutor's Office.</P>
      <P>Chen Yu-hau, a fugitive wanted by the Taipei District Court on
charges of embezzlement since June 2003, is believed to be hiding in
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THINK TANK ADJUSTS DOWNWARD FORECAST FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH FOR 2006</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
adjusted downward Wednesday its forecast for Taiwan's economic growth
for 2006 from 4.02 percent to 3.91 percent.</P>
      <P>Researchers from the private economic think tank attributed the
lower than expected growth mainly to soaring international crude oil
prices and excessive consumer credit card debt -- two factors which
they said will drive down consumption.</P>
      <P>Growth of 3.91 percent for 2006 would be slightly lower than the
4.09 percent posted for 2005.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research is the first Taiwan
think tank to predict a growth rate below four percent for Taiwan in
2006 thus far.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A passenger was nabbed at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport for bringing in live birds from China into the
country, officials of the Taipei Customs Office reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The customs officials said the four Japanese White-eyes were
found in a bird cage hidden in the carry-on luggage of the passenger,
surnamed Chen, Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that he was returning from Shanghai via Hong Kong
and that the four songbirds are his pets.</P>
      <P>The customs officials have turned Chen and the birds over to the
Hsinchu branch of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection
and Quarantine under the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that China is listed as a bird flu-affected
area and that those who violate Taiwan's regulations aimed at
preventing animal contagious diseases face up to three years in
prison or/and a maximum fine of NT$150,000 (US$4,690).</P>
      <P>Japanese White-eyes, or Mejiros, are relatively small songbirds
with an average height of about 4.5 inches. The birds, which have a
slightly curved black bill extending from their yellow forehead,
are named for the silky white rings around their eyes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEADING EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT MEMBER PROMOTES TAIWAN'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  April  25  (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading member of the European
Parliament called Tuesday for direct access for Taiwan to the World
Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>Graham Watson, leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats
for Europe in the European Parliament, said the inclusion of Taiwan
in the world health network will not only protect the people of
Taiwan but also create a fitter global health framework to protect
people around the world.</P>
      <P>Watson expressed his disapproval of the fact that Taiwan has only
been allowed to take part in some technical meetings held by the WHO,
and he urged the WHO to address this problem.</P>
      <P>Watson made the remarks during an event in support of Taiwan's
bid to participate in the WHO. The event was co-organized by Watson
and the Geneva-based consultant firm Health Diplomats.</P>
      <P>Also at the event, Delon Human, CEO and president of the Health
Diplomats and former secretary-general and CEO of the World Medical
Association, urged European Parliament members, European Union
officials, European media representatives and European medical
workers to exert their influence and press the European Union to help
Taiwan gain access to the WHO.</P>
      <P>Before Taiwan succeeds in its bid to obtain observer status at
the World Health Assembly (WHA) , which will involve a very long
process, the WHO should take several steps to try to mend the gap in
the world health network, Human suggested.</P>
      <P>These steps include the inclusion of Taiwan in the Global
Outbreak Alert and Response Network and the International Health
Regulations mechanism and allowing Taiwan to take part in
WHO-affiliated regional organizations, Human said.</P>
      <P>Printed materials prepared by the organizers stated that Taiwan
is one of the areas that is shut out of the global public health
network and that in the event of bird flu or other infectious
diseases breaking out in Taiwan, the 23 million people of the island
will have no way to gain assistance from the WHO to fight these
diseases.</P>
      <P>The consequences of this gap were demonstrated during the 2003
SARS outbreak, according to the printed materials.</P>
      <P>Also attending the event, Winston Dang, a legislator of Taiwan's
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) who concurrently serves as
director of the DPP's Department of International Affairs, told the
Central News Agency that the European Union has become more
supportive of Taiwan's WHO bid this year after the United States and
Japan have openly expressed their support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan is still barred from participating in the WHA as an
observer this year, the government should consider applying directly
with the WHO for membership, Dang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GRAVEL SHORTAGE ISSUE TO BE ADDRESSED ASAP: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Hwang Ing-san
said Wednesday that the current gravel shortage -- caused by traders'
reluctance to sell as gravel prices have been rising ahead of China's
suspension of gravel exports from May 1 -- will be addressed in the
shortest possible period of time.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Hwang said he will
see to it that the gravel supply situation is tackled first, before
other measures are taken to stabilize prices.</P>
      <P>Domestic gravel prices have risen recently amid reports that
China will ban gravel exports starting May 1.</P>
      <P>An islandwide gravel trade association reportedly wrote to
Beijing authorities recently, asking China not to ban gravel exports
to Taiwan, which the association claimed is a "domestic district" of
China.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tang Bi-a lashed
out at the trade association for being willing to sacrifice Taiwan's
sovereignty for personal gain.</P>
      <P>Tang also criticized the administration for doing nothing to deal
with the gravel trade association's actions, asking whether the
government in fact condones such behavior by private groups.</P>
      <P>Hwang responded by saying that the gravel association was
definitely "wrong" for writing the letter, adding that Bureau of
Mines authorities will communicate with the association over the
matter while the case is referred to the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>The economics minister remarked that actually, there still are
stocks of gravel in Taiwan, but traders have become reluctant to sell
their product due to speculation that prices will increase further.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of Economic Affairs is now planning to have
gravel transported from eastern Taiwan to western Taiwan for sale
while overall domestic production will be increased to meet demand.</P>
      <P>Admitting that domestic gravel prices are too high, Huang said
his ministry is also working to import gravel from the Philippines,
where gravel prices are only about 7.6 percent higher than those in
China. The ministry is also looking at Vietnam as a possible source
of gravel to meet local demand, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN ILLUSTRATOR A LATE BLOOMER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australian illustrator Shaun Tan was
neither fazed by the fact that he was the shortest student in his
class nor by the fact that he was not recruited by the famous
Disney-Pixar animation studio. He has been enjoying being a picture
book illustrator.</P>
      <P>As a latecomer who started working on children's picture books at
the age of 20, Tan is regarded as one of the most promising
Australian illustrators. Tan is visiting Taiwan on a promotional tour
for Australian picture books.</P>
      <P>Tan was born in 1974 and grew up in the northern suburbs of
Perth, Western Australia. His father is a Malaysian civil engineer of
Chinese descent who relocated to Australia. In school, Tan became
known as the "good drawer" which partly compensated for always being
the shortest kid in every class.</P>
      <P>He graduated from the University of Western Australia in 1995
with degrees in fine arts and English literature. Currently, Tan
works full-time as a freelance illustrator and writer, concentrating
mostly on picture books.</P>
      <P>Tan began drawing and painting images for science fiction and
horror stories in magazines as a teenager. He has won numerous awards
for his work. He recently worked for Blue Sky Studios and Pixar,
providing concept artwork for films, and turned down Pixar's offer of
a full-time job.</P>
      <P>Tan introduced to Taiwan two of his books, "The Red Tree" and
"The Lost Thing", both of which are currently being adapted for short
films. His works reflect a lot of his childhood memories and
observations of life, making them suitable for both children and
adults.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony of an exhibition of more than 40
Australian picture books at Eslite Bookstores in Taipei Tuesday, Tan
said he is proud of Australian picture books publishing and the
country he comes from.</P>
      <P>"Australia is an incredibly diverse country. And its picture
books publishing is very disorganized, which is good. Artists in the
field come from everywhere. There are businesspeople, school
teachers, parents, people who live in the city, and people from the
countryside," he said.</P>
      <P>"And Australian picture books are being recognized for being
experimental and adventurous, " Tan said.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Bush Takes Steps to Ease
Increase in Energy Prices 
U.S. President Bush announced a series of shoort-term steps on
Tuesday intended to ease the rise in energy prices, including a
suspension of government purchases to refill the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, a relaxation of environmental rules for the
formulation of gasoline and investigations into possible price
gouging and price fixing. The rise in energy prices has undermined
the administration's effort to build a case that its policies have
led to economic prosperity and has given Democrats an opening to
portray the White House and Congressional Republicans as allies of
the oil industry. With Bush's poll numbers sagging and his party on
the defensive over the Iraq war, Republicans have been scrambling
to show they are trying to help consumers.

Wall Street Journal: Last Resort In Russia, Grim Case Spotlights
Distress Of Justice Denied

In Russia, the European Court has become a last resort for
thousands of citizens who've lost hope of obtaining justice at home.
More cases against Russia are pending in Strasbourg than against any
other country -- 13,945 at the end of 2005. Last year alone, Russians
filed 8,500 complaints there, a sixth of all it received, according
to a Kremlin official. While Russia is a large country, this still
reflects a big showing. The complaints include many that don't fit
the human-rights mold -- things like unpaid pensions -- as frustrated
Russians treat Strasbourg as a kind of general court of appeal.
Russia's representative at the court calls the high number of cases
misleading, because "around 96 percent are declared inadmissible."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>HU FAILS TO 'SCORE' AGAINST TAIWAN ON U.S. TRIP: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said
recently that Chinese President Hu Jintao failed to "score points"
against Taiwan during his visit to the United States last week.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Asia that appeared
Wednesday, Chen said that Chinese officials had hoped
U.S. President George W. Bush would censure his decision in late
February to cease the functioning of the National Unification
Council, a body dedicated to eventual unification with China.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan had already negotiated the language of that
announcement with Washington, so Bush merely restated U.S.
opposition to any unilateral changes in Taiwan's status by either
Taipei or Beijing. Bush "did not allow China to score points on the
Taiwan issue," according to Chen.</P>
      <P>He also said that a gaffe by an MC during a welcoming ceremony
for Hu at the White House was understandable given Beijing's
insistence that Taiwan is part of China. He was referring to the MC's
announcement of the playing of the anthem of the Republic of China,
which is actually Taiwan's official name.</P>
      <P>Chen said that to make the distinction clearer between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait is a central task for his remaining two
years in office.</P>
      <P>"I would like to see the international community gain a better
understanding of the differences between democratic Taiwan and
totalitarian China, " he said. "They are, in fact, two separate
countries."</P>
      <P>But he also said that China's rise poses longer-term military and
economic threats to Taiwan and its people.</P>
      <P>With China's military buildup in recent years, he said, the
U.S. and Japanese governments have assessed that the balance of
military power in the Taiwan Strait is tilting sharply toward China.
"We must strengthen our defense capabilities," he said.</P>
      <P>Although the opposition-dominated legislature has blocked a
multimillion dollar arms procurement package -- eight diesel-electric
submarines, six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries and a squadron
of 12 P-3C submarine-hunting airplanes -- from the U.S. for nearly
two years, Chen claimed that an accord with opposition legislators
could come "in the near future."</P>
      <P>"Only by strengthening our national defense can we ensure and
safeguard the hard-won fruits of democracy as well as economic
prosperity, " Chen said in the wide-ranging interview at the
Presidential Office Tuesday.</P>
      <P>With close business relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, evidenced by statistics provided by Taiwan's Ministry of
Economic Affairs showing that government-approved investment in China
by Taiwanese companies was estimated at around US$6 billion in 2005,
he sounded a cautious note.</P>
      <P>"When Taiwan's economy becomes overly dependent on or tilts
excessively toward China, I think the government has a responsibility
to issue an early warning," he said.</P>
      <P>But he also said that "investing in China is part of the global
plan of Taiwanese companies. The government cannot stop it."</P>
      <P>Chen said China's rise is causing a list of problems for Taiwan
and other countries: rising prices of raw materials, inefficient
energy consumption and a flood of cheap imports that is causing
structural unemployment.</P>
      <P>China's growth "isn't only an opportunity for the global economy.
More importantly, it's a kind of threat," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said the government wants to ensure that Taiwan, which has a
per capita income of more than US$14,000 compared with China's
US$1,700, does not "place all its bets" on China as Taiwanese
companies rush to tap China's huge market and cheap labor.</P>
      <P>Taiwan retains the edge over China in the information technology
industry, Chen said, adding that "Taiwan's economy cannot become
merely an appendage of China's economy."</P>
      <P>But he also dismissed concerns about a possible government
crackdown on investment in China in the wake of his announcement
earlier this year that the government will more "actively manage"
investment across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He said that prosecutors' investigation into chip giant United
Microelectronics Corp's possible illicit ties to a Chinese
semi-conductor company is "an isolated case."</P>
      <P>He also voiced optimism that a long-awaited influx of Chinese
tourists to Taiwan could occur later this year after Beijing recently
announced that it might be willing to lift its restrictions on
letting its citizens travel to Taiwan as tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT THANKS TAIPEI MAYOR FOR SUPPORTING `REASONABLE' ARMS DEAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  26  (CNA)
(By Timothy J. Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian thanked
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou Wednesday for
supporting "reasonable" arms procurements, adding that he hopes the
arms procurement bill could be passed at the Legislative Yuan as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>During an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Asia Tuesday,
Chen said that the best strategy for Taiwan is to "deter effectively
and defend resolutely." He noted that Taiwan will never launch a
first strike against any other country.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's defense is based on protection and prevention, and the
top three principles of defense are preventing a war, defending the
territory, and taking anti-terrorism measures," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwan would do its best to avoid a war,
"therefore, we need to enhance our defense capabilities."</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the main reason for Taiwan to enhance
defense capabilities lies with China, which has never given up the
option of using force against the country.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he continued, China passed its Anti-Secession Law in
March last year and has deployed 784 missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Between the "pan-green camp" and the "pan-bule alliance" there
should be neither disputes nor ideological differences over enhancing
Taiwan's defense power, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen criticized the visits to China by former opposition KMT
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong,
claiming that the visits have given wrong signals that will be
misinterpreted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO SKIRT TIAOYUTAI ISSUE IN FISHERY TALKS WITH JAPAN: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will skirt the thorny Tiaoyutai
issue to facilitate the holding of fishery talks with Japan in the
future, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>To facilitate the holding of a preparatory fishery meeting with
Japan, Taiwan will intentionally not address the fishing area below
27 degrees north, or the southern area of the Tiaoyutai islands --
known as the Senkakus in Japan -- an uninhabited island group in the
East China Sea where fishery as well as crude oil resources are
reportedly abundant, said COA Vice Chairman Lee Chien-chuan.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials said a day earlier that
Taiwan hopes to hold a preparatory meeting with Japan if formal talks
between the two countries are impossible in the near future because
of the huge differences in their respective viewpoints.</P>
      <P>A planned 16th round of Taiwan-Japan fishery talks, originally
scheduled to be held in March, was postponed to April and reportedly
to an unspecified date, due to huge differences in the positions of
the two sides on issues including overlapping territorial waters and
the Tiaoyutai issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lee said, the Ministry of the Interior has drawn a
provisional demarcation line or jurisdiction line along the center
line of the two countries' overlapping economic zones since 2003 in
order to avoid further disputes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan fishing boats are not impounded by Japanese patrol ships
if they operate only to the west of the demarcation line, he noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan have been embroiled in a long-running dispute
over their overlapping economic zones, with many Taiwanese fishing
boats being chased away or detained while operating in waters outside
the temporary demarcation line.</P>
      <P>Lee added that the COA Fisheries Administration has also
allocated a budget to subsidize 230 Taiwan fishing boats to install
advanced virtual memory system on their vessels to let them know
whether they have crossed to an area east of the demarcation line
when operating in the overlapping fishing grounds.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan have held 15 rounds of fishery talks and two
rounds of preparatory meetings since 1996.</P>
      <P>The waters near the Tiaoyutais northeast of Taiwan are considered
by Taiwan fishermen as their traditional fishing grounds. However,
Japan demarcated the area as part of its 200-nautical mile economic
zone in 1996 and has since then often chased Taiwan fishing boats
that enter the area and fined the owners of the boats.</P>

performance, an EPA spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The top performing administrative areas are Taipei, Kaohsiung and

counties. They were rated according to 16 environmental protection
indicators, including air quality, water resource management, soil
conservation and waste treatment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SLACKENING INVESTMENT, CONSUMPTION TO HINDER GROWTH: TIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the adverse impact of soaring oil
prices and huge credit card debts owed by local consumers becoming
ever more evident, private investment and consumption growth is
expected to slow, which will in turn affect the nation's economic
growth this year, an economic think tank predicted Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The TIER adjusted downward its economic growth forecast for
this year from 4.02 percent to 3.91 percent, with the trade surplus
expected to reach US$26.4 billion.</P>
      <P>At a press conference on Taiwan's macro economy, TIER President
David Hong noted that surging international crude oil prices and
gigantic credit card debt in the domestic market will result in a
decrease in private consumption growth from the original target of
3.07 percent to 2.82 percent, and will cause domestic investment
growth to drop from the originally estimated 4.09 percent to 2.35
percent.</P>
      <P>However, Hong said that although TIER adjusted downward this
year's economic growth forecast, it does not mean that the research
institute is pessimistic toward the country's economy.</P>
      <P>According to a TIER estimate, Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI)
will register a 1.84 percent growth this year, as TIER predicted that
international crude oil prices will be maintained at between US$60
and US$65 per barrel this year, which the TIER said is not expected
to cause too much inflation pressure.</P>
      <P>In addition, the new Taiwan dollar is expected to appreciate
against the U.S. dollar to the level of NT$31.893 this year, which
Hong said will help reduce cost of imports and curb inflation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a TIER survey shows that only 34.7 percent of local
manufacturers believe that the domestic economic prospects will
improve in the coming six months, compared with the 58.5 percent
registered in a previous survey conducted in February, while those
pessimistic toward the business prospects in the coming six months
rose from 7.6 percent to 16.1 percent due largely to the soaring oil
prices.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator John Chiang of the main
opposition Kuomintang announced Wednesday that he will give up his
bid for the post of Taipei mayor for the sake of the party's
solidarity.</P>
      <P>Chiang, accompanied by his wife and two daughters, said in a
statement that since his decision to run in the mayoral election, he
has found that elected officials, KMT members and relatives were put
in a difficult situation after being asked to take sides among the
KMT hopefuls.</P>
      <P>"In the long run, this would seriously undermine the solidarity
within the party," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>After his withdrawal from the race, the other three KMT hopefuls
left in the field to vie for a chance to represent the KMT in the
year-end election are former Taipei Vice Mayor Yeh Chin-chuan,
Legislator Ting Shou-chung and former Environmental Protection
Administrator Hau Lung-bin.</P>
      <P>Chiang said that KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou and KMT Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan, both of whom he visited, support his decision.
Chiang also called on Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he had hoped for a chance to serve through a fair and
just democratic mechanism, but had to reconsider his bid in the wake
of the latest developments.</P>
      <P>He said that from his past experience as KMT secretary-general,
he knows that solidarity within the party will be the key in
competition with other parties, and that he had to consider the best
interests of the party.</P>
      <P>Yeh, whose support is catching up with the front runner, Hau, in
polls, lauded Chiang, a former foreign affairs minister, for his
expertise in diplomatic and cross-Taiwan Strait affairs.</P>
      <P>Yeh also said that he would call on Chiang to seek his advice on
city administration.</P>
      <P>Chiang declined to discuss who he will support after his
withdrawal.</P>
      <P>Ting, who has the support of Lien, said that his ideal of
upgrading the competitiveness of Taipei City remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Although facing an uphill battle, Ting said that "giving up has
never been one of my options."</P>
      <P>Ma said the primary has a fair competition mechanism and that he
will respect the wills of all aspirants.</P>
      <P>As long as there is more than one hopeful wanting to take part in
the election, the party will follow the set procedure of holding a
primary and will then throw its weight behind the winning candidate in
the election.</P>
      <P>Asked about integration with its ally, the People First Party, Ma
said that both the KMT and PFP have yet to field their candidates and
that if both parties field candidates, he will coordinate with the
PFP to study whether to field one candidate to represent both parties
in the election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>REPORTER FINED FOR THIRD TIME FOR REFUSING TO GIVE TESTIMONY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court fined a United Daily
News reporter NT$30,000 for the third time in a row Wednesday after
he again refused to give testimony about his sources for a news story
that is part of a court hearing on an insider stock trading case.</P>
      <P>Kao Nien-yi remained silent on the question of who gave him the
information he reported March 16, 2005 regarding an insider trading
scandal in which senior government officials are allegedly involved.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said they believe Lee Chin-cheng, former director
of the Examination Bureau of the Financial Supervisory Commission and
a key suspect in the case, might have leaked critical information to
Kao, whose story was used as a tool by Lee's stock-trading friends,
who stand accused of making illicit profits.</P>
      <P>In that story, Kao reported that Lee gave his friends advance
information on a government probe of illegal trading of Power
Quotient International Co.'s shares. Armed with the information, they
made huge gains by selling short on the small computer company's
stock, leading to an extremely volatile stock market at the time.</P>
      <P>Liu Shou-sung, a spokesman for the court, said the court handed
down the fine because it claimed Kao had "neither a proper reason nor
the right" to refuse testimony.</P>
      <P>Kao's newspaper has pledged to lodge a formal complaint against
the court ruling on the consecutive fines, claiming that freedom of
the press and the country's democratic system are at stake.</P>
      <P>Other media organizations and journalist groups have also voiced
support for the reporter, urging the court to respect the ethics of
their profession and not to infringe on their constitutionally
protected rights.</P>
      <P>Government Information Minister Cheng Wen-tsang called for a
rational debate on the issue, which he said involves "two important
values in a democracy" -- freedom of the press and judicial
independence.</P>
      <P>Freedom of the press is a pivot of democracy, while judicial
jurisdiction is the last defense of social justice, Cheng noted.
"Both are important. When they are in conflict, we need a rational
debate to clear things up," he added.</P>
      <P>As to whether a criminal act has been committed in the process,
that is something the judicial authorities are still investigating,
he added.</P>

has vigorously attempted to do for the past ten years, President Chen
Shui-bian said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting with the French
parliament's pro-Taiwan group at the Presidential Office. He
expressed hope the group's leader Senator Monique Papon and other
members would exert their influence to help Taiwan participate in WHO
(World Health Organization) activities.</P>
      <P>France has sold a large amount of weapons to Taiwan, including
Lafayette-class warships and Mirage 2000 aircraft which are still the
mainstay of Taiwan's armed forces, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He noted that bilateral trade between Taiwan and France reached
almost US$4 billion in 2005, with France registering a US$1.1 billion
trade deficit, adding that Taiwan is France's 6th largest import
country and 5th largest export market.</P>
      <P>As there should not be any question of national boundaries when
it comes to public health promotion and the prevention of epidemics,
Taiwan's 23 million people must not be deprived of their right to
health, Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Chen criticized China's poor human rights record, which he
claimed has shown no improvement since the 1989 Tiananmen incident,
as China remains a country where there is no freedom of speech,
freedom of assembly or freedom of the press.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he continued, China passed the "Anti-Secession" Law in
March last year, and has increasingly deployed missiles targeting
Taiwan. Therefore, European countries should maintain the arms
embargo on China, Chen added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMOCRATIC TAIWAN CORNERSTONE OF ASIA-PACIFIC SECURITY: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Taiwan is the cornerstone of
Asia-Pacific security, a visiting Taiwan official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Tan Sun Chen made the
remarks during a speech delivered at a forum on Taiwan affairs
organized by Waseda University in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and Japan are on the "same boat" in the face
of China's increasing military power, the former ROC minister of
foreign affairs said the two countries should cooperate closely to
maintain the peace and security in the Asian and Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"The west Pacific where Taiwan and Japan are located is not
politically stable, with democratic and communist forces competing
with each other on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, " Chen said,
adding that while Taiwan has been devoting itself to democratization,
China is using its new-found economic power to expand its global
hegemony.</P>
      <P>Noting how Taiwan and Japan have played a key role in China's
modernization and economic rise, Chen said Japan had offered
development aid worth US$30 billion to China, while Taiwanese
investors have been injecting US$280 billion into its economy.</P>
      <P>Despite this, China has spared no efforts in squeezing Taiwan's
presence within the international community, Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>With China's military spending growing by double digits every
year, Chen said Japan and other Asian countries should also question
the motivation behind such a phenomenon.</P>
      <P>"Although China is using every method to obstruct Taiwan's
democracy, the island should not concede in this field, as democracy
is the treasure and the bottom line of Taiwan," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed gratitude to Japan for offering Taiwanese
tourists 30-day visa-free treatment during his term as ROC foreign
minister and for hailing Taiwan's democratization as U.S. President
George W. Bush did in his speech delivered in Kyoto last November.</P>
      <P>Stressing that democracy is a core value shared by Taiwan, Japan
and the United States, Chen said the three countries should
strengthen their cooperation to protect democracy in the
Asian-Pacific region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER CONFIDENT ABOUT TIES WITH SOLOMON ISLANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang
Chih-fang said Wednesday he is confident that diplomatic relations
between Taiwan and the Solomon Islands will remain intact, despite
the recent turmoil in the South Pacific island nation.</P>
      <P>Huang was responding to foreign wire service reports that quoted
the Solomon Islands' sole opposition candidate for prime minister,
Manasseh Sogavare, as saying earlier the same day that if elected he
will consider severing diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the political situation in the Solomon Islands has
not yet stabilized following a recent riot in the country's capital
city, Huang said various political forces are now vying for the power
to form the next Cabinet.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has devoted long-term efforts to maintaining extensive
ties with both ruling and opposition parties in the Solomon Islands,
Huang said he is confident that bilateral relations won't be affected
by the country's recent political developments.</P>
      <P>At a time when the Solomon Islands is undergoing a power
transition, Huang said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) dares
not let down its guard and will keep close tabs on all relevant
developments.</P>
      <P>The Solomon Islands' capital of Honiara was wracked by burning
and looting -- mostly businesses owned by ethnic Chinese there --
after its parliament elected Snyder Rini as prime minister April 18.
The situation abated after Australia and New Zealand sent troops and
police officers to maintain law and order.</P>
      <P>Australian officials claimed the riot was a reaction to Taiwan's
involvement in the Solomon Islands' prime minister election. But
Huang dismissed the claim, stressing the Republic of China's
government had no involvement in its ally's election.</P>
      <P>Following Rini's resignation Tuesday on the eve of the opening of
the new parliamentary session, the Solomon Islands' political
situation has again caused concern.</P>
      <P>Rini will serve as caretaker prime minister until the parliament
elects a replacement. On Wednesday, Sogavare was appointed as the
sole opposition candidate in the upcoming prime minister election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IMPOSSIBLE TO LOWER NOISE LEVEL BELOW 48DB IN S. SCIENCE PARK: NSC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It's simply impossible to lower the noise
level to below 48 decibels in Southern Taiwan Science Park, where a
vibration-reduction engineering project has become the subject of
controversy, a senior National Science Council official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ching-chih, an NSC vice chairman, said even without the
noise from high-speed trains running through the park, its background
noise was already at the 50-52 decibel level.</P>
      <P>He claimed that from the very outset, it was a "mission
impossible" when the Ministry of Transportation and Communications
(MOTC) and the NCS discussed the target of lowering the noise level
to below 48 decibels.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added, it was not an issue that the NSC allowed a
private contractor to try to complete that impossible mission, since
the project was aimed merely at "reducing" the vibration or noise
level -- or improving it.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the comment as some have suspected irregularities may
have occurred during the process of selecting the project's winning
contractor.</P>
      <P>For example, in an area 200 meters from the high-speed railway,
Hung Hua Technology Engineering Co. has managed to bring down the
noise level from 60db to 50db, which is quite an improvement, he
said.</P>
      <P>When high-tech companies set up their own production lines, they
will install their own facilities so that manufacturing sites would
have a noise level as low as 30db or 20db, he added.</P>
      <P>In response to Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Legislator Liao
Pen-yen's suspicion that the NSC might have been overcharged by the
private contractor, Hsieh said even if it were just one cent, NSC
would "demand it back."</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lee Chi-chu quoted an April 6
administrative court ruling as saying the NSC went ahead to decide on
a winning contractor in spite of the fact that none of the competing
companies had presented a proposal that met the NCS's own
requirements.</P>
      <P>She said the NCS will have to explain why it decided to waste
taxpayer money to build a "vibration reduction" wall that it knew
full well would not work.</P>
      <P>Hsieh and other officials, including those at the science park,
will attend a legislative committee meeting to face lawmakers'
questions Thursday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of inbound passengers reached
860,000 in the first quarter of this year, marking a 7.5 percent
year-on-year growth, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting
and Statistics (DGBAS) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Among them, tourists accounted for 352,000, up 12.8 percent from
the year-earlier level, and business travelers numbered 237,000.</P>
      <P>Japan remained the largest source of visitors to Taiwan,
accounting for 294,000 or 34.2 percent of the total and representing
a 7.5 percent year-on-year increase.</P>
      <P>Visitors from Hong Kong and Macau formed the second largest group
of inbound passengers, accounting for 101,000, according to DGBAS
tallies.</P>
      <P>The United States was the third largest source of visitors to
Taiwan during the January-March period, totaling 91,000.</P>
      <P>During the first three months of this year, Taiwan citizens made
2.03 million overseas visits, up 7.9 percent from the year-earlier
level.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong remained Taiwan people's top overseas travel
destination, making 693,000 visits during the three-month period.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwan visitors to Thailand registered a 58.7
percent year-on-year growth in the first quarter, DGBAS officials
said, adding that the steep rise was attributable to a relatively
small number of travelers to that country last spring following the
tsunami disaster in South and Southeast Asia in December 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCO AIMED AT COUNTER-BALANCING U.S. CONTAINMENT: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  26 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Shanghai Cooperation Organization
(SCO) allows China to offset the perceived attempt by the United
States to surround and contain China, said a Hong Kong professor
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Barry Sautman, an associate professor of the Department of Social
Science at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told
CNA in a telephone interview that the abovementioned purposes of the
organization are more important than its stated objectives of
anti-terrorism and combating separatism.</P>
      <P>With the organization moving beyond anti-terrorism to projects
involving military cooperation, it is trying to impress on the West
-- particularly the United States -- that it would be unsuccessful in
any attempt to contain China, such as the case in the 1950s and 60s,
he said.</P>
      <P>This is one reason why Chinese and Russian leaders are anxious to
expand the organization to include other countries in Western Asia,
such as Iran, India and Pakistan, he added.</P>
      <P>"In fact it means that most countries surrounding China would be
more or less friendly -- or at least well disposed toward China --
through the Shanghai Cooperation Organization," he said.</P>
      <P>However, Sautmen said that some member countries may have
different reasons for participating in the quasi-alliance.</P>
      <P>"Some Central Asian countries see China as a counter-balance to
Russia," he said.</P>
      <P>However, he said, most of the quasi-alliance's results would be
in the realm of psychological warfare.</P>
      <P>"What China's trying to do is basically show that wing of opinion
in U.S. solid circles that any attempt on their part to create a bloc
to surround China -- or contain China -- would be fruitless because
China has created a counter-organization involving neighboring
countries," he said.</P>
      <P>U.S. leaders, he added, certainly don't want to have any kind of
competing regional organizations, especially given the fact they 
have been rebuffed in their attempt to gain observer status in the 
SCO.</P>
      <P>Sautman also noted that the SCO is stronger than it was several
years ago.</P>
      <P>The SCO was founded in 2001 based on an informal regional
alliance set up in 1996. Its members include China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.</P>
      <P>Mongolia, Pakistan, India and Iran are observers at SCO meetings.</P>
      <P>The SCO held a one-day defense ministers' meeting in Beijing
Wednesday, in which the six nations announced they will hold joint
anti-terrorism exercises in Russia next year.</P>
      <P>The Chinese side has said that SCO is not aimed at confronting
other parts of the world and will not damage the interests of other
countries.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Timothy J. Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Ma
Ying-jeou proposed Wednesday that Taiwan explore new ways to improve
ties with China, such as signing a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and
other measures conducive to Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in a speech titled "Standing on Taiwan,
Looking at the World," at National Cheng Kung University in Tainan in
southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ma said to an audience of students: "We should try our best to
find opportunities for Taiwan, such as signing an FTA with countries
like the United States and Singapore, in the same way that Panama has
been the first country to sign an FTA with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He noted that members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) are promoting a "ten plus one" or "ten plus two or
three" trade zone, which will eventually include Japan, China, and
South Korea -- but possibly exclude Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Globalization doesn't just mean speaking English or going abroad;
rather, it means taking advantage of Taiwan's being at the center and
the front door of East Asia, Ma said, adding that it also means to
explore any opportunities or connections with China, including
signing an FTA.</P>
      <P>Ma also suggested that Taiwan open its doors as soon as possible
to China's high school graduates so they would be able to study at
Taiwan's universities, a move he claimed would decrease hostilities
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan needs to shore up its national
defense instead of emphasizing its independent sovereign status, a
Japanese law professor who spent part of his youth in Taiwan before
World War II said at a Taipei seminar Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"From the international law perspective, Taiwan is already an
independent country with its own territory, government and people,"
said Shigeru Oda, a professor at Japan's Tohoku University and a
former judge of the International Court of Justice for 27 years.</P>
      <P>"There's no need for Taiwan to stress the fact of independence, "
Oda said. "Instead, what Taiwan urgently needs to do is shore up its
national defense."</P>
      <P>The Oda family enjoyed a deep relationship with Taiwan when the
island was under Japanese colonial rule (1895-1945). During that
period, Oda's grandfather and father served as doctors in Taiwan,
helping to establish medical schools on the island.</P>
      <P>Oda, 79, grew up and received most of his secondary education in
Taipei before returning to Tokyo in 1945 to pursue an international
law career, which has taken him to the U.S. and the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>During the last 60 years, Oda has occasionally visited Taiwan and
described himself as "nostalgic" and holding special feelings for the
island.</P>
      <P>Oda addressed a full house about how the Taiwanese were reluctant
to talk about politics after the tragic Feb. 28 Incident of 1947 in
which many elite Taiwanese professionals were jailed or executed by
the then-Kuomintang government.</P>
      <P>In his view, Oda continued, Taiwan was wrong to adopt an
"all or nothing" approach in its battle to defend its seat in the
United Nations in the early 1970s. Because of then-President Chiang
Kai-shek's reluctance to make any compromise on the Republic of
China's national title, the U.N. General Assembly came to adopt
Resolution No. 2758 in 1971, giving the "China" seat to Beijing at
the expense of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The seminar "My perspective on Taiwan" was part of a series of
activities to commemorate the late ruling Democratic Progressive
Party Chairman Huang Shin-chieh. It was co-organized by the Ketagalan
Institute and the International Cultural Foundation.</P>

NT$90,0000 (US$2,812.5) in accordance with the law on epidemic

you meet one who is not a proper person to speak to and you speak to
him, you waste your words. A man of intelligence never loses his
opportunity, neither does he waste his words."</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan's representative to Britain, Edgar
Lin, urged the European Union Wednesday to pay attention to China's
rise and study its possible impact on global security.</P>
      <P>Expressing his doubts about Beijing's claim to be pursuing a

rapid economic growth to build up its military with the ambition of
becoming a superpower.</P>
      <P>While China's arms spending power is second only to the United
States, Beijing has never relaxed its efforts to suppress Taiwan in
the international arena, Lin said.</P>

      <P>During a question and answer session, Lin said that as Beijing

    <HEADLINE>DPP DENIES PRESIDENT LEADING MOVE TO BOOST NUMBER OF LEGISLATIVE SEATS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party Thursday denied as "groundless" reports
that President Chen Shui-bian has been quietly leading a campaign to
increase the number of legislative seats from 113 to 164 and to adopt
the Cabinet system of government.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun and Yeh Yi-jin, leaders of the DPP caucus, said
the president cares only about "giving Taiwan a suitable
Constitution" but has never gone into such details as to how many
seats should be adopted in the coming amendments to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>To change the number of legislative seats, the Constitution must
be amended. And to change a Constitutional provision, a proposal must
be signed by a quarter of the legislators, who would then vote on
whether or not to put the proposal to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>The proposal would require the support of three-quarters of the
lawmakers in a legislative session attended by at least
three-quarters of all legislators. This is why it is considered to be
a "high threshold" for any Constitutional amendment proposal to pass
the legislature. After that, the legislature-approved proposal would
be put to a national referendum.</P>
      <P>In spite of the difficulties in having a constitutional provision
revised, lawmakers from all the major parties at the Legislative Yuan
have been quietly forming a "united front" to try to change the
provision on the number of seats in the next and future legislature,
a local newspaper reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The report said President Chen Shui-bian has been behind the
campaign, a report that the DPP caucus called "groundless."</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-chun said the Constitution had just been amended last
year to cut the number of legislative seats by half. If the lawmakers
themselves propose another amendment just to increase their own
chances of getting re-elected, this will leave a bad taste in the
people's mouths, he added.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun also said the party cannot seek to "turn
the clock back" when it comes to amending the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Regarding the election of the members of the legislature, the
Constitution was amended last year to include a clause on the "single
constituency, two votes" system to come into effect in 2007. Last
year's amendments also enshrined the general public's right to
referendum, an achievement that President Chen has said he is proud
of.</P>
      <P>"In the future, " Yu said, "the DPP will not support any
constitutional amendment proposals that are not in accord with the
spirit and purpose of national referendum."</P>
      <P>Claiming that he remains "completely neutral" in this
controversy, legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng said increasing the
number of legislative seats is something that should at least be
discussed. "How realistic it is to amend the Constitution in that way
is another story," he added.</P>
      <P>One hundred and thirteen legislative seats indeed are "too few, "
he said, adding that "what should be reformed should be reformed, for
the sake the country."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan maintains stable and close
relations with the Solomon Islands but has never interfered in any
democratic elections of the South Pacific nation, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Donald Lee, director-general of the MOFA's
Department of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Taiwan has provided a
lot of assistance to the Solomon Islands to promote the country's
national development projects since the two countries established
diplomatic relations in 1983, and both sides have developed a close
relationship over the past 20 years.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Taiwan also maintains good relations with Manasseh
Sogavare, the Solomon Islands' sole opposition candidate for prime
minister, and that Sogavare's Social Credit Party is supportive of
the diplomatic relations with Taiwan and Taiwan's bids to join the
United Nations and other international organizations.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks during a regular news briefing in the wake
of reports that Sogavare will consider severing diplomatic ties with
Taiwan if elected.</P>
      <P>Snyder Rini, who was elected by the Solomon Islands' parliament
as prime minister April 18, resigned Tuesday on the eve of the
opening of the new parliamentary session.</P>
      <P>Rini's election to the post triggered riots in the Solomon
Islands amid rumors that Taiwan or China had been involved in
influencing the election outcome.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said there is no reason for Taiwan to
try to influence the election because the majority of the
parliamentarians in the Solomon Islands are in favor of maintaining
diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>

Wall Street Journal: Economy's Surge Stirs Questions About When
Slowdown May Come

The latest readings suggest the United States' economy is
carrying significant momentum into the second quarter, raising new
questions about when a slowdown might come after a torrid start to
the year. By most accounts, the economy surged in the first quarter
after a brief lull late last year. Over the rest of the year, Federal
Reserve officials expect growth to moderate to a long- term rate of 3
percent to 3.5 percent, slow enough to keep inflation at bay but fast
enough to keep unemployment from rising. That would permit the Fed to
stop the campaign of interest-rate increases it began in June 2004.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of legislators urged the National
Communications Commission (NCC) Thursday to see to it that the number
of mobile phone base stations (MPBS) around the country be
substantially cut to return to the Taiwan public a safe and
radiation-free environment.</P>
      <P>According to NCC Vice Chairman Liu Tsung-teh, there are 26,000
base stations for 2G mobile phones, 6,500 base stations for 3G mobile
phones and 16,000 base stations for personal handy-phone systems
(PHS), for atotal of about 48,000 base stations around the country.</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Kuo
Chun-ming said he wants the NCC to "strongly intervene" in efforts to
cut the number of base stations by at least half since the coverage
rate of existing MPBSs is more than five times the amount that Taiwan
residents actually need.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tsai Chi-chang asked Liu whether the number of
base stations can be cut by half in the future and said that the NCC
should demonstrate its authority by controlling the number of base
stations.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator Tsai Cheng-yuan said that based
on the ratio of mobile phone base station efficiency to the area of
Taiwan, the island needs no more than 10,000 base stations. He urged
the NCC to deal with this issue without delay so as to avoid public
protests, particularly by people in residential and school areas.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that residential neighborhoods and schools must not be
exposed to the risk of radiation which might cause cancer,
miscarriages, and diseases of the nervous system, and may even drive
people to suicide, arguing that existing mobile phone base stations
must be made to move out of such areas, as studies show that
radiation levels at such facilities in Taipei and Tainan all surpass
reasonable levels.</P>

Straits (AETATS), who recently said he would invite Taiwanese fruit,
fishery and agricultural associations to Beijing in May to discuss
technical issues surrounding Taiwanese farm produce exports.</P>
      <P>Fu said the government's policy of delegating that line of
business to TAITRA has not altered, adding that both governments can
begin negotiating on the issue if China is really sincere about
importing Taiwan fruit.</P>
      <P>The government assigned TAITRA as the liaison office regarding
Taiwan's farm produce exports to China in June last year.</P>
      <P>Since China announced its duty-free policy on importing 15 kinds
of Taiwanese fruit last August, the ROC government has been urging
the Chinese authorities to discuss measures of implementing the
policy, Fu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 20% OF FIFTH, SIX GRADERS HAVE THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 27 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A member of the Taipei City Council called
on the nation's parents and school authorities Thursday to pay heed
to the emotional inner life of fifth and sixth graders after a survey
showed 26.4 percent of children in that age group have had thoughts
of taking their own life.</P>
      <P>City Councilor Lee Yen-hsiu made the call after releasing the
results of the survey, which was conducted Feb. 23-March 9 on fifth
and sixth graders from 12 elementary schools -- representing 12
administrative districts of Taipei -- and their parents.</P>
      <P>Some 1,137 effective samples were collected with a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 49.7 percent of students responded they
had once felt "sick of their life" while 26.4 percent said they had
thought of committing suicide.</P>
      <P>Among that number, 70.8 percent said their greatest source of
pressure was to get high scores in school, while 9.5 percent said
their parents were the greatest burden in their mind.</P>
      <P>Lee said the survey also found that most fifth and sixth graders
try to let off steam by playing computer games or sports, airing
their grievances with friends or seeking comfort through religion.
However, 25.7 percent of the students said they usually take the
pressure in silence, she noted, urging school authorities to pay
closer attention to students' emotional difficulties.</P>
      <P>Psychiatrist Lee Kuang-huei, who was also present at the news
conference held by Lee and her colleague Chin Li-fang at the city
council to publicize the survey, confirmed that most of today's
elementary school students are under great pressure to perform
academically and show signs of developing symptoms of melancholia.</P>
      <P>However, children suffering from depression develop different
symptoms than adults, Lee said, noting that kids more often carry out
actions of self-harm. If their parents would be more careful to take
the time to listen to their children for few minutes, a child's
emotional disorder may be easily adjusted, Lee added.</P>

      <P>The Taichung City Government will organize
a conference Friday aimed at gathering experts' opinions on ways to
improve public order and safety in the city, Taichung's Mayor Jason
Hu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hu said that Taichung's social order has long been criticized,
and he hopes that experts in the field will provide advice on how to
make the city a safer place.</P>
      <P>Experts such as Professor Yang Shu-lung, director of National
Chung Cheng University's Graduate Institute of Criminology and
Professor Meng Wei-teh of Central Police University will attend the
conference. Former Premier Hau Pei-tsun is also invited because one
of his principal achievements in the early 1990s was to improve law

      <P>Yeh Kun-fu, director-general of the Taichung City Police
Department, said the purpose of the conference is to determine the
real problems at issue so the city can improve its crime-fighting
policies.</P>
      <P>The police chief added that the Taichung City Government has
significantly expanded its police force, but that he still receives
negative feedback on the city's law and order.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) ,
Taiwan's quasi-official intermediary body tasked with cross-strait
exchanges, has offered assistance to families of Taiwanese tourists
who were recently injured in a car accident in Zhangzhou, China, but
the SEF's request for a travel permit fell on deaf ears.</P>
      <P>SEF Secretary-General You Ying-lung said Thursday that his office
wrote the day before to the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- the SEF's counterpart in Beijing -- asking
for permission for Huang Kuo-jui -- a SEF director in charge of
travel affairs -- to accompany the Taiwanese tourists' families to
Zhangzhou so he could facilitate medical treatment, rehabilitation
and related affairs for the injured.</P>
      <P>The SEF, however, did not hear from ARATS until Thursday at noon,
when the Taiwanese families were departing Kinmen Island for
Zhangzhou, You lamented.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC)
plans to forward its draft redistricting proposal for next year's
legislative elections to the Legislative Yuan for passage before the
end of May as scheduled, a CEC spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Teng Tien-you made the remarks while commenting on news reports
that said several lawmakers were preparing to submit a constitutional
revision proposal to the Legislative Yuan in May to seek an increase
in the number of legislative seats from 113 to 164, a change in the
electoral system to multiple seats per constituency and the adoption
of the parliamentary system.</P>
      <P>A constitutional reform package passed in June 2005, which
stipulated that starting from the seventh legislature -- to be
elected in late 2007 -- the total number of seats will be halved from
225 to 113, and the electoral system for legislators will be changed
into a "single-seat constituency, two votes" format -- that is, one
vote for candidates, and the other for political parties.</P>
      <P>Based on the reforms, the CEC worked out the redistricting
proposal months ago, which states that among all the 25 counties and
cities, 10 will have one seat each, while the constituencies of the
others must be redistricted in proportion to population size.</P>
      <P>A total of 73 seats will be elected from regional districts,
while six seats are reserved for aboriginal representatives and 34
seats for at-large and overseas Taiwanese representatives.
Legislators will serve four-year terms rather than the current
three-year terms, according to the revised Constitution.</P>
      <P>Teng said the CEC will not adjust the existing procedure in
handling redistricting despite some lawmakers' new proposal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Universities that have received special
funding from the Ministry of Education (MOE) should not hike their
tuition fees, Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tu was referring to 23 universities which have received funding
under a five-year, NT$50 billion-dollar higher education subsidy
program and a teaching excellence subsidy program.</P>
      <P>Tu noted that a panel under the MOE will review plans by local
universities to hike tuition fees and will decide by the end of
May whether to approve the proposals.</P>
      <P>In considering the plans, the ministry should ensure the
hikes are reasonable and that they take into account the financial
ability of the underprivileged, Tu said.</P>
      <P>Tu made the remarks during a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Education and Culture Committee, where Tu was invited to brief
lawmakers on the ministry's policy regarding university tuition.</P>
      <P>According to the MOE's Department of Higher Education, the
ministry approved only 10 out of 145 plans proposed by public
universities to hike tuition fees last year.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Cheng Chin-ling argued
that while private universities should enjoy some autonomy in

      <P>The public were urged Thursday to only

period. However, there was no information about where it was
circulated, and the milk did not undergo any official quality
testing.</P>
      <P>Citing DOH data, they said there are currently 78 brands of
infant formula, as well as 43 brands of follow-on formula, certified
by the DOH, and that most of the products are imported from Europe,
America and Oceania.</P>
      <P>All the certified products are labeled before they are put on the

law that allows dishonest traders to market uncertified baby food as

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATORS EXPRESS APPREHENSION ABOUT HIGH-SPEED RAILWAY SAFETY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators of both the ruling and
opposition parties expressed apprehension Thursday that Taiwan's
high-speed railway, scheduled to be launched by the end of October,
may not be up to required safety standards.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Transportation Committee,
legislators of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) told officials of the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications that the scheduled opening of the
high-speed railway in October should not be a decision based on
political considerations.</P>
      <P>The legislators indicated that their concern about the safety of
the railway is based on their observations that the project's
construction is seriously behind schedule, and that the Taiwan
High-Speed Railway Corp. (THSRC) has run out of funds.</P>
      <P>The THSRC has already delayed the scheduled launch of the
high-speech train service twice -- from June 2003 to October 2005 and
again to October this year.</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation and Communications Kuo Yao-chi gave
her assurance at the legislature earlier this month that if the
high-speed railway again fails to open as scheduled by the end of
October, she will resign to take responsibility.</P>
      <P>At the Transportation Committee meeting Thursday, KMT legislator
Joanna Lei presented a document showing that inspections of Section
C230 of the railway in Miaoli, southern Taiwan, found that the
strength of the cement used for the project was not up to standards.</P>
      <P>However, she added, instead of having the problem remedied for
the sake of public safety, the THSRC was allowed to pay a fine.</P>
      <P>DPP legislator Kuo Wen-chen reminded transportation officials
that they should not allow political considerations to compromise the
safety of the high-speed railway.</P>
      <P>Kuo said he will be happy to see the railway to open as scheduled
in October if its safety is not a concern.</P>
      <P>"If delaying the opening of the railway service for another two
months could make it safer, it will be all right with me," he said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of March, the construction of the 345km railway
linking Taipei and Kaohsiung -- Taiwan's two largest cities -- was
about 95 percent complete.</P>
      <P>When in operation, the train will run at 200 kph and could reduce
the time for the journey between Taipei and Kaohsiung to 90 minutes.</P>
      <P>The DPP government has been under fire for providing NT$308.3
billion (US$9.5 billion) in government loans to the THSRC without
oversight, against the NT$130 billion capital invested by the
company's five shareholders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIME FOR TAIWANESE BUSINESSES TO INVEST IN INDIA: FORUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is time for Taiwanese businesses to
invest in India and learn more about the country, experts and
officials said Thursday in a wide-ranging forum that discussed
Taiwan-India trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>"If you don't invest now, somebody else will, " said Gopal
Srinivasan, Director of TVS Electronics Ltd., in the two-day forum
titled "Seize the India Trend: International Forum on Taiwan-India
Commercial Exchanges."</P>
      <P>Taiwanese businesses can duplicate their success in the 1990s in
China in India, which is regarded as the next "world factory" after
China and one of the fastest-emerging economies in the world, said
Vijay Gokhale, Director-General of India-Taipei Association, India's
de facto embassy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gokhale said Taiwan's "Go South Policy" and India's "Look East
Policy" are a perfect match as Taiwan looks to shake off its economic
dependency on China while India is trying to bring in foreign
investment.</P>
      <P>It makes no sense that Taiwan's trade with India is less than 1
percent of its total trade, while its trade with China, the United
States, Japan and the European Union -- the other four of the world's
five largest economies -- all exceeded 10 percent, said Yu Shyi-kun,
chairman of the Taiwan-India Cooperation Council (TICC).</P>
      <P>"The reason for Taiwan to increase investment in India is not
just for its cheap labor. It's for the excellent brains of the Indian
work force, " said Ko Chen-en, president of Chung-hua Institution
for Economic Research.</P>
      <P>And it is better to invest in India sooner than later, since
Japanese and Korean corporations such as Suzuki, Samsung, Hyundai
Motors and LG Electronics have all made their moves and have enjoyed
relative success, Srinivasan noted.</P>
      <P>Stan Shih, founder of the Acer Group said in a keynote speech
that "Taiwan is developing its knowledge economy and business
innovation, both of which need a large-scale market to be
successful."</P>
      <P>TICC, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Taiwan ThinkTank
organized the forum, which is being attended by more than 200
government officials, business representatives and scholars from
India and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A total of 10 speeches covering areas such as auto components,
textiles, medical services and electronics will be held Friday,

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan announced Thursday that local
businessmen can now invest in small-sized flat panel production and
low-end semiconductor packaging and testing technology in China.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) --
Taiwan's top China policy planner -- announced that the government
has decided to remove restrictions on investment in thin film
transistor-liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCDs) of four inches and less
in China and the export of low-end chip packing and testing
technology to China under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>Wu said the opening, which goes into effect immediately, was
decided after the MAC completed lengthy discussions with relevant
government agencies, including the Executive Yuan and the National
Security Council, as well as the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Ing-san made a similar
announcement later in the day, saying that from Thursday, investment
in such TFT-LCD production in China and exports of wire bond chip
packaging and ELE testing technology to China will be removed from
the government's "restricted" list.</P>
      <P>Interested Taiwan companies can file their applications with the
Ministry of Economic Affairs as long as they have operated identical
businesses in Taiwan, can fully control their future investment in
China and have a global marketing strategy, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>He added that although these two categories of investment were
removed from Taiwan government's restricted list, such investment is
still considered "major" and "influential." Thus, he said, the
investment plans filed by Taiwan companies to the Ministry of
Economic Affairs will still have to be assessed and reviewed
individually by a supra-ministerial screening ad hoc group.</P>

      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said at a gathering
with business leaders Thursday that the government will pragmatically
handle the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Proclaiming his confidence in Taiwan, Su said as long as the
Taiwanese identity and policy initiatives are well-managed, good
results will come of the government's trade and economic policies
toward China.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while hosting a breakfast meeting
with business leaders at the Executive Yuan, his first such meeting
since becoming premier in March.</P>
      <P>On the government's response to the 15-point consensus reached at
the recent Kuomintang-Communist Party of China economic forum in
Beijing, Su said that some of the proposed measures have already been
implemented while others are under negotiation, adding
"we've already received some positive response from the stock

      <P>Theodore Huang, chairman of the Chinese National Association of
Industry and Commerce, urged the government to take more constructive
steps to upgrade from the "mini three links" to the "middle three

businesses investing more than 40 percent of their capital in China.</P>

differences over charter flights have narrowed although it may take a
little longer to settle them.</P>
      <P>Business leaders hope to discuss more mid- to long- term
development strategies during the Economic Sustainable Development

Taiwan investors would not have to set up shop abroad.</P>

care of minorities and the disadvantaged and leading a clean and
competent government are my administrative priorities," Su said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian decorated the
outgoing deputy head of the U.S. representative office in Taipei
Thursday in recognition of his contribution to the promotion of
relations between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Chen conferred the Order of Brilliant Star with Violet Grand
Cordon on David J. Keegan, deputy director of the Taipei Office of
the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , at a ceremony held at the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Keegan said he was honored to receive
the decoration.</P>
      <P>Despite the substantial changes in Taiwan's social and political
situation since his first visit to Taiwan 30 years ago, Keegan said,
the Taiwan people's can-do spirit and vitality have remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Over the past three decades, Keegan recalled, he has come to
Taiwan on numerous occasions and has witnessed the blooming of the
country's opposition and its transformation into a liberal democracy.</P>
      <P>During his stint as deputy director of the AIT Taipei Office from
September 2003, Keegan said he has observed three nationwide
elections, including the ferociously contested 2004 presidential
election. Each of them, he said, manifested Taiwan's democratic gusto
and dynamism.</P>
      <P>Touching on bilateral relations, Keegan said he is convinced that
the longstanding friendship between Taiwan and the United States will
remain cordial.</P>
      <P>AIT Taipei Office Director Stephen Young, Presidential Office
Deputy Secretary-General Ma Yung-cheng and Vice Minister of Foreign
Affairs Huang Lung-yuan were present at the ceremony.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BBC ANCHOR STRESSES MEDIA'S `GATEKEEPING' RESPONSIBILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The media should accommodate itself to
modern technology and "citizen journalism, " while still being
accountable to its "gatekeeping" responsibility, British Broadcasting
Corporation (BBC) anchor Nik Gowing said in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>Because of modern technology such as mobile phones, handycams and
the Internet, there is much more first-hand information coming to the
media directly from citizens. The media needs to move with this trend
but should still check and validate sources, said Gowing.</P>
      <P>Gowing, who was invited by the British Chamber of Commerce in
Taipei to deliver a speech at its monthly luncheon, has been the main
anchor on BBC World, the BBC's 24-hour international TV news and
information channel, since 1996.</P>
      <P>In covering the South Asia tsunami, Hurricane Katrina's damage in
the United States and the London Underground bombing, the media
resorted to citizens to provide first-hand information and
observations, he said, adding that following the bombings in London,
the BBC received more than 1,000 images, 20 video clips, 3,000 text
messages and 20,000 emails from London citizens relating to the
event.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, he said, citizens often provide more information
following major news events than the media, which in turn provides
more information than government agencies most of the time.</P>
      <P>"The job of people like me or other BBC staff is to check and
validate, " Gowing said. "The media needs to produce real-time
reports and react quickly, but we'd rather wait a little bit longer
before reporting as the validation is going on," he said.</P>
      <P>News reporting today has "higher impact and shorter time frame"
because of the information explosion and development of technology,
which makes it even more important for the media to provide correct
reporting, Gowing said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is ready to play host to Chinese
tourists and can implement this policy at any moment, so long as
cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations on the issue are completed, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Responding to media reports that China plans to allow its people
to make sightseeing trips to Taiwan from July 1 this year, Wu said
that although the Chinese authorities have on many occasions promised
that they will talk with Taiwan on many issues, they had often
reneged on their promises in the past.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is not sure whether the latest report about China's
plans to allow its citizens to make tourism trips to Taiwan from July
can be materialized.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he went on, he welcomes the notion of allowing the
Chinese public to make tourism trips to Taiwan, since China remains a
tightly controlled and censored society and the only way to allow the
Chinese people to gain first-hand understanding of Taiwan is to have
them visit Taiwan in person.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LOOMING ENERGY CRISIS CHALLENGES DPP'S NUCLEAR-FREE POLICY: VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday
that progress in nuclear technology and a looming global energy
crisis have posed new challenges to the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's (DPP's) nuclear-free homeland policy.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks on the sidelines of a seminar on convincing
Taiwan investors to invest in an industrial park development project
in El Salvador.</P>
      <P>The vice president was responding to a newspaper report that she
told a DPP Central Standing Committee meeting Wednesday that the
ruling party should review its anti-nuclear policy now that
proponents claim that nuclear power has turned into "green energy."</P>
      <P>Asked whether she supported the development of nuclear power, Lu
clarified that she just wanted to raise the question for specialists
to delve into the issue.</P>
      <P>Faced with an emerging energy crisis, Lu suggested that the DPP
catch up with global trends and face new threats in each different
phase, even though building a nuclear-free homeland has always been
one of the party's core advocacies.</P>
      <P>Lu opined that the party should invite experts to explore the
possibility of using nuclear power as a form of clean energy on
grounds that technology in handling nuclear fuel waste has advanced
and that the Kyoto protocol has limited the use of traditional energy
resources.</P>
      <P>But Lu made it clear that she was not making any comments on the
fate of the fourth nuclear power plant under construction in Kungliao
township, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that a possible energy shortage in the future has
indeed posed a great challenge for the DPP, she stressed that "we
will have to face up to the problem sooner or later" and that "we
need to get more experts to study the issue across the board."</P>
      <P>According to the vice president, both the DPP and the previous
ruling Kuomintang have to jointly share responsibility regarding the
fourth nuclear power plant, because it is an issue that goes beyond
party affiliation.</P>
      <P>"It's a problem lying ahead for all of us, and we must cooperate
to find ways to resolve such a thorny issue," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD)
Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng said after a breakfast gathering called by
Premier Su Tseng-chang with business community representatives that
the fourth nuclear power plant is still being built and that an
additional budget is expected to be approved soon by the Executive
Yuan to carry out the construction project.</P>
      <P>Hu promised that the government would pay the maximum attention
to the fourth nuclear plant's safety following the completion of its
construction, and gave his assurances that the plant would be allowed
to operate only as long as its safety is fully guaranteed.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian once ordered a halt to construction on
the fourth nuclear power plant in October 2000 after coming to power
in May that year. Although the plant's construction was restarted in
2001, the interruption caused an estimated NT$70 billion (US$2.2
billion) in business losses.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT FIRMLY OPPOSED TO AMENDING CONSTITUTION AGAIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 27 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) reiterated
Thursday that the party is firmly opposed to any proposal to amend
the Constitution for an eighth time in order to increase the number
of seats in the legislature to 164.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou, who also serves as Taipei mayor,
pointed out that the Constitution was amended last year to halve the
number of legislative seats to 113 from 225, beginning from the next
legislature to be elected at the end of 2007.</P>
      <P>"The KMT's position is crystal clear: We oppose any move to amend
the Constitution again, " Ma said, adding that there is no
justification for increasing the number of seats in the Legislative
Yuan at this stage.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT will be despised by voters if it agrees to such a
move.</P>
      <P>At a meeting of the KMT legislative caucus, KMT Secretary-General
Chan Chun-po said most people in Taiwan are not interested in another
constitutional amendment, but want the KMT to concentrate on issues
that are most related to their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Chan said KMT legislators who do not follow the party line will
be disciplined.</P>
      <P>In a heated debate with Chan, maverick KMT Legislator Hsu Shu-po,
who plans to introduce his version of the amendment in May, said he
is not afraid of Chan's threat of disciplinary action. He urged party
leaders not to interfere in the legislature's internal debate on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Although Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng claimed he will
remain neutral on the issue, he said the issue is an "internal
matter" of the Legislative Yuan and that he believes the proposal
could be discussed.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the issue, Hsieh Kung-pin, spokesman for the
People First Party (PFP), the second-largest opposition party in the
legislature, said the PFP is also against amending the Constitution
again and believes that some members of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party intend to use the move to push Taiwan toward de
jure independence.</P>
      <P>News reports Thursday said lawmakers from across the political
spectrum have been quietly forming a "united front" in an attempt to
change a provision in the Constitution to increase the number of
seats in the legislature from 113 to 164 and replace the current
presidential system of government with the Cabinet system, because
many of them fear their chances of getting re-elected in 2007 will be
lessened under the new "single constituency, two votes" system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARTY'S GOAL OF NUKE-FREE HOMELAND UNSHAKEN: DPP HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) remains firm in its objective of building Taiwan into a land
free of nuclear power, DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while fielding reporters' questions after
taking part in a Taiwan-India business exchange seminar.</P>
      <P>Although Yu said the DPP will continue striving toward that goal,
he pointed out, however, that an individual case like the fourth
nuclear power plant requires further study. He added that the
Executive Yuan has the final say on the fate of the plant, which is
still under construction.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairman's remarks came after Vice President Annette Lu
was quoted as having told a recent DPP Central Standing Committee
meeting that the DPP should review its rigid anti-nuclear stance in
the face of a simmering global energy crisis.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh also said recently in a
national development conference that the government should continue
carrying out the fourth nuclear power plant construction project as a
short-term strategy to meet the country's demand for power.</P>
      <P>Echoing Yu's view, DPP legislative caucus whip Chen Chin-jun said
at a Legislative Yuan news conference that while the party seeks a
nuclear-free Taiwan, the safety of the fourth nuclear power plant is
still at issue and a primary concern of the DPP.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Yeh Yi-jin said although the Kyoto Protocol has been
put in place to cut greenhouse gas emissions, she said this does not
necessarily mean that the DPP will back off its nuclear-free homeland
policy..</P>
      <P>The DPP has never deviated from its anti-nuclear power stance and
it will continue to keep a close watch on Taiwan's nuclear power
plant operations, including the fourth plant, Yeh said, adding that
the DPP's surveillance has nothing to do with implementing the Kyoto
Protocol.</P>
      <P>It would be putting the cart before the horse if the DPP turns to
opt for even more damaging nuclear power due to the implementation of
the Kyoto protocol, which aims at cutting greenhouse gas emissions
across the world, she said.</P>
      <P>Arguing that no one in the world would believe nuclear power is
"green energy," DPP lawmaker Chao Yun-ching said it was "unthinkable"
that construction on the fourth nuclear power plant was restarted and
that the project needs additional funding to continue.</P>
      <P>He asked the government to probe into possible corruption
scandals behind the fourth nuclear power plant, insisting that the
DPP, as an accountable party, should do so in response to public
expectations.</P>
      <P>The DPP government ordered a halt to the construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant in Kungliao township, Taipei County in
late 2000 after President Chen Shui-bian came to power in May that
year.</P>
      <P>Although construction resumed in 2001, the delay in the project
caused estimated losses of NT$70 billion (US$2.2 billion) to the
nation's coffers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Taiwan Power Co. spokesman said the first phase of
the fourth nuclear power plant's commercial operations is slated for
July 2009. Commercial operations for its second phase are set for
July 2010 prior to its scheduled completion in 2112, the spokesman
added.</P>

      <P>Echoing Yu's view, DPP legislative caucus whip Chen Chin-jun said
at a Legislative Yuan news conference that while the party seeks a
nuclear-free Taiwan, the safety of the fourth nuclear power plant is
still at issue and a primary concern of the DPP.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Yeh Yi-jin said although the Kyoto Protocol has been
put in place to cut greenhouse gas emissions, she said this does not
necessarily mean that the DPP will back off its nuclear-free homeland
policy..</P>
      <P>The DPP has never deviated from its anti-nuclear power stance and
it will continue to keep a close watch on Taiwan's nuclear power
plant operations, including the fourth plant, Yeh said, adding that
the DPP's surveillance has nothing to do with implementing the Kyoto
Protocol.</P>
      <P>It would be putting the cart before the horse if the DPP turns to
opt for even more damaging nuclear power due to the implementation of
the Kyoto protocol, which aims at cutting greenhouse gas emissions
across the world, she said.</P>
      <P>Arguing that no one in the world would believe nuclear power is
"green energy," DPP lawmaker Chao Yun-ching said it was "unthinkable"
that construction on the fourth nuclear power plant was restarted and
that the project needs additional funding to continue.</P>
      <P>He asked the government to probe into possible corruption
scandals behind the fourth nuclear power plant, insisting that the
DPP, as an accountable party, should do so in response to public
expectations.</P>
      <P>The DPP government ordered a halt to the construction of the
fourth nuclear power plant in Kungliao township, Taipei County in
late 2000 after President Chen Shui-bian came to power in May that
year.</P>
      <P>Although construction resumed in 2001, the delay in the project
caused estimated losses of NT$70 billion (US$2.2 billion) to the
nation's coffers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Taiwan Power Co. spokesman said the first phase of
the fourth nuclear power plant's commercial operations is slated for
July 2009. Commercial operations for its second phase are set for
July 2010 prior to its scheduled completion in 2112, the spokesman
added.</P>

      <P>Taipei and Washington should be able to
reach an agreement soon on Taiwan's request that President Chen

      <P>Huang said that Taiwan officially put forth the request on April

understand the time pressure faced by Taiwan and will facilitate the
request.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks during an informal gathering with a group

      <P>Taiwan's deputy representative to
the World Trade Organization (WTO) headquarters, John C.C. Deng, will
reportedly be appointed as the country's deputy representative to the
United States, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) officials said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Deng is expected to succeed Jaw-ling Joanne Chang, who resigned
recently as Taiwan's second top representative to the United States,
MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials speculated that Deng's appointment is aimed at
enlisting his expertise in international business and trade affairs
so as to facilitate the signing of a free trade agreement (FTA)
between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Deng had been director of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office in Washington, D.C., the de facto Taiwan
embassy in the U.S., and vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council before being appointed Taiwan's deputy representative
to the WTO.</P>
      <P>The vacancy to be left by Deng is expected to be filled by a
Ministry of Economic Affairs official, MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>Since Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang assumed his
post in January, he has been promoting an aggressive diplomatic
strategy in a bid to score the greatest possible achievement on
Taiwan's diplomatic fronts in the face of Beijing's heightening
containment efforts against Taiwan, according to the MOFA officials.</P>
      <P>Huang was instrumental in arranging for a partial personnel
reshuffle in the MOFA's representative offices abroad recently,
including MOFA Chief Secretary Chen Yung-chuo's replacement of Lee
Tsai-fang, Taiwan's representative in South Korea; ROC Representative
to the Netherlands Chang Siao-yue's promotion to vice minister of
foreign affairs; and Vice Foreign Minister Michael Y. M. Kau's
appointment as Taiwan's representative to the European Union.</P>
      <P>Other changes in high-ranking posts at the MOFA's offices abroad
will include those in the Netherlands, Malaysia, Israel and Finland,

Senate Republicans tried on Thursday to get

provision that could levy a significant tax on

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must not accept Beijing's "one
China" principle because this will turn Taiwan into a part of the
People's Republic of China, President Chen Shui-bian said in a recent
interview with the Japanese daily Sankei Shimbun.</P>
      <P>According to the transcript of the interview released Friday by
the Presidential Office, Chen told the Japanese newspaper that he is
welcome to visit Beijing and shake hands with Chinese President Hu
Jintao as soon as he accepts Beijing's "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said, he has not done so because he "represents the
government of Taiwan and the collective interests of the 23 million
people of Taiwan and must not sell out Taiwan for personal fame."</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that as the popularly elected leader of the
country, he must safeguard Taiwan's sovereignty, dignity and
security.</P>
      <P>"If I accept the 'one China' principle, it will mean that Taiwan
is part of the People's Republic of China and Taiwan will become a
local province and special administrative region of the People's
Republic of China," Chen said.</P>
      <P>"If I were to allow a democratic Taiwan to be annexed by a
totalitarian China, I would go down in history as a sinner," he said.</P>
      <P>Just like the United States which has been promoting the
universal values of democracy and freedom and is expecting China to
embrace democracy and freedom, Taiwan also hopes that the country's
experience in democratic development will serve as a beacon leading
China towards democratization, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the majority of the people in Taiwan are
opposed to "ultimate unification" between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>"Perhaps the 23 million people in Taiwan will change their mind
one day, but this will only be possible if the Chinese communists
give up their one-party dictatorship and implement a true system of
democracy, freedom, human rights and peace," he said.</P>
      <P>The president reiterated that Taiwan is not against China or the
Chinese people but instead the totalitarianism practised by China.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that U.S. President George W. Bush has expressed his
concern about freedom of religion, assembly, speech and the press in
China during his recent meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan fully enjoy these freedoms and do not want

the construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant to help secure
clean and cheap electricity for the country.</P>
      <P>At a swearing-in ceremony, Chen -- previously Taipower president,
who was promoted to acting Taipower chairman after Taipower Chairman
Hwang Ing-san was appointed minister of economic affairs in January
-- said he will see to it that the plant is completed as soon as
possible and at the lowest possible cost.</P>
      <P>Chen said he will make sure the plant is built in accordance with
the law and under the principles of safety and quality.</P>
      <P>Hwang, who also addressed the ceremony, suggested that Taipower
invite specialists from the International Atomic Energy Agency or the
International Nuclear Regulatory Association to Taiwan to verify the
safety of the plant and also point out areas that Taipower should
correct to boost the plant's safe operations.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh said recently that Taiwan
should continue developing nuclear power in the next one to two
decades and that construction of the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant
should not be further stalled.</P>
      <P>Lee said that so long as radioactive waste is "properly handled,"
Taiwan basically faces no problems as regards nuclear safety
protection, adding that the existing second and third nuclear power
plants should continue to function, while the fourth should continue
to be built.</P>
      <P>He did not elaborate on what he meant by "properly handled."
Taipower's nuclear waste dump on outlying Orchid island is already
past capacity and the company has been unable to find anywhere else
willing or capable of accepting its radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>He speculated that Taiwan's dream of becoming a nuclear-free
country will probably not come true for another 50 years, when
optoelectronic technology and technologies of solar energy and other
recyclable energy become truly mature.</P>
      <P>After the Kyoto Protocol entered force in February 2005, the 1986
Nobel laureate in chemistry said the reduction of carbon dioxide
emissions has become an imperative task globally and that Taiwan
should not slack off in this effort. Consequently, he said, Taiwan
should strive to lessen its reliance on coal and fossil fuel for
energy so as to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>One of the first things the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration announced when it came to power in 2000 was a halt to
the controversial fourth nuclear power plant project, drawing strong
criticism from the opposition parties, which united in forcing the
DPP administration to resume the plant's construction on Feb. 14,
2001.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VIOLATORS OF DRUG, HEALTH FOOD REGULATIONS TO FACE STEEPER FINES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fines for violations of pharmaceutical and
health food control regulations will be raised dramatically,
according to the revised Pharmaceutical Affairs Act and Health Food
Control Act that cleared the Legislative Yuan Friday.</P>
      <P>Under the revised acts, non-pharmaceutical manufacturers and
media that run misleading ads for their products will both face fines
of up to NT$25 million (US$781,125). Ads for health food that claim
medicinal effects will also face fines of up to NT$2 million.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the media often run ads for
non-pharmaceutical products or health food in which the medical
effects are exaggerated, the Executive Yuan and ruling Democratic
Progressive Party legislators worked out the revised act, as the
government's past efforts in cracking down on bogus "medicines" are
often ineffectual due to low fines.</P>
      <P>Under the revised regulations, medicine traders and the media
will be fined between NT$200,000 and NT$5 million if they run ads for
pharmaceuticals that have not been approved by the government.</P>
      <P>If they continue to run the ads despite warnings, they will be
fined between NT$600,000 and NT$25 million, which is much higher than
the present maximum of NT$300,000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, for ads in which health food benefits are exaggerated,
fines will be raised to up to NT$2 million from the present maximum
of NT$1 million. In a more serious situation, licenses for the health
food, as well as business and plant registration certificates, will
also be revoked.</P>
      <P>In addition, if there is any doubt about the effect of
non-pharmaceutical health food products, the media must stop running
ads immediately and must submit to the authorities upon demand the
information of those who commission such ads.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Alliance of Fairness and Justice urged
taxpayers Friday to demand tax refunds to punish the government for
wasting their money.</P>
      <P>Citing data from the Ministry of Justice, alliance leader Chien
Hsi-chieh said there are 147 public establishment projects costing a
total of NT$40 billion (US$1.25 billion) that have been left unused
around the country, most of which are parking lots, stadiums and
activity centers, and all built at taxpayer expense.</P>
      <P>In addition, the excessive benefits enjoyed by former presidents
and vice presidents are wasting taxpayers NT$35 million per year,
while the cars, drivers and service and security personnel for former
presidents and vice presidents are costing the taxpayer an additional
NT$68.5 million per year, Chien said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the unfair 18-percent deposit interest rate enjoyed by
some retired civil servants, military personnel and public school
teachers has cost the national coffers NT$30.77 billion, Chien said.</P>
      <P>With the money that has been wasted amounting to NT$70.8 billion,
each of the total of 4.97 million taxpaying households in Taiwan
should get a refund of NT$14,216, Chien said.</P>
      <P>He asked taxpayers to fill out tax refund application forms
available at the alliance's Web site at www.justice.org.tw and mail
them to the Ministry of Finance along with their income tax returns
for this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPENNESS TO CHINA AIMED AT MAINTAINING COMPETITIVE EDGE: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Shih
Yen-shiang said Friday that the government's decision to lift
restrictions on investment in small-sized flat panel and low-end chip
packaging and testing industries in China is aimed at ensuring that
Taiwan maintains its competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan session to which
Economics Minister Hwang Ing-san and Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Joseph Wu were also invited to report on the government's
policy of lifting restrictions on investment in China by domestic
manufacturers of thin film transistor-liquid crystal displays
(TFT-LCDs) of four inches and less as well as low-end semiconductor
packaging and testing technologies.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) made the
move after conducting a thorough competitiveness analysis on the
production process of these products, stressing that the headquarters
of the companies in Taiwan are responsible for high-level technology
development, while their plants in China are in charge of low-end
technology.</P>
      <P>Shih revealed that the ministry estimates that the average
investment in a small-sized flat panel plant will be about NT$500
million (US$15 million) , while that in a low-end chip packing and
testing plants will be around NT$1 billion, which he did not classify
as "major investments."</P>
      <P>Noting that these two industries are labor intensive and
therefore stand to benefit greatly from China's cheap labor costs,
Shih said the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) will call a stop to the
investment projects if they have a negative impact on Taiwan's
manpower situation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the executives that Taiwan companies will send to
China will mostly be middle and low-level managers, and few
high-level technicians will be sent, Shih said, adding that Taiwan is
in short supply of developers of big-sized flat panels.</P>
      <P>"The government has made the assessment on its lifting of
restrictions on investment in China based on considerations of market
opportunities and opening in good order," Shih stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said the lifting of restrictions on investment in
China in these two sectors is based on a 2004 consensus reached among
various government agencies.</P>
      <P>After prudent evaluation, the government believes that the time
is ripe for the opening, Wu stressed.</P>

      <P>The central government is to help improve
social order in Taichung City, Minister of the Interior Lee Yi-yang
said Friday.</P>
      <P>A special forum on social order and security maintenance kicked
off in the central city earlier that day, hosted by Taichung Mayor
Jason Hu and attended by Lee and Hou Yu-ih, director-general of the
National Police Agency, as well as academics, experts and officials
of relevant authorities.</P>
      <P>Taichung City's citizen satisfaction rate has lagged behind all
other cities and counties in recent years, with deteriorating public
order blamed as the key culprit. In this regard, Hou claimed,
Taichung should be regarded as the key barometer for Taiwan's general
social order.</P>
      <P>Lee said that official research has found Taichung's public order
has mostly been damaged by people from other cities and counties who
commit crimes in the city, and that the population of lawbreakers is
relatively larger than other places in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Considering that the city is in short of law-enforcement
personnel, Lee said 500 additional police officers will be posted in
the city this year, adding that 2,000 more policemen will be added in
two years.</P>
      <P>Noting that Premier Su Tseng-chang has gambled his political life
on the improvement of social order, Hou pledged that his agency will
do its utmost to help the Taichung city government build a safe
living environment for its citizens.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided Friday
over a ceremony marking the opening of the "Waters of the World"
museum -- the third section of the National Museum of Marine Biology
and Aquarium --located in Taiwan's southernmost county of Pingtung.</P>
      <P>Delighted and impressed with the virtual reality (VR)
presentation of different water worlds around the globe from ancient
times to the present, Chen said the museum is another example that
not all build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects are rife with flaws and
irregularities as some opposition politicians have claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Taipei 101 -- the tallest building in the world
-- is another BOT model that was a major project endorsed by him when
he was Taipei mayor prior to 2000.</P>
      <P>The "Waters of the World" museum is the first digitalized
aquarium with VR presentations in the world.</P>
      <P>After spending two years and two months, as well as NT$2.7
billion (US$84.4 million) , the museum has been constructed in a
three-story building featuring four theme parks -- the Polar Region,
the Kelp Forest, the Deep Sea and the Ancient Oceans.</P>
      <P>In the Polar Region park, live penguins of different species are
kept in a polar environment at a temperature of minus 6 degrees
Celsius and water of 10 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>In the Kelp Forest, real kelp flourishes in giant water tanks.
The kelp grows from tiny spores at a speed of 50 cm per day in water.
The tallest branch of kelp reaches 30 meters.</P>
      <P>In the Deep Sea park, a giant VR sperm whale fights with a VR
18-meter squid in a deep sea teeming with luminous fish and other
creatures.</P>
      <P>In the Ancient Ocean park, creatures from 4.5 billion years ago
are featured in a 4D marine theater, allowing the spectators to have
a timeless and close-up experience of facing an ancient
underwater world.</P>
      <P>The National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, which gets at

      <P>As leader of the ruling Democratic

responsibility for the whole party, including disputes arising from
the first family, DPP spokesman Tsai Huang-liang said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks at a news conference in response to

President Chen Shui-bian to save the party's reputation and image
after Yu said a day earlier that the first family should not hesitate
to apologize to the public if it has done wrong.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the speculation, Tsai claimed that Yu's comments were

scandals.</P>
      <P>"All DPP members are in the same boat and no one can survive

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Any political party must take public
opinion into account when promoting amendments to the Constitution,
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while answering questions from reporters
about a report a day earlier that a dozen lawmakers from both the
ruling and opposition parties have jointly called for a fresh
constitutional amendment to allow for an increase in the size of the
Legislative Yuan from 113 to 164 seats in the 2007 general election.</P>
      <P>Stressing that it is the whole party, not a party's legislative
caucus, that should be in charge of handling the constitutional
amendment issue, Ma said that the public will not accept a new
proposal to increase the number of legislative seats only one year
after a majority of lawmakers passed a constitutional amendment
proposal to halve the scale of the Legislative Yuan from the current
225 members to 113.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan people would not feel good about holding back from an
approved constitutional amendment when it has not even been
implemented, Ma pointed out.</P>
      <P>Any KMT legislator is entitled to voice his or her viewpoint, but
it is most important that he or she realizes that constitutional
amendments are not an issue of major concern to the public at this
time, Ma said, adding that the Taiwan people are now more concerned
about improving their livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers, as representatives elected from their constituencies,
have to pay heed to public opinion, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Legislator Hsu Shu-po, who has publicly displayed
support for launching a new constitutional revision to enlarge the
next Legislative Yuan to 164 seats, claimed that he would consider
leaving the KMT if the party ignores his idea.</P>
      <P>In addition to Hsu, ruling Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers
You Ching and Lin Cho-shui, People First Party (PFP) lawmakers Lee

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Cabinet ministers who have taken their
families on a trip to Abu Dhabi to attend an inaugural ceremony for a
new stopover for China Airlines -- Taiwan's main carrier -- should
step down if their expenses were paid by the airline, legislators of
the opposition People First Party (PFP) said Friday.</P>
      <P>CAL added Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates, as a
stopover on its Taipei-Vienna route, which has three flights per
week. Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Chih-fang, Minister of
Transportation and Communications Kuo Yao-chi and four other
transportation officials were invited to the inaugural ceremony as
guests of honor.</P>
      <P>While Huang brought his wife and son on the trip, Kuo was
accompanied by her husband. They departed from Taipei April 25.</P>
      <P>Legislators serving on the Transportation Committee of the
Legislative Yuan were furious because Kuo gave them short notice
requesting leave of absence from the committee meeting April 26.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Lee Hung-chun demanded that the two
Cabinet minsters explain who paid for their air tickets and hotel
rooms and said that unless they can come up with clear evidence that
they and their families accepted no favors for the trip from CAL,
they should resign their Cabinet posts.</P>
      <P>PFP legislator Liu Wen-hsiung noted that it is strange that the
foreign minister is accompanied by his family rather than by Foreign
Ministry officials who can speak Arabic or by the top executive of
the Sino-Arabian Cultural and Economic Association.</P>
      <P>Kuo's deputy, Tsai Duei, said the Bureau of Tourism under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications paid for the travel and
hotel expenses for Kuo and four other officials, and that Kuo's
husband paid his own expenses.</P>
      <P>News reports from Abu Dhabi Friday quoted Huang's aides as
confirming that CAL provided tickets for Huang and his wife, and that
their son's tickets were paid for by themselves and upgraded to first
class through a mileage accumulation plan.</P>
      <P>As for their hotel expenses, the aides added, they will be paid
by the government of the United Arab Emirates.</P>
      <P>The aides explained that the foreign minister and his wife
brought their young son on the trip because no one else could take
care of him if he were left behind.</P>
      <P>However, CAL's public relations director Sun Hung-wen denied in
Taipei that CAL paid the travel expenses for any of the officials. He

      <P>Minister of Transportation and

traveled with Kuo aboard a China Airlines (CAL) -- Taiwan's
main carrier -- flight to Abu Dhabi Tuesday to mark the use of the
United Arab Emirates capital as a new stopover on the carrier's
Taipei-Vienna route.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Duei
issued the clarification Friday in the wake of reports that Kuo and
Foreign Affairs Minister Huang Chih-fang took members of their family
with them on the trip.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the expenses of Kuo and four other ministry officials
were paid by the Tourism Bureau, while Kuo's husband, Peng Kuang-hui,
a professor at National Taipei University of Technology, paid his own
way.</P>
      <P>Asked why the two ministers took their family members with them,
Tsai claimed it was because of the need for diplomatic protocol.</P>
      <P>The trip was mainly to take part in the inaugural ceremony of
CAL's use of Abu Dhabi as a new stopover on its Taipei-Vienna route
and the ministry had no other information about other private
itinerary.</P>
      <P>Huang reportedly took his wife and son with him, but Tsai said
that this should be explained by the Foreign Affairs Ministry.</P>
      <P>CAL public relations officials said the airline did not pay for
the trips by the minister and the officials and that their fares were
negotiated with the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. All private trips, including those
by travel operators and accompanying reporters, are paid for by the
individuals.</P>
      <P>According to the travel operators, CAL tickets for economy class
to Abu Dhabi are NT$29,880 and NT$69,880 for business class.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the opposition People First

evacuated from the South Pacific island nation Friday, a Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said.</P>
      <P>Lee Chuang-tung, director of MOFA's Department of East Asian and
Pacific Affairs, said the situation in the Solomon Islands has
largely returned to normal after recent turmoil, but as some schools
and houses were burned down during the rioting, life there is
difficult.</P>
      <P>For this reason, eight of the dependents returned to Taiwan,
while the other two headed for Australia, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Embassy staff will stay at their posts, he added.</P>
      <P>As for two Taiwanese families in the Solomon Islands, one has
evacuated to Australia and the other has decided to stay, he said.</P>
      <P>The Solomon Islands' capital of Honiara was racked by burning and
looting -- mostly businesses owned by ethnic Chinese -- after its
parliament elected Snyder Rini as prime minister April 18. The
situation abated after Australia and New Zealand sent troops and
police officers to maintain law and order.</P>
      <P>Although the situation has stabilized, the MOFA issued a travel
alert last Friday advising Taiwanese to refrain from going there for
business or travel for the time being.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan can be described as a "watermelon
kingdom" because of the wide variety grown here, a Council of
Agriculture (COA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Chin-chiang, secretary-general of the COA's Agriculture and
Food Agency, noted that the watermelon production areas in Taiwan
cover around 12,000 hectares, with annual production of around
300,000 tons of the fruit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan boasts more than a dozen varieties of watermelon, and the
fruit is available all year round. This year will be another banner
year for the fruit, he added.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has also developed different shapes of watermelon.
In addition to the rounded ones, there are also oval and even square
ones, with the square ones the most valuable, selling at up to
NT$1,200 (US$37.5) per melon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BILL REGARDING LOW-RADIATION NUCLEAR WASTE STORAGE APPROVED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan approved Friday a
bill that will govern the storage of the country's low-radiation
nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the bill, the government should hold a
plebiscite among the residents of the place where it wants to store
the radioactive waste and the place should not be considered as a
possible storage location in the future if most of the residents
oppose the project.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Justin Huang, who
initiated the plebiscite clause, said he was happy about the passage
of the bill, although he was still opposed to the Executive Yuan's
plan to tap the possibility of whether the state-owned Taiwan Power
Co.'s (Taipower's) nuclear waste can be stored in Tawu village in
eastern Taitung County. Huang was elected from Taitung County.</P>
      <P>Taipower has dumped its low-radiation waste on outlying Orchid
Island for many years, but increasing objections from residents has
pushed it to choose another storage site.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAO TRIBE LIKELY TO ALLOW NUKE WASTE TO STAY ON ORCHID ISLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some indigenous Tao tribe people residing
on Orchid Island have voiced willingness to allow Taiwan Power
Company (Taipower) to continue depositing nuclear fuel waste on the
island as long as relevant security measures are fully in
place, an influential political figure said Friday.</P>
      <P>The man, who requested anonymity, made the comments after the
Legislative Yuan passed earlier that day a law on measures regulating
sites for the disposal of nuclear waste -- which has long been a
thorny issue in Taiwan amid growing awareness of the importance of
environmental protection.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the law's passage is a boon for Orchid
Island as it will permit Taipower to relocate the nuclear fuel waste
that is temporarily being stored on the island. According to law, a
referendum is necessary for the government to make a final decision
on a nuclear waste site.</P>
      <P>But he said at least half of Orchid Island's residents have
expressed a willingness to allow the waste to stay as long as
security measures -- and monetary compensation to locals -- are
well-heeded.</P>
      <P>Those who have demanded Taipower relocate its nuclear waste from
Orchid Island are just a small group of anti-nuclear power activists
and local representatives who have used the issue for private gain,
he opined.</P>
      <P>If Taipower moved its nuclear waste from Orchid Island, more than
half of local residents will be unable to pay electricity bills and
national insurance fees that are currently being paid by the central
government as quid pro quo for the island's accommodation of the
nuclear-waste dump, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipower continues examining the 97.672 barrels of
nuclear fuel waste stored on Orchid Island, and the whole task is
estimated to be completed at the end of 2010 prior to an eventual
relocation, a spokesman for the state-run public utility said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD REITERATES 'FIVE NOES, FIVE DO'S' POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 28 (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who also serves
as the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman, reiterated his "Five
Noes, five do's" policy in cross-Taiwan Strait relations in a speech
Friday.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is expected to run in the 2008 presidential election as a
"pan-blue alliance" candidate, said the "Five Noes, five do's" pledge
will be the cornerstone of his and the KMT's policy once the party
returns to power.</P>
      <P>Ma delivered a speech titled "Embracing Chellenges Ahead: Ma
Ying-jeou's Vision for Taipei and Taiwan" at a monthly European
Chamber of Commerce in Taipei (ECCT) luncheon, attended by
more than 180 ECCT members.</P>
      <P>"The five noes has become the common denominator in Washington,
Beijing and Taiwan," Ma said, adding he would admit he "borrowed"
this from President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>President Chen said in his May 2000 inaugural speech that as long
as China promises not to use military force against Taiwan, he will
not declare Taiwan independence, will not change the official name of
the country, will not include the "state-to-state" theory in the
Constitution, will not promote a referendum to change the
cross-Taiwan Strait status quo, and will not abolish the the National
Unification Council (NUC) and its guidelines.</P>
      <P>But the "five do's" he and the KMT have been advocating are even
more important for Taiwan's future development, Ma said.</P>
      <P>For the "five do's," Ma suggested that both sides resume talks
between governments; work toward military confidence-building
measures; work toward the creation of a common market; try to
achieve a "modus vivendi" -- a temporary agreement between contending
parties prior to a final settlement -- on Taiwan's participation in
international organizations; and accelerate cross-strait cultural and
educational exchanges.</P>
      <P>Ma expressed concern that by 2015 Taiwan could be left out
and "economically marginalized" when 10 ASEAN countries,
including China, Japan and South Korea establish the largest
economic integration in the world, representing 2 billion people
with a combined US$12 trillion GDP.</P>
      <P> This is why he and the KMT will have a "pragmatic and open"
approach in dealing with China and will begin to remove legal
difficulties hampering exchanges between Taiwan and China, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>"We can't wait for another two years; otherwise Taiwan will lose
its competiveness," he said.</P>

      <P>"Hong Kong Cultural Week," an exhibition
celebrating Hong Kong's culture and heritage, was launched Friday in
Taipei to encourage more Taiwanese tourists to visit Hong Kong this
year.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong Cultural Week includes installations and cultural
event information and will be held April 28 to May 11 at the Eslite
Bookstore (Hsin-yi), said Jessica Huang, Director of the Hong Kong
Tourism Board's (HKTB) Taipei branch office.</P>
      <P>"Hong Kong is more than a shopper's paradise," said Huang. "The
campaign wants to let Taiwanese people know about cultural events and
heritage they can enjoy in Hong Kong. It's a celebration
of Hong Kong's popular culture."</P>
      <P>Between April 20 and May 7, visitors to Hong Kong will be able
to experience four major traditional Hong Kong festivals first-hand:
The birthday of Buddha, the birthday of Tam Kung, the birthday of Tin
Hau and the Cheung Chau Bun Festival.</P>
      <P>The Cheung Chau Bun Festival stands out in terms of uniqueness,
Huang said. Youngsters dressed as mythological figures are held aloft
on hidden rods in a parade. The procession ends at a temple where men
and women clamber up a tower covered in buns to grab as many "lucky"
ones off the top as possible.</P>
      <P>Huang estimated the average number of Taiwanese tourists visiting
Hong Kong during the month of festivities as somewhere between
180,000-190,000 -- an increase of 5,000 over other months.</P>
      <P>The event is part of the "2006 Discover Hong Kong Year" campaign

    <TEXT>
      <P>Oscar-winning Taiwanese
film director Ang Lee received a rousing welcome reception Friday
when he made a public appearance in his hometown of Tainan, the city
in southern Taiwan where he grew up.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his mother, Lee paid a courtesy call on Tainan
Mayor Hsu Tain-tsair at his office and was greeted by city government
officials donning cowboy hats in recognition of the fact that Lee won
this year's Academy award for best director in Los Angeles for his
film "Brokeback Mountain."</P>
      <P>In addition to declaring April 28 as "Ang Lee Day" in Tainan, the
mayor prepared a three-tier cake to celebrate the 80th birthday of
Lee's mother.</P>
      <P>The 51-year-old movie director said he is proud of Tainan and its
culture, and that the warmth and comfort he feels in his hometown are
so special to him.</P>
      <P>During his hour-long stay at the city's administration center,
Lee had his ID card renewed. When members of the public in the
building recognized their hero, they swarmed around him, seeking his
autograph and asking him to pose with them for photographs. Lee
granted all their requests in his usual gentle manner.</P>
      <P>When asked what birthday present he had given his mother, Lee

      <P>"Brokeback Mountain," Lee's latest film, received a total of

      <P>Peace and prosperity -- core values shared
by both Taiwan and China -- should be established on a foundation of
democracy and equitable wealth, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Receiving international scholars who arrived in Taipei to attend

the Taiwan Strait to maintain lasting peace and avoid war is if they
are both democratic societies.</P>
      <P>A democratic society still needs to narrow the gap between rich

that without equitable wealth, a government may resort to war against
its neighbors to divert attention from its internal problems.</P>
      <P>Ma acknowledged that Taiwan's democratic system is still
evolving, and that in terms of the quality of Taiwan's democracy and
rule of law, there is still room for improvement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT: KMT'S DIPLOMACY CANNOT INFRINGE ON TAIWAN'S SOVEREIGNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Timothy J. Hwang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said in a
interview with the Japanese daily Sankei Shimbun Friday that he was
not against recent China visits by opposition party Kuomintang
Honorary Chairman Lien Chan, but that it was "absolutely
unacceptable" if the party's diplomatic efforts infringed upon
Taiwan's sovereignty or reduced Taiwan's position to that of a
Chinese province.</P>
      <P>President Chen told the Japanese newspaper that since only
twenty-odd countries maintain diplomatic ties with Taiwan, any
diplomatic efforts -- including those of city officials and political
parties -- are welcome as long as they help to improve Taiwan's
diplomatic standing.</P>
      <P>Chen said, however, that Lien's China visit and his meeting with
Chinese Communist Party leaders were not in Taiwan's best interest.
If one speaks loudly in Taiwan about "One China, diferent
interpretations" and then stays mum while meeting with the leader of
China, it's really inappropriate, he added.</P>
      <P>Knowing there is no such thing as a "1992 consensus" with
China while insisting on having such an understanding is really
inappropriate, Chen continued. The party's not only fooling itself,
it's cheating other people, he said.</P>
      <P>President Chen also expressed strong reservations about the
timing of Lien's visit to China, saying that in the wake of China's
passage of an "Anti-Secession" Law, Lien's visit only helps
reduce the negative response of the international community. A
visit like this only serves the interest of China's propaganda
tactics, he added.</P>
      <P>As for KMT Chairman Ma Ying-jeou's recent visit to the United
States, Chen said Ma's talks about "One China, different
interpretations" and "modus vivendi" proposal don't stand up to the
challenge.</P>
      <P>Chen said Ma and Lien may claim the "One China" they have in
mind is the "Republic of China," but for the People's Republic of
China, the ROC has not existed since 1949, so the PRC has no room for
separate interpretations of "One China."</P>
      <P>President Chen stressed that Taiwan is a sovereign country, that
its future can only be decided by the free will of its 23 million
people, and that any disputes or differences should be resolved
through peaceful dialogue under the principles of sovereignty,
democracy, peace and equality.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Faced with a lawmaker's demand to
immediately halt U.S. beef imports after inspectors found
bone fragments in a shipment Thursday, health authorities said Friday
the incident reflected a flaw in quality control in some U.S.
slaughterhouses and decided to ban only the U.S. company involved
rather than all imports.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Tung-ming, chief of the Bureau of Food Sanitation under the
Department of Health (DOH), said Friday that the problematic batch of
U.S. beef imports was shipped from Tyson Fresh Meats in Nebraska, one
of 45 slaughterhouses allowed to sell beef to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The company has been expelled from the list, while the DOH has
also asked the U.S. government to reinforce management regulation
measures in their slaughterhouses and processing factories, Hsiao
said.</P>
      <P>Talking about the problematic imports, Hsiao said that "it does
not pose a problem for food safety."</P>
      <P>Quarantine inspectors at Chiang Kai-shek airport discovered rib
bone fragments in three cases of imported chilled beef loins
Thursday, the first incident of its kind since Taiwan conditionally
reopened its market to U.S. beef imports Jan. 25.</P>
      <P>According to DOH regulations, U.S. beef and related goods may be
re-introduced into Taiwan only if they are: beef from animals raised
in the U.S. and under 30 months of age; boneless beef without "risky
parts or substance" attached -- such as bone marrow and encephalon;
beef from slaughterhouses and processing factories approved by the
U.S. Department of Agriculture; and beef certified by the USDA.</P>
      <P>The beef may be banned again if imports to Taiwan don't meet the
requirements, DOH officials declared at the time when their
department gave the green light to reopen Taiwan's market to U.S.
beef.</P>
      <P>Citing Japan's move to re-impose a ban on U.S. beef imports Jan.
21 -- a few days after Taiwan gave the green light for re-entry --
after a "risky substance" was found in the beef, Legislator Lai
Hsing-yuan of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Party urged the DOH to
follow Japan's model and not reopen its doors to U.S. beef shipments.</P>
      <P>Lai proposed a petition to the High Administrative Court March 14
for a ban on U.S. beef imports, but it was later dismissed. However,
the lawmaker has appealed to the Taipei Supreme Administrative Court.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAVERICK KMT LAWMAKER GIVES UP BID TO EXPAND LEGISLATURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A maverick Kuomintang (KMT) legislator
who attempted to convince his colleagues to increase the number of
seats in the Legislative Yuan by amending the Constitution abandoned
his efforts on Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shu-po said the press vilified his idea of increasing the
number of legislative seats as "lawmakers' dirty trick to try to hang
on to their jobs, " and that the issue could no longer be discussed
rationally in the current political climate.</P>
      <P>Instead, Su said, he would propose a change in the number of
lawmakers chosen through elections and lawmakers appointed by the
political parties in proportion to votes they garner in elections,
while keeping the number of all lawmakers unchanged at 113.</P>
      <P>Under his plan, the number of popularly elected seats would
increase from 73 to 90, while the number of politically appointed
lawmakers would decrease from 34 to 17, keeping the number of seats
reserved for aboriginal lawmakers intact at 6.</P>
      <P>In order to preempt criticism of a conflict of interest, Hsu said
that once translated into constitutional amendments, his proposal
would take effect only after 2011 -- four years after the
lawmakers who vote for it have completed their terms.</P>
      <P>Further, Hsu also called for the introduction of a Cabinet system
through constitutional amendments, citing the opposition's criticism
that the current government system -- a hybrid between Cabinet and
presidential systems -- empowers the president to pull strings
without being held accountable to the legislature.</P>
      <P>Hsu's call for the legislature's expansion initially raised
eyebrows among KMT leaders, with the party's Chairman Ma Ying-jeou
asking KMT lawmakers not to back it, saying the public has grown
weary of politicians' numerous attempts to tinker with the
Constitution.</P>
      <P>To seek support for his new proposal, Hsu met with KMT Honorary
Chairman Lien Chan Friday and quoted Lien as saying afterwards that
the KMT is not an authoritarian party, and its members should be
given the freedom to air and discuss their views -- including
proposals to change the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Without naming Ma who doubles as Taipei mayor, Lien was cited by
Hsu as saying that "It is not appropriate that a bunch of people at
Taipei City Hall want to silence people with different ideas."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN REMAINS ON U.S. 'SPECIAL 301' WATCH LIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has kept Taiwan on
its watch list for intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in
2006 while recognizing Taiwan's efforts to improve its IPR regime,
according to the annual "Special 301" report released Friday by the
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR).</P>
      <P>"The United States looks to Taiwan to sustain the current level
of commitment to making progress on IPR issues, and will continue to
monitor further improvements," the report said.</P>
      <P>The report noted that Taiwan has increased the number of raids
and seizures of pirated optical media, counterfeit pharmaceuticals
and counterfeit luxury goods.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan has prosecuted the peer-to-peer Internet service
Kuro and provided protection against unfair commercial use of
undisclosed test and other data submitted by pharmaceutical
companies, the report said.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan still needs to improve its efforts to combat the
production of pirated optical media and proliferation of Internet
piracy and to deal more effectively with unauthorized use of
copyright materials on government and university computer networks,
it said.</P>
      <P>Also, Taiwan should strengthen IPR enforcement actions against
piracy and counterfeiting and establish a specialized IP court and
devote more resources and coordinated high-level government attention
to combating IPR infringement, it said.</P>
      <P>Other steps that Taiwan needs to take include strengthening
border enforcement against transshipment of pirated and counterfeit
goods, considering legislative amendments to address the liability of
Internet service providers, implementing stronger criminal penalties
for IPR infringement and extending the term of copyright protection
for works and sound recordings, it said.</P>
      <P>This year's "Special 301" report places 13 countries on the
Priority Watch List and 34 countries on the lower level Watch List.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was removed from the Priority Watch List in January 2005.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said Saturday that it regrets that Taiwan has been kept on the Watch
List in the 2006 Special 301 Report by the Office of the United
States Trade Representative (USTR).</P>
      <P>However, MOEA officials vowed that Taiwan will continue to make
efforts in stepping up protection of intellectual property rights
(IPRs).</P>
      <P>The USTR said in the latest report that it recognizes Taiwan's
efforts to improve its IPR regime but urges it to deal more
effectively with the unauthorized use of copyright materials on
government and university computer networks as well as combat the
production of pirated optical media and the proliferation of Internet
piracy.</P>
      <P>The Intellectual Property Office under the MOEA said that it has
taken the USTR's decision in stride, noting that regardless of
whether Taiwan is on the list or not, the most important thing is to
continue to strengthen IPR enforcement actions against piracy and
counterfeiting.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said that it will continue to
coordinate related government agencies to upgrade IPR protection and
inform the U.S. about its latest progress.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials said that they hope the U.S. will address the
efforts made by Taiwan and remove it from the list soon.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was one of the 34 countries included in the Watch List,
meriting bilateral attention to address the underlying IPR problems,
according to the USTR.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAISUGAR NEEDS TO PRIVATIZE: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday
that the state=run Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar) has to pursue the
path of privatization.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks while attending the 60th
anniversary celebrations held at the headquarters of the company in
the southern Taiwan city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>The president lauded the role that Taisugar has played in the
country's economic development, calling it a "prime mover" behind
Taiwan's economic miracle.</P>
      <P>In the 1950s and 1960s, revenue from the company's sugar exports
accounted for 79 percent of Taiwan's foreign currency reserve
revenues, the president said.</P>
      <P>With the changing times during the 1970s, Taisugar, the largest
land holder in Taiwan, began offering land to companies in
the high-tech sector.</P>
      <P>Noting that "a machine can get rusted after 60 years of use and
require repair of its parts, " the president said Taisugar must
"repair itself" by diversifying.</P>
      <P>"Only reforms will bring opportunities, " the president said,
adding that competition among enterprises will not stop and that
Taiwan must catch up with the world trend of privatization.</P>
      <P>Taisugar Chairman Yu Cheng-hsien said that the company has been
losing money in recent years and that its target for this year is to
achieve the "impossible mission" of breaking even.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. REAFFIRMS SAFETY OF BEEF EXPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 28 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent discovery of bone fragments
in a shipment of U.S. beef to Taiwan is an isolated incident and does
not indicate that U.S. beef products are unsafe, a U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The USDA has started an investigation into the case to check for
any possible packaging negligence, USDA spokesman Ed Loyd told the
Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities impounded a shipment of U.S. beef after rib
bone fragments were discovered in the product Thursday. With the beef
found to have been processed by a factory in Nebraska of the leading
U.S. meat supplier, Tyson Fresh Meats, Taiwan's Department of Health
decided that no beef products from the company will be allowed to be
exported to Taiwan in the future.</P>
      <P>The incident came just three months after Taiwan reopened its
market to U.S. beef under strict regulations that allow only imports
of boneless beef from animals under 30 months of age, a measure aimed
at protecting consumers against mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>In January, a spine fragment was found in a shipment of U.S. beef
exports to Japan, prompting the Japanese government to reinstate a
ban on imports of the product, less than two months after a previous
ban was lifted.</P>
      <P>On this issue, Loyd said this latest case in Taiwan is different
from the one in Japan because the spine is believed to contain risky
tissues known to carry the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)
virus.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned beef imports from the United States in December
2003 after the discovery in Washington State of a single case of BSE.</P>
      <P>In April 2005, Taiwan lifted the import ban on U.S. boneless beef
from animals under 30 months of age, but again suspended American
beef imports June 25 that same year after a second case of mad cow
disease was confirmed in the U.S. earlier that month.</P>
      <P>The second ban was lifted on Jan. 25, 2006.</P>

      <P>The registration period for the annual
government-sponsored "Symbol of Excellence" (SOE) awards for best
product design as well as most innovative and highest quality "made

invited to enter, Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA)
officials said.</P>
      <P>The semi-official TAITRA instituted the SOE program under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs' (MOEA's) commission in 1993 to
recognize the most exceptional Taiwan products and companies based on
several criteria including research and development, design and
innovation, quality systems, and brand awareness.</P>
      <P>The SOE has since developed into a globally recognized sign of
quality and innovative thinking.</P>
      <P>This year, the SOE program will be combined with the National
Award of Excellence, with the winners, which will be decorated with
National Gold (or Silver) Awards of Excellence, to serve as the
representatives of the Taiwan manufacturing industry in the
international market, according to the TAITRA.</P>
      <P>The award-winning products are expected to gain the endorsement
of Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, Intel chief executive officer (CEO)
Andy Grove and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, all of whom
have been invited by the TAITRA to publicize Taiwan's SOE products
this year, the council officials said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation urged the
government Saturday to restore its ban on U.S. beef and remove the
products from shelves immediately following the discovery of bone
fragments in a recent shipment to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Officials at the foundation said that the incident reflects the
potential risks of U.S. beef and that Taiwan should take immediate
action to protect local consumers just as the Japanese government has
recently done.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) decided Friday that no beef
products from the leading U.S. meat supplier Tyson Fresh Meats will
be allowed to be exported to Taiwan, after rib bone fragments were
discovered a day earlier in a shipment of beef from the company.</P>
      <P>The incident came just three months after Taiwan reopened its
market to U.S. beef under strict regulations that allow only imports
of boneless beef from animals under 30 months of age, a measure aimed
at protecting consumers against mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>The DOH's decision to ban only beef products from the supplier is
lenient compared with move taken by Japan, which reinstated a ban on
U.S. beef imports after a spine fragment was found in a shipment to
the country in January. The Japanese government made the move less
than two months after a previous ban was lifted.</P>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation officials pointed out that bone
fragments were also found in a shipment of U.S. beef to Hong Kong
earlier this month and that Japan has requested the U.S. government
to explain if there is any problem with the quality control of the
U.S. meat industry in light of the reoccurrence of similar incidents.</P>
      <P>They said U.S. beef is not safe for consumers because the United
States has not established a comprehensive biodata system for cattle
raised in the country, while less than one percent of the U.S. cattle
have been examined for mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned beef imports from the United States in December

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Atomic Energy Council (AEC) said 
Saturday that a new spent nuclear fuel dry storage facility will be 
installed at the nation's first nuclear power plant in September
2009 to increase the plant's spent fuel storage capacity.</P>
      <P>An AEC specialist said that as the present spent fuel pool of 
the nuclear plant will be filled to capacity by 2010, the extra 
storage facility, with at least 25 concrete vaults and a maximum 
capacity of 1,400 spent rods, is urgently needed.</P>
      <P>According to AEC documents, the dry storage vault --surrounded 
by additional steel, concrete, or other material-- can provide 
radiation shielding to workers and to the neighborhoods around the 
plant. On average, the annual radioactive levels outside the 
facility will not exceed 0.05mSv, or one-twentieth the acceptable 
level according to health regulations.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan Power Co. spokesman said the company will apply for the 
construction permit this July, and if all go as planned, the storage 
facility will be fully operational by September 2009.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The details on the profits first lady Wu
Shu-jen has made in selling all her stocks and mutual fund
holdings will be unveiled next week, the Presidential Office
reaffirmed Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said the previous day that Wu, under fire
for her alleged involvement in several corruption scandals, will sell
all her stocks and mutual fund investments and donate the profits to
charities and disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>The first lady will publish the details concerning her profits
and which groups or organizations will receive the money, according
to the latest statement by the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The statement came on the heels of Friday's comments by
Legislator Chiu Yi of the opposition Kuomintang who claimed after
checking the Control Yuan report disclosing the assets of the public
officials that nearly NT$30 million of the profits the first lady
made on the stock market had "vanished."</P>
      <P>Chiu claimed that before Wu put her assets into trust in March
2004, she had stocks worth NT$4 million, five kinds of mutual fund
holdings amounting to NT$58 million, and bank deposits totalling
NT$15 million. In 2005, she had only one fund left worth around NT$19
million, as well as stocks worth NT$12 million, and bank deposits of
roughly the same amount as the previous year.</P>
      <P>In 2006, Wu owned stocks worth NT$4 million, Chiu speculated,
adding that after the first lady sold her mutual fund holdings, she
used the NT$40 million to invest in the Fubon REITs No.1 fund, and
that her bank deposits amounted to only NT$1.2 million.</P>
      <P>Quoting the Control Yuan report, Chiu speculated that in 2005, Wu
disposed of four types of mutual funds and should have made nearly
NT$40 million. Even if she bought stocks amounting to NT$8 million,
her bank deposits did not show any marked increase, Chiu noted,
questioning where all the money had gone.</P>
      <P>The first family put its assets into trust in April 2004 after
the first lady was attacked for improperly engaging in stock trading
during the run-up to the 2004 presidential election.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PUBLIC POWER KEY TO WINNING E.U. SUPPORT FOR WHO BID: SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan needs to do a better job of
utilizing public, societal and media influence to win the European
Union's support for Taiwan's World Health Organization (WHO) bid,
scholars said in a forum held in Taipei Saturday.</P>
      <P>"With governmental efforts suffering nine straight years of
setbacks due to China's obstruction, the political side of Taiwan's
WHO bid is a stalemate, " said Wu Chih-chung, a Soochow University
assistant professor who also serves as secretary-general of the
European Union Study Association, the organizer of the forum.</P>
      <P>The best way to turn things around is to increase the E.U.'s
understanding of Taiwan through different channels --
non-governmental organizations, research and exchange groups, media
reports, and various forms of bilateral exchanges, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan also has to replace 'sentiment' (from China's
obstruction) with confidence, showing people what it can do with its
advanced medical expertise and experience in fighting SARS and avian
flu to make contributions to the WHO, " said Betty Chiu, an assistant
researcher of the National Health Research Institutes.</P>
      <P>The United States and Japan have publicly voiced their support
for Taiwan's WHO bid, which is encouraging news, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"That makes winning the E.U.'s support even more critical. And
there's no way we can't do it. Taiwan is the E.U.'s fourth largest
trading partner in Asia and 10th largest trading partner in the
world, " he added.</P>
      <P>China is obviously the No.1 reason why the E.U. does not support
Taiwan's bid in public, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"Almost everyone we talked to said they thought Taiwan should be
in the WHO, but whenever we brought up the 'one China policy, ' there
was almost total silence," Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan has to make clear its objective and build
domestic consensus, noted Liu Fu-kuo, a National Chengchi University
professor.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan needs to make sure whether it wants to bid for observer
status in the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's governing
body, or for full membership under the name Republic of China, or
under the name Taiwan. This can affect Taiwan's strategy," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIR CLARIFIES STANCE ON CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) chairman said Saturday that constitutional reform discussions
should first focus on establishing clear and comprehensive concepts
in order to avoid the problems arising from previous piecemeal reform
and to set a clear direction on which government system should be
adopted.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun made the remarks after his opposition to increasing
the number of seats in the next Legislative Yuan from the originally
planned 113 to 164 drew strong criticism from members of his own
party.</P>
      <P>It has been reported that several lawmakers from the DPP and
opposition parties are planning to present a constitutional amendment
proposal in May to increase the number of seats in the next
legislature from 113 to 164. The proposal would come only one year
after the passage of a package of constitutional amendments,
including halving the number of legislative seats from the current
225, extending the tenure of legislators from three years to four
years, and adopting a "single seat, two ballots" legislative
electoral system.</P>
      <P>Yu stressed that people should not renege on their promise of
constitutional reform and should focus on strategies to elevate
Taiwan's competitiveness and administrative efficiency for the
benefit of the 23 million citizens of the country.</P>
      <P>"If the proposed increase in the number of seats in the
legislature is for the benefit of individual legislators, this will
affect the DPP's image, " Yu said, adding that as the chairman, he
should be responsible for the party's image.</P>
      <P>The DPP has long been calling for constitutional reform but has
maintained an open attitude on what kind of government system --
namely a presidential system or a parliamentary system -- should be
adopted, Yu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER'S UAE VISIT COVERED BY MAJOR ARAB NEWSPAPER</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan gained media exposure in the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) with the publishing in the influential Arab
dailty Khaleej Times of a story Friday on the just-concluded visit to
the country by Taiwan's foreign affairs minister.</P>
      <P>The report, appearing at the top of the third page of the daily
along with a photo featuring Foreign Affairs Minister Huang Chih-fang
chatting with Khaleej Times President Mohammed A. R. Galadari,
conveyed Huang's remarks revealing that Taiwan has a great interest
in boosting economic and trade links with the UAE.</P>
      <P>Huang arrived in Abu Dhabi April 25 with his wife and son to
attend a ceremony marking the inauguration of a new flight route of
China Airlines (CAL) -- Taiwan's main carrier -- that includes a stop
in the UAE capital. Huang returned to Taipei Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Friday report cited Huang as saying that despite the absence
of diplomatic ties between Taiwan and the UAE, Taiwan is still keen
on forging economic and trade relations with the UAE.</P>
      <P>The 26-year-old Khaleej Times, known for its outspoken reporting,
is one of the widest circulating newspapers in the Gulf region. It's
owner, the Galadari Group, runs businesses in a wide range of fields,
including automobiles, medical equipment and real estate.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, upon Huang's return to Taiwan Saturday, he clarified
his UAE trip was paid for by the ministry, and not by CAL as had been
reported in the local media.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the opposition People First Party
demanded Friday for an explanation of whether CAL paid for the
tickets and accommodation for Huang and his family, and argued that
if so, Huang should resign immediately.</P>
      <P>"The visit was an official mission, " the minister noted, adding
that he paid for his son's plane ticket out of his own pocket.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER VOWS NO MEDDLING WITH POWER RATE ADJUSTMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia  Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Saturday the
Executive Yuan respects the existing electricity rate adjustment
mechanism and will not interfere with Taiwan Power Co.'s forthcoming
rate hike plan.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Su said it is hoped that the state-owned power
company will not give preferential treatment to industrial users at
the expense of household users and will refrain from offering unfair
incentives to high electricity-consuming industries.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks while attending a ceremony marking the
company's 60th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Over the past 23 years, Su said, Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) has
never raised electricity rates despite frequent surges in commodity
and raw material prices and has even lowered power rates 11 times.</P>
      <P>"As fossil fuel prices have risen by leaps and bounds, Taipower
has toiled for years at maintaining its low electricity pricing
policy. But with crude oil prices soaring past US$70 per barrel, it
can no longer afford to do so. And this is why few people dare to pan
Taipower bluntly when the company revealed its power rate adjustment
plan earlier this month," Su said.</P>
      <P>Under the current governance system, Su said, Taipower is
eligible to draft a power rate adjustment plan which will then be
subject to a review by a special commission to be assembled by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).</P>
      <P>As power rate adjustment involves professional calculation, Su
said the Executive Yuan will respect the MOEA commission's decision
and will refrain from any administrative interference.</P>
      <P>Taipower is expected to unveil a detailed power rate adjustment
scale in mid-May. </P>
      <P>Su didn't give any hint on the Taipower's possible adjustment
range. Instead, he stressed that as households account for only a
small portion of electricity consumption, Taipower should not
unfairly raise household electricity rates while offering incentives
for large industrial users.</P>
      <P>With a view to making the domestic power rate pricing formula
more reasonable and congruent with the energy-saving policy, Su said
Taipower should not offer preferential incentives to high
electricity-consuming industries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP, DPP CHIEF DENY TRYING TO DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both Vice President Annette Lu and
Chairman Yu Shyi-kun of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) dismissed reports Saturday that they want to distance
themselves from the embattled first family in consideration of their
own political futures.</P>
      <P>Lu, in a speech given in the southern Taiwan port city of
Kaohsiung, noted that the media have recently prominently reported
the alleged involvement of the Presidential Office, including first
lady Wu Shu-jen, in a number of corruption scandals.</P>
      <P>However, she said, the credibility of the media reports is in
fact questionable, with less than 50 percent of the reports being
true.</P>
      <P>The public "can read them, but they should not trust them
entirely, "she said.</P>
      <P>She noted that reports have said that the heavyweights of the
DPP, including herself, have tried to distance themselves from
President Chen Shui-bian, who is struggling with low approval ratings
in the wake of a spate of scandals.</P>
      <P>The heavyweights, who have aspirations for presidency in the 2008
election, want to stay clear of Chen at a time when the DPP's
approval ratings have also slipped along with Chen's, the reports
said.</P>
      <P>Yu, in a meeting with grass-roots DPP members in Hsinchu,
northern Taiwan, said Saturdaythat all the DPP members are "on the
same boat, " and as the head of the party, he will not shirk his
responsibility for the sake of his own interests.</P>
      <P>Yu was responding to questions about his recent remarks that the
first family should not hesitate to apologize if it has had some
lapse of judgment or done wrong, giving rise to speculation that the
harsh remarks were aimed at distancing himself from the president.</P>
      <P>He explained that as the regulations requiring ranking officials
to put their assets into trust are still not comprehensive, he had
said that even if Wu had bought or sold stocks after putting her
assets into trust, a move criticized by some as inappropriate, she
should apologize if she was involved in any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the profits the first family has raked up are not
illegal and that the first family has expressed that it will donate
all the profits to charities and disadvantaged groups.</P>
      <P>He said that the public has judged the first family and the DPP
by the highest moral standards but has failed to apply the same
standards to the main opposition Kuomintang. Although the public
judges the DPP by stricter standards, he said, the party will accept
this and "reflect upon itself and continue to engage in reforms."</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PRESIDENT WARNS PUBLIC ABOUT CHINA'S UNITED FRONT TACTICS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu on Saturday
warned the Taiwan people about China's united front tactics, which
she said include the preferential treatment Beijing has offered
Taiwan during a recent forum co-sponsored by Taiwan's opposition
Kuomintang and the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Lu made the warning in a speech to a group of domestic
veterinarians at a farmer's association in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The vice president said that China's offer of tariff-free
treatment for Taiwan agricultural products is a ploy to confuse the
international community into thinking that Taiwan is a part of China.</P>
      <P>While Beijing continues to deploy more and more missiles
targeting Taiwan, it has at the same time tried to promote political
integration across the Taiwan Strait through the boosting of economic
exchanges, Lu said.</P>
      <P>"Actually, China is engaged in six kinds of warfare against
Taiwan, " including military, economic, diplomatic and psychological
warfare, Lu said.</P>
      <P>She also blamed the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease and
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Taiwan in the last few
years, as well as the threat of avian flu, on China's lax epidemic
control and the close exchanges between the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Regarding the huge amount invested in China by Taiwanese business
people, Lu said this has been harmful to Taiwan, citing the example
of South Korea, whose investment in China over the past 11 years she
claimed has led to the loss of 210,000 jobs in South Korea and the
creation of 1 million jobs in China.</P>
      <P>The situation is similar in Taiwan, Lu said, adding that the
relocating of Taiwan plants to China has not only caused increasing
unemployment rate on the island but has also significantly hindered
Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Politically, Lu added, Beijing is adopting a three-phase strategy
to promote the unification of China and Taiwan by declaring first
that there is only one China in the world and then stressing that the
People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of
China.</P>
      <P>Finally, she said, China's preferential treatment is undermining
Taiwan's image by confusing many in the international community into
thinking that Taiwan is a part of China. She urged the Taiwan public
not to fall into Beijing's traps.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN CAREGIVERS TEND TO HAVE MORE PHYSICAL, MENTAL PROBLEMS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign caregivers tend to have more
physical and mental problems than their local counterparts because of
their heavy workload, according to a survey unveiled Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by National Yangming University
professor Yang Cheng-chang, who interviewed 481 female caregivers,
including 212 local and 269 foreign caregivers, working in hospitals,
nursing homes or family residences around the island.</P>
      <P>Yang found that the foreign caregivers are 30 years of age on
average, or 17 years younger than their local counterparts.</P>
      <P>Although the foreign caregivers are younger and have a higher
level of education, nearly half of them have not received related
training, Yang said, adding that they are also more susceptible than
their local counterparts to exploitation.</P>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of the foreign caregivers surveyed said that
they work more than 12 hours a day and that they have to take on many
different kinds of tasks in their jobs.</P>
      <P>Among all the respondents, a higher ratio of foreign caregivers
complained about having experienced headaches, dizziness, lower back
pain or sore muscles. Six times more foreign caregivers than local
caregivers complained of irregular menstrual period.</P>
      <P>Yang said that in addition to having to work long hours for low
pay, the foreign caregivers also have to deal with the language
barrier and working in a strange land.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government pay more attention and show more
concern for the physical and mental health of foreign caregivers in
conducting its annual health checkups.</P>
      <P>Yang said that he decided to carry out a study on the physical
and mental health of female caretakers in Taiwan after an incident
three years ago in which Liu Hsia, a wheelchair-bound writer, was
beaten to death by her Indonesian caregiver who was later found to be
mentally unstable.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's armed forces have made
substantial progress in its combined services operations and defense
capabilities, a retired U.S. admiral said in Taipei Saturday.</P>
      <P>Former U.S. Pacific Command Commander Adm. Dennis C. Blair made
the remarks in a speech delivered at a seminar on Taiwan's defense
reform and combined services operation strategies.</P>
      <P>Blair is in Taipei at the head of a delegation of U.S. active and
retired military personnel to observe computerized war game
simulation as part of this year's "Han Kuang 22" military exercise
that began this week.</P>
      <P>In the past few years, Blair said, Taiwan's annual "Han Kuang"
series of military exercises has been devoted to honing combined
services operation strategies and tactics.</P>
      <P>According to Blair, the Taiwan military has made remarkable
advances in its combined services operations and defense abilities.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is basically in a defense posture, with China
as its main potential enemy, Blair said Taiwan-developed combined
services operational rules are only suited for Taiwan's specific
needs.</P>
      <P>In his view, Blair said Taiwan outpaces the United States in some
combined services operations management methods. In Taiwan, both
ballistic missile units and jet fighters are under the command of the
Air Force, which requires its fighter pilots and air defense missile
personnel to receive training together.</P>
      <P>Blair said such an arrangement is an effective and highly
efficient integration system. In the United States, combined services
operations are undertaken by different military branches and require
additional communications and training. According to Blair, the U.S.
military has not been fully satisfied with the development of its
combined services operation prowess.</P>
      <P>Stressing that consistence, well-designed integrating procedures
and well-trained personnel are key to successful combined services
operations, Blair said there is still room for Taiwan to improve its
military equipment, integrating procedures and training in combined
services operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Blair said he doesn't think that China could use
military force to realize its goal of unifying the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>With China's present military might and possible U.S. support for
Taiwan in the event of an attack from China, Blair said China is not
likely to realize its unfiication goal by brute force at the moment.</P>

Shui-bian's U.S. layover plan.</P>
      <P>Based on a tacit understanding with U.S. authorities, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) waited until after Chinese
President Hu Jintao wrapped up his U.S. visit last week to file
President Chen's request for transit stops during his upcoming Latin
America visit.</P>
      <P>The ministry informed Stephen Young, director of the Taipei
Office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), April 24 of Chen's
transit request. The ministry originally expected to receive a U.S.
reply by Saturday morning. Much to its disappointment, the reply has
failed to come as expected.</P>
      <P>Given the longstanding friendship between the two countries,
Huang said he doesn't think that the United States would make things

      <P>"I'm convinced that the United States would understand Taiwan's
situation and reach a consensus with us on President Chen's transit

Young on the issue Saturday or Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to depart Taipei May 3 for Paraguay. He will
later visit Costa Rica for the inauguration of President-elect Oscar
Arias before returning to Taipei May 11.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes that Chen will be able to make a stopover on the
west coast or southern part of the United States on his way to Latin
America and make a stopover in New York or on the U.S. west coast on
his way back to Taiwan, according to a previous report from
Washington, D.C.</P>

U.N. Agency Says Iran Falls Short on Nuclear
Data

Iran has drastically curtailed cooperation
with nuclear inspectors over the past month as
it has sped forward with its nuclear enrichment,
the International Atomic Energy Agency said
Friday. Striking an unusually bleak tone in an e
ight-page report requested by the Security
Council, the United Nations nuclear agency
also documented its increasing difficulty in
monitoring Iran's activities, and Iran's refusal
to answer questions about suspected links
between its civilian program and its military
one. For the first time, the agency stated that 
Iran had begun enriching uranium on a small
scale, confirming Tehran's boasts.

Wall Street Journal: Creative Financing,
Defying the Odds, Hedge Funds Bet Billions on
Movies

For decades, movie studios have gladly
accepted millions of dollars from a group of
investors collectively dismissed as "dumb
money": deep- pocketed dentists, oil tycoons and
other wealthy individuals eager for a piece of
the glamorous, but high-risk, game of film
production. But the biggest influx of money in
Hollywood these days is coming from sharks, not
suckers: hedge funds, private-equity funds and
investment banks. Over the past two years, these
investors have provided more than US$4 billion
in movie financing to the major film studios,
perhaps the biggest flood of outside investment
money ever. Their beneficiaries range from Walt
Disney Co. and Sony Corp.'s Sony Pictures
Entertainment to the actor Richard Gere, who is
trying to raise more than US$50 million to
finance a series of movies he wants to produce.
The new players are doing more than just 
lending Hollywood money, as Wall Street has in 
the past. In a rapidly changing world of 
distribution, they are betting big on movies by 
claiming a share of the revenue after certain 
costs from movie tickets, DVDs, pay-television 
sales and related merchandise. While it's too 
soon to judge how the newcomers will fare, 
early indicators suggest that the returns may 
be modest at best.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said Sunday the government will select a pertinent official to
replace Premier Su Tseng-chang to attend Haitian President-elect Rene
Preval's inauguration.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian originally designated Premier Su to
serve as his special envoy to attend Preval's inauguration scheduled
for May 14.</P>
      <P>However, Preval politely informed Taiwan's embassy in Haiti
Saturday that China has pressured Haiti through U.N. and other
international channels not to invite Su to attend his inauguration.
Otherwise, China threatened to retaliate when the U.N. Security
Council deliberates in August whether to extend its peacekeeping
mission in Haiti. As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council,
China can veto the council's decision.</P>
      <P>For Haiti's security and future development, Preval suggested
that Taiwan follow Japan in sending a lower-ranking official to
attend his inauguration. Japan will send the chief secretary of its
foreign ministry to attend the Preval's inauguration.</P>
      <P>Terming himself a faithful friend of Taiwan, Preval made
assurances in his message that Haiti will maintain its diplomatic
relations with Taiwan during his tenure.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said the government fully understand Haiti's
quagmire and will comply with its expectation by choosing a pertinent
replacement to attend Preval's inauguration.</P>
      <P>When the time is right, the officials said the ministry will also
arrange for Premier Su to visit Taiwan's other diplomatic allies in
the Caribbean region.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ministry panned China for choking Su's Haiti
travel plan, saying its move has gravely impaired Haiti's national
dignity and hurt Taiwan people's feelings.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and Haiti have maintained diplomatic relations
for more than half a century, the ministry said China's domineering
attitude and bulling act will boomerang.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang
Chih-fang said Saturday that if necessary, he will meet with the U.S.
representative in Taipei this weekend to discuss President Chen
Shui-bian's U.S. layover plan.</P>
      <P>Based on a tacit understanding with U.S. authorities, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) waited until after Chinese
President Hu Jintao wrapped up his U.S. visit last week to file
President Chen's request for transit stops during his upcoming Latin
America visit.</P>
      <P>The ministry informed Stephen Young, director of the Taipei
Office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), April 24 of Chen's
transit request. The ministry originally expected to receive a U.S.
reply by Saturday morning. Much to its disappointment, the reply has
failed to come as expected.</P>
      <P>Given the longstanding friendship between the two countries,
Huang said he doesn't think that the United States would make things
hard for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that the United States would understand Taiwan's
situation and reach a consensus with us on President Chen's transit
plan," Huang said, adding that if necessary, he will hold talks with
Young on the issue Saturday or Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to depart Taipei May 3 for Paraguay. He will
later visit Costa Rica for the inauguration of President-elect Oscar
Arias before returning to Taipei May 11.</P>
      <P>Taiwan hopes that Chen will be able to make a stopover on the
west coast or southern part of the United States on his way to Latin
America and make a stopover in New York or on the U.S. west coast on
his way back to Taiwan, according to a previous report from
Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports, New York is a priority choice
and Hawaii is not on the "dream" list.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office is scheduled to announce the itinerary of

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE PRESIDENT'S ACTIONS NOT AS GOOD AS WORDS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Su Tseng-chang said Sunday that
China has relentlessly strangled Taiwan's activities in the
international community and that Chinese President Hu Jintao's
actions are not as good as his words.</P>
      <P>Commenting on China's obstruction of his planned visit to Haiti
in mid-May, Su said Hu's promise to "let Taiwan have larger space to
maneuver in the international community, " made during a meeting in
Beijing with opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Honorary Chairman Lien Chan
in mid-April has proved to be a bounced check in less than a month.</P>
      <P>Su called for the Taiwan public to be more vigilant against the
plots of Beijing, which he said has tried every possible means to
oppress and contain Taiwan on the world stage.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has designated Su to serve as his envoy
to attend Haitian President-elect Rene Preval's inauguration
scheduled for May 14.</P>
      <P>However, Preval informed Taiwan's embassy in Haiti Saturday that
China has pressured Haiti through U.N. channels not to invite Su and
has threatened to retaliate when the U.N. Security Council discusses
in August whether to extend the peacekeeping mission in Haiti.</P>
      <P>As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China can

Foreign Ministry to attend the Preval inauguration.</P>
      <P>In his message, Preval also gave his assurance that during his
tenure, Haiti will maintain its diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said earlier in the day that the
government will select a suitable official to replace Su at the
inauguration.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and Haiti have maintained diplomatic relations
for more than half a century, ministry officials said China's
domineering attitude and bullying will boomerang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh Yi-chin, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party
legislative caucus whip, said Beijing's efforts to contain Taiwan in
the international community have not relented even slightly after the
Lien-Hu meeting, during which the Chinese president said he will see
to it that Taiwan is allowed more room on the world stage.</P>
      <P>Yeh blasted the meeting has having proved meaningless and she

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGED TO PROMULGATE AMENDED LAW FOR PROBE INTO 319 SHOOTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) urged President Chen Shui-bian Sunday to
sign and promulgate a newly passed amendment to provide for the
establishment of a commission to probe the March 19, 2004 shooting of
the president and the vice president.</P>
      <P>The opposition-controlled legislature amended the Organic Statute
for the 319 Shooting Truth Investigation Commission in early April in
accordance with a ruling by the Council of Grand Justices that some
clauses in the original version of the law were unconstitutional. The
amendment was then submitted to the president for his signature.</P>
      <P>At a press conference at the Legislative Yuan, KMT caucus whip
Pan Wei-kang disclosed that instead of promulgating the amendment
into law, the president again said last Friday that some clauses are
still unconstitutional and should be either further amended or
referred to the grand justices for their views on its
constitutionality.</P>
      <P>Pan claimed the president's move to block the legislation
apparently shows that he "simply does not have a clear conscience"
because, as the major victim of the 319 shooting, he should be the
person most anxious to get to the bottom of the incident.</P>
      <P>She said the legislature has already responded to the Council of
Grand Justices by making necessary changes to the clauses in
question, and that it is now up to the president to promulgate the
amended law within 10 days from receiving it in accordance with
Article 72 of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislator said the president has no right to give
instructions or ask the legislature to change the law again.</P>
      <P>The statute is intended to provide a legal basis for the
establishment of a 17-member commission to probe the shooting of Chen
and Vice President Annette Lu on the eve of the 2004 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>In late 2004, the grand justices ruled that the original statute
and a commission formed to investigate the March 19 shooting were
unconstitutional because some articles in the statute would give the
commission the same powers as those of prosecutors in carrying out
investigations into the shooting and prosecuting those responsible.</P>
      <P>The opposition legislators amended the statute, which would
require that the commission's 17 members be recommended by the
various political parties in proportion to the number of seats they
hold in the legislature.</P>
      <P>According to the amended law, legislators and members of the
Control Yuan -- the highest watchdog body -- cannot serve on the
commission, whose members should be impartial people equipped with
the right expertise.</P>
      <P>These members will be appointed by the Legislative Yuan speaker.
If any party fails to recommend its own nominees, it will be seen as
giving up its rights and the vacancies will be filled by nominations
made by the commission's convener, subject to the approval of the
legislature.</P>
      <P>The commission will answer to the people only and will not be
controlled by any government or law enforcement agencies. Its members
will have the right to ask any organization to provide documents and
evidence for its examination. Failure to cooperate could lead to a
fine of up to NT$100,000.</P>
      <P>After beginning its investigation, the commission will submit a
written report to the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan every
three months. If anyone is found to have committed a criminal
offense, the commission will refer him or her to either public
prosecutors or military prosecutors. The investigation is expected to
be completed in six months.</P>
      <P>The March 19 shooting occurred when the president and vice
president were campaigning in a jeep in Tainan, southern Taiwan. The
opposition believes the incident generated sympathy votes for Chen
and Lu, helping them to win the election by a mere 29,500 votes.</P>
      <P>It also suspects that the incident was staged, and their demand
to form a commission to investigate the shooting has met strong
opposition from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its ally,
the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  30  (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amending the Constitution is not
necessarily the cure-all for Taiwan's political reform, opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a speech at a symposium titled "The Growth of Constitutional
Democracy and Its Challenges," held by the National Policy Foundation
at National Taiwan University, Ma said the Constitution should not be
treated as a scapegoat for Taiwan's problems.</P>
      <P>"There is no urgency for amending the Constitution. What's
important is to observe and implement the Constitution," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that during the past 15 years, the Constitution
has been amended seven times -- a rare phenomenon for any democratic
country.</P>
      <P>Ma said there are many burning issues that need to be addressed,
including finding ways to prevent Taiwan's economy from being
marginalized, to help less privileged people through their financial
difficulties and prevent them from committing suicide, and to assist
"credit card slaves" in solving their debt problems.</P>
      <P>He blamed the multitude of problems plaguing Taiwan today on the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) failing to observe the
Constitution and disregarding the spirit of democracy.</P>
      <P>Ma promised that unlike the DPP, the KMT -- if it becomes the
ruling party in 2008 but does not have a majority in the legislature
-- will allow the opposition party that controls the legislature to
nominate the premier.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman, who also serves as Taipei mayor, said the
spirit of the Constitution is to allow the form of government to
switch from the presidential system to the Cabinet system when the
ruling party does not hold more than half of the seats in the
legislature.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGAL AID FOUNDATION SERVES AS `NOT JUST A GOD'By Deborah Kuo</HEADLINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> CNA staff reporter
</P>
      <P>Taipei, April 30 (CNA) Writing from her home in Vietnam, Nguyen
Thi Tham has told the attorneys who helped her gain access to legal
aid in Taiwan after her left hand was badly injured in a factory
accident that she has passed the college entrance exam to major in
law.</P>
      <P>"Now I have an opportunity to be a lawyer and help people who
have had similar traumatic experiences to mine," she wrote.</P>
      <P>When she was living in Taiwan, Nguyen, 22, was among the most
socially disadvantaged people in Taiwan -- a foreign laborer.</P>
      <P>In an interview with a cable TV station in Taipei after the
accident in 2005, Nguyen said in her newly learned mandarin Chinese
that "there were very few factories in Vietnam where I could work and
make money, so I came to Taiwan hoping that I could contribute to the
family as dad is too old to work, mom is illiterate and the only
person to take care of father and my younger brother is studying at
university and needs financial support."</P>
      <P>In early 2004, she recalled, a labor brokerage company told her
she could make a basic monthly wage of NT$15,840 (US$487) working in
a Taiwan factory for eight hours a day. She flew to the southern port
city of Kaohsiung with a happy heart and high expectations.</P>
      <P>To her chagrin, she said, she was paid only a little over
NT$7,000 per month, working 16 hours a day in a battery factory, and
had to pay rent, water and electricity bills as well as her
transportation costs.</P>
      <P>Worried that with such a tiny wage she would never be able to
repay the NT$160,000 brokerage fee that her family had borrowed so
she could come to Taiwan, Nguyen decided to abscond from the factory.</P>
      <P>She landed a job at a sheet metal factory in northern Taiwan,
where the unscrupulous owner dared to hire absconded foreign workers.
The owner agreed to pay her NT$15,000 a month and put her to work
immediately, but without showing her how to operate the cutting and
pressing machines.</P>
      <P>A strong-willed girl, Nguyen thought that if other people could
do it, so could she. So she stayed and worked.</P>
      <P>The tragedy occurred three months later when a heavy part of a
pressing machine dropped from a height directly on to her left hand
smashing her fingers and pinning her for 30 minutes until she could
be freed. "I cried and yelled, but the boss remained unmoved, saying
only that he could not remove the machine," she said.</P>
      <P>Nguyen had no health insurance and her boss demanded that she
check out from the hospital two and a half days later. Unnerved and
underrepresented, with her wounds beginning to fester, Nguyen was
despondent until a Vietnamese friend told her to call Father Peter
Van Hung Nguyen from a Vietnamese expatriate service office in
Hsinchu operated by the Taiwan International Workers Association.</P>
      <P>With Father Nguyen' s assistance, she returned to the hospital,
where she received skin grafts. Father Nguyen said that had she not
contacted his office for help, she would have been reported by her
boss and would have been deported immediately because she was an
illegal worker and a runaway.</P>
      <P>Father Nguyen, who has handled several similar cases over the
past few years and has consequently become the talk among Vietnamese
expats in Taiwan, now sees more and more such workers in trouble and
seeking his help. As a result, he said, he has been playing the role
of a go-between in helping Vietnamese people seek redress from
Taiwan's public offices, particularly the non-profit Legal Aid
Foundation (LAF) financed by the Judicial Yuan.</P>
      <P>He cooperated with LAF attorneys to win a lawsuit against the
sheet metal factory owner and forced him to pay for Nguyen's medical
bills, as well as compensation for her injuries, before she returned
to Vietnam.</P>
      <P>In the TV interview, Nguyen recalled that when she told her
brother about her plight, he "wailed and howled on the other end of
the phone."</P>
      <P>Ah-hsiung is another case in which LAF attorneys helped to obtain
justice and compensation for near-fatal workplace injuries. An
aboriginal blue-collar worker in his early 40s, Ah-hsiung fell from a
construction site about two stories high. His bare head hit iron bars
scattered on the ground, leaving him brain damaged and in a coma from
which he has not emerged. After he was declared a vegetable by the
hospital, his boss deserted him.</P>
      <P>Ah-hsiung was at least lucky enough to have his older brother and
the brother's wife to take care of him. Financially strapped and
physically exhausted because of the non-stop nursing Ah-hsiung
required, the brother and his wife approached the LAF for help,
mainly aimed at seeking justice and compensation from Ah-hsiung's
boss.</P>
      <P>The construction company owner paid Ah-hsiung's medical bills and
compensation after he lost the lawsuit filed against him by a LAF
attorney.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of May 2005, a Vietnamese housemaid screamed for
help at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport as she was being
deported but refused to succumb to injustice.</P>
      <P>When Father Nguyen was asked to come to the airport to translate
for the young lady, who was unwilling to be deported, he unearthed
one of the most scandalous crimes in Taiwan involving a labor
brokerage company in Tainan.</P>
      <P>The father-and-son management team of the brokerage company was
accused of sexually assaulting each foreign maid they introduced to
local households in southern Taiwan. The two men controlled the
foreign maids by having them sign papers in Chinese, which the
foreign nationals did not understand, with a line indicating that
they are "willing to do anything for the person in charge" and by
withholding their wages.</P>
      <P>None of the victims dared to report them because they were afraid
they would be deported if the scandal came to light. In addition,
most of them came to Taiwan with debts and they could not afford to
be deported and return home with no money. As of Sept. 5, 2005, the
number of victims in the case had risen to 26, with the actual number
believed to be as high as 40 or 50.</P>
      <P>The LAF provided the victims with legal aid by filing lawsuits
for them and demanding compensation for damages as well as payment of
withheld salaries.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of August 2004, the LAF received a phone call
from Lanyu (Orchid) island saying that around 30 Lanyu villagers had
not been paid their salaries.</P>
      <P>Traveling to Taiwan proper is costly for the Lanyu people, most
of whom are members of the aboriginal Tao tribe, and they were unable
to go to Hualien, eastern Taiwan, where a LAF branch was established
in April 2004. LAF attorneys from Taipei therefore decided to go to
the small island.</P>
      <P>During their two-day trip, they visited four villages around
Lanyu and received 45 applications in regard to 34 labor disputes,
seven land issues and four other controversies. Most of them were
caused by the conflict of Tao customs with modern regulations.</P>
      <P>"As I saw the Tao people diligently listening and trying to
understand the concept of legal aid, anxiously completing the forms
and trying to discuss their issues with us in their minimal Mandarin,
I suddenly realized the value of our existence and of the foundation,
" wrote an attorney in a report published in a LAF journal.</P>
      <P>"Perhaps Lanyu needs a court that understands the Tao customs, or
Lanyu can consider returning autonomy to the indigenous people to
allow the elders to maintain order among themselves, " the attorney
wrote.</P>
      <P>The motto of the Legal Aid Foundation is to defend the people's
rights to access the court system regardless of their financial
conditions.</P>
      <P>Describing the purposes of the foundation's establishment, which
became operational in July 2004, LAF Secretary-General Jerry Cheng
said that the provision of legal aid "helps people uphold their
constitutionally protected rights to access the court system."</P>
      <P>In July 1999, the National Judicial Reform Conference approved an
agenda to promote the creation of a legal aid system in Taiwan. In
the following two years, members of the Judicial Reform Foundation,
the Taipei Bar Association and the Taipei Society formed an alliance
to promote smooth passage of the Legal Aid Act.</P>
      <P>The act was passed in December 2003 and promulgated by President
Chen Shui-bian in early 2004. Under the act, the Legal Aid Foundation
was established in April 2004, with the Executive Yuan promising to
contribute NT$500 million (US$15.4 million) to the foundation each
year and another NT$500 million for operational costs annually, in
addition to the Judicial Yuan's annual appropriation.</P>
      <P>In order to serve all the people around the country and enable
everybody to have access to legal aid, the foundation has continued
to increase the number of its branch offices nationwide -- from the
inaugural five to 19 as of early 2006.</P>
      <P>Because indigent people are often physically or mentally
incapacitated or disturbed when they run into legal problems, Cheng
said, when branch offices are established to help applicants complete
their applications, the attorneys and staff members are required to
serve in a friendly and approachable manner.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the LAF and its branches has been good news
for socially and financially disadvantaged groups, which include
laborers, women, children and indigenous people, Cheng said, adding
that when these groups of people need legal advice, representation in
civil, administrative or criminal proceedings or assistance in the
drafting of legal documents, they should contact the foundation for
help.</P>
      <P>The foundation has since committed to assisting disadvantaged
persons in enforcing their constitutionally protected right of access
to the court system by implementing the ideal of a "people's
judiciary," thereby contributing to the building of a just society.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu Yu-lan, an LAF director of general affairs, more
than half of the country's lawyers -- about 2,300 -- have signed on
as LAF volunteer attorneys. They work as "volunteers" because they
are paid only about half or one-third of costs that otherwise would
be charged for similar cases, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The foundation and its branches have accepted around 40,000
applications since its inception. Of the total, 16,834 applicants
have been granted complete legal aid free of charge and 10,927 have
been provided with free legal consultation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>One hundred social groups in Taiwan signed
up Sunday to support "International Spank Out Day" which was
initiated in 1998 by EPOCH-USA to bring widespread attention to its
desire to end physical punishment of children.</P>
      <P>Members of the Taiwan civil groups, led by the Humanistic
Education Foundation (HEF) , called for Taiwan parents and teachers
not to spank their children or students, while offering educational
information to parents and caregivers about non-violent
discipline alternatives.</P>
      <P>The group members suggested that instead of smacking upon a
sudden impulse, make a phone call for educational consultation,
exchange pithy formulas encouraging non-violent solutions,
particularly during periods of anger, and seek supporting resources
to help stop resorting to violence.</P>
      <P>Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng, who was among several
celebrities invited by the HEF to offer their "pithy formulas" to
beef up April 30 "International Spank Out Day, " said: "Respect and
understand children to avoid treating them violently."</P>
      <P>Yu Lin, principal of the Tahchih Senior High School of Taipei,
offered: "Giving the kids a big hand is better than giving them a
smack."</P>
      <P>Cheng Li-chun, chairwoman of the National Youth Commission,
offered: "I understand what you mean, please don't spank me."</P>
      <P>Former Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tuan Yi-kang said:
"One less child spanked, one more healthy spirit born."</P>
      <P>Chin Heng-wei, editor-in-chief of Contemporary magazine said:

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Sugar Industry Museum -- the
first of its kind in Asia -- was inaugurated Sunday on an historical
site of the state-run Taiwan Sugar Corporation's (Taisugar's)
105-year-old sugar mill in Chiaotou township in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing, Taisugar Chairman Yu
Cheng-hsien, Chiaotou township head Hsu Chung-ming, Legislator Chao
Liang-yen and several other business leaders took part in the
museum's opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, Yu said the museum is intended to let the
people understand the history of Taiwan's sugar industry and its
close relationship with Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Yu said that entry to the museum in the next three months will be
free. He added that the second and third stages of the construction
project will turn the museum complex into a tourist resort.</P>
      <P>Yang expressed the hope that the new addition to Kaohsiung County
will attract more tourists, create a boom for local leisure
industries and promote the development of indigenous arts and
culture.</P>
      <P>The museum complex covers 16 hectares. Inside the museum is a
sugar mill that displays the machinery and entire sugar-making
process, plus an audio-visal center for briefing visitors about the
development of Taiwan's sugar industry. Next to the museum are 19
historical relics and a railway for transporting sugar cane and
semi-finished products.</P>
      <P>A village of arts will be built next to the museum to provide an
environment where domestic and international artists can exercise
their creative power.</P>
      <P>Chiaotou Sugar Plant, set up in 1901 by the Japanese, was the
first modern sugar mill in Taiwan. It became the leading industry in
Taiwan for decades. In the 1950s and 1960s, sugar was Taiwan's No. 1
export, earning 74 percent of Taiwan's foreign currency revenue. The
plant suffered hard times in the 1980s and closed shop in 1999.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian vowed Sunday to
cut the country's rates of occupational injury and death by 30
percent within two years.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at a meeting organized by the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) to improve workplace safety, the president
dismissed the council's goal of cutting the rates by 20 percent
within two years as "lukewarm."</P>
      <P>He said the goal should be raised to 30 percent, as workplace
safety is a basic right of laborers and one of the vital criteria for
a civilized society.</P>
      <P>Noting that he promised to lower the rate of occupational death
by 40 percent during his term when he campaigned for president in
2000, the president proudly claimed that he had honored his promise,
citing CLA statistics showing that laborer death from workplace
incidents had declined from 77 people per million laborers in 2000 to
44 people per million laborers in 2004.</P>
      <P>However, the president said, Taiwan in this regard is still
lagging behind the developed countries such as Britain, which posted
only seven deaths per million workers in 2004.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL WRANGLING FORESEEN OVER DIRECT CHINA LINKS BILLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Political wrangling between the opposition
"pan blue alliance" and the ruling "pan green camp" is set to erupt
at the Legislative Yuan as law amendments on opening direct transport
links between Taiwan and China will be put to a vote May 2 after a
four-month negotiation period has ended.</P>
      <P>The vote will serve as a test of wisdom of the two camps, as the
law revision is not only a matter of trade and business, it is also
an issue of major concern that will touch on a delicate nerve among
the Taiwan people, who are polarized by an independence versus
unification dispute regarding Taiwan's future, according to
observers.</P>
      <P>While the pro-independence "pan green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) insists that Taiwan's sovereignty must be fully guaranteed if
the two sides are to set up direct air and shipping links, the
pro-unification "pan blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP) demand that the government put aside the
dispute and pragmatically devote its energy to two-way negotiations.</P>
      <P>The "pan blue alliance" has vowed to resort to a public
referendum should the government refuse to respond to the direct
links issue after the law revision initiated by the KMT and the PFP
clears the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The law amendment to the Statute Governing the Relations Between
the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area seeks to allow
Taiwanese vessels to go to China and vice versa with Taiwan's
permission. It also would remove a ban on foreign ships and aircraft
plying between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Many KMT and PFP lawmakers say that now is a good time to promote
direct Taiwan-China transport links, as the DPP government is poised
to open Taiwan to Chinese tourists and because Premier Su Tseng-chang
has said tht he would consider putting in place some of the 15
overtures made by Beijing to Taiwan following an economic forum in
Beijing last month between the KMT and the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, head of the KMT Policy Coordination Committee,
said that the "pan blue alliance" will seek a vote to determine the
links issue if inter-party negotiations fail.</P>
      <P>Urging the DPP government to respect public opinion and conduct
rational negotiations with the "pan blue alliance" on the links,
Tseng said that the KMT and the PFP will undoubtedly call a vote on
the issue within this legislative session and that the Executive Yuan
has to abide by the Legislative Yuan's decision.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, a whip of the PFP legislative caucus, said that
"there is no need to talk about" the issue now that the DPP and the
TSU remain firmly opposed to setting up the links across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"A vote will be unavoidable to settle the issue as there is no
room left for further negotiations," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP legislative caucus whip Chen Chin-jun expressed
hope that the "pan blue alliance" will not dance to Beijing's tune by
forcing the law amendment through the Legislative Yuan and asking the
government to establish direct transport links with China under its
"one China" precondition.</P>
      <P>The links must be set up after the governments on the two sides
have held talks on an equal footing, Chen said. "Taiwan's overall
interests and national dignity must be fully safeguarded in such
talks and the government will never accept Beijing's plot to make
Taiwan one of its provinces," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen called on the KMT and the PFP to refrain from ramming the
law revisions through the Legislative Yuan, although he acknowledged
that it is hard to stop the "pan blue alliance" from doing so as it
controls a majority at the legislature.</P>
      <P>Saying that the ruling DPP is still willing to hold negotiations
with the "pan blue alliance" over the issue, he claimed that the two
parties have to face the people's verdict if they disregard national
security and dignity, and should even call a public referendum.</P>
      <P>If the links issue is approved by the people in a referendum, the
"DPP government has to accept the final result, " Chen said. But he
warned the "pan blue alliance" that the independence-unification
dispute will arise again no matter the outcome.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative caucus whip David Huang said that his party
objects to an irresponsible or rash establishment of direct transport
links across the strait as the Executive Yuan has yet to submit a
report of its impact on the domestic economy.</P>
      <P>Huang made it clear that the TSU is unlikely to throw its support
behind the far-reaching issue if the Executive Yuan does not provide
a clear explanation to the public as to why it wants the links.</P>
      <P>"Any open-door policy without adequate evaluation in advance is
an imprudent and irrational act whose pros and cons cannot not be
detected beforehand," Huang said.</P>
      <P>As long as an assessment shows that setting up the links will not
affect Taiwan's national security and will not hobble its economy,
the TSU "would be willing to further discuss the issue," he claimed.</P>
      <P>But Huang expressed disappointment with what he called the
government's inactivity, because no relevant government officials
were willing to give a report to the party's legislative caucus on
the matter.</P>

Detainee Abuse in Repatriation

A long-running effort by the Bush administration to send home
many of the terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, has been
stymied in part because of concern among United States officials that
the prisoners may not be treated humanely by their own governments,
officials said. "The Pentagon has no plans to release any detainees
in the immediate future, " said a Defense Department spokesman, Lt.
Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon of the Navy. He said the negotiations with
foreign governments "have proven to be a complex, time-consuming and
difficult process." The military has so far sent home 267 detainees
from Guantanamo after finding that they had no further intelligence
value and either posed no long-term security threat or would reliably
be imprisoned or monitored by their own governments. Most of those
who remain are considered more dangerous militants; many also come
from nations with poor human rights records and ineffective justice
systems.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is contemplating tacking on to its party platform an
anti-corruption chapter to boost the party's image, but this idea was
getting the cold shoulder from a leading party lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, director of the DPP Cultural and Communications
Department said Sunday the chapter will incorporate three principles,
including a ban on moonlighting by DPP lawmakers, a requirement for
DPP public officials to put their assets into trust, and an avoidance
of conflict of interests for them.</P>
      <P>By public officials, Tsai said, it refers to the chiefs of rural
and urban township, members of county and city council and other
officials above their levels.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the forbiddance on moonlighting was necessary after two
DPP lawmakers who run hospitals respectively were indicted for
overclaiming medicare fees through their hospitals from the national
insurance Bureau.</P>
      <P>He said DPP Chairman Yu Shyi-kun hopes the anti-corruption
chapter which is to be hammered out by the party's Policy
Coordination Committee will help clean the party's image and win back
the public confidence in the party's integrity.</P>
      <P>However, DPP lawmaker Chen Chin-jun, who is the whip of the
party's legislative caucus, opposed this move, claiming it will only
lend credit to critics' claims that DPP is ridden with corruption.</P>
      <P>Noting that several government-initiated bills designed to ensure
the integrity of elected public officials are pending in the
legislature, Tsai said it is unnecessary for the DPP to compete with
the government in laying down its own anti-corruption rules.</P>
