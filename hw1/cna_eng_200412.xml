but few are magnanimous. For everybody to imitate the ruler is to
imitate the unmagnanimous. Imitating the unmagnanimous cannot be
taken as following the right standard."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. WELCOMES CHEN'S ASSURANCE OF STICKING TO PLEDGES</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government welcomes any
comments by President Chen Shui-bian reaffirming his pledge not to
change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, a State Department
spokesman said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"We continue to hold to them (the pledges) and we certainly
welcome any comments that say he (Chen) does hold to them and he's
not going to undertake any actions that would contradict them," State
Department Richard Boucher said at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>Boucher made the comments one day after Presidential Office
Deputy Secretary-General James Huang said in Taipei that President
Chen has reaffirmed his commitment to maintaining the status quo
across the Taiwan Strait on many occasions, and that commitment will
remain in place through the rest of his term.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Boucher had said that the United States is opposed to
any referendum that would change Taiwan's status or move towards
independence.</P>
      <P>"Our primary interest is in maintaining stability across the
Taiwan Strait, and the United States is opposed to any unilateral
steps that would change the status quo," Boucher also said Monday.</P>
      <P>Boucher reiterated the U.S. position after President Chen said
over the weekend that he would hold a referendum on a new
constitution for Taiwan in 2006.</P>
      <P>Huang responded on Tuesday to Boucher's comments by saying that
holding a referendum does not mean that President Chen's pledges made
in his first inauguration speech in 2000 would be changed. In that
speech, Chen pledged that he would not declare independence, not
change the name of Taiwan's government, not add the state-to-state
theory to the ROC Constitution, and not promote a referendum on the
issue of independence versus unification.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Huang
Chu-wen expressed optimism Wednesday that his party will win 25
legislative seats in the Dec. 11 elections and help the "pan-green
camp" gain majority control in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Huang said President Chen Shui-bian will be a lame duck president
unless the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and TSU wins a majority of seats in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Only by ending a disorderly legislature dominated by the
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party
will Taiwan continue its economic development, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said that with majority control in the legislature, the
"pan-green camp" will be able to abolish what he called the
unconstitutional "truth investigation commission" created by the
"pan-blue alliance" to probe the March 19 shooting of President Chen.</P>
      <P>Instead, Huang said, the "pan-green camp" will set up a new
commission to investigate the truth behind the 228 Incident, the
period of White Terror and the Kaohsiung Incident during KMT rule and
probe the "ill-gotten" assets of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang said more than 150,000 people are expected to
participate in a TSU-organized parade set for this Sunday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The parade is aimed at promoting a referendum for a new
constitution, a new name for the country and U.N. membership under
the name of "Taiwan" in order to make Taiwan a "normal country, "
Huang said.</P>

United States from a terrorist attack at home,
said on Tuesday that he would leave his job no

possibility of eventually taking another job in

As changes in President Bush's cabinet
continued, Homeland Security Secretary
Tom Ridge said he will step down as soon as a 
successor is found to head his department. Ridge
told a news conference that he will remain in
office at least until Feb. 1. While saying
that he is leaving the country much
safer today than before the department was

international partners in the fight against
terrorism and in getting the private sector to

The death toll from landslides and flashfloods
spawned by tropical storm "Winnie" rose to at least
348, with 150 others missing yesterday, most of them
from the Central Luzon region still reeling from last
week's deadly typhoon.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: 'Winnie' leaves
hundreds dead 
Officials said more than 300 people were killed --
many of them drowned and some others electrocuted or
crushed by landslides -- in the wake of tropical
depression "Winnie" that lashed several provinces of
Luzon and Metro Manila with awesome deadliness from
Monday until yesterday.

The Philippine Star: Landslides kill over 300
At least 306 people have died in three towns in
Quezon devastated by landslides and flashfloods
following heavy rains dumped by Typhoon "Winnie,"
Secretary Corazon Soliman of the Department of Social
Welfare and Development (DSWD) said yesterday.

    <HEADLINE>POLICE NAB 2 SUSPECTS USING FOREIGN LABORERS' INFO TO OBTAIN CELL PHONES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Police have arrested two suspects in
central Taiwan who are suspected of using foreign laborers' personal
information to obtain large numbers of cellular phones, the Criminal
Investigation Bureau reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Police were tipped off about one month ago that members of the
crime ring often approached foreign laborers in their hangout
eateries or shops, claiming that they would help the laborers remit
money home or apply for cellular phones. Copies of needed documents,
commonly known as "foreign laborers' cards," were then collected from
the foreign laborers to apply for cellular phone numbers.</P>
      <P>Local mobile phone operators have issued "foreign laborers'
cards" with various preferential rates and simplified application
measurers to attract foreign workers and thus expand their market
shares.</P>
      <P>The cellular phone numbers obtained would then be sold or end
up in the hands of fraud rings or gangsters, who use them to avoid
detection by police when committing criminal deeds.</P>
      <P>In two separate raids in Changhua County and Taichung County
Sunday, police were able to round up two suspects -- Lai Pei-yao, 24,
and Kao Min-ho, 42, seizing more than 2,000 "foreign laborers' cards"
and over 200 international phone cards in total.</P>
      <P>Judging from the fact that between August and November this year,
the crime ring had applied for 70,000 cellular phone numbers with
"foreign laborers' cards", police estimated that tens of thousands of
the cell phone numbers could have already been sold on the market
and that many may have been sold to fraud rings or gangsters.</P>
      <P>The police said they will now provide related information to
communications operators and ask them to step up screening during the
application process for cellular phones.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN JOINS ASIAN 'GREEN LANE' FOR SPEEDY IMPORT CERTIFICATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Charles Kang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is joining four other Asian
economies in establishing a system, to be dubbed "Green Lane," which
helps speed up imports of electrical and electronic products by
providing quick issuance of certification documents, a Singaporean
daily reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Members of the Asia Network Forum (ANF) -- which groups major
testing and certification bodies from Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, South
Korea and mainland China -- decided Tuesday during an ANF general
meeting that the "Green Lane" project will be materialized in the
near future to further facilitate imports among the ANF member
countries.</P>
      <P>The Lianhe Zaobao daily reported that once the "Green Lane"
project is established and takes effect, imports of electrical and
electronics products, such as DVD players, will take only 10 days to
move from the factory into the country of destination, instead of the
current 45 days.</P>
      <P>The ANF member countries have agreed to exchange among themselves
issuance and recognition of product certification. The certificates
that are issued by ANF member countries will save time in the
border-crossing process, said Henry Heng, CEO of Singapore's PSB
Group, which is one of the five organizations of the ANF.</P>
      <P>Taking Singapore as an example, Heng said, Singapore exported
some S$6 billion worth of electrical and electronics products to the
other four ANF member countries over the past two years via a fast
channel, which features mainly product and export certificates that
were issued by the ANF and recognized by other ANF member countries.</P>
      <P>The ANF was established five years ago in Singapore to provide
speedy product safety testing and inspection services using advanced
technology for a range of products, including chemical and materials,
electrical and electronics, as well as mechanical and building.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has kept abreast of
reports that mainland China is trying to influence the Dec. 11
legislative elections, his top aide said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Su Tseng-chang, secretary-general to the president, made the
remarks when he attended a press conference to drum up support for
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidates at Taipei
101, the tallest skyscraper in the world.</P>
      <P>Su was referring to Chen's remarks the previous day while on the
campaign trail for DPP candidates in Keelung, in which he said Taiwan
businessmen in Shanghai recently hosted a big banquet to drum up
support for the "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) that was attended by Kuo
Su-chun and Huang Liang-hua -- who are KMT at-large legislative
candidates -- with Chinese policemen standing guard outside the
restaurant. "The Communist Party of China supports the KMT, the
Taiwanese must support the DPP," the president claimed.</P>
      <P>Noting that while DPP officials cannot go to mainland China but
the KMT has gone out of its way to solicit votes there, Su questioned
how much Beijing is trying to influence Taiwan's elections.</P>
      <P>Kuo said Wednesday that she only accompanied her husband, Hung
Hsi-yao, to the mainland to attend a gathering of Taiwan businessmen
there.</P>
      <P>She noted that Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland are
also Taiwanese and have the same right to choose their favored
legislative candidate. As an at-large candidate, she said she sees
nothing wrong with inviting Taiwan businessmen to return to support
KMT candidates.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou also urged President Chen not to
"randomly label" anyone as being in league with the communists.</P>
      <P>He said the president should not forget that he is the embodiment
of national unity, and not the source of a split, and urged him to
pay more attention of the woes of the public, such as the diminished
income of farmers and the 120,000 school children who cannot afford
to pay for lunch at school.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of five former officials of Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's administration teamed up Wednesday to promote
their bids to win seats in the Dec. 11 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Lin Cheng-hsiu, former director of the city government's

Indigenous Peoples Commission; Wu Yu-sheng, former director of the
Department of Information; Lai Shyh-bao, former vice chairman of the

legislator and former deputy convener of Taipei's human rights
advisory panel, said their professional backgrounds will make them a
strong backup for the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and People First Party and enhance the checks and balances
in the government.</P>
      <P>However, they denied their entry to the legislature was aimed at
paving the way for a bid by Mayor Ma to run for the 2008 presidency,
saying they are joining forces in the election campaign because they
share a similar philosophy.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said that Ma and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang
Jin-pyng are two of the most likely KMT candidates for the 2008
presidency.</P>
      <P>However, unless the "pan-blue alliance" continues its majority
control in the legislature after the Dec. 11 elections, Wang will
lose his speakership of the legislature, which will diminish his
leverage in the KMT, according to the analysts.</P>

Taichung, central Taiwan, in inclement weather Tuesday, leaving four
of its crew members missing with seven others rescued, Coast Guard
Administration (CGA) authorities said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The seven rescued mainland Chinese crew members were taken to
Taichung City by coast guard officers, while the four missing
crewmen, also from mainland China, are feared drowned, although the
coast guard is continuing its search, CGA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to CGA authorities, the 1,745-ton gravel ship signaled
an SOS before noon Tuesday when it sprang a leak as it was about 40
nautical miles off Taichung.</P>
      <P>The ship was on its way to the southern port city of Kaohsiung
from Hong Kong, transporting sand and gravel.</P>
      <P>Two CGA patrol frigates arrived in the location of the stricken
vessel at around 1: 30 p.m. and the gravel ship's captain later
contacted the ship's Taiwan agent, which in turn sent a tugboat to
the scene. While the tug was preparing to tow the cargo ship that
evening, however, the cargo ship suffered a sudden water intake and
sank immediately at around 10 p.m., CGA officials said.</P>
      <P>All the crewmen jumped overboard when the ship began to sink.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANCER-AFFLICTED DOCTOR RUNS MARATHON TO `KILL FEAR'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A surgeon suffering from leukemia who calls
himself Jet has signed up to run in the 2004 ING Taipei International
Marathon slated to kick off Dec. 19, because "running can drive away
his fears."</P>
      <P>Jet will be the first cancer-stricken doctor to take part in any
international marathon held in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jet said during an interview with the Central News Agency that he
has been treasured every day of his life for the last six years since
his doctors confirmed their diagnosis.</P>
      <P>Fear of death is constantly with him, Jet admitted, even though
he is a professional medical man who is supposed to know the disease
better than the average layman.</P>
      <P>His fear continues to prevail, despite his seeking religious
comfort and despite his leading a much healthier life, including
eating more greens and getting more sleep, Jet said.</P>
      <P>After trying many different ways to kill this fear, Jet said, he
has found that nothing beats running to make him feel relaxed.</P>
      <P>Over the past several years, Jet said, he has become addicted to
running and can easily dash from Renai Road up to Yangmingshan "before
he knows it."</P>
      <P>Running from Shihlin all the way to coastal Chinshan by
traversing the mountainous Yangmingshan is a piece of cake, a relaxed
Jet said.</P>
      <P>A "Taiwan Forrest Gump" or not, Jet said he finds peace whenever
he runs.</P>
      <P>He has been receiving treatment for his leukemia since the first
year of diagnosis and has shown no symptoms for the last five years.</P>
      <P>Running is probably another kind of treatment, he claimed.</P>
      <P>He has also just published his first book, titled "Challenges and
Gains in Cancer" to share his experiences and mental outlook as a
cancer patient.</P>
      <P>The 2004 ING Taipei International Marathon offers a NT$1 million
cash prize for the top overall finishers if the runners run the
standard 42.195 km marathon and break the Taiwan records -- 2: 14 for
males and 2:35 for females, according to sponsors.</P>
      <P>Other race events include a half-marathon (21 km), a nine-km race
and a three-km race, the sponsors said.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun has instructed that an
ongoing crackdown on vote-buying will target all political parties,
especially the Democratic Progressive Party, because as the ruling
party, it has to be subjected to a higher standard of inspection, a
spokesman for the Executive Yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai quoted the premier as noting that the upcoming
legislative elections are significant as they are the first national
elections since the March 20 presidential election, and he urged all
legislative candidates and voters to abide by the law in campaigning
activities.</P>
      <P>The premier has asked the Central Election Commission (CEC) and
local election commissions to carry out their duties faithfully so
that the election results can be passed on quickly and correctly.</P>
      <P>He also asked the Ministry of Justice to step up a crackdown on
violence and graft during the 10-day official campaign period that
kicked off Wednesday before the Dec. 11 election day.</P>
      <P>Yu urged political parties, candidates and third parties to
follow the regulations and not to run radio or TV ads. He warned that
the CEC and the Government Information Office (GIO) will deal with
violators according to the law.</P>
      <P>In addition, the premier wants the GIO and the Mainland Affairs
Council to compile information concerning mainland China's and the
international community's reactions to the elections and to analyze
the information.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, anti-graft teams comprised of prosecutors, police and
investigators began to station themselves in police stations around
the nation.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan, while unveiling an anti-graft
team plaque at a Taipei city police station, reaffirmed the
government's determination to crack down on graft to ensure a clean
election.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the team will act swiftly on any violations in the
elections. He noted that as the elections enter their final stage,
graft cases will become even more rampant judging from past
experience, and he warned candidates and their supporters not to
challenge the law.</P>
      <P>He also urged the public to pitch in to help contain corruption,
saying that the ministry has appropriated cash rewards for
information leading to the arrest of corrupt officials, saying that
the minimum reward will amount to NT$500,000 (US$15,520).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has no intention of changing the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait in terms of its relations with
mainland China, Executive Yuan spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in the wake of a weekly Executive Yuan
meeting in response to fresh concerns from the United States in this
regard.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that President Chen Shui-bian's recent promise to
put forth a suitable constitution for Taiwan by 2006 will not touch
on sensitive issues and he reiterated that the president does not
have the slightest intention of making any change to the country's
official title or traditional territory that is designated in the
existing Constitution.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the president will remain firm to his "four
noes plus one" pledge revealed in his May 2000 inauguration speech
and to his vow made in this year's Oct. 10 National Day address to
stay away from issues linked to the independence vs unification
dispute while pushing for an adequate constitution for the nation.</P>
      <P>Richard Boucher, spokesman for the U.S. State Department, told a
news conference a day earlier in Washington, D.C. that "we continue
to hold to them (the pledges) and we certainly welcome any comments
that say he (Chen) will hold to them and that he is not going to
undertake any actions that would contradict them."</P>
      <P>Boucher also said that the United States opposes holding any
referendum that would alter Taiwan's status quo or take it on the
path toward independence. "Our primary interest is in maintaining
stability across the Taiwan Strait, and the United States is opposed
to any unilateral steps that would change the status quo, " he

    <HEADLINE>THAI LAWMAKERS VISIT TAIWAN PRISON TO PUSH FOR PRISONER EXCHANGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Thai National Assembly delegation visited
a Taiwan prison Wednesday to study the feasibility of bilateral
exchanges of prisoners.</P>
      <P>The seven-member delegation, which arrived in Taipei earlier in
the day, is headed by Sukhum Laowansiri, a member of the Thai
National Assembly and an adviser to the Thai prime minister. Among
the delegation members is Pichan Piboonwattanawong, vice chairman of
the Thai National Assembly's Human Rights Commission.</P>
      <P>The Thai lawmakers held face-to-face talks with the 29 Thai
convicts who are serving their terms in a prison on the outskirts of
Taipei to inquire about their willingness to return home to serve out
the remainder of their time in Thai prisons.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time Thai lawmakers have visited Thai inmates
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During the 40-minute meeting, the lawmakers talked with the
inmates in their native tongue and the inmates were reported as being
moved by the visit of parliamentarians from their homeland, saying
they have few opportunities to speak their mother tongue in prison.</P>
      <P>More than 70 percent of the Thai prisoners said they are willing
to return home to serve their terms, while some others said they will
make a decision after they gain a better understanding of the prison
term commutation formula.</P>
      <P>For years, local human rights activists and families of Taiwan
nationals serving time in Thai prisons have been pushing for the two
countries to exchange prisoners, but their appeals have been hindered
by the absence of formal diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Thanks to strenuous efforts by a Taiwan-Thai cultural exchange
promotional group, the Thai parliament finally decided to send a
fact-finding delegation to Taiwan to study the feasibility of
exchanging prisoners.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers will also travel to Taichung in central Taiwan to
visit Thai prisoners incarcerated there before returning to Thailand.</P>
      <P>Laowansiri said his mission will push the Thai parliament to
discuss relevant issues and draft law revisions to pave the way for
an early realization of the long-talked-about exchanges of prisoners
with Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILL NOT BE MARGINALIZED BY CHINA-ASEAN FTA: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will not be marginalized by the
signing of a free trade agreement (FTA) between mainland China and
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) , an official of
the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) claimed
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ming-feng, vice chairman of the nation's top economic
planning agency, made the remarks in the wake of the signing of the
accord Monday between the mainland and the 10-member ASEAN during an
ASEAN summit meeting in Laos, with the aim of creating the world's
largest free trade area by 2010, a sprawling market of 1.8 billion
people.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that the mainland is trying to marginalize Taiwan, but
said that "with Taiwan's robust economic strength, it will not be
marginalized."</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the mainland's trade with ASEAN totaled
US$78.2 billion in 2003, up 42.8 percent from 2002. In the first nine
months of this year, bilateral trade reached US$75.453 billion.
Judging from this trend, bilateral trade between the mainland and
ASEAN could reach US$100 billion in 2004, said Yeh.</P>
      <P>Asked about possible adverse effects on Taiwan's economic
development with the closer economic ties between the mainland and
ASEAN, Yeh said Taiwan ranks between 15th and 17th in world trade,
showing its strong economic might.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will not be absent from the international stage, " he
stressed.</P>
      <P>Contradicting Yeh's claims, however, Kung Ming-hsin, an official
of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, a think tank, said that
under the "ASEAN plus one," Southeast Asia's exports of raw materials
and machinery equipment to the mainland will increase, which will be
detrimental to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan step up relations with Southeast Asian
countries, but at the same time target the United States and Japan
for the signing of FTAs in the mid- and long-term, adding that
although progress in this respect is slow, Taiwan still needs to make
the effort.</P>
      <P>An even bigger threat, he noted, will be "ASEAN plus three, "
meaning cooperation between ASEAN, the mainland, Japan and South
Korea, which he said will have even greater impact on Taiwan, so that
the island must go on high alert in this regard.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan can finally export papayas to Japan
after eight-year negotiations with Japanese authorities, according to
a statement released Wednesday by the Bureau of Animal and Plant
Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) under the Council of
Agriculture (COA).</P>
      <P>The statement said that the BAPHIQ received an official
announcement that day from Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries (MAFF) allowing Taiwan papayas to be shipped into
Japanese markets as long as they have been through an officially
approved quarantine and anti-pest procedure and have passed official
tests conducted by both Taiwanese and Japanese quarantine experts.</P>
      <P>BAPHIQ officials indicated that their researchers developed years
ago a steaming method that has proved capable of wiping out all fruit
flies that live on papayas, especially the new Tainung No. 2 strain
of papaya developed by COA experts.</P>
      <P>The bureau filed an application with the MAFF for certification
of the method and export permission in 1997, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>After years of on-site inspections and report reviewing, the MAFF
passed the Tainung No. 2 papayas fit for import at a public hearing
in October and filed the official announcement Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials added that in addition to papayas, the BAPHIQ has
also filed testing reports on the quarantine and anti-pest procedures
for start fruit, cantaloupe and night-blooming gereus, while making
efforts to develop effective quarantine technology for other local
fruit such as guava and bell fruit in the hope of opening overseas
markets for these products.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP POSITIVELY: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Wednesday that the
economy and competitiveness of Taiwan are both developing in a
positive direction, in the wake of reports that the Standard and
Poor's Ratings Services (S&amp;P) has revised its outlook on Taiwan to
negative from stable.</P>
      <P>Yu pointed out that Taiwan's economic growth is rising and its
unemployment rate is falling, while its rankings in terms of global
competitiveness have also improved significantly.</P>
      <P>Taiwan advanced one place to become the world's
fourth-most-competitive economy this year, according to the latest
Global Competitiveness Report released by the World Economic Forum,
and has jumped from 17th place last year to 12th this year in another
assessment conducted by the International Institute for Management
Development, he noted.</P>
      <P>S&amp;P revised its outlook as a result of rising cross-Taiwan Strait
tension and the island's weak fiscal flexibility owing to high fiscal
deficit and a growing government debt burden.</P>
      <P>However, Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said the government has
carried out a series of fiscal and financial reforms over the past
three years and has successfully improved the financial environment
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, President Chen Shui-bian has shown goodwill on many
occasions to try to improve relations between Taiwan and mainland
China and has proposed that both sides start negotiations on the
launch of cross-strait passenger and charter flight services, Chen
Chi-mai said.</P>
      <P>According to Thomas M.F. Yeh, vice chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, debts payable by the central
government accounted for 32.2 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP) as of the end of September, which is lower than the 35.6
percent of the United States, the 107.7 percent of Japan and the
100.7 percent of Singapore.</P>
      <P>The ratio was 36.6 percent of GDP after taking into account the
debts of local governments, which is still lower than the 62.8
percent of the United States and the 157.3 percent of Japan, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>Government deficits amount to NT$247.8 billion (US$7.7 billion)
this year, compared with NT$300 billion last year, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>On the financial reforms in Taiwan, Yeh pointed out that the
ratio of non-performing loans of domestic banks fell to 3.32 percent
in October this year from a high of 8.4 percent in 2002.</P>
      <P>In an effort to reduce the number of financial institutions in
Taiwan, the government has worked out a timetable that aims to raise
the combined market share of the three largest financial institutions
to above 10 percent and to lessen the number of government-owned
financial institutions to six by the end of 2005, Yeh went on.</P>
      <P>It is the government's goal to cut the number of financial
holding companies from 14 to seven by the end of 2006, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, he added, domestic investment as a percentage of GDP
is expected to rise to 20 percent this year, when economic growth is
likely to reach 5.9 percent.</P>

Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tainan County Animal Disease Prevention Center officials said it
was the second of the rare birds to be brought in for treatment and

microbes and that its condition is not life-threatening.</P>
      <P>The center was conducting various tests on the bird in order

    <HEADLINE>TAIWANESE-AMERICAN THANKS OMBUDSMAN FOR HELPING HIM STAY IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An American citizen with a Taiwanese mother
thanked Control Yuan member Liao Chien-nan Wednesday for helping him
obtain residency in Taiwan after he had overstayed his alien resident
certificate by eight years.</P>
      <P>George Laverne Jennings presented flowers to Liao as a token of
gratitude when Liao was making an inspection tour of the Taichung
County Government in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 28-year-old man was born in Colorado in 1976 to an American
father and a Taiwanese mother. His mother took him back to Taiwan
after his father died in 1984. He has since lived in Tantzu township,
Taichung County with his mother.</P>
      <P>His alien resident certificate expired eight years ago, but he
never realized the legal problems concerning his status until he went
to see a doctor early this year and came to learn that he was not
covered by the national health insurance program.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's immigration law, he was supposed to be
deported and banned from entering Taiwan again for a period of eight
years.</P>
      <P>After his case was brought to public attention with the
assistance of Taichung County Councilor Lin Chu-wang, the Control
Yuan set up a special panel to coordinate authorities to overcome the
legal restrictions.</P>
      <P>Jennings was issued a resident visa on Nov. 16 as a student at a

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN CALLS FOR TAIWAN-U.S. MUTUAL TRUST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 1 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday he
looks forward to the day that Taiwan and the United States can trust
each other without suspicions.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while meeting with Olene Walker, governor
of Utah, who is currently visiting Taipei.</P>
      <P>The president took advantage of the meeting to express his
gratitude for a positive response from the U.S. State Department to
his reaffirmation a day earlier regarding his commitment to upholding
his "four noes" pledge while formulating a new constitution and
policy toward relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"I'm grateful for the United States' positive response to my
reaffirmation and I earnestly hope that our two countries can become
closer without any mistrust," Chen told his guest.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Taiwan's proposed new constitution would be
formulated in line with Taiwan's constitutional system and would not
contradict his previous commitments on cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's constitution-amending procedures, Chen said, the
new constitution draft requires the consent of three-fourths of
legislators before it is put to a nationwide referendum.</P>
      <P>Even if the "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) manages to win a
simple majority in the new Legislature Yuan to be elected Dec. 11,
Chen said it is unlikely the "pan-green" camp will control
three-fourths of the 225 legislative seats.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, the opposition camp, with more than
one-fourth of the legislative seats, will be able to play a
check-and-balance role in writing our new constitution and thus help
ensure steady proceedings in our constitutional re-engineering work,"
Chen explained.</P>
      <P>The president further said his new constitution proposal would
not violate his previous commitments on cross-strait relations,
including the "four noes" pledge articulated in his May 2000
inaugural address, which he reaffirmed in his second inaugural
address.</P>
      <P>"The commitments on constitutional reform and cross-strait
relations that I have promised remain unchanged, and there will be
absolutely no change through the rest of my term in office, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that pursuing permanent peaceful development on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait and completing normalization of
cross-strait relations are the top mission of his second term.</P>
      <P>"I sincerely hope the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can resume
dialogue on the foundation of their 1992 Hong Kong talks," Chen said,
adding he believes that the next two years are crucial for the
development of cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>At a campaign rally last weekend, Chen vowed to hold a referendum
in 2006 on a new constitution for implementation from May 20, 2008.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Chen's push for a new constitution violated his
earlier commitments on preserving the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait, U.S. State Department Richard Boucher said Monday that the
Taiwan leader's earlier "pledges were very, very important, and they
need to be respected."</P>
      <P>"As far as whether any other ideas or proposals contradict that
or not, I think he'll have to explain," Boucher said.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Chen took advantage of his meeting with a visiting
U.S. congressional delegation headed by Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas)
to reaffirm that had not wavered in his previous commitments.</P>
      <P>Asked about the U.S. views on Chen's reaffirmation during a daily
press briefing in Washington, D.C. later that day, Boucher said: "We
saw the statement...and we certainly welcome any comments that say he
does hold to them [Chen's pledges] and he's not going to undertake
any actions that would contradict them."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAYOR HAS HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR KAOHSIUNG FREE TRADE PORT ZONE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.   1  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor will become more
competitive after the first of next year when it becomes a free trade
port zone, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks during a meeting with Singapore's
representative stationed in Taipei, Ker Sin Tze.</P>
      <P>Given that the Kaohsiung free trade port zone is slated to begin
operations on Jan. 1, 2005, Hsieh expressed the hope that the nearby
Chienchen economic processing zone would be included in the free
trade zone to further enhance the harbor's competitive edge.</P>
      <P>In response to Ker's question of opening direct trade, transport
and postal links between Taiwan and mainland China, Hsieh claimed
that with the entry of the free trade zone, Kaohsiung Harbor will be
able to serve as a transshipment center between the two sides before
the full three links are set up.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan and Keelung Harbor in
northern Taiwan are the country's first two ports authorized by the
central government to operate as free trade port zones. Keelung
Harbor -- Taiwan's second-largest port -- began free trade operations
in September.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau officials have predicted that Kaohsiung
port -- Taiwan's largest -- will be more lucrative after its free
trade zone becomes operational.</P>
      <P>Shipping companies using the Kaohsiung Free Trade Port Zone,
where goods, personnel and capital are allowed to move freely, will
see their operating costs and tax rates go down and enjoy a quicker
customs clearance process, they said.</P>
      <P>They estimated that more than NT$60 million (US$1.8 million) in
administrative costs can be saved each year and that an additional 5
million tons of cargo can be handled by the Kaohsiung Harbor,
increasing business worth over NT$150 million and creating more than
400 jobs.</P>
      <P>They also forecast that the Keelung and Kaohsiung harbors
together will be able to court an additional combined investment of
about NT$4.56 billion (US$137 million) and create at least 900 job
opportunities after kicking off their free trade operations.</P>
      <P>Taichung Harbor in central Taiwan and various economic processing
zones and industrial zones across the country are still waiting for
the final government approval to set up free trade port zones, a
major drive launched by Taiwan to make it a business operations hub
in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-U.S. TIFA TALKS END WITH CONSENSUS ON KEY TRADE ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Nov. 30 (CNA)
(By Winnie Chi and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A sub-Cabinet-level meeting under the
the Taiwan-U.S. Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA)
concluded Tuesday with both sides reaching consensus on four major
trade issues.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long, head of the
Taiwan delegation, said the two-day meeting was a success as both
sides had reached consensus on intellectual property rights (IPR)
protection, the opening of the telecommunications market,
agricultural trade and revisions to Taiwan's pharmaceutical law.</P>
      <P>Chen said the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Office has agreed
to consider Taiwan's request to remove its name from America's
Special 301 "priority watch list" for intensified IPR violations
monitoring.</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's expectation of signing a bilateral free trade
agreement (FTA) , Chen said the USTR has come to a better
understanding of Taiwan's desires.</P>
      <P>"It requires our long-term efforts. The possibility of signing a
Taiwan-U.S. free trade pact is not nil, " Chen said, adding that TIFA
is a stepping-stone to a Taiwan-U.S. free trade agreement.</P>
      <P>The TIFA trade consultation is the highest-level official
Taiwan-U.S. economic meeting. The just-concluded meeting is the first
of its kind in six years. The United States suspended TIFA
consultations in 1998 due to its discontent with Taiwan's allegedly
sloppy IPR enforcement. With tremendous progress in Taiwan's
crackdown on commercial piracy, the U.S. government finally agreed to
resume TIFA talks this year.</P>
      <P>The U.S. delegation to the just-ended meeting at the USTR office
in Washington, D.C. was headed by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative
Josette Sheeran Shiner.</P>
      <P>During the meeting that began Monday, Chen said Taiwan agreed to
adopt a national quota system instead of the existing global quota
system from next year for rice imports. Under the new quota system,
Taiwan's rice market will open wider to foreign-grown rice.</P>
      <P>In response to the U.S. request for further liberalization of
Taiwan's telecommunications market, Chen said Taiwan already opened
its fixed-line network market in September.</P>
      <P>As to the U.S. request for patent rights to pharmaceutical data
and other market liberalization measures, Chen said relevant
government agencies will come up with draft revisions to existing
laws for legislative approval in line with the U.S. suggestions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said the two sides agreed to hold a
teleconference in December to decide whether Taiwan's processed
poultry meat can be allowed to enter the U.S. market.</P>
      <P>In return, Chen said, Taiwan will decide whether to re-open its
market to U.S. beef after an expert team that has recently completed
a field study in the United States comes up with an inspection report
before the end of December.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation to the TIFA meeting was composed of
officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Council of
Agriculture, the Directorate General of Telecommunications, the
Bureau of National Health Insurance Bureau, the Board of Foreign
Trade and the nation's representative office in the United States.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO SARS QUESTIONNAIRES FOR INBOUND AIR TRAVELERS: HEALTH DEPARTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Inbound passengers at Taiwan's international
airports will no longer have to fill out a questionnaire on severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a spokesman for the Cabinet-level
Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-i, deputy director-general of the health department's
Center for Disease Control (CDC) , said that the measure will be
stopped immediately, but the requirement of having temperatures taken
will be maintained. But he added that arriving passengers with fever,
vomiting or diarrhea -- common symptoms of some epidemic diseases
including SARS -- will still be required to fill out the
questionnaire.</P>
      <P>The CDC decided to lift the measure on the grounds that a very
small number of SARS cases were screened out of passengers'
questionnaires since the practice began in March last year, Shih
said.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that potential SARS- and communicable
disease- infected passengers will be fined from NT$3,000 to NT$15,000
(US$450) , if they are found to have not handed over their
questionnaires. He called for continued cooperation from the public
to prevent a reoccurrence of SARS in the winter peak seasons of flu
and other maladies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Regular commercial flights between Taiwan
and South Korea were resumed Wednesday after a 12-year hiatus due
mainly to political reasons.</P>
      <P>The two Taiwan carriers assigned to fly the Taipei-Seoul route --
China Airlines and EVA Airways -- didn't hold special celebration
activities. The passenger occupancy rates of their first regular
Taipei-Seoul flights in 12 years reached an average of 80 percent.</P>
      <P>According to a route allocation agreement reached last month
among six Taiwan carriers interested in operating Taiwan-South Korean
flight services, the Taipei-Seoul route was assigned to China
Airlines and EVA Airways, and the Kaohsiung-Seoul line was designated
to UNI Airways and Mandarin Airlines.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-Jeju line was designated to Far East Air Transport and
TransAsia Airways, the Kaohsiung-Jeju line was appointed to UNI
Airways and Far East Air Transport. The Taipei-Busan line was
designated to TransAsia Airways and UNI Airways.</P>
      <P>On the South Korean side, Korean Air and Asiana Airlines will
initially provide seven weekly flights connecting Seoul with Taipei.
Some South Korean media executives traveled to Taipei aboard the two
Korean ailines' first flights to Taipei Wednesday. A representative
of the Incheon International Airport also arrived in Taipei aboard
the Korean Air flight to promote bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and South Korea struck an aviation agreement Sept. 1
authorizing the formal resumption of air links between both sides
after the links had been broken off in 1992 when Seoul switched

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTOR INDICTS CANDIDATE IN DEFIANCE OF SUPERIOR'S CONCERNS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  1 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A maverick prosecutor who made headlines
in January by questioning President Chen Shui-bian in his
investigation into an alleged vote-buying case was thrust into the
limelight again Wednesday by returning a vote-buying indictment
without the approval of his superior at the Hualien District
Prosecutors' Office.</P>
      <P>At a hastily called news conference, Chang Hsao-ping, a spokesman
for the Hualien District Prosecutors' Office said the indictment from
prosecutor Lee Tzu-chun against You Ying-lung, the Democratic
Progressive Party's (DPP) failed candidate in the 2003 by-election
for magistrate in Hualien County, is invalid because it had not been
approved by the Public Prosecutor General Kuo Wen-tung and,
therefore, did not have the office's seal.</P>
      <P>Chang said Kuo had asked Lee to reinforce his legal grounds for
prosecuting You but was refused by Lee who made public his indictment
anyway.</P>
      <P>Chang said Kuo has ordered Lee to transfer the case to another
prosecutor.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said that the indictment has been completed and
should have gone into force as it was sent by mail to the Hualien
District Court on Monday. He didn't know what else Kuo wanted him to
hand over to other prosecutors.</P>
      <P>Kuo's approval is only an administrative process which would not
affect the legal effect of his indictment against You, Lee went on.</P>
      <P>Lee said he didn't agreed with Kuo's view that the treatment of
similar cases in Japan should be taken into account before handling
the case, because foreign legal precedents are not binding on
domestic cases.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Hualien District Court confirmed
that his court has received Lee's indictment but has not yet assigned
it to any judges.</P>
      <P>As to the validity of the indictment, a spokesman, Lai
Chun-liang, said the judges assigned to hear the case will be decided
by themselves whether the indictment is valid or not.</P>
      <P>You was investigated for promising during his campaign to give
subsidies to chiefs of aborigines in Hualien County, which is
populated mainly by aborigines.</P>
      <P>As a candidate of the ruling DPP, You claimed that his promise
was backed by his party and DPP Chairman Chen Shui-bian, who is also
the head of state.</P>
      <P>It was for that reason that the prosecutor subpoenaed the
president for questioning on Jan. 14 and caused an uproar.</P>
      <P>For the president, it was all grist to the mill. Instead of
avoiding the probe by invoking his constitutional immunity from any
judicial pursuit, he appeared at the prosecutor's office on time and
answered Lee's questions in a cooperative spirits.</P>
      <P>You was angry Wednesday after learning that he was charged by Lee
for vote-buying, claiming that the indictment has violated his
constitutional freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>He dismissed the indictment as politically motivated and he
claimed this was evident from the prosecutor's decision to subpoena
the president three months before the 2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>You said he is mulling filing a complaint with the Control Yuan
against the prosecutor on the grounds of abuse of power.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian inaugurated an
islandwide satellite-receiving system aimed at reinforcing television
signals transmitted to aboriginal communities in remote mountainous
areas.</P>
      <P>In a ceremony to mark the inauguration of the system, President
Chen, Council of Indigenous Peoples (CIP) Chairman Chen Chien-nien,
and Director-General of Government Information Office Lin Chia-lung
jointly put a dish on an antenna.</P>
      <P>The president also spoke with a group of aborigines in Wutai,
Pingtung County in southern Taiwan via satellite hookup. The
tribesmen greeted the president by saying in chorus, "We love you. We
like you."</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen said, "I know Wutai. I have been there. It is
the best place to live in the world."</P>
      <P>The system, established at a cost of NT$71 million (US$2.2
million) , consists of 100,584 satellite dishes installed in various
places around the island. It improves the reception of TV signals in
Taiwan's mountainous areas, which are inhabited predominately by
aborigines.</P>
      <P>With this system in place, CIP Chairman Chen Chien-nien said a TV

    <HEADLINE>RARE DECEMBER TYPHOON MAY TRIGGER TORRENTIAL RAINS IN TAIWAN: CWB</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A rare December typhoon is forecast to bring
torrential rains to Taiwan in the next few days when the typhoon
encounters strong northeast trade winds, the Central Weather Bureau
(CWB) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Nanmadol, the 27th typhoon reported in the Pacific area this
year, was located some 930 kilometers south-southeast of Taiwan's
southernmost tip of Hengchun at 11 a.m. Thursday, moving in a
west-northwest direction toward Taiwan at a speed of about 30 km/h,
CWB forecasters said.</P>
      <P>The typhoon has a large radius of more than 250 kilometers, with
maximum sustained winds of up to 198 km/h.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau may issue a sea warning for Typhoon Nanmadol
late Thursday night or Friday morning, depending on how the typhoon's
strength and pace change after it makes landfall in the Philippines,
the meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>The CWB forecast that Typhoon Nanmadol will stir up high waves
with strong winds in the seas near Taiwan, adding that it still
remains to be seen whether the typhoon will directly hit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The typhoon is expected to bring large amounts of rainfall to
Taiwan, probably beginning Friday afternoon, when it encounters a
northeast trade wind system, the forecasters said.</P>
      <P>Vessels operating in the Bashi Channel and southern Taiwan Strait
should be on high alert against strong winds and high waves over the
next few days, while people in Taiwan's north and northeastern areas
should be on guard against torrential rains, the forecasters said.</P>
      <P>Typhoons are extremely rare in the Western Pacific in December
because of the colder weather, according to the CWB meteorologists.
The last time that the CWB issued a sea warning for a December
typhoon was in 1964.</P>

The National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC)

REAL, Quezon -- Real, a coastal town of 30,000
people, was fast becoming a ghost town as the
survivors scrambled to flee an approaching typhoon
that was expected to hit land on Thursday night.
Tropical storm "Winnie" has resulted in a casualty
count composed of at least 500 dead and missing.

The death toll from flashfloods and landslides

least 177 other people were reported missing.

      <P>An environmental group said Thursday that 66
legislators from across the political spectrum, or 30 percent of all
Legislative Yuan members, have signed a declaration committing
themselves to pursuing sustainable development to protect the
environment.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Environmental Protection Union (TEPU) and a dozen
other civic groups held a press conference to unveil the names of the
legislators. The list included more legislators from the "pan-green

the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), than from the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP).</P>
      <P>TEPU President Chen Chiao-hua said that 37 legislators from the
DPP, 10 lawmakers from the TSU, nine legislators from the KMT, nine
independent legislators and one lawmaker from the PFP signed the
declaration.</P>

motive behind seeking the endorsement of legislators and refused to
sign it. She stressed the TEPU's goal is to promote environmental

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) said Thursday it will promote the use of "Taiwan Republic"
envelopes as part of its campaign to rectify the name of Taiwan and
formulate a new constitution for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative whip Chen Chien-ming said that although the "new
name and new constitution" campaign is a solemn cause, it can be
addressed in a cheerful, light-hearted manner.</P>
      <P>Chen said that just as people need new clothes to fit their body
when they grow up, Taiwan has reached a stage in its development
where it requires a new constitution and a new national designation
to fit its present reality.</P>
      <P>"This is a delightful thing. We should tackle it in a cheerful
mood. We'll promote the 'new name and new constitution' campaign in
an amusing manner by encouraging the use of newly designed 'Taiwan
Republic' envelopes," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He displayed a pile of the new "Taiwan Republic" envelopes
donated by a TSU supporter at a news conference. Their format is
identical to the standard envelope issued by state-owned Chunghwa
Post Co. except for the addition of the words "Taiwan Republic" on
the top of the address blank.</P>
      <P>Chen said the TSU will distribute the new "Taiwan Republic"
envelopes to its supporters during a street parade in Taipei Sunday
to drum up support for its candidates running in the Dec. 11
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chen said, the present "Republic of China" postage
stamps issued by Chunghwa Post should also be changed to distinguish
them from those issued by the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>"At present, our postage stamps bear the name 'Republic of
China,' which has often confused foreign citizens who tend to mistake
our stamps as those issued by the People's Republic of China. We
should print the word 'Taiwan, ' not the 'Republic of China, ' on our
postage stamps to avoid any confusion," he added.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Thursday declined to comment on a wire service report that Marshall

      <P>Chen's visit, probably sometime in March or April of 2005, would

      <P>The U.S.-based Formosa Foundation is set to
host an international conference on post-elections U.S.-Taiwan-China
relations in Taipei on Dec. 13, a senior ROC presidential adviser
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Pei-li, former chairman of the foundation and a senior adviser
to President Chen Shui-bian, said the re-election of U.S. President
George W. Bush, the formation of a new mainland Chinese leadership
headed by Hu Jintao, the re-election of President Chen and the
upcoming legislative elections in Taiwan will all have a major effect
on the subsequent development of the triangular relations among the
three governments.</P>
      <P>The conference, which has been organized against this backdrop,
will cover several main topics, including the 2004 elections in
Taiwan, cross-strait relations, Taiwan's economic future, as well as
the implications of the elections on the political and strategic
relationship between the United States and Taiwan, and revising the
"one China policy, " Wu said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling party and the opposition
announced Thursday they would be holding large rallies on "super
Saturday," the last weekend before the Dec. 11 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, a vice secretary-general of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) , said that there will be a rally in Taipei
Saturday, dubbed "Taiwan vs. China, " and one in the southern city of
Kaohsiung the same evening.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the rallies, expected to draw over 100,000 people
in each city, will go on as planned in spite of Typhoon Nanmadol, a
rare December typhoon which is expected to drench participants. The
party will supply raincoats and umbrellas, Lee added.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will take part in the rally "rain or
shine," and will join former President Lee Teng-hui in Kaohsiung, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>He called the day of the rallies "super Saturday" because of its
importance to the campaigns of the party's candidates. Supporters of
the DPP and its political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
will first meet at the former Sungshan Tobacco Factory, with four DPP
campaign managers -- DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung, Premier
Yu Shyi-kun and Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, with Vice President
Annette Lu announcing the beginning of the event.</P>
      <P>President Chen will join the supporters later before they arrive
at Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The DPP and the TSU, commonly referred to as the "pan-green
camp," hope to win a clear majority in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Along the march route there will be eight stops, with DPP
legislative candidates highlighting the need for a "green" majority
in the legislature so that key legislation can be passed, such as
that to retrieve alleged ill-gotten gains in real estate from the
former ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and joining the United Nations under
the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT also announced it would hold a large rally on
Sunday in what an official described as a "promote the ROC vs.
eliminate the ROC" activity.</P>
      <P>Liao Fung-teh, director of the KMT's Organization and Development
Committee, as well as Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Culture
and Communications Committee, urged those who love their county to
come to the Taipei City Government building Sunday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Liao said that since the pro-independence TSU will also hold a
rally on the same day to promote the writing of a new constitution,
the public will be able to see the difference between the two parties
and can chose the correct path to take.</P>
      <P>Liao said that if the people are in favor of a completely new
constitution, they should join the TSU; if they support a revision of
the ROC Constitution, they should join the KMT.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that the rally aims to highlight the KMT's views
on seven issues -- opposition to tampering with history, opposition
to Taiwan independence and the writing of a new constitution,
depletion of national coffers, resistance to paying an exorbitant
price for weaponry, address rising consumer prices and deteriorating
social order and protection of farmers' livelihoods.</P>
      <P>Chang urged all supporters to bring along anything that can be
identified with the ROC to the rally to show their support for the
nation.</P>

      <P>An English-language children's book,
authored and illustrated by Taiwan artist Chih-yuan Chen, has made it
to the New York Times Book Review's "top 10" bestseller list, the
Hsin-Yi Foundation reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Guji Guji, " a modern-day ugly duckling story with a reptilian
twist: the title character is a crocodile raised among a family of
ducks -- is the second illustrated book that Chen has published in
the United States.</P>
      <P>His first, "On My Way to Buy Eggs, " another children's book, was
named one of U.S. Publishers Weekly's best children's books of 2003.</P>
      <P>"Guji Guji" is the third book of Chen's that has received the
Hsin-Yi Picture Book Award offered by the Hsin-Yi Foundation, which
was founded by Yuen Foong Yu Paper Manufacturing Co.'s founder and is
one of the most prestigious organizations in Taiwan devoted to
publications and activities for children.</P>
      <P>Chen was awarded a gold medal in the illustrated book division in
the 2004 Taipei International Book Fair earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Buzz about "Guji Guji" began in late August, when the Washington

called it "hilarious."</P>
      <P>USA Today followed suit, describing it as "quietly funny...about
true family values and accepting differences."</P>
      <P>"Sales skyrocketed after Daniel Pinkwater dubbed 'Guji Guji' a
masterpiece on National Public Radio's Weekend Edition last month.
The book is now going into its sixth printing, with more than 55,000
copies in print in just three months," said the New York Times Book
Review.</P>
      <P>Now the No. 4 bestseller on Amazon's children's book listing, it
has also been listed by the U.S. School Library Journal as a "must

      <P>An original in his own family, Guji Guji proves to himself and
others that family, no matter where or what that family may be, is
worth protecting and cherishing.</P>
      <P>The story has much to say about appreciating families and
differences, and it will resonate with children long after the final

    <TEXT>
      <P>Any modification to the Republic of China
Constitution as proposed by President Chen Shui-bian must have the
support of the people before a referendum can be held on the issue, a
senior presidential adviser said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Wu Li-pei, who is also a former chairman of the
U.S.-based Formosa Foundation, the constitutional re-engineering
project must be backed up by strong popular support and cannot be
achieved by Chen's personal will alone.</P>
      <P>Expressing the hope that the constitutional reform will clarify
the status of Taiwan, Wu said the United States has no right to
interfere in a decision made by Taiwan through a democratic process.</P>
      <P>Washington on Monday reiterated that it was "opposed to any
referendum that would change Taiwan's status or move towards
independence" in the wake of the president's proposal raised over the
weekend to hold a referendum in 2006 for a new constitution.</P>
      <P>This prompted a reassurance from the ROC government that the
constitutional re-engineering project would have nothing to do with
the issues of independence versus unification, or a change of
territorial boundaries or the country's official name.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the United States, for the sake of its own
national interests, does not want war to break out across the Taiwan
Strait and expects Taiwan to refrain from any provocative moves.</P>
      <P>Wu said he believes there will be a chance for Taiwan and China
to reopen dialogue after the Dec. 11 legislative elections because
cross-strait peace will be crucial to China's economic development
and to the stability of the new Beijing leadership headed by Hu
Jintao.</P>

    <TEXT>The Moscow Times: Ukraine Parliament Ousts
Yanukovych.

The Ukrainian parliament passed a vote of no confidence in the
government of Prime Minister Vladimir Yanukovych on Wednesday in the
latest sign that outgoing President Leonid Kuchma appears to have
abandoned Yanukovych, his preferred successor, in a power struggle
with opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko. The vote triggers the
automatic resignation of Yanukovych's government, which Kuchma has to
accept. Kuchma, however, can allow the Cabinet to stay on for up to
60 days until a new government is formed.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>DPP HOPES TO PASS DRAFT AMENDMENTS TO REFERENDUM LAW SOON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Thursday expressed the hope
that the Executive Yuan will send draft amendments to the Referendum
Law to the Legislative Yuan soon so that they can be passed in
current legislature, which will conclude at the end of January.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, DPP whip in the legislature, made the remarks
one day after the Executive Yuan withdrew draft revisions to the
Referendum Law from its weekly agenda at the last minute ostensibly
because some civic groups still think that the threshold for
initiating and mounting a petition is too high, and that Premier Yu
Shyi-kun had asked for further coordination.</P>
      <P>However, there is speculation that the retraction has to do with
pressure from the United States after a spokesman from the U.S. State
Department expressed serious concern about President Chen Shui-bian's
call to put a new constitution to a public referendum in 2006.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the DPP can understand the situation, but he
expressed the hope that after the Dec. 11 legislative elections, the
Executive Yuan will send the revised draft amendments to the
legislature as soon as practicable.</P>
      <P>He said that even some DPP legislators, the Nuke-4 Referendum
Initiative Association and other civic groups have differences about
the amendments, believing that the Executive Yuan should consider all
aspects of the issues before sending them to the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"The retraction is not due to pressure from the United States, "
he said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union, an ally of the DPP, asked the
Executive Yuan to explain clearly why it had not included the draft
amendments into discussions.</P>
      <P>The opposition People First Party said that the Executive Yuan's
withdrawal is probably just a ploy, with the intent to reap the
maximum political gains by continuing to keep sensitive questions
concerning Taipei-Beijing-Washington relations on the front burner.</P>
      <P>The draft amendments that the Cabinet had intended to discuss
actually dramatically lowered the threshold for initiating a petition
for a national referendum to 0.05 percent of those eligible to vote
in the last presidential election, or about 8,000 people. The law
currently stipulates that to initiate a referendum requires 0.5
percent of eligible voters from the last presidential election, or
about 80,000 people.</P>
      <P>The law also stipulates that a collection of signatures of 5
percent of the eligible voters in the latest presidential election, or
approximately 800,000 signature must be obtained before the proposal
can be screened by the Referendum Supervisory Committee. The draft
amendments suggest lowering the threshold to 2 percent, or about
300,000 people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HAILS AICA DECISION TO HOLD CONGRESS IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian hailed the
International Association of Art Critics (AICA) as one of Taiwan's
best friends Thursday because the UNESCO affiliate has braved
Beijing's opposition to hold its 2004 world congress in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the AICA 2004 World Congress at the
Taipei County Government building, Chen said artistic activities
symbolize a country's freedom and creativity while artistic criticism
can serve as a bridge between artists and the general public.</P>
      <P>As a member of the international community, Chen said, Taiwan is
more than willing to make positive contributions to the world and
fulfill its duties and obligations.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said Taiwan has been shut out of the United Nations
since 1971 when the U.N. General Assembly gave the China seat to
Beijing. For years, he went on, Taiwan has faced enormous
difficulties taking part in U.N.-sponsored activities because of
Beijing's diplomatic suppression.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chen said, the AICA's choice of Taiwan as
the venue for its 2004 annual congress is of great significance.</P>
      <P>Chen further said his administration has consistently placed much
emphasis on cultural development and artistic activities and
education, with an aim to make Taiwan a country with vitality and
creativity. He urged all AICA conference-goers to present valuable
advice to help boost Taiwan's cultural development.</P>
      <P>The AICA was founded in Paris in 1948 and was recognized as a
non-governmental organization by UNESCO in 1951. The AICA now has
branches in 72 member countries, representing more than 4,000 art
critics around the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan became a formal member of the organization under the
designation of "AICA Taiwan" in 2001 and the AICA authorized Taiwan
to hold its 2004 world congress last year. AICA Taiwan is one of the
few local organization that have been able to join an organization
affiliated with the United Nations Education, Science and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).</P>
      <P>More than 200 art critics from 63 AICA member states are taking
part in the AICA World Congress which will run through Dec. 9. The
congress activities will include an Administrative Council meeting, a
general assembly, symposiums and tours to local sites of interests.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-hsing, honorary president of the AICA Taiwan, said the
ongoing world congress has provided a conduit for Taiwan to develop
ties with major arts groups and will have a significant impact on the
nation's future artistic and cultural development.</P>

      <P>The private sector has actively taken part
in public construction projects, and its investment could reach
NT$120 billion (US$3.72 billion) by the end of the year, Premier Yu
Shyi-kun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while attending a party to mark the
contract signing between Dragon Steel Corp. and Taichung Harbor on
the building of a steel factory.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu said that given the difficult financial situation, the
government's investment in public construction projects has continued
to drop. In addition, the government is bound by the national debt
law, and with debts amounting to three trillion, the ceiling cannot
be raised further.</P>
      <P>He noted that the Executive Yuan has since the latter half of
2002 advocated that the private sector take part in public
construction projects. Investment from the private sector amounted to
NT$62.4 billion in 2003, up 860 percent from 2002.</P>

      <P>One out of every four working people in
Taiwan smoke and nearly half of all workplaces do not enforce a
no-smoking regulation, the latest survey on smoking hazards in the
workplace showed Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted on 9,017 full-time workers over the age
of 15 by a workplace smoking hazard prevention center at the
commission of the Bureau of Health Promotion (BHP) under the
Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that 24.2 percent of workers smoke -- 42.4
percent of men and 3.2 percent of women.</P>
      <P>Miners and gravel workers smoke the most, followed by men working
in construction. The trades in which most women smoke are real estate
and the borrowing and lending sectors, followed by the culture,
sports or leisure sectors.</P>
      <P>On trades that enforce a ban on smoking most thoroughly, the
sectors of medical care and social welfare had the highest ratio of
90 percent, followed by education services at 70 percent, and the
agriculture, forestry and fishery sector, and construction sector
ranked at 10 percent and 37 percent, respectively, in the lowest
bracket, showing that they have the most serious smoking hazard in
the workplace.</P>
      <P>BHP education official You Po-chun noted that according to
smoking hazard prevention regulations, the owners or violators in a
smoke-free workplace can be fined between NT$1,000 and NT$3,000

    <TEXT>
      <P>Around 76 percent of Taiwan companies have
hired disabled workers, with over half of them saying that
professional skills make the difference, according to the results of
a recent survey.</P>
      <P>The poll, made by a headhunting Web site, show that about 76
percent of domestic businesses have employed an average of 2.1
mentally or physically handicapped workers -- mainly partially
paralyzed persons.</P>
      <P>Some 48 percent of them admitted to having hired disabled workers
due to government law, while 57 percent claimed that professionalism
is their top consideration while deciding whether or not to hire such
a person.</P>
      <P>According to the poll results, around 35 percent of handicapped
respondents are trying to find a job, while the remaining 65 percent
are employed with an average monthly salary of NT$20,166 (US$605) --
a level which falls short of the average of NT$30,517 as claimed by
the employers questioned.</P>
      <P>Some 57 percent of the handicapped pointed to a lack of company
willingness to hire disabled workers as their major problem in
finding a job, ahead of about 50 percent who citied a lack of an
offer of adequate work.</P>
      <P>Nearly 92 percent of the disabled people polled think that the
government should further step up its employment campaign for them,
the survey showed.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Ministry of the Interior show that
there are around 896,740 handicapped people in Taiwan, accounting for
4 percent of the country's total population. More than 65 percent of
them have a senior high school education, followed by 18 percent with
a junior high school certificate. Only 2.3 percent have higher
education training.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legal Assistance Foundation (LAF) urged
the public Thursday to show more concern for the rights and interests
of foreign laborers and mainland Chinese spouses of Taiwan citizens.</P>
      <P>LAF Secretary-General Cheng Wen-lung made the appeal at a news
conference attended by two Vietnamese workers who recounted the
ordeals they have endured in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cheng said foreign laborers from other developing countries have
contributed to Taiwan's economic development over the years, but many
of them have not received reasonable treatment after they contracted
diseases or fell victim to workplace accidents, he added.</P>
      <P>Because of language barriers and disadvantageous social status,
Chen said, foreign laborers have difficulties filing complaints about
maltreatment at the hands of the Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>"Out of consideration of human rights and humanitarianism, we
should show more concern and extend necessary assistance to foreign
workers and caregivers," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>The LAF has received 6,865 applications for legal assistance
since its inauguration in July this year, Chen said, adding that
2,850 of those applications, including 107 filed by foreign
applicants, have been approved.</P>
      <P>During the news conference, two Vietnamese women, identified as
Meihua and Linmei, said they were misled by manpower brokers into
believing that they could earn big bucks if they came to work in
Taiwan. However, they said they had not received reasonable treatment
since their arrival.</P>
      <P>Meihua said she was assigned to care for a quarantined patient
during her first trip to Taiwan. She was repatriated after she was
infected by the contagious disease. On her second trip to Taiwan,
Meihua claimed she was hired to care for a partially paralyzed man.
She said she had to endure sexual assault and domestic violence.
The employer frequently threatened to repatriate her if she failed to
comply with his demands.</P>
      <P>In Linmei's case, she first worked at a factory, but absconded
after she was hospitalized due to overwork. She then worked at an
underground factory where she cut herself because of unfamiliarity
with the mechanical operations. She was forced to leave the hospital
after two days of treatment because her employer was afraid of being
found to have hired an absconder.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the LAF is striving to help Meihua and Linmei receive
reasonable compensation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fueled by a global economic recovery and
rising tension in the Middle East, imported oil cost an average of
US$34.1 per barrel in the first nine months of this year, government
authorities reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) , the average
price for the January-September period represents a rise of 20.9
percent over the previous year's level. The country's oil imports
totaled US$9.24 billion in value in the same period, an increase of
40 percent year-to-year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan consumed a total of 110 million kiloliters of oil and
other fuel in the first nine months, up by 11.9 percent compared to
the year-earlier amount, the statistics show. Some 99.18 million
kiloliters of energy sources were imported, or 98.1 percent of the
total. Only 1.9 percent was produced at home.</P>
      <P>The country has for long relied almost fully on foreign imports
to meet domestic demand. Taiwan's oil supplies come overwhelmingly
from the Middle East, while mainland China, Australia and Indonesia
are its leading suppliers of fuel coal.</P>
      <P>In the first nine months, the mainland and Indonesia provided
Taiwan with 48.4 percent and 36.2 percent of its fuel coal needs,
respectively, while Australia accounted for 12.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Although the mainland is the world's largest coal producer and
consumer, DGBAS officials said that the mainland's own robust demand
for fuel has led to a supply shortage and pushed up its prices
markedly on the international market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imported coal as both fuel and material at an average
price of US$49.6 per metric ton in the January-September period, a
jump of 47.2 percent over the average level of a year ago, according
to DGBAS tallies. The country's fuel imports grew by 11.3 percent for
the same nine-month period, with a value worth US$2.28 billion, up by
63.8 percent from the year-earlier level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S MILITARY EXPANSION TARGETS TAIWAN: U.S. THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The military expansion of mainland China
in recent years has a short-term goal of imposing its terms on
Taiwan, a former official of the U.S. Department of Defense said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Daniel Blumenthal made the remarks in a seminar on the future of
the mainland Chinese military sponsored by the American Enterprise
Institute (AIE), a U.S. think tank.</P>
      <P>Blumenthal said Beijing has in recent years continued to expand
its military might, as well as update its weaponry and command and
communications system.</P>
      <P>The military buildup aims at overwhelming Taiwan militarily and
to prevent the United States from interfering in an event of a
conflict in the Taiwan Strait, he said.</P>
      <P>Murray Scor Tanner, an expert from the Rand Corp., said the
mainland tried to pressure Taiwan businessmen operating on the
mainland during Taiwan's presidential election early this year,
warning them that if they supported Taiwan independence, they would
have to forget businesses on the mainland, but President Chen
Shui-bian won the election anyway. This, he said, makes one wonder
what options are available if economic interference is ineffective.</P>
      <P>But Harvey Feldman, a senior researcher from the Heritage
Foundation, said the mainland might have the capacity to unify Taiwan
by force soon, but using force against the island will not be in the
long-term interests of Beijing.</P>
      <P>Feldman stressed that the crucial thing is that the U.S.
administration must let Beijing know clearly that it will not sit
by in the event of a military attack against Taiwan, adding that if
the United States were to allow that to happen, Japan, South Korea,
the Philippines and other Southeast Asian nations would view the
United States in a less favorable light.</P>
      <P>But Feldman also agreed that the United States must ask Taiwan to
exercise self-restraint, and that both sides of the Taiwan Strait
must act cautiously and avoid provocation so that cross-strait
differences can be resolved peacefully.</P>

      <P>The continuing appreciation of the new
Taiwan dollar has had limited impact on the competitiveness of local
industries, with the range of its surge narrower compared with those
of its competitors such as Japan and South Korea, Bureau of Foreign
Trade (BOFT) Director-General Huang Chih-peng said Thursday.</P>

different industrial sectors, and exporters usually do not wish to
see a drastic and lasting fluctuation of the currency.</P>
      <P>Most traders and industries surveyed by the BOFT think the rise
is still within a "tolerable" range so far, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Having gained nearly NT$1.5 against the U.S. dollar over the past

Thursday to finish at NT$31.990 against the greenback.</P>
      <P>According to Kung Ming-hsin, an expert from the Taiwan Institute

footsteps of Japan and South Korea in order to maintain the
competitiveness of Taiwan's exports.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday he is
convinced that Taiwan can join the World Health Organization (WHO) as
an observer.</P>
      <P>"With the perseverance and support of our allies and friends,
we'll attain our goal of becoming a WHO observer," Chen said while
meeting with Palau Vice President Sandra S. Pierantozzi, who
concurrently serves as the South Pacific island nation's health
minister.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan has reached world standards in medical
service, health care, epidemic control and public sanitation, Chen
said it's unfair and unreasonable to exclude Taiwan from the WHO
and its governing body -- the World Health Assembly (WHA).</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his gratitude for Palau and other countries that
voiced support for Taiwan's WHO bid at this year's WHA conference
held in Geneva in May.</P>
      <P>"Although we didn't succeed, we'll not be daunted by the setback.
So long as we do not give up our bid, we'll make it one day," he said
confidently.</P>
      <P>Despite its failure to join the WHO, Chen said, Taiwan will
continue to offer medical aid to its diplomatic allies and offer
humanitarian aid to needy countries to fulfill its obligations as a
member of the international community.</P>
      <P>Pierantozzi is currently in Taiwan to attend an Austronesian
health ministers meeting.</P>

to the same hereditary illnesses, such as diabetes, obesity and gout.</P>
      <P>Besides environmental factors, Chen said, the prevalence of these

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's ubiquitous diplomatic
suppression of Taiwan has driven the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
even further apart, Taiwan's top mainland policy planner said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu made the
remarks while meeting with three visiting U.S. Congressmen -- John
Culberson, John Carter and Phil Gingrey -- along with their aides.</P>
      <P>Wu said that although commercial and cultural exchanges across
the strait have been brisk in recent years, the mainland has
continued to threaten Taiwan militarily and squeeze Taiwan's
participation in international organizations and activities on
various political and non-political occasions.</P>
      <P>Just last month, Wu said, the mainland authorities forced an
across-the-board market recall on the mainland of boxed Yungho-brand
soybean milk simply because the package identified Taiwan as its
country of origin.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Wu said, mainland customs have recently ordered the
seizure and destruction of all products carrying labels denoting
Taiwan as their country of origin.</P>
      <P>During an international hair styling and makeup contest in Milan
last month, Wu said, the mainland delegates demanded that the Taiwan
delegation change its designation to "Taiwan, PRC."</P>
      <P>"All these repressive moves have hurt the Taiwan people's
feelings and only drive the two sides further apart," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Touching on the mainland's relentless military threat, Wu said
Taiwan plans to purchase advanced defensive weapons to protect its
security and prevent the cross-strait military balance from overly
tilting in the mainland's favor.</P>
      <P>In view of the increasing social unrest on the mainland, Wu went
on, Taiwan has to heighten its alert and is making every possible
effort to protect itself from falling prey to the mainland regime's
stirring up of nationalism and patriotism, moves that are aimed at
taking the mainland people's minds off their discontent with the
communist government in Beijing.</P>

      <P>The tax exemption for foreign films will be
canceled as part of the government's efforts to revitalize Taiwan's
moribund movie industry, Government Information Office (GIO)
Director-General Lin Chia-lung said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lin said the GIO has consulted with the Ministry of Finance and
relevant film operators on the proposal to cancel tax exemption or
deduction privileges for imported movies in order to enhance the
competitiveness of locally produced films.</P>
      <P>Lin unveiled a new package of measures aimed at reviving the
flagging local movie industry two days ahead of the presentation of
the annual Golden Horse Awards in honor of outstanding Chinese- and
Taiwanese-language films, actors, actresses and other movie
professionals.</P>
      <P>Lin said the government will set up a "movie venture capital
fund" to pool resources in the public and private sectors to produce
fine-quality films with market potential and artistic value.</P>
      <P>According to the GIO's plan, Lin said the Executive Yuan
Development Fund will contribute 45 percent to the "movie venture
capital fund" and the remaining 55 percent will come from private
investors.</P>
      <P>The GIO will also coordinate with financial institutions to
provide NT$3 billion in low-interest loans for movie production and
marketing, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin said, the GIO will assist the private sector in
setting up a talent nurturing center to train a new generation of
professionals in film production and marketing.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin said, the GIO plans to coordinate private groups

    <TEXT>New York Times: U.S. to increase its force
in Iraq by nearly 12,000.

The American military presence in Iraq will grow by nearly 12,000
troops by next month, to 150,000, the highest level since the
invasion last year, to provide security for the Iraqi elections in
January and to quell insurgent attacks around the country. The
Pentagon is doing this mainly by ordering about 10,400 soldiers and
marines in Iraq to extend their tours. Commanders had signaled for
weeks that there was a likelihood that additional troops would be
needed to provide security for elections scheduled for Jan. 30, and
the Pentagon took a first step in October by ordering 6,500 troops to
extend their tours. But the force levels announced Wednesday are
larger than many officers had expected and reflect the insurgents'
deadly resiliency and the poor performance by many newly trained
Iraqi security forces in the face of rebel assaults.

Wall Street Journal: Fed view shifting on inflation; rate rises
likely.

A growing number of Federal Reserve officials believe inflation
risks are on the rise -- a shift in sentiment that will likely keep
the central bank raising interest rates at its next few meetings.
Officials cite several reasons for their new found concern: slowing
productivity growth, the lower dollar, high energy and commodity
prices, recent inflation data, and anecdotal evidence of businesses
raising prices.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TRANSFORMATION NEEDED FOR TEXTILE INDUSTRY'S SURVIVAL: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the face of an abolition of the quota
system due next year in the global textile market, Taiwan's textile
industry must seek to diversify and push for transformation if it
wants to enjoy continued growth, domestic experts said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Huang Yao-tang, chairman of the Taiwan Textile Research
Institute, said that the domestic industry should shift its focus to
industrial applications for sustainable development in view of
fiercer challenges from structural changes in the international
market.</P>
      <P>Once the quota system has been lifted, Taiwan's garment makers --
currently the mainstay of the industry, accounting for 80 percent of
the domestic industry -- will not be able to compete against rivals
in mainland China due to their cheaper production costs, Huang said.</P>
      <P>In an effort to break this bottleneck, Taiwan textile companies
should devote their resources to creative applications for
diversified uses.</P>
      <P>Compared to a share of 30 percent or the even higher 50 percent
production application rate enjoyed by European and U.S. textile
makers in other industries, such as the biotech and the architecture
arenas, Taiwan manufacturers should bravely embrace the arrival of an
"intelligence era" with sharpened competitiveness, he argued.</P>
      <P>The major obstacle facing the domestic industry today, he pointed
out, is that research and markets are not pegged to each other.
Taiwan companies do not have the know-how to turn research
achievements into innovative products in the market and to promote
them in other countries, he said.</P>
      <P>To serve that end, the Taiwan Textile Research Institute provides
domestic companies with total solution packages, with finance and
subsidies from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), he said.</P>
      <P>The institute will hold a series of seminars and exhibitions to
display their advanced research results and new products particularly
and solely for industry insiders, starting from next Monday.</P>
      <P>In terms of application fields, the pavilions will focus on
themes surrounding health care, security monitoring, medical
treatment and digital imprinting and testing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's textile industry and related businesses yield about
NT$60 billion (US$1.88 billion) in output value per year at present,
and an MOEA upgrading program seeks to double the level to NT$120
billion by 2008. The domestic industry was once the country's No. 1
earner of foreign exchange reserves.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. CONGRESSMEN URGE E.U. TO KEEP CHINA ARMS EMBARGO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Dec. 1 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twenty-five members of the U.S. House of
Representatives wrote Thursday to the prime minister of the
Netherlands, current chair of the European Union, urging him to do
whatever he can to make sure the 25-state bloc does not lift its arms
embargo on mainland China.</P>
      <P>Due to the fact that the remainder of the U.S. congressional
sessions after the November elections is rather short, the prospects
for passing HCR 512, which was introduced in mid-October, are slim.
The co-introducers of HCR 512 -- Reps. Steve Chabot (R-OH) and
Sherrod Brown (D-OH) -- decided to initiate a letter to the European
Union in lieu of the resolution. The letter quickly obtained
the endorsement of more than 20 of their congressional colleagues.</P>
      <P>HCR 512 refers to a resolution pushing the European Union to
maintain its ban on arms sales to the mainland.</P>
      <P>The letter to the Dutch prime minister reads: "We believe that
Europe should take the positions of other democracies into account.
The views of the United States, Japan and democratic nations that
surround China -- such as Taiwan and South Korea -- should weigh
heavily in the balance between pro and con. They clearly do not favor
lifting the embargo."</P>
      <P>It concludes: "We urge you to use your good offices to work with
your European Union colleagues to make sure that the arms embargo on
China remains."</P>
      <P>The 25 co-signers are: Reps. Steve Chabot, Sherrod Brown, Tom
Lantos, Tim Ryan, Mark Souder, Pete Sessions, Tom Tancredo, Vito
Fossella, Earl Blumenauer, Steve King, John Shimkus, John Hostettler,
Gene Green, Lane Evans, Howard Berman, Brad Sherman, John Culberson,
Ron Lewis, Shelley Berkley, Gil Gutknecht, Dave Camp, Peter King,
Hilda Solis, Thaddeus McCotter and Nita Lowey.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Formosa Association for Public Affairs (FAPA), a
Washington-based group dedicated to promoting Taiwan's cause, said in
a press statement Wednesday that it is pleased to learn that both the
U.S. administration and Congress oppose the lifting of the E.U. arms
embargo.</P>
      <P>Noting that if the embargo is lifted, the military balance in the
Taiwan Strait will shift unacceptably in the mainland's favor, FAPA
President Wu Ming-chi said the FAPA will do whatever it can to make
sure it is not lifted next year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) should
donate its "white sun against a blue sky" party emblem to the nation
to avoid confusion, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmaker said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shen Fu-hsiung, a physician-turned-legislator, made the appeal
after President Chen Shui-bian urged the KMT last week to voluntarily
change its party logo, which he said resembles too closely the
Republic of China's national emblem. If the KMT fails to change its
emblem in three months, Chen said, he will push for a revision to the
existing National Emblem Law to "outlaw" the KMT's party logo.</P>
      <P>Shen said the KMT should take the initiative to donate its party
emblem to the nation. Should the KMT do so, Shen said, the
Legislative Yuan should pass a resolution formally accepting the KMT
logo as the ROC's national emblem thereafter.</P>
      <P>Because of historical factors and the KMT's party-state concept,
the ROC's national emblem is only slightly different to the KMT logo.</P>
      <P>Provided that the KMT donates its party emblem, Shen said, the
DPP should also be magnanimous enough to accept the logo as the
nation's new emblem.</P>
      <P>Shen urged both camps to end their ideological strife and devote
more of their energy to developing Taiwan into a better and stronger
country.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
asked the European Union Thursday not to lift its arms embargo on

      <P>Meeting the representatives assigned to Taipei by E.U. member

commissioner in charge of external relations, on Nov. 16.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the minister said, Beijing has never denounced the
use of force as a means of resolving its dispute with Taiwan, and a
lifting of the arms embargo will boost Beijing's military
intimidation of the country.</P>
      <P>The E.U. is expected to have a summit with the mainland Dec. 8
and the question of the arms embargo is almost certain to be raised.

Interior and Local Government Secretary Angelo

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: 'Yoyong' slams Luzon

EVEN before it made landfall last night, super
Typhoon "Yoyong" (international code name: Nanmadol)
had already brought more death and destruction to the
provinces of Southern and Central Luzon still reeling
from Typhoons "Violeta" and "Unding" and tropical
depression "Winnie."

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With a rare winter typhoon approaching
Taiwan, the Council of Agriculture (COA) activated its disaster
prevention and relief mechanism Friday.</P>
      <P>Taking seriously the "super" Typhoon Nanmadol, which has killed
or left missing at least 1,000 people in the Philippines since early
Thursday, the COA warned against possible landslides and mudslides in
mountainous areas.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a sea warning for
Nanmadol at around 2: 30 a.m. Friday after the typhoon turned north
toward Taiwan after making landfall in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Nanmadol, the 27th typhoon reported in the Pacific area this
year, was located some 450 kilometers south-southwest of Taiwan's
southernmost tip of Hengchun at 11: 30 a.m. Friday, moving in a
west-northwest direction, turning north-northeast, toward Taiwan at a
speed of about 16 km/h, CWB forecasters said.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau is expected to issue a land warning
for Nanmadol at around 2: 30 p.m. Friday should the typhoon continue
to sweep in the same direction toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If Nanmadol makes landfall in Taiwan later Friday or early
Saturday, it will be the first typhoon to hit Taiwan in December in
the island's recorded meteorological history.</P>
      <P>Typhoons are extremely rare in the Western Pacific in December
because of the colder weather, according to the CWB meteorologists.
The last time that the CWB issued a sea warning for a December
typhoon was in 1964.</P>
      <P>The weather bureau warned that while approaching Taiwan, typhoon
Nanmadol is expected to interact with the northeast monsoon, causing
torrential rains in most areas of the island, particularly in the
north, northeastern and eastern parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, due to heavy rains and strong winds, authorities in
Taitung County, eastern Taiwan on Friday morning announced the
closure of all public offices and schools for the day. The Taitung
airport has been closed on and off since Friday morning, and many
flights have been delayed.</P>
      <P>All flights to and from Hualien airport in eastern Taiwan have
also been suspended, and civil aviation authorities there have given
no timetable on when they will be resumed.</P>
      <P>Tainan County saw some rare rain Friday morning. Wintertime is
usually the dry season in the southern county.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mount Ali railway officials announced Friday morning
that rail services up the scenic mountain in southern Taiwan would be
suspended Friday and Saturday due to the approaching typhoon.</P>
      <P>Daniel Wu, deputy director of the Central Weather Bureau,
forecast that Nanmadol's influence on Taiwan should peak Saturday,
after which the typhoon will sweep away from the island, hopefully on
Sunday.</P>

Wall Street Journal: As crises mount, global aid groups tap
Islamic money

As humanitarian crises multiply across the globe, straining
Western contributions, relief organizations are moving in on a source
of money that has eluded them in recent years: the Islamic world.
Muslim governments and individuals have long been generous donors to
charity, heeding the Islamic obligation to give a portion of annual
savings to the poor. Most of their giving has flowed through Islamic
charities that fund their own projects, or directly from one
government to another.

Relatively little has gone to the international organizations
that do the bulk of the feeding, housing and healing in crises around
the world.

Now, these organizations' appeals are getting a better reception
in the Islamic world. Donors are looking for more globally respected
organizations, while they found that greater contributions to
multinational humanitarian efforts can improve their image in the
West.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HANDLING MAINLAND DISSIDENTS' APPEAL: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been handling in an appropriate
manner the appeals of two mainland Chinese dissidents seeking
political asylum and settlement in third countries, an official of
the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said the government has arranged
"in three stages" for mainland Chinese pro-democracy activists Chen
Rongli and Yan Peng to settle in third countries in accordance with
their wishes.</P>
      <P>Relevant government agencies, including the MAC, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Interior, have been
collaborating in handling Chen and Yan's cases by verifying their
identities, respecting their requests and providing assistance, Chiu
noted.</P>
      <P>Chiu said it takes time and patience in handling such cases.</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman made the remarks in response to a Reuters
report Dec. 1 that 70 mainland dissidents have urged President Chen
Shui-bian to free Chen and Yan, who fled to the island earlier this
year to seek political asylum.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Chen swam to Taiwan in January after
finishing an eight-year prison term on the mainland in 2003 for
attempting to establish a political party, while Yan swam to Taiwan
in June after he was jailed in 2001 for 18 months.</P>
      <P>The report quoted Liu Qing, president of the New York-based
watchdog Human Rights in China as saying in a statement that
"detaining democracy activists who are fleeing persecution on the
mainland is hardly consistent with the Chen Shui-bian government's
professed emphasis on human rights."</P>
      <P>Chiu denied the watchdog's accusation in the statement that Chen
and Yan were denied telephone contact with the outside world and not
allowed to watch television or listen to the radio while they were
detained at the Chinglu Detention Center in Ilan, eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said Chen and Yan have enjoyed the freedom of communication,
exchanging dialogue freely with relatives and friends outside Taiwan
and officials from the Taiwan Association for Human Rights.</P>
      <P>Chiu said it was justifiable to incarcerate Chen and Yan at
Chinglu -- a detention center for illegal mainland Chinese immigrants
-- because they stole into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite this, Chiu argued, based on humanitarian grounds,
officials from the MAC and the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation have visited Chen and Yan at the detention center many
times over the past several months to gain further understanding of
their situations as well as their wishes.</P>
      <P>Chiu continued that the MAC has now completed the verification
work and is in the process of contacting third countries, including
Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as
other democratic nations, in which the dissidents have expressed
the wish to settle.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the MAC has not dragged its feet in handling the
requests, Chiu said that the third countries also need to be given
time to ponder the requests.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that the government has been active in offering
assistance to pro-democracy activists. For instance, he said, the
government helped ex-mainland dissident Tang Yuanjun to settle in the
United States in 2002 and helped Xu Po settle in the Marshall Islands
in 2003.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Association for Human Rights criticized the government
at a news conference in early August for its slow progress in
handling Chen and Yan's case.</P>
      <P>Ku Yu-chen, an association executive, said the government should
set up a special task force to handle the case. He also urged the
government to formulate a statute governing asylum for political
refugees.</P>
      <P>"We should work out operational procedures and regulations that
meet general international standards and norms in handling political
refugee asylum," Ku added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. WARNED: TALKING DOLLAR DOWN A 'DANGEROUS GAME'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Economist has warned in an editorial in
its Dec. 4 issue that it is a "dangerous game" now that American
policymakers seem to be talking the dollar down, because people will
be reluctant to invest in a currency that will almost certainly
depreciate.</P>
      <P>The British weekly magazine said America's challenge is not just
to cut its budget deficit, but also to persuade existing foreign
creditors to hang on to their vast stocks of dollar assets, estimated
at US$11 trillion.</P>
      <P>A fall in the dollar sufficient to close the U.S. current account
deficit might destroy the currency's safe-haven status. This would
lead America's creditors to start cashing their checks, causing the
dollar to tumble further. Consequently American bond yields, or
long-term interest rates, would soar, quite likely causing a deep
recession, the Economist said.</P>
      <P>The magazine noted that over the past three years, the dollar has
fallen 35 percent against the euro and 24 percent against the yen.
"But its latest slide is merely a symptom of a worse malaise: the
global financial system is under great strain."</P>
      <P>The Economist blamed the weak dollar on America's "inappropriate"
habits, including rampant government borrowing, furious consumer
spending and a huge current-account deficit, estimated to rise to
US$825 billion by 2006, or 6.4 percent of America's GDP.</P>
      <P>While suggesting that the United States should cut its budget
deficit and increase its household saving, the Economist also said
China and other Asian economies should let their currencies rise,
relieving pressure on the euro.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, it said, Europe needs to accept that a weaker
dollar will be a good thing if it helps to reduce America's deficit
and curb the risk of a future crisis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>S&amp;P REPORT BASED ON INSUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE OF TAIWAN: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lack of deep understanding of Taiwan has
led the Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Services (S&amp;P) to slap a negative
credit outlook on the island, Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) Chairman Hu Sheng-cheng claimed Friday.</P>
      <P>Hu was referring to a report released by the world-renowned
expert body Tuesday, wherein its outlook for Taiwan was revised to
negative from stable as a result of the rising tensions in
Taiwan-mainland China relations, high structural fiscal deficits and
a growing government debt burden.</P>
      <P>Hu admitted that the revision should be viewed as a warning to
Taiwan, but claimed it also reflected some "mistaken concepts" about
Taiwan that the government must try to address.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, Hu pointed out that President Chen
Shui-bian has repeatedly expressed his goodwill to the mainland by
offering to enhance economic and trade exchanges between the two
sides and pledging to maintain peace and stability across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The government is also trying to start negotiations with Beijing
on the launch of cross-strait passenger and cargo charter flight
services, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Hu said the S&amp;P assessment could have been "misled" by the
temporary disturbance in the domestic political scene, as it was
conducted at a time when Taiwan was gearing up for the Dec. 11
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>On the fiscal deficits, Hu said, the government has lessened its
capital expenditure over the past few years since Taiwan experienced
the first negative economic growth in 50 years in 2001 and an obvious
decrease in tax revenue.</P>
      <P>However, the deficits as a percentage of gross domestic product
(GDP) started to decline last year as the economy recovered and the
economic growth is expected to reach 5.93 percent and even 6 percent
this year, Hu noted.</P>
      <P>The combined public and private investment is predicted to
account for 20 percent of the GDP this year, with the ratio of
private investment likely to hit 24 percent of GDP, Hu said.</P>
      <P>Hu said he believes S&amp;P will change its opinion of Taiwan after
the new figures are released.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the government's "10 major construction
projects, " costing NT$500 billion over a five-year period, will
raise the ratio of public investment to a desirable level.</P>
      <P>The growth of government investment is forecast at 3.1 percent
next year, the first positive figure after five years of negative
growth, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S., TAIWAN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE TO AVERAGE 1:31.7 IN 2005: CIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan currency against the U.S. dollar
is expected to average 31.7: 1 in 2005 if the greenback continues to
fall in value while major Asian and European currencies soar by
comparison, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research (CIER)
forecast Friday.</P>
      <P>The average NT$-greenback exchange rate is estimated to top
31.34:1 in 2006 if similar conditions persist, CIER researchers said.</P>
      <P>At a meeting on global economic prospects for 2005, CIER
economists also forecast that Taiwan's economy will advance by 5.91
percent this year, the biggest jump since 2000.</P>
      <P>This year, they forecast, Taiwan's domestic investments will top
NT$1.94 trillion (US$60.25 billion) , with the growth of investment
from the private sector surging a whopping 24.32 percent.</P>
      <P>Export and import trade will grow 18.95 percent and 20.18
percent, respectively, for the year, the researchers forecast.</P>
      <P>The export trade will post net contributions worth NT$1.14
trillion to the nation's economy, up NT$86.5 billion over the
year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The CIER economists foresee less advantageous factors that will
adversely impact the growth of the world economies in the coming
months, such as continuously rising interest rates in the United
States that will in turn drag down investments and productivity, as
well as the cooling off of mainland China's overheated economy.</P>
      <P>They see increased oil output by oil-producing countries and
falling oil prices as potentially advantageous factors.</P>
      <P>They also predict uncertainties, including fluctuation trends of
interest rates in Japan and the European Union; whether the mainland
Chinese economy is able to secure a soft landing; and the political
situation in the Middle East.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the economists also forecast that Taiwan's economy
will grow around 4.37 percent in 2005, relatively slower than this
year's prospective 5.91 percent, mainly as a result of a slower pace
in the world's overall economic advancement, coupled with a rising NT
dollar, which will exert a negative impact on the country's export
trade, the prime mover behind economic growth.</P>
      <P>In 2005, they forecast, Taiwan's per capita income will surpass
the US$15,000 level to reach about NT$15,646.</P>
      <P>Consumption in the private sector is expected to grow 3 percent,
about the same as this year's 2.95 percent, while domestic investment
will post a growth of 7.54 percent, relatively much lower than this
year's 24.32 percent, the researchers concluded.</P>

Outgoing President Leonid Kuchma brought Ukraine's disputed

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SAYS HE WILL NOT BE SWAYED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that as
a national leader, he will holds his stance firm and will not be
easily swayed.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks when he received U.S. Congressman James
Langevin at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>The president said that after he won a second term in the March
20 presidential election, he felt an ever greater sense of
responsibility. As Taiwan is in a very difficult plight, he said
that as the nation's leader, he must consider cross-strait
relations, international factors and the different views within
Taiwan when dealing with national affairs.</P>
      <P>With only one week before the crucial Dec. 11 legislative
elections, "our stance is firm, and we will not be swayed by other
factors," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has the determination to safeguard itself and that
the Executive Yuan has proposed a special budget to purchase
submarines, anti-submarine aircraft and Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile
batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>He told his visitor that if the "pan-green camp" of his party and
its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, can command a clear majority
in the Legislative Yuan, it will facilitate the passing of the arms
procurement deal in the legislature.</P>
      <P>The president also expressed his appreciation for Langevin's
support for Taiwan's bid to be an observer in the World Health
Organization, his urging for the United States to abide by its
commitment to Taiwan's security in a meeting to mark the 25th
anniversary of the Taiwan Relations Act, and his opposition to the
European Union's lifting of an arms embargo against mainland China.</P>
      <P>He also apologized to Langevin that first lady Wu Shu-chen, who
originally wanted to accompany him to receive the U.S.
congressman, was not well enough to be present, but he thanked
Langevin for taking time to see Wu during the first lady's visit
to Washington, D.C. in 2002.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Langevin was the first U.S.
Congressman to serve while paralyzed and that his wife was also
paralyzed from the waist down after being run over by a truck 20
years ago. She was also the first legislator in a wheelchair when she
was elected as a legislator in 1986.</P>
      <P>The president expressed his admiration for Langevin perseverance,
noting that he has been confined to a wheelchair for 24 years.</P>
      <P>James Huang, vice secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
said later that Chen's long-standing stance is seeking a better
economy and major reforms to make Taiwan a normal and complete
country, and to pursue a lasting cross-strait peace.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visitors from Taiwan will enjoy visa-free
treatment during and after the EXPO 2005 AICHI, based on revised
laws, Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura confirmed Friday.</P>
      <P>Machimura told a news conference that the Japanese government has
in principle decided to continue to offer visa-free entry to Taiwan
visitors after the six-month EXPO 2005 AICHI ends on Sept. 25.</P>
      <P>The Japanese government had previously agreed to grant the
privilege to Taiwan people entering the country during the EXPO
period in an effort to lure a larger number of Taiwan tourists to the
exhibition.</P>
      <P>According to Machimura, the Japanese government will put forth a
special law in January and an amendment to the exit and entry law
after April to push through the move in two phases.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Japan's second-largest source of tourists after South
Korea, with the number so far this year expected to exceed the 1
million mark next week.</P>
      <P>Currently, only visitors from countries that maintain diplomatic
ties with Japan are provided with visa-free entry. Tokyo switched its
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1972.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a survey released Friday show
that the prevalence of obesity among Taiwanese children has increased
to 12 percent from 3 percent or 4 percent some 20 years ago, a
worrisome phenomena caused mainly by inadequate exercise and
overeating.</P>
      <P>The report also indicates that the number of female Taiwanese
people with a waist of more than 80 cm has been 40 percent of the
female population over the past 20 years, far higher than the 20
percent of the males on the island.</P>
      <P>However, the prevalence of obesity among males aged over 19 has
been growing in recent years, said Chu Nien-feng, a physician at the
department of public health of the Taipei-based Tri-Service General
Hospital, while announcing the survey results at the two-day
Symposium on Nutrition Monitoring and Health Policy Development that
opened Friday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chu noted that weight control measures popular among Taiwanese
women might be the reason their obesity rate has not expanded.</P>
      <P>The physician said that obesity is linked to deadly diseases such
as cardiac and vascular disease, making it important that people

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun pledged Friday to
continue to enhance community building on Kinmen and to develop the
outlying island into an international tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks during a tour of Kinmen to inspect major
development projects such as the Kinmen National Park and the Shuitou
port, which operates direct ferry services to the mainland Chinese
port of Xiamen.</P>
      <P>Yu pointed out that the Kinmen National Park is the sixth of its
kind in Taiwan and the first that abounds with heritage, including
historic vestiges of wars and nature reserves.</P>
      <P>The efforts to maintain traditional communities in Kinmen have
been especially remarkable, with the custody of 37 ancient houses
having been taken over by the Kinmen National Park Administration and
90 others having been restored, Yu said.</P>
      <P>Yu said the preservation of the historic properties will help
boost the tourism industry on the island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Council for Cultural Affairs will assist Kinmen
with fostering a community-building work force comprising members of
Kinmen's younger generation.</P>
      <P>Yu said the government has a responsibility to develop Kinmen and
Matsu, which have long been the frontline of Taiwan's defenses
against mainland China.</P>
      <P>The government has budgeted NT$4.3 billion (US$133.54 million) to

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS TO DEAL WITH ASEAN-PLUS-ONE EFFECT CAUTIOUSLY: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has to deal cautiously with the
effects of a free trade agreement (FTA) between the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and mainland China to avoid the
hollowing out of its industry, the head of a local think tank said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Vincent Siew, chairman of the Chung-hua Institution for Economic
Research, was referring to the signing of the FTA, dubbed
"ASEAN-plus-one" during an ASEAN summit meeting in Laos Monday, with
the aim of creating the world's largest free trade area -- a
sprawling market of 1.8 billion people -- by 2010.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement, both sides have set a timetable for cutting
tariffs starting next July, with tariffs on 7,000 items to be cut to
between zero percent and 0.5 percent by 2010.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that Japan and South Korea are also keen to begin FTA
discussions with ASEAN. Even India, Australia and New Zealand could
sign similar agreements, he added.</P>
      <P>This "ASEAN-plus-six" would usher in a completely new era very
different to the situation that exists at present, he said.</P>
      <P>He said the most adverse impact on Taiwan of an expanded ASEAN
would be the exodus of local manufacturers to places with low or no
tariffs unless Taiwan can produce goods that the world needs, which
he said is unlikely at present.</P>
      <P>The former premier and economics expert expressed worry that if
the government cannot come up with a strategy to cope with the
changes in five years, the worst scenario could be a further
hollowing out of Taiwan's industry.</P>
      <P>"With Taiwan's economic strength, there is no reason, other than
objections from Beijing, for it to be shut out of an East Asia free
trade area." He added that with its rising economic might, the
mainland is playing the role of a locomotive to orchestrate Asian
integration.</P>
      <P>"Without the consent of China, it will be difficult for Taiwan to
seek cooperation with ASEAN," Siew said.</P>
      <P>"The real impact will start from 2010, " he said, urging the
government to think carefully about how to make a breakthrough in the
next five or six years, adding that a resolution of the cross-strait
impasse will be crucial if Taiwan is to have any chance of joining
the major trade bloc.</P>

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun Friday ordered the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) to study the possibility of expanding
the "mini three links" between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Yu issued the directive in response to a proposal by Kinmen
Magistrate Lee Chu-feng during an inspection tour of the frontline
island.</P>
      <P>Kinmen and Matsu maintain direct trade, transport and postal
services with the mainland Chinese ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou --
generally known as the "mini three links." However, the services are
applicable only to local residents of Kinmen and Matsu and Taiwanese
businessmen with operations on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lee said it is time the government reviewed its "mini three
links" policy, as the mainland will soon allow its nationals to
travel to Kinmen for sightseeing purposes, with arrivals estimated at
600 people per day.</P>
      <P>According to Lee's proposal, the services should be expanded to
apply to Kinmen-born and Matsu-born people residing on Taiwan and a
five-day, four-night package tour to Kinmen and Xiamen should be
launched to attract Taiwanese tourists.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, international tourists and overseas Chinese should be
allowed to travel to Xiamen via the "mini three links" and transfer
from Kinmen to Taiwan, Lee suggested.</P>
      <P>Also, Lee proposed that the government set up an export
processing zone on Kinmen and permit imports of mainland workers.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has instructed the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to suspend all campaign
activities Friday and Saturday because of the approach of Typhoon
Nanmadol, DPP officials said.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said that he was notified
by the Presidential Office that the key campaign managers for the DPP
-- Premier Yu Shyi-kun, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh and Presidential
Office Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang -- must prepare for disaster
relief efforts, should they be necessary.</P>
      <P>A Saturday rally in Taipei that was expected to draw 100,000
people has also been canceled out of concern for the safety of
the participants, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, a deputy DPP secretary-general, said that Nanmadol
is the first typhoon to hit Taiwan in the winter and is
unpredictable, adding that the president called him Friday morning to
tell him that the focus of the nation's officials must now be on
disaster relief and prevention.</P>
      <P>Along with the Taipei rally, the DPP had scheduled a large
campaign event for Saturday night in Kaohsiung, with President Chen
and former President Lee Teng-hui attending to cement support for
candidates from the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and its ally, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>The DPP has now rescheduled the events. Former President Lee and
Chen will appear at a rally on Dec. 8 and a number of DPP luminaries
will give speeches on the eve of the Dec. 11 legislative elections.
Venues for the campaign events have yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>The DPP hopes that it and the TSU can win a clear majority in the
225-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said that a
large-scale rally planned for Sunday in Taipei will be held as
scheduled. It will revolve around the theme of "unity and
safeguarding the Republic of China." Weathermen predict that northern
Taiwan will be out of the influence of the typhoon by that time.</P>
      <P>The pro-independence TSU also said that a rally to advocate
"rectifying the name of the country, writing a new constitution and
establishing a Taiwan nation" will go on as planned on Sunday in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who concurrently serves as a KMT vice

argued that the CBC should not sit idly by and allow for manipulated
profiteering.</P>
      <P>He forecast that the local currency will appreciate rapidly again
should the daily transaction value in the domestic market surpass the
US$1 billion level.</P>
      <P>He strongly suspects that much of the foreign hot money has moved
to mainland China or other countries on the grounds that the domestic
stock market's weighted index remains below 6,000 points. He called
on the government to pay special heed to the situation.</P>
      <P>The currency ended at NT$32.2 against the U.S. dollar on the same
day in the Taipei foreign exchange market, a fall of NT$0.21 from
Thursday's finish of NT$31.99 -- a key psychological barrier for many
businesses.</P>
      <P>Chen Cheng-i, spokesman for the General Chamber of Commerce of
the Republic of China, claimed that the recent gain by the local
currency against the greenback from NT$35 to NT$32 has been quite
obvious, putting Taiwan companies in a very difficult situation to
flight against low-priced products from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The sole comfort for Taiwan businesses for the time being is that
the Japanese yen and the South Korean won have strengthened more than
the new Taiwan dollar, he added.</P>
      <P>During the October-November period, the new Taiwan dollar
appreciated by some 3 percent against the U.S. dollar, a range lower
than the 4.5 percent posted by the euro and other Asian currencies.</P>
      <P>Industry analysts predicted that Taiwan's hi-tech sectors will
suffer bigger losses than expected in their revenues figured in U.S.
dollars, in particular notebook computer and motherboard makers, if
the local unit continues to rise.</P>
      <P>To effectively minimize the impact of a stronger new Taiwan
dollar, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh a day earlier urged
domestic industries to make currency exchange hedge efforts for the
short term and sharpen their productivity for the long term.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO TAKE MEASURES TO DEAL WITH IMPACT OF ASEAN-CHINA FTA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  3 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will take a series of
measures to deal with effects of a free trade agreement between the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and mainland China, a
government official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Jun-rong, chairman of the Cabinet-level Research, Development
and Evaluation Commission (RDEC) , said that his commission had
presented proposals for relevant government agencies' reference in
dealing with the ASEAN-China FTA impact based on a study by the
Taiwan Institute of Economic Research (TIER) under the RDEC's
commission.</P>
      <P>On the economic and trade aspect, Yeh noted that the government
will use the World Trade Organization's framework to promote
substantive bilateral ties with other nations and will support trade
liberalization based on multilateralism.</P>
      <P>The government will also actively seek to sign an FTA or a closer
economic partnership agreement (CEPA) with the United States, Japan
and ASEAN nations and to seek the possibility of forming a free trade
area with Japan and South Korea, he went on, adding that Taiwan will
continue to promote its trade liberalization.</P>
      <P>Also, he said, Taiwan will continue to promote the implementation
of Bogor goals of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>With regard to domestic enterprises, Yeh said that the government
will provide them study results and analyses of effects that various
international economic integrations may bring to Taiwan for their
reference and encourage them to set up overseas strongholds to enjoy
benefits brought by FTAs.</P>
      <P>The government will also encourage private organizations to take
part in international discussions on the impact of regionalism to
Taiwan and will help Taiwan businesses establish regional trade
networks.</P>
      <P>In the long-term, Yeh said, Taiwan will actively improve its
investment environment, facilitate the development of non-trade
industries in the nation, increase domestic demand and sharpen the
nation's international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>In the political field, Yeh said that the government will
highlight the unjustified economic sanction-like treatment toward
Taiwan by the international community by shutting out Taiwan from all
bilateral and multilateral free trade areas.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Taiwan will continue to enhance bilateral ties with
ASEAN nations by offering them a generalized system of preferences.</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by the RDEC, Yeh said, Taiwan will
suffer losses of around NT$4.7 billion (US$146 million) a year, or
0.05 percent of its gross domestic product, due to the implementation
of the ASEAN-China FTA signed Monday in Laos.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MUST REACH OUT FOR CEPA WITH OTHER NATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  4  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must develop Closer Economic
Partnership Arrangement (CEPA) with other nations to soften the
impact that will result from the new free trade agreement (FTA)
between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and
mainland China, an economics official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development, was responding to the FTA signed by China and ASEAN
Monday during an ASEAN summit in Laos, under which both sides agreed
to lower all tariffs starting next July and cut tariffs for 7,000
items to between zero percent and 0.5 percent by 2010.</P>
      <P>Hu noted that the new agreement and one that might be made in the
future with ASEAN and Japan and South Korea will have an adverse
impact on Taiwan, but he has some reservations as to whether the new
cooperation framework would run as smoothly as the signatories
believe.</P>
      <P>He said that there will be difficulties during bilateral
discussions and that during this time, Taiwan has to actively
advocate its inclusion.</P>
      <P>"With Taiwan's economic strength, it should be 'ASEAN plus four,"
with Taiwan being the fourth," he said.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that signing an FTA will involve issues of
national sovereignty, which would put Taiwan at a disadvantage. As
the CEPA does not involve sovereign issues, Hu said it should be
easier for Taiwan to reach CEPA agreements with its major trading
partners.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan should step up efforts in CEPA negotiations to
minimize the impact of the China-ASEAN FTA.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said Taiwan must also continue trying to be
included in an FTA with the ASEAN, Hu said, adding that if
negotiators from Taiwan can convince one member state, others should
follow.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan currently has only signed an FTA with
Panama, and it needs to do more in this aspect, adding that some have
suggested that in addition to seeking to be included in FTAs, Taiwan
could also look for opportunities to develop CEPAs.</P>
      <P>In addition, to avoid being excluded from regional economic
integration blocs, Taiwan must also seek cooperation with nations
outside ASEAN, although Taiwan must keep a low profile to avoid being
harassed by mainland China.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, the head of a local think tank warned that the
biggest adverse impact for Taiwan of an expanded ASEAN would be
Taiwan's manufacturers flocking to low-tariff areas.</P>
      <P>Vincent Siew, chairman of the Chung-hua Institution for Economic
Research, said that he was worried that the government will not be
able to come up with a strategy to deal with the new situation in
Asia by 2010, with the worst-case scenario being the "hollowing out
of Taiwan's industry."</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Finance said Saturday that
it will be relentless in its crackdown on rogue manufacturers who try
to claim business tax rebates through false export documents.</P>
      <P>In view of the growing number of cases of manufacturers who lie

engaging in this illegal practice, among them a high-tech company
that inflated the export price to falsely claim over NT$10 million

the tax as well as a fine of NT$70 million.</P>

Friday as part of is efforts to reinforce research on Taiwan's

      <P>David Ta-wei Lee, the Republic of China representative to the

      <P>Lee thanked the university for establishing the resource center.</P>
      <P>The center is the first of its kind ever established in the
United States. Several public and private institutions in Taiwan have
donated books and periodicals to help enrich its collection.</P>
      <P>Lee said even though Taiwan-U.S. trade reaches US$50 billion
annually and the two countries have cooperated closely in maintaining
peace in the Asia-Pacific region and in countering terrorism, there
still exist barriers to mutual understanding between them because of
a combination of factors, including the absence of formal diplomatic
ties, the language barrier, geographic distance and cultural
differences.</P>
      <P>Lee said he is hopeful that the new resource center will not only
serve George Washington University students for Taiwan studies but
can also become a U.S. think tank and even an information center for
U.S. authorities.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Studies Resource Center at George Washington
University's library collects numerous Chinese and English books and
periodicals on Taiwan history and contemporary developments as well

      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng on
Saturday criticized the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) as
performing poorly in administering the country, claiming the problem
will worsen if the party gains majority control in the legislature
after the Dec. 11 elections.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is also a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT), blamed the DPP for sending Taiwan's economic growth plummeting
to 5.27 percent from the 9 percent registered during the KMT rule.</P>
      <P>While one million people have migrated to mainland China, two
million people are on the verge of unemployment, and the gap between
rich and poor is widening, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang further accused the DPP of squandering away taxpayers'
money, saying the DPP government has spent NT$8.2 trillion (US$254.65
billion) in five years, compared with only NT$5.7 trillion during the
previous five years in which the KMT ruled.</P>

the opposition-controlled legislature passed nearly 600 legislative
bills in the past five years, which he said is even more effective
than the time when the DPP was in the opposition.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Wang said the DPP's maneuvering the ethnic issue has
severely divided Taiwan society and that the DPP's provocative manner
in handling cross-Taiwan Strait relations is providing the country a
negative outlook.</P>
      <P>Wang claimed the "pan-blue alliance" must be allowed to maintain
majority control in the legislature to ensure the security of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On reports that KMT Chairman Lien Chan plans to announce three
days before the legislative elections that he will step down from the
chairmanship after the vote, Wang said he has no knowledge about this
matter.</P>
      <P>Lien has denied the reports.</P>
      <P>Wang had previously said that he would not rule out the
possibility of running for KMT chairman.</P>
      <P>In response to Wang's criticism, DPP lawmakers said Wang hopes
the "pan-blue alliance" will continue to dominate the legislature
because he wants to retain his speakership in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, the whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said
Wang is responsible for the disorder in the Legislative Yuan, as he
has always sided with the "pan-blue alliance" and failed in his role
as a neutral mediator.</P>
      <P>Tsai said he does not think Lien will step down from the KMT
leadership even if the KMT suffers a setback in the upcoming
elections.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau lifted sea and
land warnings for Typhoon Nanmadol at 2:30 p.m. Saturday.</P>
      <P>Bureau meteorologists said the strength of the rare December
typhoon was greatly reduced after it made landfall in southern
Taiwan's Fungliao township, Pingtung County at 7: 40 a.m. It left
eastern Taiwan's Taimali township, Taitung County for sea at 9: 30
a.m.</P>
      <P>A woman was killed during the storm when she was hit by a flying
billboard while riding her scooter in Tainan County. Rescuers are
currently searching for two people who went missing in Hualien. One
was swept into a river while driving, and the other was engulfed in a
mudslide as he was checking his water main.</P>
      <P>Sixty-two places around the island reported rainfall of more than
300 mm over a 24-hour period. The Pulowan mountainous community in
eastern Hualien County recorded 800mm of rain.</P>
      <P>No major casualties were reported in Taipei, but Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou urged the public to be on alert as there could still be
heavy rain.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, Yangmingshan registered the most rainfall in the
mountainous area at 160 mm, while Nankang registered the most
in the plains at 125 mm.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) estimated that the typhoon
caused agricultural losses of NT$2.60 million (US$81,250).</P>
      <P>COA officials said that 675 hectares of fields in Pingtung County
were damaged, with crops of wax apples, watermelons and onions being
the most severely affected.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications said that as of
10 a.m., Nanmadol had damaged 12 highways, with the most problems
in eastern Taiwan and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Power Company reported that electricity was briefly
interrupted in some areas in the counties of Kaohsiung, Changhua,
Yunlin and Hualien, affecting 94,334 households. Except for 231
households in Tiensiang, Hualien, 99.8 percent of homes have resumed
normal power supply.</P>
      <P>Falling rocks onto mountainous roads in the scenic Tiensiang area
have hampered repair work, Taipower said. However, after the roads
are clear Sunday, the power supply can be resumed quickly to those
still without electricity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, weathermen said that the island can expect a cold
front to hit, with temperatures dropping to around 12 degrees Celsius
between Sunday night and early Monday morning in some coastal areas.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City police should not have
issued permits allowing two rival parties to have rallies on the same
day in the same city, Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Legislator Chen
Chien-ming, said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Both the "pan-blue alliance, " made up of supporters of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) , and the TSU plan
to mobilize more than 100,000 people to attend events on Sunday
afternoon ahead of the Dec. 11 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>While the "pan-blue alliance" will march from the Taipei City
Council offices to the Legislative Yuan, the TSU will gather on
Ketagelan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the TSU filed its application with the
police a month ago on Nov. 3, and the application by the "pan-blue
alliance" was filed much later than that.</P>
      <P>He said the police are negligent for issuing the two permits
since the potential for conflict between the parties with different
political views is obvious.</P>
      <P>Also, Chen said, the TSU has received information indicating that
some radical supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" might take the
opportunity to attack former President Lee Teng-hui, who will
participate in the TSU rally.</P>
      <P>In addition to promoting the writing of a new constitution and
rectifying the name of the country, Lee will also try to give voters
a clear idea of the differences between the TSU and the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party in order to consolidate the TSU's
support base in the elections, sources said.</P>
      <P>In response to Chen's concerns, officials at the Taipei City
Police Department said the two rallies were permitted according to
law and that the order in which the applications were submitted was
not a consideration.</P>
      <P>A large police force will be deployed to maintain order at the
rallies to prevent any violent incidents, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOTORCADES, RALLIES PLANNED AS CAMPAIGNING ENTERS HOME STRETCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) announced Saturday that major party campaign managers will lead
motorcades in central Taiwan Sunday as stumping for the Dec. 11
legislative elections enters the home stretch.</P>
      <P>Su Tseng-chang, secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
said that looking at the breakdown of the vote count in the
presidential elections in 2000 and 2004, one can see that the DPP
gained 13 percent in central Taiwan over the past four years, with
Taichung County jumping 15 percent.</P>
      <P>But he said that the DPP hasn't fully reached all of its
potential supporters for the upcoming elections, shown by the fact
that the support for one political party is higher than for
individual candidates. Since many of the DPP's candidates are not
so well known this time, the party must do all it can to help them
raise their visibility.</P>
      <P>Su estimated that the DPP can gain four seats over what it
currently holds; this and the two to three seats from the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, the ally of the DPP, will ensure that the
"pan-green camp" wins a clear majority in the 225-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung will lead a motorcade in
Nantou, while Premier Yu Shyi-kun will lead one in Changhuwa.
Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh will lead a motorcade in Taichung, and Su
himself will lead a procession of campaign vehicles in Yunlin. The
motorcades will converge in Fengyuan, Taichung County before heading
toward Taichung City to meet with President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, a deputy DPP secretary-general, also announced
that there will be a big rally in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan,
Thursday, or the eve of the 25th anniversary of the "Kaohsiung
Incident" -- a pro-democracy peaceful rally in 1979 in which political
dissidents used the occasion of marking the Dec. 10 World Human
Rights Day to criticize the government. The day ended in police raids
and arrests. Some participants, including Vice President Annette Lu,
were jailed.</P>
      <P>Lee said that this will be a rally that is expected to draw
50,000 people in front of the Kaohsiung Museum of Fine Arts that
night, and the party is arranging for President Chen to appear with
former President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that President Chen, DPP Secretary-General Chang,
Kaohsiung Mayor Hsieh, and Presidential Secretary-General Su were all
defense lawyers for the defendants of the "Kaohsiung Incident, " and
they will all be at the campaign event.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that 25 years ago, the supporters carried torches, but
the supporters will carry roses and lanterns Thursday to try to
revitalize the spirit of human rights, love and peace in memory of
the night the "Kaohsiung Incident" took place.</P>

      <P>Lawrence Euteneier, a visually impaired
staff member at the Canadian Department of Industry, received the
2004 First Lady of Taiwan/The Wu Shu-jen Career Award at a World
Disabled Day celebration dinner in Ottawa Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Tung-pi, the Republic of China representative to Canada,
presented the award to Euteneier on behalf of the ROC first lady at
the Celebration of People Awards Dinner at Tudor Hall in the Canadian

      <P>Euteneier has headed a team of engineers and programmers at the
Canadian Department of Industry in setting up a "Web-4-All" Web site
with special software and hardware designs to enable the physically

      <P>Chen read Wu's congratulatory message at the presentation
ceremony. Wu thanked Euteneier for offering her and the people of
Taiwan an opportunity to express concern and friendship for disabled
Canadian people through the presentation of the award.</P>
      <P>On behalf of Wu, Chen also presented a book detailing Wu's visit
to the United States in 2002, titled "Journey of Democracy and
Goodwill," to Euteneier.</P>
      <P>The events organizers presented an outstanding achievement
award to Wu in 2002 in recognition of her efforts in public service
despite her disability. Wu has been paralyzed from the waist down
since being run over by a small truck in 1985. With Wu's consent, the
ROC representative office has since set up the First Lady of
Taiwan/The Wu Shu-jen Career Award to be presented annually as part

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, CHINA URGED TO BE MORE FLEXIBLE FOR CROSS-STRAIT RESOLUTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Dec. 4 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China should be more flexible
and practical in finding a resolution that is acceptable to both
sides to end their deadlock, an American scholar said Saturday.</P>
      <P>David Shambaugh, director of the China Policy Program at the
Elliott School of International Affairs of George Washington
University, made the remarks during a seminar on cross-Taiwan Strait
relations organized by the school.</P>
      <P>Shambaugh said it will not help solve any problem for Taipei and
Beijing to insist on preconditions that the other side will never
accept.</P>
      <P>For example, China has been trying to sell its "one country, two
systems" formula for unification despite the fact that very few
people in Taiwan are in favor of this proposal, Shambaugh said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taiwan is insisting that it is an independent
sovereign state, which is objected to by Beijing and finds little
support from Washington, Shambaugh said.</P>
      <P>He said remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell in
October that "Taiwan does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation" should
not be taken as a slip of the tongue.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan and China consider the model of the
European Union, which he said is closest to the positions of the two
sides.</P>
      <P>Michael Swaine, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, urged Beijing to drop its "one China" principle
on reopening dialogue with Taipei.</P>
      <P>Swaine said China should seriously consider President Chen
Shui-bian's proposals to restart talks based on the basis of the
first cross-strait meeting in Hong Kong in 1992 and to discuss the
issue of "one China" with Beijing.</P>

      <P>The economic prospects for Taiwan are very
promising with economic growth expected to reach 4.5 percent and
unemployment to drop to 4.25 percent next year, a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislator said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, DPP legislative caucus whip, made the remarks
in response to claims by Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng that
the DPP has done a bad job in administering the country, especially
in terms of the economy.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the economic growth rate of Taiwan dropped to
around 5 percent during the time that the Kuomintang was in power,
and the first term of President Chen Shui-bian happened to be the
start of a global economic recession.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan has managed to create a "new miracle" by seeing
its foreign reserves double despite the global recession, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan has survived the recession and is now ready to
welcome a promising future.</P>
      <P>While economic growth is estimated at 4.5 percent next year, the

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHIEF PITCHES FOR ACADEMIC CONFIDENCE-BUILDING MECHANISM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu came up with a new initiative Saturday aimed at breaking
the political stalemate across the Taiwan Strait, saying the two
sides can start by forging a confidence-building mechanism among
academics.</P>
      <P>According to Wu's proposal, each side could designate an
established scholar to be stationed on the other side to do research
and concurrently serve as a conduit for information exchanges between
the two governments.</P>
      <P>By so doing, Wu said, the Taipei and Beijing governments can
avoid misjudgments due to confusing information.</P>
      <P>"I think this kind of confidence-building mechanism in the
academic community is less political and should be more feasible than
the one suggested by President Chen Shui-bian early this year, " Wu
said.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested Feb. 3 that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
exchange representatives to establish rapprochement and mutual trust.
As cross-strait relations have remained deadlocked, Wu said he thinks
the possibility of Chen's proposal being implemented is low, if not
nil, for the moment.</P>
      <P>Under Wu's proposal, the scholar to be posted on the other side
can be chosen from political, legal or international relations
fields. The scholar can lead several graduate students pursuing
doctoral degrees on the mainland to study its political problems
while serving as the government's cross-strait information exchange
conduit, Wu said, adding that the duration of the stay could be for
two to three years.</P>
      <P>Wu urged mainland China to show sincerity to improve cross-strait
ties by accepting his proposal after Taiwan's Dec. 11 legislative
elections. "I believe this academic confidence-building mechanism can
mark a new start for cross-strait engagements," he added.</P>

      <P>The 2004 Computer Fair of the Information
Technology (IT) Month opened on Saturday at the Taipei World Trade
Center, drawing a huge crowd of visitors.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun and Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-Yueh
attended the opening ceremony for the annual fair, which has become a
high-profile consumer trade fair for computer-related products since
its beginning in 1980.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Yu suggested IT Month organizers that in
addition to traditional awards for excellent designers of information
products and excellent creations, they should set up other awards to
encourage innovative inventions.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the Taiwan IT industry, which has made successful
inroads into world markets, should keep developing to maintain its
international competitiveness. He noted that facing the challenge of
shrinking profits from sales of computers and peripherals, the sector
should not only accelerate its drive to create advanced technologies,
but also use its imagination to create products for the future.</P>
      <P>The premier also praised the industry for its marvelous
achievements over the past 25 yeas, saying that two major IT sectors
-- the semiconductor and color monitor manufacturing sectors --
created an accumulated output of NT$1.55 trillion (US$48.21 billion)
last year.</P>
      <P>Yu added that Taiwan's TFT-LCD monitor manufacturing sector saw a
world market penetration rate of 40.6 percent this year, a figure
that made Taiwan the largest monitor supplier in the world.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, Taiwan ranked as the world's fourth in the
2004 Global Competitiveness Report of the World Economic Forum, while
being listed as the first among Asian economies the third year in a
row.</P>
      <P>The premier's remarks were echoed by the economics minister who
pointed out that Taiwan's export have increased to NT$160 billion
from NT$20 billion 25 years ago, a six-fold increase. Ho said the
growth contributed to the IT industry's strong export abilities.</P>
      <P>She said proudly that today, every eight of 10 notebook personal
computers in the world were made by Taiwanese manufacturers.</P>

order."</TEXT>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and its
political allies, the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party,
held a campaign parade in Taipei Sunday afternoon with less than a
week to go before the Dec. 11 elections.</P>
      <P>Liao Feng-teh, the director of the KMT Department for
Organization Affairs, said the parade was for "the defense of the
Republic of China and the salvation of Taiwan".</P>
      <P>Touting the parade as a struggle between the defenders of the ROC
and those who want to destroy it, Liao had urged the supporters of
the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, PFP and New Party "to turn up and
participate in the parade in flocks.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan was scheduled to give a speech to parade
participants in the square in front of the Legislative Yuan at the
end of the parade, instead of leading the parade all the way from the
Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall as initially planned because of safety
concerns.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said the parade is to voice seven
appeals, including opposing tampering with history, opposing the
creation of a constitution aimed at realizing Taiwan independence,
opposing the government's arms procurement plan, opposing the hike in
commodity prices, opposing the worsening of social peace and order,
and opposing the government's overlooking of farmers' welfare.</P>
      <P>In order to underline the participants' support for the Republic
of China, Chang urged the parade-goers to carry ROC national flags or
other things to underline their determination to defend the country.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WON'T NECESSARILY BE MARGINALIZED IN ASIA: CHINA HAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will remain an important player in
Asia and will not be marginalized even if China further bolsters ties
with other countries in the region, so long as the island's economic
prosperity and science and technology development continues, a Hong
Kong-based academic said Saturday.</P>
      <P>David Zweig, director of the Center on China and Transnational
Relations of the Technology University of Hong Kong, made the
comments in a telephone interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Zweig noted that China was previously considered by most
countries in Asia as a threat. However, in recent years, particularly
after the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit in
Laos last month, China has demonstrated the "soft" side of its
diplomacy, he added.</P>
      <P>China has shown that it is willing to engage in regional affairs,
which has in turn spurred the ASEAN members' interest in further
exploring the huge Chinese market, he continued.</P>
      <P>Disagreeing with the view of some that China is aiming to isolate
Taiwan by bolstering its ties with ASEAN, Zweig said that China's
expanding ties with ASEAN and the so-called Taiwan issue are two
separate matters. China is primarily aiming at expanding its economic
activity in the ASEAN markets, he added.</P>
      <P>China has also tried to demonstrate its "peace-loving" side by
seeking peaceful solutions to controversial issues in the region,
such as the question of who has sovereignty over the Nansha Islands
(Spratlys). For example, Zweig said, China and the Philippines have
decided recently to jointly tap crude oil in the Nansha Islands area.</P>
      <P>Zweig, however, said he does think that China's increasing
engagement with ASEAN is weakening the United States' relative
influence in Asia. "As far as I know, there are people in the United
States who have shown concern over this issue," he added.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not recognized by most of the Asian countries
politically, it remains an important player in Asia's economic arena,
Zweig said, adding that Taiwan is still seen actively taking part in
the markets of China, Japan and ASEAN member nations.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's economic role in Asia will not regress," Zweig claimed.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, another Hong Kong-based "China hand" disagreed with
Zweig's comments regarding Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Dixon Sing, an associate professor with the Public and Social
Department of Hong Kong's City University, said that Taiwan will
inevitably be isolated in the process of China strengthening its
interactions with ASEAN members and other countries around Asia.</P>
      <P>China is poising to take a leading role in Asia with its go-go
economic development and soaring status in the region, Sing claimed.</P>
      <P>Seconding Sing's opinions, Qiang Jiang, a researcher with the
Center of Asian Studies, the University of Hong Kong, said that
Taiwan will "certainly have trouble" in its efforts to enter the
shaping of a "pan-Asian bloc" as China's clout across Asia swells.</P>
      <P>At the recently concluded ASEAN summit, which was also attended
by leaders of Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South
Korea, the leaders focused their discussions on accelerating ASEAN's
economic integration and narrowing the economic divide among the
group's wealthier and poorer members.</P>
      <P>The leaders agreed to convene an East Asia Summit in Malaysia
next year, which could signal the start of a pan-Asian bloc which
would include India, Australia and New Zealand, in addition to the
ASEAN's traditional dialogue partners, China, Japan and South Korea.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday that he
hopes the two campaign parades being held simultaneously by the two
opposing political camps Sunday afternoon in Taipei will be carried
out peacefully.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference at the Taipei Headquarters of his
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), the president said he has
ordered the National Police Administration to prevent any
confrontations between participants in the two parades.</P>
      <P>One of the parades is being held by the "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang (KMT), the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party.
The other parade is being held by the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) ,
which is allied to the DPP in the "pan-green camp."</P>
      <P>As both groups have branded themselves as true loyalists of
Taiwan, they should not do anything to stir up chaos which would be
detrimental to the country, the president said at the news conference
which was called to unveil the DPP's latest campaign strategy in the
lead up to the Dec. 11 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The "pan blue alliance" parade will proceed from the square in
front of the Taipei City Hall to the Legislative Yuan, with KMT
Chairman Lien Chan, PFP Chairman James Soong and New Party leader
Yok Mu-ming all taking part in the parade, an organizer said.</P>
      <P>The organizer said he expects some 100,000 people from around
Taiwan to take part in the parade, with some 500 tour buses bringing
supporters into the capital from other parts of the island.</P>
      <P>The TSU parade will proceed from the 228 Peace Park to the square
in front of the Presidential Office, which is located just across
from the KMT headquarters. Organizers said some 150,000 people from
around the island will take part in the parade, with 2,500 buses
bringing supporters to the capital.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, who is the spiritual leader of the
TSU, will give a speech at the square in front of the Presidential
Office, the organizers said.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The word "Taiwan" will be used in the
official designations of all of the Republic of China's overseas
missions and state-run companies within two years, President Chen
Shui-bian said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the country's official title is "the Republic of
China" and that the ROC is Taiwan, Chen said that the word "Taiwan"
will be used for the overseas missions and state-run enterprises in
order to distinguish them from those of the People's Republic of
China and thus avoid any confusion in the international community.</P>
      <P>The first step will be replacing "China" with "Taiwan" in the
official designations of state-owned enterprises, to be followed by
the government's representative offices abroad, Chen said while
giving a speech at the headquarters of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to help boost public support for the party in
the Dec. 11 legislative elections. Chen also serves as DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>In the future, all the nation's overseas offices will be called
"Taiwan representative offices, " he added.</P>
      <P>The president vowed that he will never deviate from the policies
and promises that he unveiled in his May 20 inauguration speech for a
second term and in his Oct. 10 National Day address.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that he is ready to fight for Taiwan's sovereignty
forever but added that he will not act rashly by altering the
country's official name for the sake of national unity as a majority
of Taiwan's 23 million people are in favor of keeping "the ROC" as
the nation's official title for the time being.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huan-liang, a whip of the DPP at the Legislative Yuan,
called the name change plan a pragmatic approach to better reflect
Taiwan's present situation.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, maintaining "the ROC" as the country's
official designation, while using "Taiwan" in the names of state
companies and overseas representative offices is not expected to
cause a further split at home.</P>
      <P>Using "Taiwan" instead of "the ROC" in some fields is aimed at
strengthening the people's identification with the country and is a
move which does not equate to altering the country's official
designation, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Tsai also reiterated that the DPP will not go beyond the "four
noes plus one" pledge outlined by the president in his first
inauguration speech in 2000 while pushing for a new constitution for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP whip made it clear that sensitive issues such as the
nation's title and flag will not be touched in the DPP's
constitutional re-engineering task.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  5 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The labor union of state-owned Chunghwa
Telecom passed a resolution in an islandwide members' vote Sunday to
enable workers of Taiwan's largest telecommunications company to go
on strike as a means of safeguarding their rights and interests.</P>
      <P>The resolution was passed overwhelmingly by 17,118 votes in favor
of allowing Chunghwa Telecom workers to strike to protect their
rights and interests. Altogether, 17,356 out of the labor union's
28,000 members cast their ballots.</P>
      <P>This marked the first time in Chunghwa Telecom's 47 years history
that the union has held a referendum-style vote to vote on enabling
the workers to strike. It was also the first time that a vote was
held via teleconference islandwide, in three locations across
northern, central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom Labor Union Chairman Chang Hsu-chung said that
Sunday's vote was held after management ignored the labor union's
appeals for guarantees that benefits and work conditions would not be
altered after Chunghwa Telecom is completely privatized.</P>
      <P>He added that it is hoped that the vote will give the labor union
more bargaining leverage in future negotiations with management.</P>
      <P>Chang said that if the Chunghwa Telecom workers decide to go on
strike, it must be done in a way that has the least adverse impact on
the convenience of subscribers and users of Chunghwa Telecom
services.</P>
      <P>In response to passage of the labor union's resolution, Chunghwa
Telecom Vice President Chang Feng-hsiung said that if a strike is
unavoidable, the company will try its best to maintain the company's
services.</P>
      <P>"I guarantee that Chunghwa Telecom will do whatever it can to
prevent subscribers' rights from being compromised under any
circumstances," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has abandoned the
"middle road" policy that he claimed he would follow when assuming
the presidency four years ago by tilting toward Taiwan independence,
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) spokesman Chang Jong-kung said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang made the remarks after the president said earlier the same
day that state-run businesses and the government's overseas offices
will carry the word "Taiwan" in their official names instead of
"China" to differentiate them from those of the People's Republic of
China. Chen, however, also said that the country's official name --
the Republic of China -- will not be altered.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, President Chen made the remarks mainly to
secure backing from pro-independence voters for the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) amid fierce competition from the
pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) in the runnup to the
Dec. 11 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Chen's words form the latest in a series of moves
by the DPP to promote Taiwan independence, Chang described the ruling
party's strategy as a "soft coup" designed to weaken and eventually
topple the ROC in a gradual fashion.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's vow to change the
name of the country's overseas offices and state-run enterprises by
including the word "Taiwan" is aimed at distinguishing them from
those of mainland China, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) chairman
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In an apparent attempt to preempt criticism that president is
moving another step closer toward Taiwan independence, Joseph
Jaushieh Wu said that the move was made to avoid foreigners confusing
Taiwan, whose official designation is the Republic of China, with the
People's Republic of China on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wu cited the example of ROC diplomats in Panama, with which the
ROC maintains formal diplomatic ties, once wrongly being referred to
as diplomats from the PRC by the host country.</P>
      <P>Changing the official names of the country's overseas offices
will avoid such embarrassing mistakes and is desired by the people of
Taiwan, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that the move does not mean a change in the nation's
official title and should not elicit ire from Beijing which frowns on
any moves that could be construed as steps toward Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>President Chen announcement has been seen by some as a move to
gain support from pro-independence voters for Democratic Progressive
Party candidates ahead of the Dec. 11 legislative elections.</P>

      <P>The proposed new constitution for Taiwan
will bring the country's human rights protection into line with the
international standards, President Chen Shui-bian said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar jointly organized by a unit under the

expanded to include such things as "social rights" and "development
rights."</P>

inadequate in terms of the new definition of human rights and falls
short of the public's expectations, adding that the new constitution
will address these issues and bring Taiwan into line with

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has
been making efforts over the past several years to change the formal
designation of all of the nation's official outposts in countries
that do not maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, a MOFA
spokesman said Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Such efforts will be boosted further to be in line with the
policy put forward in President Chen Shui-bian's remarks Sunday, "
MOFA spokesman Michel Lu.</P>
      <P>President Chen said Sunday that the formal names of the Republic
of China's overseas official missions and state-run enterprises
should be changed within two years to include the word "Taiwan" to
differentiate them from those of the People's Republic of China and
thus avoid any confusion.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that to change the name of any of its overseas offices,
Taiwan needs to first acquire the consent of the host country.</P>
      <P>In response to President Chen's remarks Sunday, the state-run
China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSBC) said it will do whatever it can to
cope with the policy. Fan Kuang-nan, acting chairman of the CSBC,
said that a name change for the company is a challenging task, with
more than 100 contracts overseas needing to be altered.</P>
      <P>Despite these difficulties, the CSBC will try its best to come
into line with the plan, Fan added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the formerly state-owned China Steel Corp., which is
now a listed company, said Sunday that the company currently has no
plans to change its name.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INTERNAL STRIFE POSES LARGEST THREAT TO TAIWAN IT SECTOR: CEPD HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Internal strife, rather than a lack of brand
names, is the largest threat to Taiwan's information technology
sector, the chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with CNA, Hu Sheng-cheng said that
despite providing the world with over 50 percent of key components
and devices, Taiwan's IT sector has failed to become a major player
because of heated competition among domestic companies.</P>
      <P>This competition has led to a price war that has only benefited
foreign multinationals, Hu said, urging Taiwan computer makers to
bolster cooperation to end this detrimental situation.</P>
      <P>Asked about which industry will emerge as a new star in Taiwan's
industry in the face of strong competition in the information
industry, Hu predicted that the automobile industry has the potential
to reach annual production of more than NT$1 trillion (US$30.5
billion) -- which would make it the fourth domestic industry after
the semiconductor, display panel and telecommunication sectors to do
so.</P>
      <P>Basing his analysis on the fact that Taiwan produces world-class
car accessories, he claimed that there is ample room for the domestic
automobile industry to further develop in conjunction with the
country's car electronics makers thanks to Taiwan's advanced
opto-electronics and display industries.</P>
      <P>He stressed that training skilled workers and professionals is
extremely important for industry and also for the government in its
bid to build Taiwan into a business operations center and a financial
hub in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>The government also plans to cut the number of the many public
banks and financial holdings companies in Taiwan by half in an effort
to reduce overlap and sharpen the industry's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Citing Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting
and Statistics figures, Hu said that meeting the government's
forecast of economic growth of 5 percent and unemployment of 4
percent for next year will be a challenge amid a slowing world
economy.</P>
      <P>To achieve the two targets, the government will keenly promote
local demand by injecting NT$100 billion into public construction
projects through the new 10 development plans to offset an expected
decline in the export sector, he explained.</P>

(By Flor  Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two campaign parades in Taipei for the Dec.
11 legislative elections, organized by the opposition "pan blue
alliance" and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), respectively, ended
peacefully Sunday.</P>
      <P>The "pan blue alliance " march of the Kuomintang (KMT) , the
People First Party (PFP) and the New Party (New Party) attracted more
than 100,000 people across Taiwan to take part in, starting at the
Taipei City Hall and finishing at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan, PFP Chairman James Soong and NP Chairman
Yok Mu-ming accompanied their backers through the march under the
slogans such as unity, protecting the Republic of China and saving
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien called on the public to help the "pan blue alliance" gain a
majority at the 225-member Legislative Yuan in the coming legislative
polls to secure the ROC's constitution and the nation's future.</P>
      <P>Soong accused the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) of
pushing Taiwan toward the edge of war with mainland China by
promoting Taiwan independence, and he claimed that a "pan blue
alliance" majority at the Legislative Yuan is necessary to check and
balance the government led by Chen.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, who is also a vice
chairman of the KMT, also gave a speech on the occasion, pointing out
that under the DPP rule, Taiwan is confronting major problems on the
financial, economic and ethnic fronts as well as in its relations
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Political uncertainties, ethnic confrontation, economic dwindling
and social disorder will continue to worsen if the "pan green camp"
of the DPP and TSU grabs more than half of the seats at the new
legislature, Wang pointed out.</P>
      <P>At the same time, about 150,000 supporters participated in the
parade led by the TSU, which kicked off at the 228 Peace Park and
ended at the square in front of the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, spiritual leader of the TSU, said
that the "pan blue alliance" has betrayed most of the Taiwan people
by boycotting the government's constitutional and democratic reforms.</P>
      <P>He clamored for voters' support to help the "pan green camp" to
form a majority at the new legislature in order to create a new
constitution for Taiwan and push through the government's major
military procurement plan worth of NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23
billion).</P>

    <HEADLINE>180 TSMC STAFF MEMBERS VOLUNTEER AS SCIENCE MUSEUM GUIDES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  central  Taiwan,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 180 staff
members of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) have signed
up as volunteer guides at the National Museum of Natural Science in
Taichung.</P>
      <P>The TSMC volunteers, who work in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan or in
Tainan in the south, take turns heading to Taichung to serve as
guides in the museum's special "IC World" section on the weekends.</P>
      <P>TSMC, the world's first and largest IC chip foundry, lent
financial and technical support to help build the "IC World" at the
museum six years ago. Last year, in order to attract more visitors,
the head of the TSMC Cultural and Educational Foundation decided to
set up the volunteer guide program.</P>
      <P>The idea has been well-received, attracting some 180 TSMC staff
members, including top-level directors, engineers, technicians, and
members of their families to sign up almost immediately. Some 240
more TSMC staff members and members of their families are expected to
join the volunteer program next year.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, the volunteers have used their professional
expertise to help ordinary museum goers get to know the scientific
world of ICs. While serving as guides, the TSMC volunteers have also
constantly consulted among themselves and even made some changes to
the displays and environment in an effort to provide "perfect"
service at the museum.</P>
      <P>"Even at the museum, the TSMC volunteers demonstrate their 'zero
defects' spirit that has been cultivated through years of
professional training, " said Kuo Shan-shan, chief secretary of the
TSMC Foundation.</P>
      <P>Wu Chung-ming, a director with the TSMC DVPSOC (digital visual
processing and silicon-on-chip) Lab, said she and her two college
student sons have enthusiastically worked as volunteer "conductive
agents" at the IC World over the past year. The volunteer program
also serves as a real-life education for TSMC staff family members
who take part, she added.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Tsung-chih, a senior engineer working at a TSMC Clean Room,
said he feels blessed to have such a great job with an excellent
company and wants to repay society by taking part in the volunteer
program. He called working as a museum guide a piece of cake compared
to his past volunteer experiences, including as a firefighter and as
a paramedic's assistant aboard an ambulance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'NO DIFFICULTIES FORESEEN' IN NAME CHANGE POLICY: MOTC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There are currently no difficulties foreseen
in state-run enterprises under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) carrying out the name-change policy espoused by
President Chen Shui-bian Sunday, the MOTC vice minister said Monday.</P>
      <P>President Chen said Sunday that the formal designations of the
Republic of China's overseas official missions and state-run
enterprises should be changed within two years to include the word
"Taiwan" in order to distinguish them from those of the People's
Republic of China and thus avoid any confusion in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister Tsai Duei said that Chunghwa Telecom, Chunghwa Post
and China Airlines, the three business operations under the MOTC's
supervision, will experience different problems in their attempt to
come into line with the name-change policy put forward by President
Chen.</P>
      <P>Basically, the name-change work can be implemented without any
technical problems, Tsai said, adding however that these companies
will need time to assess the situation.</P>
      <P>"Currently, there is no timetable for the implementation of this
project," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said
state-run enterprises under the supervision of her ministry,
including the Chinese Petroleum Corp., won't require the full two
years to carry out the name change policy.</P>
      <P>"What should be done should be done quickly, so long as it is to
the benefit of the country," Ho added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ho said, the formerly state-owned China Steel
Corp.(CSC), which is now a listed company, would not necessarily come
into line with the name-change plan as the Ministry of Economic
Affairs now only holds a 23-percent stake in the company.</P>
      <P>It is up to CSC's investors and shareholders to decide whether
the company should be renamed "Taiwan Steel Corp," she said.</P>

      <P>A second round of free trade agreement (FTA)
bilateral consultations between Taiwan and Nicaragua has just
completed in San Francisco, marking a step forward in efforts for the
two countries to eventually sign an FTA, the Bureau of Foreign Trade

      <P>Officials headed by ROC Vice Economic Affairs Minister Steve
R.L. Chen on the Taiwan side and Alejandro Arguello, Nicaragua's vice
minister of development, industry and commerce on the other, reached
consensus upon the conclusion of the consultation on several issues,
including market access, trade facilitation and cooperation for the
attainment of a third round of such talks, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>In detail, the two sides reached consensus on areas including
animal quarantine, technical trade barriers, fair competition, labor,
intellectual property rights, telephone and other telecommunications,
investment, and trade regulations as well as procedures, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The two sides agreed that the third round of talks will be held
between Jan. 31 and Feb. 4, 2005, in the hope that the two countries

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
continue talks with host countries of Taiwan representative offices
overseas on the government's plan to change the name of the nation's
representative offices in countries that do not diplomatically
recognize the Republic of China, a senior official said Monday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu made the remarks after President Chen
Shui-bian said a day earlier that his administration will push for
changes of the designation of ROC missions abroad and certain
state-owned enterprises in two years by including the word "Taiwan"
to clearly distinguish them from those of the People's Republic of
China (PRC).</P>
      <P>Lu said the president's name change proposal does not involve
changes to the nation's status or title.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, the designation of the ROC embassies and
consulates in countries that maintain formal diplomatic ties with
the ROC will not be subject to change.</P>
      <P>As for missions in countries with no diplomatic ties with the
ROC, Lu said, the MOFA has been working on name change issues for the
past few years. Now that Chen has given a timeframe for attaining the
goal, he went on, the MOFA will continue negotiating the "name
change" issues with the relevant countries.</P>
      <P>The ROC forged diplomatic relations with the Pacific island
nation of Kiribati in November 2003. As the embassy is situated
opposite a building that used to house the PRC embassy, the ROC
embassy's name plaque already bears a word "Taiwan " to avoid
confusion.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the ROC embassies in other countries will follow
this practice, Lu said it requires a further study before a decision
can be made.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GREY MULLET CONGREGATING OUTSIDE TAMSUI INSTEAD OF MIGRATING SOUTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  southern Taiwan,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the arrival of
this year's first cold front, schools of mullet -- the "fish that lay
the golden eggs" -- have continued to congregate around Tamsui,
northern Taiwan, instead of heading south in their normal migratory
movement.</P>
      <P>Fishermen in southern Taiwan have only caught about 1,000 of the
fish over the weekend as so few have made the journey south along
Taiwan's western coast.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Council of Agriculture's Taiwan Fisheries
Research Institute in Kaohsiung contacted Monday attributed the
situation to the fact that the water in the southern part of the
Taiwan Strait has remained too warm for the fish, which prefers
colder water.</P>
      <P>Grey mullet, the roe of which is an expensive hors-d'oeuvre on
dinner tables in Taiwan and Japan, normally swim from the cold North
Pacific in great shoals to the southern Taiwan Strait between early
December and February every year to spawn before returning to the
north.</P>
      <P>These mullet schools usually show up off the coast just north of
Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, which has long been mapped as a prime
winter fishing ground.</P>
      <P>About a decade ago, fishermen in southern Taiwan could catch big
hauls of gravid mullet between December and February, particularly
when cold fronts approached, making fortunes out of their catches.</P>
      <P>In recent years, however, catches have declined year after year
as a result of several factors, including water pollution, increased
dynamite fishing by mainland Chinese fishermen, and interception of
the shoals by mainland fishermen before they reach the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT ANNOUNCES BALLOT ALLOCATION IN 10 CITIES, COUNTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) announced a
ballot allocation scheme in 10 of the nation's 25 cities and counties
Monday to try to counter the "pan-green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union as the campaign for the crucial Dec. 11 legislative
elections enters the home stretch.</P>
      <P>Lin Fong-cheng, KMT secretary-general, and Liao Fung-teh,
director of the KMT's Organization and Development Committee, made
the announcement as it is seeking to maximize the number of
Legislative Yuan seats it can win.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, polls have shown that nearly 30 percent of the
respondents are willing to accept the ballot allocation plan,
especially among voters in urban areas.</P>
      <P>The DPP has in the past used ballot allocation scheme with great
success, but this will be the first time the KMT has employed the
scheme to ensure the maximum number of seats in the multi-seat
constituency system.</P>
      <P>Lin said that except for people in three categories, voters
will be asked to vote for a certain KMT candidate based on voter
criteria such as gender, township, or month of birth, in order to
ensure that each candidate gets the maximum number of available
votes.</P>
      <P>He defined the three categories as voters who can be
persuaded by KMT branch officials to vote for a specific
candidate; retired servicemen -- traditional core
supporters of the KMT -- who are assigned to support specific
candidates; and those who have made up their minds to vote for a
specific KMT candidate irrespective of any instructions from party
officials.</P>
      <P>Other KMT voters who have yet to decide for whom to vote should
follow the vote allocation system, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The 10 cities and counties in which the KMT want to use the
scheme are Taichung and Tainan cities, Kaohsiung, Pingtung, Taoyuan,
Yunlin, Tainan, Miaoli, Taichung, and Changhua counties.</P>
      <P>He also said that the party is still coordinating in areas such
as Taipei city and county and Kaohsiung city, in the hope that it
can announce a plan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As for the ballot allocation scheme between the KMT and its "pan
blue alliance" ally the People First Party (PFP), Lin said that a
consensus has yet to be reached and the situation will have to be
dealt with in each city and county individually.</P>
      <P>Nantou County is reported to be the most likely place to adopt
the ballot allocation scheme between the two parties, Lin said,
adding that the KMT could allocate some of its diehard ballots to the
PFP.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Enterovirus infections in Taipei City have
increased since mid-November, a city department of health official
said Monday, adding that a total of 673 cases were reported by local
clinics and hospitals during the period from Nov. 16-29.</P>
      <P>The figure shows a major growth compared with the 237 cases
reported in the same period of last year, Tsai Yi-chen said, quoting
data compiled by the health department.</P>
      <P>Tsai said schools reported that a total of 19 classes of students
have been forced to stay home due to the outbreak during the two-week
period. As of Monday, he added, four classes were still closed.</P>
      <P>However, he indicated that despite the infection having broken
out on a larger scale than last year, it poses less of a threat
because the outbreak is mainly caused by the less severe Coxsackie
viruses rather than the much more serious Enterovirus 71. In the past
two weeks, only one case of acute infection has been reported in
Taipei City, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official said the cases in the recent outbreak
are lasting longer than in past years and that therefore, the public
should stay alert and pay attention to personal and environmental
hygiene to prevent infection.</P>
      <P>Everyone is at risk of enterovirus infection, although infants

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should respect the
mandate that will be revealed in the Dec. 11 legislative elections
when he forms a new Cabinet, the legislative caucus of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-fu, KMT legislative whip, was elaborating on KMT
Chairman Lien Chan's remarks the previous day on the campaign trail
in which he claimed that if the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and
the People First Party (PFP) win a majority in the 225-seat
legislature, it can form a Cabinet "according to the Constitution."</P>
      <P>Huang claimed that "according to democratic norms, " if the
legislative majority forms the Cabinet, it will be key to stable
executive and legislative relations.</P>
      <P>He noted that President Chen Shui-bian has the right to appoint
the premier according to the Constitution but added that the
president should respect the mandate as shown in the legislative
election results.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, if the "pan-green camp" is in charge of the
forming of a Cabinet even if the "pan-blue alliance" wins a majority
in the legislature, then the legislative elections will be rendered
meaningless.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the chaos in recent years can be attributed to
what he described as Chen's "lack of respect for the majority" in the
legislature. A minority Cabinet has resulted in the constant
bickering between the executive and legislative branches, he said.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" currently holds a slim majority in the
225-seat legislature and Chen is urging voters to give the "pan-green

said Monday.</P>
      <P>Tu made the remarks after President Chen Shui-bian said the
previous day that the nation will identify itself as "Taiwan" when
taking part in international activities, to clearly distinguish it
from mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to the president's plan, the Republic of China's
representative offices in countries with which it does not maintain
formal diplomatic ties will be designated as "Taiwan" representative
offices and the word "China" in state-owned firms will be replaced by
the word "Taiwan."</P>

the Ministry of Education is a government organ, its job is to

      <P>"So if the proposed name change becomes policy, the MOE will

Lumpur, Penang, Jakarta and Surabaya.</P>
      <P>Tu said that although those schools are private establishment,
they have traditionally received financing from the ROC government.
Moreover, he went on, the ROC government has sent conscripts to teach
at those schools to fulfill their alternative military service. The
six schools now have more than 1,500 students in total.</P>
      <P>As for several local universities that bear the words "China" or

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO BE CAUTIOUS AMID DIPLOMATIC SUPPRESSION BY BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should make greater efforts to
spotlight the country's mainstream public opinion internationally so
as to effectively curb Beijing's diplomatic blockade under the
pretext of "quelling Taiwan independence, " scholars have urged.</P>
      <P>At a recent seminar sponsored by the National Development Outlook
Foundation on Beijing's diplomatic strategy toward Taiwan since the
re-election of President Chen Shui-bian, scholars unanimously urged
the government to take countermeasures in the international community
in the face of Beijing's description of "Taiwan independence" as the
source of disaster in East Asia.</P>
      <P>Chen I-shin, a professor at the Graduate Institute of American
Studies under Tamkang University, said that Beijing's relentless
suppression of Taiwan independence seems on the surface to be
detrimental to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the
pro-Taiwan independence movement.</P>
      <P>But Chen pointed out that the country as a whole would be hurt
the most should the Beijing's rhetoric become the basic tone of the
international stance on Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>If remarks on Taiwan's lack of sovereignty made by U.S. Secretary
of State Colin Powell "were accepted by the international community,"
it would do immeasurable damage to Taiwan, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>He contended that Taiwan must seek to maintain a balance in the
delicate Beijing-Washington-Tokyo ties to ensure the maximum benefits
in Taiwan's interests to protect the country's security.</P>
      <P>Powell said in late October in Hong Kong that Taiwan is not
independent and does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation.</P>
      <P>Chi Shun-chieh, deputy secretary-general of the Taiwan
International Studies Association, said that Beijing's scheme to
align other countries to stem Taiwan independence by using its
growing economic and diplomatic power has kept increased pressure on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing's influence, Chi said, has even expanded to Latin
America, the backyard of the United States and the diplomatic
stronghold of Taiwan, home to most of the country's diplomatic
allies.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Beijing's claim that there only is the "Taiwan
independence problem" rather than the "Taiwan problem, " he called it
a Chinese communist strategy to fan a diplomatic war against Taiwan
with stronger foreign support to clamp down on the independence
movement.</P>
      <P>However, he also agreed that it is very difficult for Taipei to
directly confront Beijing when the Chinese communist regime can use
its vast resources to conduct a diplomatic war. He proposed that the
government make concrete moves to allow the voice of Taiwan people to
be heard clearly on the world stage.</P>
      <P>Wang Kun-i, a deputy professor at the Graduate
Institute of International Affairs and Strategic Studies of Tamkang
University, said that the Beijing regime has taken anti-independence
as a priority over advocating unification between the two sides.</P>
      <P>At a time when member states of the Association of South East
Asian Nations (ASEAN) are increasingly tilting toward Beijing, the
Chinese communists are trying hard to win backing from the United
States regarding the Taiwan independence issue after Taipei and
Beijing suspended bilateral negotiations, he warned.</P>
      <P>The scholars spoke out in unison that Taiwan should exercise
tremendous caution when facing Beijing's voracious diplomatic
offensive and when the United States is also seeking cooperation from
Beijing on issues related to the international anti-terror campaign
and on nuclear power problems on the Korean peninsula.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CPI ANNUAL INCREASE SHOWS NO INFLATION PRESSURE: DGBAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual increase of the consumer price
index (CPI) was only 1.49 percent in November, showing that there is
little pressure of inflation, the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Monday.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials said that the CPI in November was 101.23, down
1.2 percent from October, mainly because November is harvest time for
winter vegetables, with resultant drops in price.</P>
      <P>The officials estimated that the average increase of the CPI in
the first 11 months was 1.61 percent, compared with an increase of
4.1 percent for the first 10 months in mainland China, 3.7 percent in
South Korea, 2.5 percent in the United States and 1.7 percent in
Singapore, a sign of very modest or "non-existent" inflation.</P>
      <P>On the wholesale price index (WPI) , the index was 111.72 in
November, down 1.78 percent from October, mainly because prices of
agricultural products and crude oil dropped.</P>
      <P>Compared with the same month of last year, there was an increase
of 9.06 percent, but this was still a dramatic drop from between 10
percent and 11 percent in the third quarter. The average WPI increase
in the first 11 months was 7.16 percent.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Five local terrestrial television stations
began broadcasting legislative campaign commercials produced by major
political parties Monday, five days ahead of the Dec. 11 legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>According to regulations governing political parties use of
televised broadcast media for campaigning, the Central Election
Commission (CEC) is required to arrange at least two time slots on
terrestrial TV stations for political parties to air campaign
material.</P>
      <P>A political party must have fielded five or more candidates to be
qualified for the CEC-sponsored TV campaign time slots. For the
upcoming elections, five parties are eligible to share the TV
campaign time slots, which are to be distributed in proportion to the
number of each party's candidates.</P>
      <P>CEC officials said they have arranged to broadcast campaign
material of the five parties on five local terrestrial TV stations
from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. Monday through Friday. The broadcasts will
start with a four-minute film produced by the CEC to raise public
awareness of the upcoming legislative elections and rules governing
them.</P>
      <P>The remaining time will be allocated to the five political
parties as follows: the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, 20
minutes; the Kuomintang (KMT) , 16 minutes; the People First Party,
nine minutes; the Taiwan Solidarity Union, six minutes; and the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union, five minutes.</P>
      <P>According to the CEC's arrangement, the political parties'
campaign spots will be broadcast on Chinese Television System Monday;
China Television Co. Tuesday; Taiwan Television Enterprise Wednesday;
Formosa Television Co. Thursday; and Public Television Service
Friday.</P>
      <P>The CEC approved all of the campaign videos late last month
presented by the five political parties.</P>
      <P>Chi Chen-nan, a CEC commissioner who headed the video screening
committee, said that even though the opposition KMT-produced video
contains defamatory slogans against the CEC, the commission still
agreed to its broadcast based on the principle of freedom of speech.</P>
      <P>Chi said the CEC screened the campaign videos using objectivity,
impartiality, neutrality and legality.</P>
      <P>According to Chi, the KMT video contains slogans such as "the
Central Election Commission violates the law; is not impartial and
not fair," and "Chen Shui-bian used illegal means to gain power."</P>
      <P>As those words do not violate Article 54 of the Public
Functionary Election and Recall Law or Articles 21 and 22 of the
Radio Broadcasting and Television Law, Chi said the CEC's screening
panel gave the green light to the video.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Marines' raids underline
push in crucial area.

The U.S. Marine Strike Force Two, in a convoy of unlit Humvees,
entered some of Iraq's deadliest terrain. For the 10 weeks since
thier battalion began operating in this area south of Baghdad, raids
like this one by Strike Force Two have captured more than 250 people

have been killed. The raids have taken an American toll, too. Since
late September, the Second Battalion of the 24th Marine Expeditionary
Unit has lost eight men. It has deployed in what has become, since
November's battle for Falluja, one of the war's most crucial battle
zones.

Wall Street Journal: Unlikely democrat leads the charge in
Ukraine's revolt.

Yulia Tymoshenko who issued her marching orders to the crowd to
blockade the Council of Ministers and applied the radical use of
"peopple power" brought the Ukrainian government to the negotiating
table. Unlike Walesa or Vaclav Havel, a Czechoslovakian playwright
who rose to the presidency, the leaders of Kiev's "orange revolution"
aren't idealistic outsiders. Many stood at the helm of Ukraine's
government and business establishment just a few years ago under
current President Leonid Kuchma, whom they now decry as a dictator.
Ms. Tymoshenko herself is a former billionaire who made a fortune
through political connections in the murky aftermath of the Soviet
Union. As a deputy prime minister in 1999-2001, she kept an office in
the same Council of Ministers building her supporters now block.
"Tymoshenko is posing as a folk heroine, but her history is a history
of oligarchic clans in Ukraine, " says Stepan Havrysh, head of the
pro- government Democratic Initiatives faction in Ukraine's
parliament. "All these people in the opposition didn't just work for
Kuchma, they got their influence, their visibility, their importance
thanks to him. They know very well how this system works, and now
they're simply trying to take it over."</TEXT>

year. To reach that goal, it has decided to offer visa-free entry for
Taiwan citizens for a six-month period from March 2005 in concert
with the eco-friendly world exposition to be held in Aichi

      <P>In contrast, the number of Japanese tourists to Taiwan has not
increased as fast as expected. As of Oct. 31, Japanese citizens had

      <P>The fishing boat seized by the Indian navy

dozens of suspicious crewmen aboard belongs to Thailand, not Taiwan,
a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said Monday.</P>

service reports that two Taiwan boats with 40-plus suspicious crewmen
on board were seized late last month for intruding into Indian
territorial waters.</P>
      <P>Lu said the reports were not correct. Lu confirmed that a Taiwan
fishing boat -- the "Yumanhsiang No. 20" -- was intercepted by Indian
naval ships in the Bay of Bengal Oct. 27. He said the three Taiwan
crewmen aboard were released on bail Nov. 29 and that Indian judicial
authorities will hold a hearing Dec. 9 to decide whether the fishing
boat will also be released on bail.</P>
      <P>As to the fishing boat seized by the Indian navy Nov. 30,

      <P>A commission created to investigate the
presidential election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu has posted 10 questions surrounding the
March 19 shooting on its Web site, and is asking scholars and experts
to come forward to provide their expertise to help solve the case.</P>
      <P>The "March 19th Shooting Truth Investigation Special Commission,"
which was created under a special bill that cleared the
opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan in August, called a news
conference Monday and unveiled the 10 questions:
1. Where did the lead bullets come from?
2. Was there a second gunman?
3. Why did the two shell casings picked up by bystanders show no sign of being
fired? Why were no shells recovered that did indicate that they had been 
fired?
4. Was President Chen Shui-bian's abdomen wound the result of a gunshot or a 
knife?
5. Why was there so little blood from the wound?
6. Why was a microscopic examination of the wound not directly obtained and 
why was it only taken days later and then transferred via a number of people? 
Was the president's white blood cell count abnormal?
7. Why are the two holes in Chen's shirt marking the entry and exit points 
of the bullet on the right side of his abdomen and why is the distance between
the two 7.5 cm when the wound is 11 cm?
8. What caused the holes in the shirt and the trousers of the president?
9. Why did the president's jacket show signs of having been melted by heat?
10. Why were the fibers attached to the lead bullets, which were found to be 
similar to fibers of the president's jacket, underwear and shirt, in an 
inconsistent pattern?
The commission's Web site is: http://www.the319.org.</P>
      <P>The shooting took place on March 19, 2004 while President Chen

Tainan, southern Taiwan, in an open-top jeep. Both of them sustained
minor injuries.</P>
      <P>Chinese-American forensic expert Henry Lee, who was invited to

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FORECAST TO PUT OUT 31 MILLION CD-ROM RECORDERS IN Q4</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is forecast to produce 31 million
CD-ROM recorders in the fourth quarter of this year, up by 14.4
percent over the previous year's level, according to the findings of
a panel under the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI).</P>
      <P>The country made a total of 27 million CD-ROM recorders in the
third quarter, with a production value of US$920 million, marking
a 2.7 percent increase year-to-year, a spokesman for the Industrial
Technology Intelligence Services (ITIS) under the ITRI said.</P>
      <P>He attributed the increase in Q3 output value to the timely
marketing of new products, such as more advanced DVD recorders, as
the average price of a locally made CD-ROM recorder rose to US$33.8
during the three-month period.</P>
      <P>The growth in both production quantity and value in the third
quarter was mainly boosted by strong demand for personal computers
(including desktops and notebooks) from across the world ahead of
the winter peak season, he explained, predicting that the Q4 number
of the world's PCs will rise by 10 percent over the Q3 figure.</P>
      <P>DVD recorders absorbed 19 percent of the country's total CD-ROM
production in the third quarter, a growth as compared to the 14
percent posted in the second quarter, ITIS statistics show.</P>
      <P>The ratio of DVD-related products, such as DVD-ROM readers and
DVD-ROM combos, as a percentage of Taiwan's overall CD-ROM recorders
has outstripped that of CD-related goods.</P>
      <P>The former group grabbed 58 percent of Taiwan's overall output of
CD-ROM recorders in the third quarter, an advance from the Q2 level
of 55 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Monday if the
"pan-green" camp can win a clear majority in the new legislature to
be elected this weekend, it will greatly facilitate the "name change"
campaign to clearly distinguish Taiwan from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Yu was responding to President Chen Shui-bian's announcement of
his plan a day earlier that the Republic of China's representative
offices in countries with which it does not maintain formal
diplomatic ties will be designated as "Taiwan" representative offices
and the word "China" in state-owned firms will be replaced by the
word "Taiwan" in two years.</P>
      <P>Yu said if the "pan-green" camp of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union
-- can win a clear majority in the Dec. 11 legislative elections,
the "name change" campaign will get a big boost.</P>
      <P>Yu said the DPP is facing difficulties in the Taipei County's
first and third constituencies as well as the Taichung and Kaohsiung
constituencies. He urged "pan-green" supporters to pool their
strength to back DPP nominees in the upcoming elections so that the
"pan-green" camp can win a legislative majority to end domestic
political chaos.

      <P>The Executive Yuan will come up with a
method to change the names of the country's overseas representative
offices and state-run enterprises to highlight their Taiwan identity,
a spokesman for the Executive Yuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman, Chen Chi-mai, said Premier Yu Shyi-kun has
appointed Minister without Portfolio Shu Chih-hsiung to draw up a
plan to do this within two months.</P>
      <P>Chen said the names used by Taiwan in international organizations
including Taipei China; Taipei, China; Chinese Taipei; and China
(Taiwan) fail to underline their Taiwan identity and the fact that
Taiwan is separate from China.</P>
      <P>The name of Republic of China, which is used by Taiwan in dealing
with countries that recognize it, will remain unchanged, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The names, used by Taiwan to call its representative offices in
countries which don't recognize it diplomatically, such as the Taipei
Economic and Cultural Office and the Institute of Chinese Culture,
fail to indicate that they are from Taiwan, Chen said.</P>
      <P>These names should be converted into the Taiwan Representative
Office through negotiations with the host countries in the future.</P>
      <P>State-run enterprises or foundations which used the name China or
Chinese, including Chunghua, will be changed to avoid being mistaken
as enterprises or foundations from the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>In order to change their names, the charters of these companies
and foundations should be revised first according to law, Chen went
on.</P>
      <P>The name-changing campaign has nothing to do with the Democratic
Progressive Party's cause for an independent country named Taiwan,
Chen said, adding that Taiwan, as a term, is more popular than China
on the island.</P>

      <P>Chabot and the other Congressional Taiwan Caucus co-chairmen
recently wrote a letter to President Chen to express their support
for Taiwan's plan to change the name of the Taipei Economic and

Representative Office in the United States. The office is Taiwan's de

diplomatic ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>In the letter, Chabot said that a new name for the office with
the word "Taiwan" in it would much more precisely reflect the
characteristics of the government in Taiwan, and that he would extend
whatever help he could to facilitate the name-change effort.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan, Chabot is also expected to meet with

    <DATELINE>Panama City,  Dec.  7 (CNA)
(By Ramon Huang and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Panamanian First Vice President and
Foreign Affairs Minister Samuel Lewis Navarro reiterated Tuesday that
Panama's formal diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on
Taiwan have been solid and will remain unchanged.</P>
      <P>Lewis said during a press conference marking the 100th day in
office of the new Panamanian government led by President Martin
Torrijos that although Panama has maintained strong business and
trade ties with mainland China and that these ties will continue to
increase, this does not necessarily mean that Panama should change
its diplomatic relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lewis made the remarks in response to a question by a Xinhua News
Agency reporter about whether Panama plans to further rev up its
diplomatic relations with China, which is generally considered an
important player in world trade with a huge market and which
maintains close interactions with Latin America.</P>
      <P>The first vice president noted that Panama has on many occasions
reiterated its stance of maintaining formal diplomatic relations with
Taiwan while continuing to bolster commercial ties with China.</P>
      <P>Lewis claimed that China indeed has played an ever-increasingly
important role in the world's trade arena and that it is one of the
key users of the Panama Canal and that these are the reasons why
Panama has maintained strong business and trade ties with that
country.</P>
      <P>He said that expanding commercial ties with countries around the
world remains one of the government's priority tasks. For example, he
pointed out, Panama is currently engaging in the sixth round of free
trade agreement talks with the United States. Once the talks are
concluded, the Panamanian government will hold similar talks with
other countries, and mainland China will naturally not be left out,
he added.</P>

      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) said
Wednesday that Taiwan has in recent years experienced a massive
exodus of people and that "pan-blue alliance" supporters must throw
their weight behind the alliance's legislative candidates in
Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The PFP legislative caucus made the appeal in a get-out-the-vote
drive amid reports that voters are apathetic about the elections,</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, PFP whip in the Legislative Yuan, noted that a
majority of the Taiwanese who have emigrated overseas in recent years
are traditionally "pan-blue" supporters. As they are unlikely to
return to vote this time, he urged the "pan-blue" supporters in
Taiwan to come out to vote in large numbers.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Pang Chien-kuo said that between 1983 and 2000,
there were about 290,000 Taiwanese who did not return to Taiwan after
heading overseas, and that the figure reached nearly 105,00 for the
2002-2003 period. He said the exodus has become serious, pointing out
that the figure for just the first four months of this year was about
72,000,</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Pang's colleague Lin Cheng-yi claimed that a lot of
overseas Taiwanese are dissatisfied with President Chen Shui-bian's
performance and that many of them have thus helped their relatives
emigrate.</P>
      <P>As many of these people are skilled professionals, Lin expressed
concerns about a "brain drain" that could undercut the nation's

New York State lawmakers voted Tuesday
evening to reduce the steep mandatory prison
sentences given to people convicted of drug
crimes in the state, sanctions considered among
t he most severe in the nation. The so-called
Rockefeller drug laws instituted in the 1970's
put some low-level first-time drug offenders
behind bars for sentences ranging from 15
years to life. Under the changes passed Tuesday,
which Gov. George E. Pataki said he would sign,
the sentence for those same offenders would be
reduced to 8 to 20 years in prison. The law will
allow more than 400 inmates serving lengthy
prison terms on those top counts to apply to
judges to get out of jail early.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan's plan to offer visa-free treatment to
visitors from Taiwan during the six months of the EXPO 2005 AICHI
beginning March 1, 2005 remains unchanged, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks in response to a report by Japan's Kyodo News
a day earlier that the Japanese government would not grant
"permanent" visa-free treatment to Taiwan visitors beginning from the
EXPO 2005 AICHI.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that the Japanese government had never said that it
would grant "permanent" visa-free privilege to visitors from Taiwan
from the EXPO 2005 AICHI.</P>
      <P>He said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials contacted
Japanese authorities Tuesday and were told that the six-month
visa-free plan beginning next March remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>Japanese Foreign Minister Nobutaka Machimura said last Friday
that based on revised laws, Japan will offer visa-free entry to
Taiwan tourist during the EXPO 2005 AICHI from March 25 through Sept.
25, 2005, in order to attract more visitors from the island.</P>
      <P>After that, Machimura said, Japan may consider granting
"permanent" visa-free treatment to Taiwan visitors if they have not
done anything wrong or illegal in Japan during the period.</P>
      <P>An official in charge of general affairs at the Interchange
Association's Taipei Office told CNA Wednesday that his office had
not received any information from the Interchange Association
headquarters in Tokyo about any change in the visa-free plan as
reported.</P>
      <P>The official said that as far as he knows, plans to change
relevant laws are currently in the pipeline to pave the way for the
Japanese government to grant visa-free treatment to Taiwan people
from March 25 to Sept. 25 next year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Japan's second-largest source of tourists after South
Korea, with the number already exceeding the one million mark this
week.</P>
      <P>Currently, only visitors from countries that maintain diplomatic
ties with Japan are provided with visa-free entry. Tokyo switched its
diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1972.</P>
      <P>According to Japanese official tallies, the number of tourist
arrivals to Japan has already exceeded six million so far this year,
with one million arrivals from Taiwan. Japan is expected to attract
1.3 million Taiwan tourists next year.</P>

      <P>U.S. Congressman Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) , a
co-chairman of the pro-Taiwan U.S. Congressional Taiwan Caucus, is
scheduled to arrive in Taipei Thursday for a four-day visit.</P>
      <P>Chabot was originally scheduled to arrive in Taiwan Wednesday but
rescheduled his itinerary when his original Taiwan-bound flight was
delayed.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen, Chabot is
visiting Taiwan mainly to observe Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>He is also scheduled to meet with President Chen Shui-bian Friday
to exchange views on a wide range of topics, with Taiwan's
name-change plan for its overseas representative offices and
state-run enterprises expected to be a focus of the talks.</P>
      <P>Chabot and the other Congressional Taiwan Caucus co-chairmen
recently wrote a letter to Chen expressing their support for Taiwan's
plan to change the name of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Representative Office in the United States to the Taiwan
Representative Office in the United States. The office is Taiwan's de
facto embassy there in the absence of formal diplomatic ties between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>In the letter, Chabot said that a new name for the office that
includes the word "Taiwan" would better reflect the characteristics
of the government in Taiwan, and that he will extend whatever help he
can to facilitate the name-change effort.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan, Chabot is also expected to meet with
the foreign affairs minister for talks on various issues, including
U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and diplomacy exchanges between Taiwan's
Legislative Yuan and the U.S. Congress.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES SUPPORTERS TO HELP DPP WIN 10 SEATS IN TAIPEI CITY</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called on
supporters Wednesday to follow the voter allocation measures
announced by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to help
the party win 10 legislative seats in Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The DPP has fielded five candidates in the city's north
constituency and another five in the south constituency.</P>
      <P>While accompanying the candidates to temples to pray for victory
in Saturday's legislative elections, Chen told supporters the
elections are even more important than the presidential race of
earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Chen said the DPP's victory in the March 20 presidential election
will be meaningless unless the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and the
Taiwan Solidarity Union can seize a majority in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He said most of the lawmakers of the "pan-blue alliance" of the
opposition Kuomintang and People First Party, which dominates the
current legislature, always oppose the DPP government's policies "for
no reason, " which he noted has made him a "lame duck president."</P>
      <P>Chen urged voters to give the "pan-green camp" a chance to
control the legislature and promised to step down in two years should
the DPP still fail to improve its performance.</P>
      <P>If the "pan-blue alliance" continues to dominate the legislature,
the country will be thrown into a situation of disorder and unrest,
he warned.</P>
      <P>He asked DPP supporters to solicit their friends to vote for the
party's candidates and to follow the voter allocation measures to
ensure that all DPP candidates are elected.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT 'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC' ABOUT LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman Lien Chan of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) said Wednesday that he is "cautiously optimistic"
about the party's performance in the Dec. 11 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks as the campaign for Saturday's elections
was gearing up for the final stretch.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that the party has adopted a two-pronged strategy -- a
restrained nomination approach and measures to bolster trailing
candidates -- which he claimed has produced great results.</P>
      <P>In addition, the KMT has announced a voter allocation scheme in
12 of the country's 25 cities and counties, Lien said.</P>
      <P>"The voter allocation strategy is new to us, but in these
bitterly contested elections, and since the rival party uses the
strategy, we have to follow suit," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Lien also defended his earlier remarks that if the "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party garners a majority in
the elections, a "pan-blue" figure must be appointed as premier to
form a Cabinet.</P>
      <P>According to Lien, the Constitution stipulates that the Executive
Yuan must report to the Legislative Yuan and that if there is a new
legislature and a new mandate, "one must respect the majority."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT legislative caucus lashed out at President
Chen Shui-bian, claiming that it is him who has plunged the nation
into six crises.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-fu, KMT whip in the legislature, named first and
foremost what he claimed is Chen's "authoritarian administration, "
saying that except for the Legislative Yuan, the president holds the
personnel appointment power in the Executive, Judicial, Control, and
Examination yuans.</P>
      <P>There is no clear line between the nation and the party, he said,
adding that the president concurrently serves as party chairman and
claiming that he has asked the officials and the heads of the
state-owned enterprises to solicit donations for the DPP.</P>
      <P>The DPP has also depleted the national coffers by spending NT$500
billion a year, and the president has continued to create rifts
between ethnic groups, Huang claimed, adding that the KMT feels Chen
has continued to edge toward what he described as a "red line" set by
the United States and alienating the country's most important ally,
while continuing to provoke mainland China, which could trigger war.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Cabinet-level Council of
Aboriginal Affairs defended Wednesday the legitimacy of his daughter
Chen Ying's running for a legislative seat.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-nian pointed out that his daughter has legitimately
registered with the Central Election Commission for the legislative
elections in accordance with the country's laws.</P>
      <P>He denied categorically that he is using "public resources" to
broaden a support base for his daughter.</P>
      <P>Calling for "fair competition like gentlemen, " Chen appealed to
Chen Ying's rivals, particularly from the opposition parties, not to
besmirch him and his daughter any longer.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung, a party whip of
the opposition People First Party, claimed it is unfair that Chen
Ying is "enjoying all the Council of Aboriginal Affairs' resources"
in her bid to win a seat at the Legislative Yuan simply because she
is the daughter of Chen Chien-nian.</P>
      <P>What is even more outrageous, he said, is that Chen Ying has not
even lived in Taiwan longer than four months over the past three
years.</P>
      <P>He poured further ridicule on Chen Ying, saying that the
aboriginal voters do not need a lawmaker representing them who cannot
speak any of their languages and who has only lived in Taiwan for a
few months since the presidential election earlier this year.</P>

      <P>In view of the good results of a rent
incentive program in the country's industrial zones, the Executive
Yuan decided Wednesday in a floor meeting that the program will be
extended for another two years.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan, noted that to

Executive Yuan approved the program May 16, 2002 for manufacturers
who want to rent land in the industrial zones -- zero rent in the
first and second years, 60 percent of the rent in the third and
fourth years, and 80 percent of the rent in the fifth and sixth
years.</P>
      <P>Vice Economic Affairs Minister Chen Ruey-long said that since the
launch of the program, 634 manufacturers have been approved to rent
381 hectares of land or buildings in the industrial zones. They have
invested NT$244.2 billion (US$7.63 billion) with an annual production
of NT$367 billion, have created 44,046 jobs, and have contributed
NT$5 billion in tax revenues for the government annually.</P>
      <P>After the extension of the program, and an increase of a loan

security.</P>

      <P>As of the end of October this year, police

      <P>A total of 245,400 policemen were mobilized to maintain order in

motivated, NPA statistics show. The January-October demonstration
number reflects a noticeable rise of 2,395 over the previous year's

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party

the Formosa Incident.</P>
      <P>The 15-minute documentary records the major developments in
Taiwan's democracy, which include the birth of the opposition
movement, the foundation of the DPP and the coming to power of the
DPP.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Incident, also known as the "Kaohsiung Incident, "
occurred Dec. 10, 1979, when a demonstration organized by opposition
activists and Formosa Magazine to mark Human Rights Day in Kaohsiung
City turned into a bloody riot. It led to the arrest of a group of
then-dissidents, many of whom are now heavyweight DPP members.</P>
      <P>Recalling the heavy-handed authoritarian rule of the Kuomintang
(KMT) in the past, DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said the
people on the island went through a long period of martial law and
were deprived of the right to form political parties and to elect the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The DPP was able to win the support of the people because it
responded to their expectations for freedom, democracy and human

      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh said the efforts and devotion of the
DPP have proven to be worthwhile in light of the freedom of speech
and democracy enjoyed by the people of Taiwan today.</P>

      <P>The premier also called on all political parties and their

Taiwan must follow and it will not budge under pressure, an official
of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, the DPP's legislative whip, made the remarks
one day after President Chen Shui-bian said he would continue to push
for the name change issue, despite U.S. State Department deputy
spokesman Adam Ereli's remarks Monday that the U.S. will not support
the proposal, as it appears to unilaterally change the island's
status quo.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that Taiwan will never budge because of outside

conforms to Taiwan's real situation.</P>
      <P>He said the change will not involve the "four noes plus one"
pledge made by Chen in his inauguration speeches -- no declaration of
Taiwan independence if Beijing does not use force, no change of the
nation's official name, no inclusion of the "state-to-state" theory
in the Constitution, no referendum on Taiwan's future status
regarding independence or unification and no abrogation of the

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN TO WORK WITH NAME CHANGE PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Wednesday that
since President Chen Shui-bian has proposed changing the names of
the country's overseas missions and state-owned enterprises, the
Executive Yuan will work with the plan.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks when he attended the inauguration of
an expressway from Huwei to Taihsi in Yunlin County that will improve
traffic in the central Taiwan county.</P>
      <P>Yu was referring to Chen's proposal Sunday to push for changing
the names of overseas missions and state-owned enterprises within two
years to highlight the national identity and to avoid confusion with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>However, a U.S. State Department deputy spokesman has already
said that the United States will not support the proposal, as it
would appear to unilaterally change Taiwan's status quo.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the issue is an internal affair that will not
involve the change of Taiwan's status quo and will not violate Chen's
"four noes plus one" pledge -- no declaration of Taiwan independence
if Beijing does not use force, no change of the nation's official
name, no inclusion of "state-to-state" theory into the
Constitution, no referendum regarding Taiwan's future
status as regards independence or unification with the mainland,
and no abrogation of the National Unification Guidelines -- in his
inauguration speeches.</P>
      <P>The name-change plan has caused heated debate in recent days,
with some people questioning the cost of changing the names of such
state-controlled companies as China Shipbuilding Corp., Chunghwa
Telecom and China Airlines, saying that the building of a name brand
is not achieved in a short time.</P>

      <P>About 50 percent of adults in Taiwan who
responded to an Asia-wide opinion survey said they have suffered from
insomnia, according to the results of a report released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey was jointly conducted by media research firm ACNielsen
and the Asian Sleep Research Society. More than 8,000 adults in
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and Japan were interviewed in
the survey, which was aimed at exploring their sleep quality.</P>
      <P>The results show that nearly half of those interviewed in Taiwan
complained of sleep problems, with the ratio increasing to 80 percent
among respondents aged over 45.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results, 75 percent of those claiming to
have sleep problems said they have never seen a doctor or received
medical treatment for their complaint.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the survey results, Lin Ching-ku, a family medicine
physician, said that among advanced countries, Taiwan ranks second
after the United States in terms of the percentage of adults with
sleep problems.</P>
      <P>Lin said anyone who suffers from insomnia three times a week in a
month should immediately see a doctor.</P>
      <P>For most people, Lin said, sleep problems can be solved by
adopting orderly living habits and taking nutrients such as calcium,
magnesium and vitamin B. Drinking a cup of hot milk or chocolate
before going to bed is also a good method of ensuring a good night's
sleep, Lin added.</P>

      <P>Changing the names of Taiwan's overseas

President Chen Shui-bian claimed while stumping for a legislative
candidate of his Democratic Progressive Party in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>One day after Washington expressed its disapproval of his move to
rename the country's overseas missions to highlight their Taiwan
connections, Chen said his promise to change the designation of the
country's overseas missions to make them recognizable as offices of
Taiwan is "necessary."</P>
      <P>He also disputed critics' claims that his plan to replace the
word "China" in the names of all state-run enterprises with "Taiwan"
will cost these enterprises a fortune, arguing that the Formosa
Plastic Group makes a lot of profit under the name of Formosa, which
is the old term for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He urged his audience to back his name-changing move by voting
for his party in Saturday's legislative elections.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About 150 fishermen from Keelung protested
in front of the office of the Japanese Interchange Association (JIA)
in Taipei Wednesday because Japan impounded two Taiwan fishing boats
in November, which had allegedly intruded into Japan's territorial
waters.</P>
      <P>The JIA represents Japanese interests in Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>According to the demonstrators, Japanese coast guard authorities
often impound and fine Taiwan fishing boats on charges that they were
poaching in Japan's territorial waters. However, the demonstrators
insisted that they have been operating legally in Taiwan's exclusive
economic waters, not Japan's.</P>
      <P>Just last month, Japan seized two Taiwan fishing boats and
slapped them with fines of NT$1.8 million and NT$1.5 million,
respectively.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators demanded that Japan refund the fines.
Otherwise, they said they will mobilize fishermen from around Taiwan
to stage a massive demonstration at the JIA office in the near future
to protest Japan's unlawful and unjust treatment of Taiwan fishermen.</P>
      <P>The protestors pelted five or six eggs at the JIA office before
police managed to stop them. Some of them scuffled with police while
they were trying to storm the JIA office.</P>
      <P>The protest ended after a JIA official accepted a petition letter
from two representatives of the protesting fishermen. The official
said that although the demonstration was not legally approved by
Taiwan's police authorities, he decided to accept the petition in
consideration of the fishermen's feelings. He said the JIA will
convey the appeal to the Japanese government.</P>
      <P>Some demonstrators said that since the two countries' exclusive
economic zones overlap in certain areas, the ROC government should
step up negotiations with Japan to find a mutually acceptable way for
sharing maritime resources in those regions and thus resolve fishery
disputes once and for all.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taichung Airport needs to make major
expansions if it hopes to become the island's third international
airport for flights to and from Hong Kong and Macau, an aviation
industrialist said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>One day before the Council for Economic Planning and Development
(CEPD) under the Executive Yuan is expected to approve a plan to
improve the facilities of the Taichung Airport, also known as the
Chingchuankang Air Force Base, to make it an international airport, Le
Ta-hsin, the general manager of Mandarin Airlines, said both the
terminal and the runways of the airport need to be expanded to
accommodate large commercial passenger planes and the great number of
passengers that they carry.</P>
      <P>The current runways of the Taichung Airport are too short to be
used by jumbo aircraft, and the terminal is too small to handle the
huge number of inbound and outbound passengers, Le said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the current restriction imposed by the air force on the
time and the number of landings and takeoffs -- 40 flights per day
between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m.-- should be relaxed or else the carriers
will have difficulty coordinating their departures and arrivals.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, air rights should be secured to start flights to and
from Hong Kong and Macau since Taichung Airport is currently not
covered by the existing aviation agreement between Taiwan and Hong
Kong or Macau, Le said.</P>
      <P>Although local carriers are interested in starting services
between Taichung and Hong Kong and Macau, they are not certain their
counterparts in Hong Kong and Macau will share their interest
, Le went on.</P>
      <P>Under the CEPD's plan, the government will spend NT$18 million
(US$560,311) to improve the facilities at the airport and NT$1
billion (US$31.12 million) to expand the runway, terminal and parking
apron.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MARKET FORCES TO DECIDE MERGERS OF FINANCIAL HOLDINGS GROUPS: FSC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  8 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)
Chairman Kong Jaw-sheng said Wednesday that the government plan to
merge Taiwan's many financial holding companies will be subject to
market forces despite a government blueprint for the move.</P>
      <P>Kong made the remarks after having paid an inspection visit to
the Securities and Futures Bureau under the FSC.</P>
      <P>Although the FSC has crafted a blueprint on mergers of Taiwan's
financial holdings groups, Kong said that it is only an initial idea
on the government side and stressed that all the processes and
companies involved must be scrutinized by the market.</P>
      <P>According to the FSC blueprint, three merger models are possible
-- mergers between privately run groups, mergers between
privately run and government controlled companies and consolidation
of private, government companies and foreign investors.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian recently said that there should be three
financial holding companies each capable of having at least a 10
percent market share by the end of 2005, and that the current 12
government-controlled financial institutions should be merged into six
by the end of 2006, with one of them being listed in foreign markets.</P>
      <P>In an effort to create a "national champion" in the business, a
merger of privately owned and government controlled financial holding
groups will be better to clear the way for the creation of a
"regional champion," FSC Vice Chairman Lu Daung-yen said.</P>
      <P>To serve that end, the Ministry of Finance hopes to choose one or
two from the three government run groups -- First Financial Holdings,
Hua Nan Financial Holdings and Mega Financial Holdings -- early next
year, if possible, to play the role as a catalyst to effectively
promote the task, Lu said.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the FSC has reached consensus with the Ministry
of Finance on the strategy. "That is what the government can do
best," he noted.</P>
      <P>Domestic and foreign banking experts share a common viewpoint
that Taiwan's financial institutions are facing major problems on the
small business scale, with backward product innovations, lax
profit-making capabilities and insufficient regionalization and
globalization, FSC officials said.</P>
      <P>The government is in the position to design a set of standard
indexes to help the domestic financial sector sharpen its
competitiveness and enlarge its operational scale under the
precondition that market mechanisms are fully respected, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a Mega Financial Holdings executive said that the
group is open to all possibilities of a "big and beautiful" merger,
as long as the other side is a company of high quality.</P>
      <P>Spokesmen for the Hua Nan and First financial holding companies
also displayed willingness to follow the government's merger policy.
Consolidation between public institutions will be much quicker and
easier to help the domestic banking industry move up its ranking in
the world, they said.</P>
      <P>The FSC was set up this year to oversee the domestic banking
insurance, securities and futures industries, which were exercised in
the past by the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of China and
the Central Depository Insurance Co.</P>

      <P>Chen said he attaches great importance to the selection of
Control Yuan members. He revealed that the ombudsmen recommendation
screening team headed by Vice President Annette Lu has furnished him
with a list of qualified candidates. Chen said he is scheduled to

been on the decline, not on the rise as claimed by the opposition
People First Party (PFP) , Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen was refuting the PFP legislative caucus's claim earlier in
the day that the number of ROC citizens emigrating has been
increasing since the Democratic Progressive Party took power four
years ago. In the first 10 months of this year alone, the PFP caucus
claimed that 230,000 Taiwan nationals emigrated.</P>
      <P>Chen said the PFP claim was not factual. The figure presented by
the PFP included many of those who stayed abroad for 30 days or 180
days.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan household registration law, only those who
have stayed abroad for two years should be listed as emigrants. The
rule complies with the general international norm regarding
emigration, Chen said, adding that under general international
practices, those who have not returned after going abroad for either
30 days or 180 days have seldom been defined as emigrants.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Chen said the annual number of Taiwan
emigrants was 22,461 in 1989 and then rose steadily to reach a peak
of 35,029 in 1995. The number has since declined continuously to
8,658 in 2003.</P>
      <P>Chen said the PFP should not use implausible statistical reports
to mislead local people.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of an important political group in
the European Parliament said Wednesday that he is opposed to a
lifting of the European Union's ban on arms sales to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with the German National Broadcasting
Co., Daniel Cohn-Bendi, president of the Greens/European Free
Alliance Group, said that besides the lack of improvement in human
rights in China, the Tibet issue and the Taiwan issue are two other
reasons to keep the ban in place.</P>
      <P>The European Union and mainland China held a summit meeting in
the Hague the same day.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that China continues to occupy Tibet and intimidate
Taiwan, Cohn-Bendi said that the European Union cannot lift its arms
embargo against China before the Tibet and Taiwan issues are resolved
peacefully.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Cohn-Bendit also admitted that most members of the
European Parliament support the notion of working toward an eventual
lifting of the ban.</P>
      <P>Touching on whether the E.U. leaders will reach a consensus at
their summit meeting next week, Cohn-Bendit said that its hard to say
now and predicted that France will continue to press the other E.U.
member nations to lift the ban, while Germany will express its
reservations and the Scandinavian countries will voice their
opposition.</P>
      <P>During the E.U.-China summit, the E.U. side informed China that
there is a willingness within the union to work towards a lifting of
the arms embargo but said at the same time that this must be seen in
relation to the adaptation of the E.U. code of conduct for arms
exporters.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun on Thursday expressed
satisfaction with the anti-vote-buying campaign, saying that it has
produced good results.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu said that "election" banquets, which were fairly
common in past elections to solicit voters, have been dramatically
reduced in number by 90 percent, and that prosecutors have so
far filed more than 10 suits against violators during the
vote-buying crackdown.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks while stumping for five legislative
candidates from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in
Tainan, southern Taiwan with only two days to go before Saturday's
elections.</P>
      <P>Yu noted that the good results can be attributed to the move of
stationing prosecutors and investigative agents at local police
stations around the island so as to handle any vote-buying complaints
quickly.</P>
      <P>In addition, Yu said, the move of having local prosecutors who
support the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and its ally Taiwan
Solidarity Union check the legislative candidates from the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party,
while having prosecutors who support the "pan-blue alliance" check
"pan-green camp" candidates has been effective.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWIN COURT OFFICIAL RETIREES AIM EVEN HIGHER AT 64</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  central Taiwan,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The twin brothers whose
record achievement of passing court clerk qualification tests with an
elementary school education still remains unbroken after 30 years,
are now preparing to take on the graduate school entrance exams at
the age of 64.</P>
      <P>Hu Shun-long and Hu Shun-ching, who were farmers until the age of
30, became publicly certified court clerks when they were 31 years
old in 1973. They retired from their law careers in the same month in
2002.</P>
      <P>The Hu twins, who are self-taught and who acquired their college
diplomas from the Open University, are now studying together under
the same roof in Taichung in preparation for graduate school entrance
exams next year. Their story serves as another shining example of
lifelong learning.</P>
      <P>Born into a poor family of five children in Chiayi, the twins'
father died when they were two years old. They were raised along with
their three elder siblings by their farmer mother in barely
subsistence-level living conditions.</P>
      <P>The twins were forced by poverty to quit school after they
completed their elementary school education to work on the family's
rice paddies.</P>
      <P>The Hus said that they would never have thought about taking the
court clerk tests if it were not for an incident 30 years ago when
Shun-ching was beat by police.</P>
      <P>Being farmers with subsistence-level incomes, the twins also
caught fish to make ends meet at a fishery pond jointly managed with
other members of the neighborhood. At one point, the neighbors began
complaining that their catch was continuously diminishing as a result
of some unworthy police officers frequently fishing at the
privately-run pond without paying.</P>
      <P>With his limited vocabulary and total lack of legal knowledge,
Shun-ching wrote an appeal letter to the Police Department under the
then Taiwan Provincial Government, explaining how the police had
stolen the fish from the pond and how the fishermen's living had been
adversely affected.</P>
      <P>The appeal letter was relayed to the local police authorities and
as a result, Shun-ching was "invited" to a police station, where he
was given a shellocking.</P>
      <P>The Hus' bitterness had never been vented. They were later
inspired by a friend who had passed a public examination to become
prison guard to take the law clerk certification tests. The twins
took the friend's advice, thinking that "if you can't beat them, then
join them."</P>
      <P>To enter the examinations, the twins first had to pass tests
proving they had the academic ability equivalent to that of a high
school graduate. After succeeding, they then biked hours to the
nearest town to buy reference books to prepare for the civil servant
examinations.</P>
      <P>After following the routine of getting up each morning at 4
o'clock before going out to farm at 7 for months on end, the twins
passed the exams the next year and were certified as court clerks,
becoming the first people in Taiwan with only elementary school
education to do so.</P>
      <P>During their 31-year legal career, Shun-long and Shun-ching
worked at district courts in Taipei, Chiayi and Taichung cities as
well as in Nantou County before returning to the Taichung District
Court where they retired as section chiefs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP UNVEILS PLAN FOR ACHIEVING STABLE MAJORITY AFTER ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Thursday that it has a "two-staged approach" to achieve a
stable majority after Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung made the remarks as he
unveiled the party's latest legislative elections poll in a press
conference held at the DPP headquarters.</P>
      <P>Chang said the poll conducted last week shows that the "pan-green
camp" of the DPP and its ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will
be able to garner 113 seats in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, Chang said, the DPP will secure 96 seats
(plus or minus two seats) , while the TSU will obtain 17 seats (plus
or minus one seats) , the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) 68 seats (plus
or minus two seats) , the People First Party (PFP) 30 seats (plus or
minus one seat), the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU) six seats,
and independent candidates eight seats.</P>
      <P>Chang said the DPP will adopt a two-staged approach to achieve a
stable majority, adding that the DPP is "cautiously optimistic" about
the "pan-green camp" commanding a majority in the new legislature. He
said that if the camp does not win a majority, it will cooperate with
several NPSU and independent legislators, whom he said have expressed
an interest in cooperating with the camp.</P>
      <P>He said that if the "pan-green camp" wins a majority, the
cooperation of the NPSU and independent lawmakers will further cement
a "stable majority."</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP, which currently
holds a slim majority in the legislature, will lose its dominant
status in the new legislature, he added.</P>
      <P>On the ratio of votes that each party will garner, Chang said the
poll shows that the DPP will increase its take to 39 percent from
33.4 percent in the previous legislative elections, while the TSU
will increase to 8.2 percent from 7 percent, the KMT and the New
Party (a splinter party of the KMT which is running under the banner
of the KMT) will drop to 30.4 percent from 31.2 percent, the PFP will
drop to 13.2 percent from 18.6 percent, and the other legislators
(including independents and those of the NPSU) will increase slightly
to 9.2 percent from 9.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Chang also said that the DPP had originally estimated that the
party would win 100 seats, but because of recent scathing criticism
from the TSU aimed at President Chen Shui-bian, it has adjusted its
estimate downward to between 96 and 98 seats.</P>
      <P>He was referring to President Chen's proposal Sunday to rectify
the names of Taiwan's overseas missions and state-owned enterprises,
which the TSU criticized as not going far enough. The staunchly
pro-independence TSU wants the nation's official designation to be
changed, and not just what it called the "partial name-change"
advocated President Chen.</P>
      <P>President Chen, while proposing the name-change, also reaffirmed
his pledge of no change of the nation's designation which is part of
his "four noes plus one" pledges in his inauguration speeches, which
also include no declaration of independence if mainland China doesn't
use force, no inclusion of the "state-to-state" theory in the
Constitution, no referendum on the nation's future status concerning
independence and unification, and no abrogation of the National
Unification Guidelines.</P>
      <P>Chang said that both the DPP and the TSU are native political
parties, but as the DPP is the ruling party, it shoulders greater
responsibility.</P>
      <P>" As the nation's leader, President Chen has to coordinate
divergent opinions," Chang said, adding that "this is the responsible
approach."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) on Thursday
accused authorities of unfairly targeting the party's politicians in
their crackdown on vote-buying ahead of the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Huang Teh-fu claimed that
prosecutorial, investigative and police authorities began probing 14
KMT candidates right from the start of the crackdown.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has received information indicating that
authorities will target certain KMT candidates in Taipei, Taoyuan,
Taichung, Changhua, Yunlin, Tainan and Kaohsiung counties within the
next couple of days, Huang claimed the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) government is trying to influence the outcome of Saturday's
elections by ordering the operations.</P>
      <P>Luan Kang-meng, head of the KMT's Evaluation and Discipline
Committee, alleged that the DPP is resorting to every means to attack
the KMT in order to achieve its goal of seizing a majority in the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Luan said that the KMT has been cooperating with private
detectives to gather vote-buying information involving DPP candidates
in Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Changhua, Yunlin, Tainan, Kaohsiung and
Pingtung.</P>
      <P>However, the authorities have not taken the information
seriously, Luan claimed.</P>
      <P>Rejecting the KMT's accusations, DPP Secretary-General Chang
Chun-hsiung said the DPP has never interfered in any individual
cases, although the DPP-controlled Cabinet and Ministry of Justice
might have ordered authorities to step up their crackdown on
vote-buying.</P>
      <P>If the DPP were able to interfere in judicial cases as the KMT
has claimed, Chang said, then the party's candidate for Hualien
magistrate, You Ying-lung, would not have been indicted for alleged
vote-buying and President Chen Shui-bian would not have been summoned
to attend a court hearing about the case early this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 20 MAINLAND FISHING BOATS EXPELLED FROM TUNGSHA ISLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 20 mainland Chinese fishing boats
that were allowed to seek shelter from Typhoon Nanmadol on Dec. 3
near Tungsha Island were driven from the area Thursday by the ROC
Coast Guard because they had overstayed their welcome.</P>
      <P>Tungsha, located about 240 nautical miles southwest of Kaohsiung,
is claimed by the ROC.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese fishing boats were among 45 vessels from
Hainan province that were allowed to anchor off the coast of Tungsha
Island to avoid the brunt of Typhoon Nanmadol.</P>
      <P>The Hainan boats were supposed to leave Tungsha after the typhoon
left the area in the afternoon of Dec. 4. Nevertheless, more than 20
of them were still in the area four days after the deadline,
prompting the ROC Navy detachment posted on Tungsha to notify the
Coast Guard Administration (CGA) to take action.</P>
      <P>Two CGA patrol frigates arrived near Tungsha Wednesday but could
not properly maneuver the Chinese ships out of the area because of
inclement weather.</P>
      <P>However, as of noon Thursday, all of the 20-odd mainland Chinese
fishing boats had left the area, CGA authorities reported.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council transferred a faxed letter filed by
the Taipei-based Chinese Search and Rescue Association to the CGA
Dec. 2 prior to the typhoon that requested that 45 Hainan fishing
boats, with some 1,120 crew members aboard, be allowed to seek
temporary shelter on Tungsha Island.</P>
      <P>Based on humanitarian considerations, the CGA granted permission
to the mainland fishing boats and allowed them to anchor off a
coastal area near Tungsha, but did not allow the boats to anchor at
Tungsha Port for security reasons.</P>
      <P>The CGA also asked the ROC Navy detachment posted on Tungsha to
help the mainland fishing boats if they were in need.</P>
      <P>The archipelago of the Pratas Islands, comprising Tungsha Island
and two coral reefs, is located in a strategically important position
along a major sea route connecting the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The
group is 140 nautical miles south of China's Guangdong province, 400
nautical miles northwest of Manila, 170 nautical miles southeast of
Hong Kong and 240 nautical miles southwest of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Tungsha Island is a coral atoll with a land area of 2.4 square
kilometers. Among the three islands, only Tungsha Island, which is
shaped like a horseshoe, is always above water.</P>
      <P>The ROC government set up a national monument on Tungsha Island
June 30, 1989 to assert its sovereignty over the archipelago.</P>
      <P>In addition to being a source of fish, salt and minerals, the
island group is an outpost for the ROC Navy in the South China Sea.
The ROC Navy has set up a hospital, a power station and a runway on
Tungsha Island. A fishermen's service center also provides fishermen
operating in the South China Sea with emergency shelter.</P>

Billionaire Mikhail Fridman's biggest telecommunications asset,

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES VOTERS TO KEEP ON REWRITING TAIWAN'S HISTORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> Taipei, Dec. 9 (CAN) Speaking on the eve of the 25th anniversary
of the " Kaohsiung Incident, " President Chen Shui-bian on Thursday
stressed that the road to Taiwan's democracy has been a bumpy one and
urged the public to show the same spirit of bravery in rewriting
history by supporting his party in Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while he was stumping for
legislative candidates from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in
Taoyuan and Taipei counties in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Incident took place on Dec. 10, 1979 when a march
by opposition activists and people associated with Formosa Magazine
to mark Human Rights Day in Kaohsiung City turned into a bloody riot,
which led to the arrest of a group of then-dissidents, including the
current vice president, Annette Lu. The incident is generally
believed to have been the seed that sowed the DPP.</P>
      <P>The president, in recalling the bravery of the past dissident
leaders in breaking the many taboos that existed at the time, urged
the public to show the same bravery in pursuing democracy and end the
present chaos in the legislature, which he blamed on the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party, which holds a slim majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>On the significance of the incident a quarter of a century ago,
Chen said that it strengthened and cemented democracy on the island,
leading to the lifting of martial law in 1987, the first fully
democratic legislative elections in 1992, the first popular
presidential election in 1996, the first power transfer between
different political parties in 2000 and the first national referendum
in 2004.</P>
      <P>The president said that because of the persistence of the
Taiwanese, history is continually being rewritten. He urged the
public to continue the trend in Saturday's elections, and give the
DPP its first majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>The president also asked supporters where KMT Chairman Lien Chan
and PFP Chairman James Soong were during the infamous Kaohsiung
Incident. Chen asked rhetorically whether either one of them had ever
shed a drop of blood for Taiwan or been thrown into jail for even a
single day. "They are the accomplices blocking Taiwan's democracy and
undermining its human rights," he added.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Secretary-General Chang
Chun-hsiung said the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) is expected to win a majority in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Even if it fails to meet its target, the "pan-green camp" can
still gain a majority by joining forces with independent legislators,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Disagreeing with Chang, Legislative Yuan speaker and opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman Wang Jin-pyng said it is hard to
predict which camp will win a majority in the legislature.</P>
      <P>However, Wang said the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the
People First Party (PFP) should be able to retain its majority by a
narrow margin in Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>A total of 387 candidates are on the ballots, vying for 168
regional and eight aboriginal seats. The remaining eight overseas
Chinese seats and 41 at-large seats will be allocated to the various
parties according to the number of votes they garner.</P>
      <P>While the DPP has nominated 92 candidates for regional seats, the
KMT has named 74 candidates. The PFP is fielding 41 candidates, and
the TSU and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union are fielding 30 and 26,

    <HEADLINE>LENOVO-IBM DEAL SHAKES UP TAIWAN COMPUTER MAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The acquisition of IBM Corp's PC division by
mainland China's biggest personal computer maker, Lenovo Group, has
dealt a heavy blow to Taiwan's information industry, which says that
the impact will be comprehensive over the long term.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's companies devoted to foundry and brand creation will be
affected across the board, industry sources said, adding that the
US$1.75 billion deal will turn Lenovo, already Asia's largest
computer maker, into the world's third-largest.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the deal, Lenovo will be licensed to use the
IBM "ThinkFamily " brand names over a five-year period, topping
Taiwan companies' efforts to seize a larger slice of the mainland
market and diluting their bids to create their own distinctive brand
names.</P>
      <P>Although short-term effects are not expected to be serious
because IBM orders for Taiwan contractors are already due, they
pointed out that the long-term impact will be unavoidably severe --
with secondary companies being hurt the most.</P>
      <P>The Hon Hai Group, Quanta Computer, ASUSTeK Computer -- all
Taiwan's leading companies -- are IBM's PC and notebooks contractors,
while the Compal Group, First International Computer and Mitac
International make computers for Lenovo.</P>
      <P>Statistics show that IBM enjoys the largest notebook market share
of 18.2 percent in mainland China as of the end of this year's third
quarter, followed by Lenovo's 16.5 percent. ASUSTeK ranked sixth with
a 5.4 percent stake, ahead of Acer, Taiwan's largest personal
computer manufacturer, at a place out of the top 10.</P>
      <P>Acer has long been keen on becoming the world's third-largest PC
computer manufacturer, but the goal remains further away now with
Lenovo's expansion, market analysts said.</P>
      <P>The Lenovo's deal with IBM also deals a heavy blow to PC
peripheral makers based in Taiwan, as many of them are worried that
"future road will be more rugged" at a time when domestic PC and
notebook manufacturers are already engaged in a heated price war.</P>
      <P>Current suppliers for IBM acknowledged that "negative elements
outnumber positive effects, " and business sources predicted that
there will be a major shake-up for Taiwan's information industry,
threatened by slim profits due to an intensively competitive world
market.</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for

      <P>Chen Ruey-long, vice minister of economic affairs, said that

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of Economic
Affairs Ho Mei-yueh, who arrived Tuesday in the United States, is in
Washington, D.C. to drum up support for a free trade agreement (FTA)
between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Ho will attend a meeting of the International Institute of
Economy, a Washington think tank, Friday, during which she will
promote an FTA between the two countries.</P>
      <P>In addition, she will also call on U.S. State Department
officials.</P>
      <P>Following the recent signing of an FTA between mainland China and
the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Taiwan is
trying to avoid being marginalized, and the signing of an FTA with
the United States is a priority goal.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Ho said she hopes to have face-to-face
communications with U.S. officials, adding that an FTA between the
two countries will be a boost to bilateral trade relations. She
admitted, however, that it will be a "long road," but said she hopes
to quicken the pace.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another ROC official, Deputy Minister of Defense
Michael Tsai Ming-shian, is also in Washington at the head of a
delegation. He is expected to meet with U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary
Paul D. Wolfowitz and other officials to exchange views on military exchanges
and other defense issues.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ing-wen, former Mainland Affairs Council chairwoman, will
also visit the U.S. after Saturday's legislative elections in her
capacity as an at-large legislator-elect of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party. She is expected to attend a seminar Dec. 16 on the
future of Taiwan at the Brookings Institution, another Washington

    <HEADLINE>KMT CANDIDATE BLAMES CHINA FOR FUELING TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has unwittingly fueled the sentiment
for independence in Taiwan by going all out to stop the country using
its official name of the Republic of China, a legislative candidate
named by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shei-saint, a KMT legislator who is running for re-election,
told a group of Hong Kong journalists and scholars who came to Taiwan
to observe the Dec. 11 legislative elections that Beijing will only
have itself to blame for the emergence of pro-independence parties in
Taiwan should it keep overlooking Taiwanese people's desire to be
their own master.</P>
      <P>Worrying that the country is polarized politically, with one side
favoring independence and the other favoring the eventual union of
the mainland and Taiwan, Chen called himself a candidate who follows
the middle course, adding that if he does not win re-election, the
Legislative Yuan would be denied a rational voice.</P>
      <P>He predicted that if re-elected, he, as well as other like-mind
lawmakers, will play the role of power-brokers in the new
legislature, because whichever party wins the most seats in the
legislature will need their support to win the presidency of the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>After the brief meeting, the Hong Kong visitors followed Chen on
the campaign trail to get first-hand experience of Taiwan elections.</P>

      <P>The opposition "pan blue alliance" will
recommend P.K. Chiang, a respected veteran technocrat in economic
affairs, to serve as premier if the opposition camp wins a majority
in the new Legislative Yuan, Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks while campaigning for legislative

Party and the New Party in southern Tainan County, with less than two
days to go before Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Should the "pan blue alliance" win more than half of the seats in

Economic Planning and Development in the previous KMT-led government

      <P>The Legislative Yuan will put a review of the
2005 general budget of the central government and the legislation of
an ad hoc National Assembly as its top priorities when it resumes
sitting after a one-month recess in preparation for Saturday's

      <P>The ad hoc 300-member National Assembly, currently moribund, must
be formed by May 2005 so as to pass constitutional amendments
proposed by the Legislative Yuan in August, including the halving of
the 225-seat legislature, the changing of the electoral system to a
"single-sea, two ballots" model and the inclusion of a referendum law
into the Constitution, as well as the abrogation of the National

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAKES PROGRESS IN HUMAN RIGHTS PROTECTION: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 9 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has made progress in its human rights
protection over the past year, with judicial rights and women's
rights posting the most significant progress, according to the
results of a survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Chinese Association for Human
Rights (CAHR) , which mailed questionnaires to elite members in
various quarters, including academics, experts, elected
representatives, government officials and non-profit organizations
executives, to explore their views on domestic human rights
conditions.</P>
      <P>The measurement was based on nine indexes -- judicial rights,
economic rights, the rights of the elderly and the mentally and
physically challenged, women's rights, labor rights, children's
rights, cultural and educational rights, and environmental rights. A
total of 2,858 valid samples were collected.</P>
      <P>CAHR President Hsu Wen-pin said judicial system reform and
concerted efforts by the judicial authorities have contributed to
substantial improvement in judicial rights.</P>
      <P>"Judicial rights posted the greatest progress among all the
indexes subjected to the evaluation, " Hsu said, adding that in the
prosecutorial investigation stage, the situation of prosecutors using
illegal means to take depositions from defendants or criminal
suspects has improved.</P>
      <P>Quoting the survey results, Hsu said, local judges have become
more prudent while probing evidence, helping upgrade the accuracy and
quality of their judgments. Moreover, Hsu went on, the survey found
that the number of cases involving maltreatment or abuse of prison
inmates has declined significantly.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsu said, women's rights received the highest-ever
score in this year's survey, with protection for women's social
participation rights, health rights and education rights registering
the greatest progress. Protection for women's personal safety has
also improved, but their work rights have regressed, he added.</P>
      <P>On economic rights, Hsu said the survey found that progress has
been made in product safety and health management, while individual
consumers now have easier access to filing complaints and better
opportunities to receive compensation.</P>
      <P>On labor rights, Hsu said there is still ample room for
improvement in the crackdown on commercial piracy and underground
companies, as well as restrictions on legally licensed companies, the
labor retirement system and the gap in the business climate between
private and state-owned firms.</P>
      <P>On cultural and educational rights, Hsu said, college tuition
fees are too high, while the quality of college education has been
declining and the educational gap between urban and rural areas has
continued to widen.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Legislator Her Jyh-huei filed a lawsuit against President Chen
Shui-bian Thursday, accusing Chen of intending to thwart his
re-election bid by disseminating false information against him.</P>
      <P>Her filed the suit with the Miaoli Prosecutor's Office on the
grounds that Chen has violated the nation's Public Official Election
and Recall Law by publicly urging Miaoli residents not to vote for
him in Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Without referring to Her by name, Chen noted during a campaign
rally in Miaoli County Wednesday that an opposition lawmaker who once
served as Miaoli county magistrate fled to mainland China and stayed
there for 11 months after being indicted by prosecutors on corruption
charges last year.</P>
      <P>"The lawmaker is the shame of Miaoli. Miaoli residents should not
vote for such a corrupt candidate again because he may have to go
behind bars before serving out his three-year legislative term.
Should that be the case, it would be a loss for Miaoli voters," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Her claimed after filing the suit against Chen that the president
has violated the election law by making such an appeal three days
ahead of the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Her went on, Chen's remarks expose his attempt to use
his political clout to interfere with the judicial system.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the court has yet to try the indictment against
him, Her claimed that the president "has handed down a verdict
against me even before judges try the case."</P>
      <P>"I feel regret that the president, a lawyer-turned-politician,
has deliberately violated the election law and tried to meddle with
the judicial system," Her said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he is worried about being imprisoned after the
elections, Her said he will face up to the case squarely and believes
that the court will clear his name.</P>
      <P>Her has been indicted for alleged involvement in two high-profile
land development scandals and prosecutors asked for an 18-year prison

      <P>An accord devised by Taiwan and Sweden to
avoid double taxation will become effective Jan. 1, 2005, benefiting
both countries and stepping up two-way investment and exchanges, a
spokesman for the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>From the beginning of the year, taxation on companies based in
the two countries will be subject to the terms stipulated in the
agreement, providing momentum for bilateral activities and
cooperation in investment and technology, the MOF official said.</P>
      <P>For instance, earnings made by the two countries' air carriers
and shipping companies that conduct international routes will not be
taxed by the other side in the future, he said.</P>
      <P>In compliance with Taiwan's existing income tax law, foreign
individuals and corporations must pay 30 percent and 25 percent,
respectively, of their earnings made in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After the double taxation avoidance agreement takes effect, the
tax rate will be cut to up to 10 percent for non-resident foreigners'
business earnings and interest income chalked up on either side, he
explained.</P>
      <P>The parliaments of Taiwan and Sweden ratified the double taxation
avoidance pact last month in the hope of further enhancing bilateral
exchanges.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are about 40 Taiwan companies with operations in
Sweden, which is Taiwan's largest trade partner in Scandinavia.

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday the
Presidential Office Human Rights Advisory Commission will unveil a
list of the perpetrators of 10 major political prosecution cases
during Taiwan's martial law era next May.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks after unveiling the 10 major political
prosecution cases during the 38-year-long martial-law era, also known
as the "white terror" era, on the eve of Dec. 10 World Human Rights

      <P>Lu said the plan to make public the list of "white terror"
perpetrators is mainly aimed at pursuing the truth, not at revenge.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the list will also include prosecutors and
presiding judges of the 10 cases.</P>
      <P>"If the prosecutors or presiding judges were forced to make
indictments or hand down outrageous judgments, they are welcome to
tell their sides of the stories to help enrich historical records of
that dark period," Lu said.</P>
      <P>The 10 major political prosecution cases refer to the
1949 Shangdong students case; the 1952 Chungli Yiming High School

case; the 1960 Lei Chen case; the 1961 Su Tung-chi case; the 1964

the 1972 Huang Chi-nan and Chung Chien-shun case; and the 1979
Formosa Incident.</P>
      <P>Lu said the 10 cases were selected according to several indexes,
including their representation, influence and absurdity. In addition

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two victims of the 1979 Formosa Incident
laid out the significance of the incident Thursday on the eve of its
25th anniversary.</P>
      <P>Examination Yuan President Yao Chia-wen, who is one of the 61
victims arrested and put behind bars after organizing a demonstration
in Kaohsiung City Dec. 10, 1979 pressing for political reform when
the island was ruled under martial law, told CNA that history has
proved that the demonstration struck a chord with the public.</P>
      <P>Yao said all the demands aired in the demonstration, including
the lifting of martial law, the election of all legislators and the
revision of the Constitution have been met through the efforts of its
organizers and their sympathizers in the two decades since the
incident.</P>
      <P>The incident got its name because the demonstration was organized
by political dissents who preached democracy through their political
magazine, the Formosa.</P>
      <P>The dissents later formed the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
which had grown into the biggest party in the legislature by 2001.</P>
      <P>Yao said the incident opened a new chapter in the country's
political development because it demonstrated to the rulers that the
juggernaut of democracy cannot be stopped even by martial law.</P>
      <P>Politicians will win the support of the people as long as they
speak their minds, Yao said, urging today's politicians to draw
lessons from the Formosa Incident.</P>
      <P>Shih Ming-teh, another victim of the incident who is running as
an independent in Saturday's legislative elections, said he would not
boast about his suffering in the incident to win sympathy votes.</P>
      <P>Some people may try to turn their status as former political
prisoners into political assets in the elections, "but I don't want
to debase myself by appealing to voters for support by stressing my
role in that incident," he said.</P>
      <P>However, he disagreed with President Chen Shui-bian's claims that
the victims of the Formosa Incident were not the 61 political
dissents who organized the demonstration but the 23 million Taiwan
people who were ruled under martial law at the time, describing it as
campaign rhetoric aimed to woo the voters by distorting the facts.</P>
      <P>Instead of suffering from the incident, Shih said, Chen, who
served as an attorney for the victims during their trial before a
court-martial, benefited from it.</P>
      <P>The trial earned Chen a reputation as a human rights activist and
laid the groundwork for his political career, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Once a chairman of the DPP, Shih left that party after falling
out with other party leaders, and has since wandered in the political
wilderness.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's information technology industry
should consider investing in India due to various advantages the
South Asian nation has, officials of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>India has been listed as one of the world's four big recently

and Brazil, with an annual economic growth of 8.2 percent posted in
2003, the officials said.</P>

the software sector, which exported goods worth US$12 billion in
2003, four times over the figure registered in 1999.</P>
      <P>India's National Association of Software and Service Companies

for 2008, they went on.</P>
      <P>India's booming IT industry, coupled with its strong ability in

be a good son; when out in the world, a good citizen. He should be
circumspect and truthful. He should be in sympathy with all men, but
intimate with men of moral character. If he has time and opportunity
to spare, after the performance of those duties, he should then
employ them in literary pursuits."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Straits
Times:Mandarin popular among the young.

A new survey has thrown up what to some is
a surprise finding: Mandarin is alive and well 
- at home, at play and in school.

Almost four out of five Chinese Singaporeans
in the 17 to 39 age group felt they could
understand and speak Mandarin either 'well' or
'very well'.

More than three in five felt they had no
problems reading Chinese. Only in the ability 
to write Chinese was the proportion lower, at 52
per cent.

More than half were more fluent in
Mandarin than in English, and more than half used
it to speak with their spouses and children. Only
at the workplace is English usage more dominant -
59 per cent compared to Mandarin's 35 per cent.

These findings emerged from a Singapore
Press Holdings (SPH) survey of 363 Chinese
Singaporeans in the post-1965 generation,
conducted in November ahead of the Dec 13
celebration of the Speak Mandarin Campaign's
25th anniversary.

President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo yesterday ordered
the National Disaster Coordinating Council to
intensify search and rescue operations in a
landslide-stricken area in Real, Quezon after military
and volunteers extricated four survivors - including a
three-year-old girl - from a building that collapsed
under a huge pile of mud at the height of tropical

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Miners pull out 4
buried under ruins 
REAL, Quezon -- When miner Luis Balungay heard a
faint call for help yesterday, he was convinced that
it was coming from under the pile of rubble. Just
minutes later, Balungay and others were lifting out
four survivors from the ruins of Repador building,
which collapsed amid the onslaught of tropical storm
"Winnie".

The Philippine Star: Four survive for 10 days under

Rescuers are frantically digging for more survivors

    <HEADLINE>THICK FOG DELAYS CROSS-STRAIT EMERGENCY TRANSPORT OF PREMATURE INFANT</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The emergency cross-strait transport of the
premature baby of a Taiwan businessman and his mainland wife
scheduled to take place Thursday night has been delayed due to thick
fog, sources from Shanghai said Friday.</P>
      <P>Thick fog has caused the closure of the freeway connecting
Shanghai and Wenzhou since Thursday evening, forcing the planned
emergency transport of "Little Angel An-an" -- the seven-month old
daughter of Taiwan computer businessman Chen Chao-fu and his Hangzhou
wife -- from Shanghai to Xiamen to be postponed.</P>
      <P>All relevant agencies and staff, including paramedics and
hospital and sea-air-land transportation personnel, have been on hold
because of the fog.</P>
      <P>"Little Angel An-an," as she is called by doctors at the Shanghai
Pediatrics Hospital, was originally scheduled to be carried Thursday
night by ambulance 1,200 kilometers to the southern Chinese port city
of Xiamen, where the baby, who is in critical condition, and
paramedics were to board a ship bound for Kinmen before being
helicoptered from Kinmen to the Veterans General Hospital in
Taichung, central Taiwan. The whole trip was to take about 22 hours.</P>
      <P>"An-an," who only weighed 900 grams upon birth, has been staying
in an intensive care unit for infants for the last four months on a
respirator. Currently, she weighs around 2.3 kilograms.</P>
      <P>Chen Chao-fu, the baby's father who is a project manager with a
Taiwan computer company on the mainland, met Yu Xiaoqing, a woman
from Hangzhou, last year and got married soon afterwards. On May 1
this year, Yu gave birth to "An-an" just 28 weeks into the pregnancy.
"An-an" has since suffered various lung malfunctions due to
underdevelopment.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he and his wife cannot afford the huge costs of
medical treatment in Shanghai and therefore have decided to take the
infant back to Taiwan where he enjoys national health insurance
coverage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN JOINS GET-OUT-VOTE DRIVE</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan and other top KMT officials on Friday joined the
get-out-the-vote drive on the last day before Saturday's legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Lien and KMT Vice Chairmen Chiang Ping-kun and Wu Poh-hsiung
made the calls at the KMT branch in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Lien also canvassed voters by phone for KMT candidates, saying
this was the first time that he has engaged in this form of
canvassing.</P>
      <P>Lien would not predict the outcome of the election, saying only
that he is "cautiously optimistic" about the chances of the "pan-blue
alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party.</P>
      <P>Lin Fong-cheng, DPP secretary-general, estimated that 108
candidates from the "pan-blue alliance" will be elected to the
225-seat Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lien also expressed the hope that President Chen Shui-bian would
give serious consideration to his recommendation the previous day
that Chiang Ping-kun, also vice speaker of the legislature and an
economic expert and, serve as the premier if the "pan-blue alliance"
wins a majority in the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, who has the sole right as ROC president
to appoint the premier according to the Constitution, dismissed the
idea upon hearing it, saying that "there are a lot of talented people
from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, and there will be no
vacancy for Chiang."</P>
      <P>Chiang also said Friday that if the president can accept Lien's
proposal, it will show "his magnanimity."</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that Lien only recommended him after seeing Taiwan
being marginalized internationally as well as witnessing the
hollowing out of the island's industry and the polarization of Taiwan
society.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus also said that democracy and the
economy in Taiwan have made no progress during the more than four
years of DPP administration. If the "pan-blue alliance" can command a
majority in the legislature, President Chen should respect public
opinion and consider Chiang, a former chairman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development, because of his expertise and
capability.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) on Friday condemned terrorism
after a pickup truck loaded with canisters of liquefied natural gas
exploded in a fireball in Taipei Thursday, calling it "a move of
cowardice."</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, DPP party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said
that the people should express their political views in rational ways
and that planting bombs in public places is a cowardly attack on
democracy.</P>
      <P>The explosion took place near the Taipei Railway Station. As the
truck's license plate was missing and the gas valves on the canisters
were all open, police suspect it was a plot to cause chaos.
Fortunately, no one was hurt in the incident.</P>
      <P>Several local television stations received warnings Thursday that
explosives had been planted around the Taipei Railway Station with
anti-Taiwan independence slogans sticking to them. Police checked the
station complex and only found four fake explosive devices.</P>
      <P>James Soong, chairman of the opposition People First Party, also
condemned the act, saying that he disdains all forms of violence,
particularly violence in the run-up to elections which could affect
the results of the elections.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) said that bomb terrorism and any other form of violence is
poison to the development of democracy.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus also called for the ruling DPP to engage in
soul-searching about whether it has caused social and ethnic
divisions as well as hatred between the ruling and the opposition

    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Vice Chairman
Chang Chao-hsiung predicted Friday that his party will win at least
32 to 34 seats and could grab up to 41 seats in Saturday's
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, Chang said the number is slightly
lower than the 44 seats enjoyed by the PFP at present mainly because
the party has nominated less candidates than it did during the last
elections in order to meet the quota set by itself and its ally, the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>Also, while supporters of the "pan-blue alliance" tended to vote
for PFP candidates in the last legislative elections because PFP
Chairman James Soong had won more votes than KMT Chairman Lien Chan
in the 2000 presidential election, "pan-blue" supporters will be
inclined to vote for KMT candidates this time around because Soong
was Lien's running mate in the 2004 presidential race, Chang said.</P>
      <P>On the voter allocation strategy adopted by the "pan-blue
alliance, " Chang said it is difficult to tell what effect the
strategy will have as only an estimated 20 percent to 30 percent of
the voters are expected to comply with the policy.</P>
      <P>However, Chang expressed optimism about how the PFP will perform
in the elections, saying the nomination strategy of the party has
been successful compared with those of other parties.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that the "pan-green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union has
nominated an excessive number of candidates, and the KMT is also
fielding too many candidates after including some New Party
politicians who are running under the KMT's banner.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Union will not necessarily
lift its arms embargo against China in the first half of next year,
Taiwan's representative to France said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiou Jong-nan, who has returned to Taiwan for consultations,
made the remarks one day after Michel Lu, a spokesman of the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs, said that the ministry would not rule out the
possibility that the E.U. will lift its 15-year ban on arms sales to
China.</P>
      <P>Chiou said China's aspiration that the ban can be lifted by June
next year "will not be easy" to achieve.</P>
      <P>Chiou noted that it was French President Jacques Chirac who first
broached the idea of lifting the ban but that this is not only an
issue between France and China. Noting that the European Union makes
decisions based on consensus, Chiou said that currently, the Central
and East European members, and other members who uphold the ideals
of freedom and human rights are not in favor of lifting the ban.</P>
      <P>He also said that since France proposed the lifting of the ban,
his representative office has exhausted every channel to let France
know Taiwan's stance on the issue, adding that the French side has
also conveyed its concerns and position to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan tried to let Paris know that the human rights situation in
mainland China has yet to improve and that if the E.U. were to lift
its arms embargo now, it would send a message that the E.U. would
approve of China using force against Taiwan under certain
circumstances, which he said would definitely affect security in the
Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>France also explained that the lifting of the arms embargo ban
will be a political decision based on its global strategic
considerations and is part of a long-term goal to establish a
strategic partnership relation with China.</P>
      <P>The E.U. imposed the ban on arms sales to China over human rights
concerns shortly after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.</P>

      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
will only consider merging with the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) after
the KMT resolves the problem of its ill-gotten assets and reaches a
consensus with the PFP on cross-Taiwan Strait policy, PFP Vice

      <P>Chang made the remarks at a news conference held on the eve of
the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Chang said the assets are a liability for the KMT and that the
PFP will be accused of merging with the KMT for a share of the assets
unless the problem is settled.</P>
      <P>On cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Chang said the PFP favors
maintaining the status quo and has "no other option."</P>
      <P>However, he claimed that some politicians within the KMT, such as
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Legislator Apollo Chen,
have advocated that "independence for Taiwan can be an option."</P>
      <P>A merger will thus be impossible until both parties have come to

    <DATELINE>(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P> Taipei, Dec. 10 (CAN) Taiwan's representative to Malaysia
expressed worry Friday about the recent signing of a free trade
agreement (FTA) between mainland China and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</P>
      <P>Wu Wen-ya made the remarks when he attended a tea party given by
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>The mainland and ASEAN signed the FTA last week in Laos, with the
aim of creating the world's largest free trade area -- a sprawling
market of 1.8 billion people -- by 2010.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, the two sides have set a
timetable for lowering tariffs from next July, with tariffs on 7,000
items to be cut to between zero and 0.5 percent by 2010.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that bilateral trade between the mainland and Malaysia
has far surpassed that between Taiwan and Malaysia, and the
completion of the FTA will inevitably squeeze Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that exchanges between Malaysia and the mainland have
been brisk and that Malaysia has great expectations for the vast
mainland market. Two-way trade between Taiwan and Malaysia last year
amounted to just US$7.8 billion, compared with mainland-Malaysia
trade at US$20.1 billion.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the government is currently conducting a feasibility
study on signing an FTA with Malaysia, but he admitted that progress
has been limited.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that the
government is fully prepared to maintain order in Saturday's
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Yu urged political parties and their candidates to be rational on
the last day before the poll and to respect the decisions of the
voters after the results of the elections are out, according to
Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai.</P>
      <P>Yu ordered the police to step up security at polling stations
around the island and to take action against any social disorder.</P>
      <P>He also instructed the Ministry of Justice to continue its
efforts to crack down on vote buying, especially on the eve of
polling day, when vote-buying is at its most prevalent.</P>
      <P>The authorities must also be on the lookout for the new
vote-buying method, in which voters are paid after the elections, Yu
said.</P>
      <P>He also instructed the Central Election Commission (CEC) to
handle the technical matters of the elections properly to ensure the
results are produced rapidly and accurately.</P>
      <P>The polls will open at 8 a.m. and close at 4 p.m. and CEC Deputy
Secretary-General Teng Tien-yu reminded voters to bring their
identification cards, personal seals and voting notifications.</P>
      <P>Voters will be forbidden from taking mobile phones or cameras
into the polling stations and offenders will be subject to
imprisonment of up to one year, community service or a fine of up to
NT$30,000 (US$926), Teng said.</P>
      <P>He urged voters to mark their choices in the designated space on
the ballots, although a vote will also be counted as valid if it is

    <HEADLINE>PROSECUTORS' CRACKDOWN ON DPP CANDIDATE TERMED 'MEDIA EVENT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) lashed out Friday at two prosecutors in Taitung, eastern Taiwan
for searching the campaign headquarters of DPP legislative candidate
Chen Ying and the Taipei office of Chen Ying's father for evidence of
vote-buying.</P>
      <P>DPP Vice Chairman Lee Ying-yuan claimed that prosecutors Yang
Ta-chih and Chiang Wen-chun's order to search Chen Ying's
headquarters and the office of her father, Chen Chien-nian, chairman
of the head of the Cabinet-level Council of Aboriginal Affairs, was
an act designed and executed as a media event.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the search, which he claimed was politically
motivated, was controversial as the media were there even before the
search was begun.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chien-nian again defended the legitimacy of his
daughter Chen Ying's running for a legislative seat.</P>
      <P>Denying categorically that he is using "public resources" to
broaden a support base for his daughter, Chen pointed out that his
daughter has legitimately registered with the Central Election
Commission for the legislative elections in accordance with the
country's laws.</P>
      <P>Describing Yang and Chiang as "deep orange" -- meaning they are
stalwarts for the opposition People First Party -- Chen Chien-nian
said the search, within 72 hours of the legislative elections, was
politically motivated and meant to alter the outcome of the
elections.</P>
      <P>"Yang and Chiang will be to blame if my daughter is not elected,
"Chen claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed ridicule as to why other candidates in Taitung,
who have also offered sports jackets to supporters in return for
their support, were not attacked by prosecutors Yang and Chiang, who
are husband and wife.</P>
      <P>Two days ago, PFP party whip Liu Wen-hsiung claimed that it is
unfair that Chen Ying is "enjoying all the Council of Aboriginal
Affairs' resources" in her bid to win a seat at the Legislative Yuan
simply because she is the daughter of Chen Chien-nian.</P>
      <P>What is even more outrageous, he said, is that Chen Ying has not
even lived in Taiwan longer than four months over the past three
years.</P>
      <P>He poured further ridicule on Chen Ying, saying that the
aboriginal voters do not need a lawmaker representing them who cannot
speak any of their languages and who has only lived in Taiwan for a
few months since the presidential election earlier this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VOWS TO PUSH FOR PASSAGE OF 10 MAJOR BILLS AFTER ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reaffirmed his
determination Friday to push for the passage of 10 major legislative
bills, including a special statute paving the way for a crucial arms
procurement package, after the weekend legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Chen made the reaffirmation while meeting with U.S. Congressmen
Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) , a co-chairman of the pro-Taiwan U.S.
Congressional Taiwan Caucus who arrived in Taipei Thursday for a
four-day visit to observe the elections.</P>
      <P>The president said he believes that the "pan-green camp" of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally -- the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) -- will be able to win a clear majority in the
new Legislative Yuan to be elected Saturday.</P>
      <P>With a working majority in the legislature, Chen went on, his
administration will go all-out to have 10 long-stalled bills clear
the legislative floor to kick-start his critical political and
financial reform programs that have so far been stymied by the
intransigence of the opposition.</P>
      <P>Among the bills will be a special statute authorizing the
government to use a special budget to procure advanced weapons from
the United States worth an estimated NT$610.8 billion, Chen said. The
arms to be purchased include eight diesel-electric submarines, a
squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six PAC-III Patriot
anti-missile batteries.</P>
      <P>Also high on the agenda are a bill on the creation of a financial
reconstruction fund, revisions to the existing Judicial Yuan and
Executive Yuan organizational laws, amendments to the securities
transaction law and the real-estate security law, as well as
revisions to the land value increment law to halve the increment tax
rates.</P>
      <P>So long as the "pan-green camp" wins a legislative majority, Chen
said his administration will organize a cross-party commission to
work for a thaw in the long-deadlocked cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chen assured Chabot that his administration will pull out all the
stops to forge contact with the mainland and pursue permanent
cross-strait peace and Asia-Pacific regional security and stability
through dialogue and consultations.</P>
      <P>During their talks, Chen also said he admires U.S. President
George W. Bush for managing to win re-election and enjoy a
comfortable majority in both the House of Representatives and Senate.</P>
      <P>Due to a lack of a legislative majority, Chen's administration
has faced enormous difficulties implementing many of its policy
initiatives since Chen assumed presidency in May 2000.</P>
      <P>Chen said his re-election in March this year will be rendered
meaningless if the "pan-green camp" fails to win a working majority
in Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"We need a working majority in the legislature to implement our
reform agenda and realize my campaign promises to our people, " Chen
said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen said
Friday he is unaware of whether the government will send two
officials from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to the
United States after Saturday's legislative elections to communicate
with Washington over a proposal to change the names of overseas
missions and state-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister was referring to reports that Tsai Ing-wen,
a former Mainland Affairs Council chairwoman and a shoo-in at-large
legislator from the DPP, and Lee Ying-yuan, deputy DPP
secretary-general, will make the trip.</P>
      <P>"The ministry has not heard that Tsai or Lee will travel to the
U.S. to communicate on the name-change issue, and the ministry
also has no plans to send Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Kau Ying-mao
to the U.S. over the matter," he said.</P>
      <P>He said that the government will send a delegation to attend the
inauguration ceremony of U.S. President George W. Bush, but claimed
to have "no idea" about whether there will be a communication on the
name-change proposals.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan and the United States have various channels
available to them for communication and said any communications on
name-change proposals would not necessarily have to be carried out by
his ministry.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian proposed Sunday changing the names of
overseas missions and state-owned enterprises to include the word
"Taiwan" within two years to highlight national identity and avoid
confusion with mainland China.</P>
      <P>But deputy U.S. State Department spokesman Adam Ereli responded
the following day that Washington will not support the proposal as it
appears to be a unilateral change of Taiwan's status.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that in view of the new legislature that will be
formed after Saturday's elections, the United States will be keen to
learn about the latest situation and the government's promotion of
related policies.</P>
      <P>He noted that there are differences between Taiwan and the United
States on certain issues, and said that although Washington may not
be supportive to begin with, it will not necessarily continue to be
unsupportive after communications.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should stick to its determination to
change the names of its overseas missions in non-allied countries and
such efforts should not be daunted even in the face of mounting U.S.
pressure, senior presidential advisor Koo Kuan-min said Friday.</P>
      <P>"Only by opening the door wide can Taiwan walk on a wide path, "
Koo said, adding that Taiwan should make more efforts to give
Washington a better understanding of the "truth and reality" within
Taiwan so that the U.S. attitude toward Taiwan will change.</P>
      <P>Koo, who placed advertisements in the Washington Post and the New
York Times at his own expense in early October to urge the U.S.
government to reassess its "one China" policy, told CNA that he will
probably take out another ad in major U.S. dailies prior to President
George W. Bush's inauguration for second term, to optimize Taiwan's
name-change plans.</P>
      <P>Koo took out 2,000-word, full-page advertisements in both the
Washington Post and the New York Times Oct. 6 urging the U.S.
government to face the reality concerning Taiwan and rethink its "one
China" policy, which Koo claims has only benefited the communist
totalitarian regime in mainland China.</P>
      <P>In the ad, titled "U.S. Adherence to One China Policy Only
Benefits Communist Dictators: Let Taiwan Speak Out for Lasting Peace,
" Koo said America's "one China" policy based on the 1972 Shanghai
Communique no longer fits the political reality in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Koo said he hopes the U.S. government can reassess its "one
China" policy in light of Taiwan's new mainstream public opinion and
its new political reality.</P>
      <P>Koo said that the "one China" policy is already outdated and that
many practices in Washington today are making people question whether
the United States has deviated from its founding principles.</P>
      <P>As to the controversy regarding Taiwan's establishing formal
diplomatic relations with the Pacific island country of Vanuatu, Koo
said that although "one more" is welcomed, it should be no big deal

      <P>He also claimed that President Chen Shui-bian has used the shadow
of his March 19 election-eve shooting to make him the major character
of the legislative elections, targeting himself and PFP Chairman
James Soong, even though they have not taken part in the elections,
with personal attacks that have made the election campaign "lose
focus."</P>
      <P>He further claimed that the president and his Democratic
Progressive Party "could not come up with any new initiatives" and
can pander to its ally, the pro-independence Taiwan solidarity Union,
to try to solicit ballots from TSU voters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT legislative caucus claimed that only if the
"pan-blue alliance" commands a majority in the legislature will it be
able to effectively check the government and prevent it from
corruption.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-fu, KMT whip at the legislature, was responding to
earlier remarks by the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party claiming that if the "pan-blue alliance" gains the
majority, it will result in paralysis of the legislature, financial
bankruptcy, mainland China reaping the benefits, disappointment for
local enterprises, and Taiwan going under.</P>
      <P>Huang dismissed the DPP's remarks as showing a "lack of common
sense."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A conference on international maritime law
and Taiwan's fishery development opened Friday in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The event was attended by nearly 100 experts in international
maritime law from Taiwan, the United States, Russia, Japan and South
Korea.</P>
      <P>Giving a speech at the conference, Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh
pointed out that Taiwan has been isolated internationally and is not
a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,
yet despite this, the country has abided by the rules set down in the
convention.</P>
      <P>With the world's second-largest hauls of tuna and squid, Taiwan
ranked among the top six high-sea fishing countries in the world last
year, Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Kaohsiung City has transformed from a small fishing
port more than 100 years ago to become a major international
container port in the world today, and the city government is also
working to develop the city into a maritime capital.</P>
      <P>He said the city government will try to attract international
corporations to set up operations and research and development
headquarters in the port city.</P>
      <P>With the Kaohsiung Freeport set to start operation next year, the
city government is also promoting law amendments to make export
processing zones part of the freeport, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT OFFERS FIVE PROMISES ON EVE OF LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  10  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian went into
overdrive Friday on the eve of the legislative elections to campaign
for ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidates, pledging to
realize five promises during the rest of his term in office.</P>
      <P>If the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) , manages to win a majority in the new
Legislative Yuan to be elected Saturday, Chen said his administration
will give priority to the passage of 10 long-stalled bills in the
first session of the new legislature.</P>
      <P>With a "pan-green camp"-controlled legislature, Chen said he will
also faithfully deliver on five promises in the coming three-plus
years left in his term.</P>
      <P>"I'll fulfill my duty as a president of 'all the people,' actively
promote cross-party cooperation and strengthen partnership between
central and local governments, write a new constitution for Taiwan,
streamline the administration and form a cross-party commission to
work for peaceful development on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, "
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks during a campaign rally in front
of the world's tallest skyscraper, Taipei 101, to drum up support
for DPP legislative candidates running in the two Taipei City
constituencies where the opposition "pan-blue alliance" has
traditionally had an edge.</P>
      <P>The DPP headquarters especially chose Taipei 101 as the rally
venue to signify its ambition to win 101 seats in the weekend
elections so that the "pan-green camp" can easily secure a working
majority in the 225-seat legislature. The TSU is expected to capture
at least 20 seats. During the rally, 101 colorful balloons were
released to symbolize the DPP's electoral target.</P>
      <P>Chen said the upcoming elections are crucial as they offer a good
opportunity to end more than four years of "war of attrition," mainly
resulting from the antagonism of the "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang and the People First Party, which controls a slim majority
in the present legislature.</P>
      <P>So long as the "pan-green camp" garners a working majority in the
new legislature, Chen said his administration will go all-out to have
the 10 major bills clear the legislative floor to kick-start various
political and financial reform programs that have so far been stymied
by the intransigence of the opposition.</P>
      <P>Among the bills is a special statute authorizing the government
to use a special budget to procure advanced weapons from the United
States worth an estimated NT$610.8 billion, Chen said. The arms to be
purchased include eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12
P-3C anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC-III anti-missile
batteries.</P>
      <P>Also high on the agenda are bills on the creation of a financial
reconstruction fund, revisions to the existing Judicial Yuan and
Executive Yuan organizational laws, amendments to the securities
transaction law and the real-estate securitization law, as well as
revisions to the land value increment law to halve current rates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHIEFS OF ROC OVERSEAS MISSIONS FULLY SUPPORT 'NAME-CHANGE' PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chiefs of eight Republic of China overseas
missions who returned to Taiwan earlier this week for consultations,
unanimously approved the government's "name-change" policy on Friday.</P>
      <P>For the sake of clearly distinguishing the ROC from the People's
Republic of China and underscoring Taiwan's separate identity, the
eight overseas mission chiefs said the government's plan to rectify
the name of the nation's representative offices in non-diplomatically
allied countries by including the word "Taiwan" to clearly
distinguish them from those of the PRC is "absolutely correct."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a tea party with local journalists organized by the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chiou Jong-nan, representative to
France, said he fully supports the "name-change" plan.</P>
      <P>Chiou said the "rectifying the name" drive involves negotiations
with host countries of the nation's overseas representative offices.
Taking the ROC representative office as an example, Chiou said that
it is now designated as the "Bureau de Representation de Taipei en
France (the Taipei Representative Office in France) ." Chiou said the
designation was a hard-won result of lengthy negotiations with French
authorities between 1994 and 1995.</P>
      <P>Chiou admitted that the French government has so far not made any
response to his office's request to change the designation to include
the word "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"Whether we can succeed will hinge on the timing of negotiations
and the overall relations between our two countries," Chiou said.</P>
      <P>At present, Chiou said although the designation engraved on the
office's nameplate has not changed, the reference "Taiwan" is
commonly used in day-to-day operations, including telephone
recordings and conversations.</P>
      <P>Henry Chen, representative to Ireland, echoed Chiou's views,
saying that all overseas missions are obligated to highlight their
"Taiwan" identity in engagements with host countries and members of
diplomatic corps in those countries. Chen said all ROC overseas
missions chiefs should identify themselves as "ambassadors from
Taiwan" to defend national sovereignty and dignity as well as to
distinguish themselves from their counterparts from the PRC.</P>
      <P>While endorsing the government's "name-change" policy, Chen said
negotiations with host countries should adopt a pragmatic strategy.</P>
      <P>Matthew S. M. Lee, director of the representative office in San
Francisco, said domestic political developments have often caused
squabbling among overseas Taiwan expatriates. Supporters of the
"pan-green camp" have different views from the pro-"pan-blue
alliance" expatriates in the San Francisco region, Lee said. If
possible, Lee said, most expatriates there prefer to use the nation's
full official title; otherwise, they would like to see the use of
"Taiwan, " he explained. Green is the political color of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, while blue is the color of the
opposition Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Other mission chiefs present at the tea party were Wang
Shih-rong, representative to Switzerland; Wu Wen-ya, representative
to Malaysia; Joseph Ting Shih, representative to New Zealand; Liu
Jiunn-man, director of the representative office in Munich; Hwang
Ju-hou, director of the representative office in Fukuoka, Japan.</P>

      <P>Visiting Republic of China Minister of
Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh met with Deputy U.S. Trade
Representative Josette Sheeran Shiner Thursday to discuss matters of
mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Ho, who arrived in Washington, D.C. Wednesday to lobbying support
for the signing of Taiwan-U.S. free trade agreement (FTA) , said her
meeting with Shiner marked a good start for Taiwan's FTA drive.</P>
      <P>Ho said the government has listed FTA negotiations with major
trading partners as a priority task and that the United States has
been a primary target.</P>
      <P>"It will require enormous efforts to realize the goal of striking
an FTA deal with the United States. I hope we can speed up
preparatory work," Ho said, adding that her current visit is aimed at
holding direct dialogue with U.S. officials, academics and business
executives to solicit their opinions about the FTA issue.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Ho paid a visit to Sen. Max Baucus, who
concurrently serves as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to
seek his support for the signing of a Taiwan-U.S. free trade pact. Ho
quoted Baucus as having said he is very supportive of signing such an
agreement with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During her stay, Ho will also attend a seminar to be organized by
the Institute for International Economics, a noted U.S. think tank,
and deliver a speech to American business executives at the
invitation of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council which groups U.S.
companies with interests in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This is Ho's first visit to the U.S. capital since she assumed

      <P>Taiwan is resolute in its pursuit of peace
with mainland China, Joseph Jaushieh Wu, chairman of the Mainland
Affairs Council said Friday.</P>
      <P>In a meeting with visiting US Representative Steve Chabot from
Ohio, who is also the co-chairman of the Congressional Taiwan Caucus,
Wu predicted that the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) will
win a majority in Saturday's legislative elections and the
government's special budget for arms purchases from the United States
will then clear the new legislature controlled by the DPP.</P>
      <P>Wu told Chabot that President Chen Shui-bian's plan to change the
names of the country's overseas missions and state-run enterprises
was meant to distinguish Taiwan from China rather than disrupt the
status quo across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>It is China which imposes on Taiwan its territorial claims and
threatens to absorb Taiwan with force, posing a risk to the status
quo across the Strait, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Chabot arrived in Taiwan Thursday night for a private visit and

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu defended the
government's plan to rectify the name of Taiwan's state-owned
enterprises Friday, saying it is aimed at averting confusion and
misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks while meeting with U.S. Congressman Steve
Chabot (R-Ohio), the co-chairman of the pro-Taiwan U.S. Congressional
Taiwan Caucus, who arrived in Taipei Thursday for a three-day visit.</P>
      <P>During this era of globalization, Lu said, corporate names are
very important. Some of Taiwan's state-controlled enterprises still
bear the words "China" or "Chinese" in their designations, such as
the Chinese Petroleum Corp. and the China Shipbuilding Corp.</P>
      <P>"It is very likely that those companies are mistaken as mainland
China's, " Lu said, adding that the ROC government's plan to rectify
the name of its state-owned companies is not politically motivated,
but rather aimed at avoiding confusion.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chabot said he supports Taiwan's "name-change"
plan. He further said Taiwan's future should be determined by its 23
million people, not anybody else. He also said Taiwan's democratic
achievements can serve as a model for other developing countries.
Chabot promised to continue helping promote Taiwan-U.S. relations and
cooperation in various fields.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday that
the right to name a premier to form the Cabinet lies with the
president, not the majority party in the Legislative Yuan under the
ROC Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chen was refuting opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan's claim a day earlier that if the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and the People First Party wins a clear majority in Saturday's
legislative elections, it should have the right to name a premier to
form a Cabinet on its own. Lien also said KMT Vice Chairman P.K.
Chiang, who is also the incumbent Legislative Yuan vice president,
should be the next premier.</P>
      <P>Chen ridiculed Lien as ignorant of the nation's constitutional
provisions. He stressed that it is the president who has the power to
name a premier.</P>
      <P>According to the ROC Constitution, Chen said the majority party
in the legislature can only initiate a no-confidence vote against a
premier named by the president. Moreover, he said, the president can
disband the legislature to pave the way for new elections if he does
not accept the result of the no-confidence vote.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan voters went to the polls Saturday to
elect the nation's sixth Legislative Yuan, which is scheduled to open
Feb. 1, 2005.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and his wife Wu Shu-jen were all smiles
when they cast their ballots at a polling station at Mintsu
Elementary School in the Taipei City's north constituency where their
legal abode is located.</P>
      <P>Chen was accompanied to the polling station by Presidential
Office Deputy Secretary-General Cho Jung-tai, Minister of the
Interior Su Jia-chyuan and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Chen said after casting his ballot that the bright sunshine on
election day is a good omen for the campaign for "a new Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"This is a historic day. I believe that the people of Taiwan will
use their democratic vote to change Taiwan's history. I also believe
that the people of Taiwan will pursue love, peace, unity and
stability through the democratic vote," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president saluted all election and security staff for their
devoted services in carrying out election work and maintaining order.</P>
      <P>In his brief speech, Chen also urged all eligible voters to go to
the polls to elect the nation's lawmakers. "Don't forget to cast your
ballots. Your votes will make a difference," he said.</P>
      <P>A total of 13,930 polling stations have been set up around the
country for the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun and his wife returned to their hometown in
Ilan County early in the morning to cast their ballots.</P>

camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its ally
-- the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- can win a clear majority in the
elections to facilitate implementation of many reform programs.</P>
      <P>"More than 200 critical bills related to the livelihood of the
people are still stalled in the opposition-controlled legislature. If
the 'pan-green camp' can control a majority in the new legislature,
those bills will clear the legislative floor quickly and the DPP
administration will be able to speed up many construction and reform
projects," Yu said.</P>
      <P>A total of 225 legisaltive seats are up for grabs, with the
number of eligible voters reaching 16,559,254, according an

    <HEADLINE>MOFA AWARE OF GRENADIAN PM'S MAINLAND CHINA TOUR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is
well aware of a planned visit to mainland China by the prime minister
of Grenada, a longterm ally of the Republic of China, a MOFA
spokesman said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In reply to a journalist's question on a foreign wire service
news report that said Prime Minister Keith Mitchell was leaving
Friday on a visit to the mainland, Michel Lu said the MOFA is aware
that Mitchell has been in contact with Beijing authorities for more
than a year.</P>
      <P>Although the Grenadian government has announced that Mitchell's
plan to visit Beijing is aimed at seeking funds for hurricane relief
and economic development, the MOFA believes the information was
leaked deliberately by Beijing to affect Taiwan's legislative
elections on the eve of Saturday's voting, Lu said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that no matter in what ways Beijing tries to persuade
Mitchell to engage in private talks with them, the MOFA will never
play the game of "dollar diplomacy" with the mainland Chinese
authorities to win votes at the United Nations.</P>
      <P>The ROC forged diplomatic relations with the Caribbean country in
1989 and has won the latter's long-standing support for Taiwan's bid
to join the U.N.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen visited Grenada in
mid-September after Hurricane Ivan swept through the island state
causing the worst damage and losses in nearly 100 years.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Chen presented US$200,000-worth of food relief
to the Grenadian government and met with Mitchell to discuss
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>According to the foreign report, a spokeswoman for Mitchell said
the prime minister, accompanied by the foreign minister and business
leaders, will spend the weekend in London before heading to Beijing.
She noted that the trip will focus on Grenada's reconstruction needs
in the wake of Hurricane Ivan, as well as agricultural aid, job
creation and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Lu said that his ministry is in control of the situation and has
been keeping contact with the Grenadian government through every
possible channel.</P>

Supermarkets sparked a Christmas petrol price war yesterday by
cutting more than 3p off a litre of fuel. Fuel costs for motorists

reduce the price of a litre of petrol to 79.9p. Diesel is down to

Financial Times: Retirement age to stay at 65 for five years.

British employers will be able to force staff to retire at 65
following an emphatic victory by business groups over trade union and

implementation of a European Union directive tackling discrimination.
The decision - due to be announced shortly by Patricia Hewitt, UK
trade and industry secretary - is certain to be highly contentious.
It comes after months of wrangling over the issue both within and
outside the government, exposing a fundamental policy divide over how

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TRYING TO INFLUENCE TAIWAN ELECTIONS THROUGH VOHOR'S OUSTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  11 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
claimed Saturday that mainland China is trying to influence Taiwan's
legislative elections by jeopardizing the newly established
diplomatic ties between Taiwan and Vanuatu.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after Vanuatu's parliament held a
no-confidence vote Friday, the eve of Taiwan's Dec. 11 legislative
elections, against Primer Minister Serge Vohor due to allegations of
corruption and his decision to establish diplomatic relations with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Vohor and Chen signed a joint communique in Taipei Nov. 3 for the
establishment of diplomatic ties, making Vanuatu the 27th diplomatic
ally of Taiwan. Vanuatu still maintains diplomatic ties with the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that the mainland's manipulation can be seen in
Vohor's ouster, which he said was aimed at influencing Taiwan's
legislative elections. He urged the voters to understand the fact
that Beijing is using money diplomacy to ruin Taiwan-Vanuatu
diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Michel Lu, Vanuatu's
parliament launched a no-confidence vote to oust Vohor Friday and
elected Ham Lini and Sato Kilmam as prime minister and deputy prime
minister, respectively, to form a new government.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's diplomatic personnel stationed in Vanuatu are
still making efforts to communicate with officials of the new
government in a bid to retain the diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>As long as the Vanuatu Cabinet has not made a decision to
maintain or annul Vanuatu-Taiwan diplomatic relations, Taiwanese
diplomats will try their best to convince the South Pacific nation's
new government that the establishment of diplomatic ties with Taiwan
will be of great interest to Vanuatu, Lu added.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that Vanuatu-Taiwan diplomatic ties will not be
affected by the transfer of governments in Vanuatu for the sake of
the South Pacific nation's sustainable development.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 10 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Republic of China Minister of
Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh urged the U.S. government Friday to
start negotiations with Taiwan as soon as possible for signing a
bilateral free trade agreement (FTA).</P>
      <P>Ho made the appeal in a speech delivered at a seminar on FTA
issues organized by the Institute for International Economics (IIE) ,
anoted U.S. think tank.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is the United States' eighth-largest trading
partner, Ho said Taiwan can be an ideal bridgehead for U.S. companies
seeking to tap into the booming Asian market.</P>
      <P>Since the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) signed
an FTA with mainland China last week, Ho said, the United States will
face challenges in further expanding its trade and investment in
Asia.</P>
      <P>Ho said the Bush administration should start FTA negotiations
with Taiwan as soon as possible for the two countries' mutual
benefit.</P>
      <P>If the United States were to sign an FTA with Taiwan, Ho said,
Taiwan would be able to offer U.S. banking and financial service
companies very good opportunities to expand their Asian market
penetration.</P>
      <P>Ho said the ROC government has listed FTA negotiations with major
trading partners as a priority task and that the United States is a
primary target.</P>
      <P>"We believe that an FTA deal with the United States will help
encourage other countries to follow suit, " Ho said, adding that she
is fully aware that it will require enormous efforts to realize the
goal of striking an FTA deal with the United States.</P>
      <P>Nicholas R. Lardy, an IIE senior researcher, echoed Ho's view,
saying that Taiwan would be able to achieve a breakthrough in its FTA
bids if it managed to sign an FTA with the United States.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been absent from ASEAN's "ASEAN plus One" and "ASEAN
plus Three" FTA talks with major East Asian countries, including
China, Japan and South Korea, mainly because of Beijing's opposition,
Nicholas said.</P>
      <P>The mainland has warned other countries against signing FTAs with
Taiwan. As a result, Taiwan has so far only managed to ink one with
Panama.</P>
      <P>Ho told journalists after the seminar that her visit is aimed at
holding direct dialogue with U.S. officials, academics and business
executives to solicit their opinions about FTA-related issues.</P>
      <P>Ho, who arrived in Washington, D.C. Wednesday, met with Deputy
U.S. Trade Representative Josette Sheeran Shiner Thursday to discuss
matters of mutual concern. Ho said her meeting with Shiner marked a
good start for Taiwan's FTA drive.</P>
      <P>Also Thursday, Ho paid a visit to Sen. Max Baucus, who
concurrently serves as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, to
seek his support for the signing of a Taiwan-U.S. free trade pact. Ho
quoted Baucus as having said he is very supportive of the proposal.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday he

an end after the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in an interview with the Qatar-based

      <P>In the past few years, Ma said, the pervasive political culture

      <P>"I hope Saturday's elections can put an end to this phenomenon. I
hope our people will no longer feel compelled to take sides on major
political issues in their daily lives," Ma said.</P>
      <P>In addition to deciding whether the "pan-green camp" of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and its ally -- the Taiwan
solidarity Union -- or the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party will take control of the
Legislative Yuan for the next three years, Ma said, Saturday's
elections will also have an impact on the future development of
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The results of nearly all pre-election public opinion polls show
that the two rival camps have been running neck and neck and Ma noted
that the final victor will not be determined until after the end of
the vote count.</P>
      <P>Ma, a KMT vice chairman, said no matter whether the "pan-blue

should play a "loyal opposition" role and fulfill its

(By C.H. Lu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top mainland China policy
formulator has urged Beijing to resume stalled cross-Taiwan Strait
talks after Taiwan's legislative elections Saturday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, made the
remarks when he was interviewed by Ming Pao, a major Hong Kong daily.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that Taiwan has gone out of its way to look for issues
that have few political implications, such as charter flights during
the Chinese New Year holiday and cross-strait cargo charter flights,
so as to avoid the talks between the two sides of the strait from
breaking down yet again.</P>
      <P>"Once the issues with few political implications bear fruit, they
will lay the basis for future talks," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan has responded to requests by Beijing
on two-way cross-strait charter flights without rerouting via third
places during the Chinese New Year holiday, and the question now is
whether Beijing is willing to talk.</P>
      <P>Charter flights for Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland
were opened on a trial basis during the 2003 Chinese New Year
holiday, but it was only one-way and had to make stopovers in Hong
Kong or Macau. The service was disrupted for the 2004 holiday after
both sides failed to discuss Beijing's request for two-way service
without stopping over in third places.</P>
      <P>Wu said that past experience shows that as long as mainland China
is willing to negotiate, a lot of issues can be handled in a flexible
way. But if Beijing insists on accepting its "one China" concept as a
prerequisite, it will continue to be a big hurdle for such talks.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has observed since late last year that the mainland has no
intention to negotiate because the Beijing authorities are worried
about uncertainty following the recent presidential elections in the
United States, the Dec. 11 legislative elections in Taiwan, and the
change of guard in the mainland leadership.</P>
      <P>"Now that all three factors have passed, it will be a good
environment for both sides to resume talks, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>He also urged Hong Kong to set up a representative office in
Taiwan, saying that it would further cement Taiwan-Hong Kong
relations.</P>
      <P>He noted that Hong Kong's status changed after 1999, but "our
Hong Kong policy or attitude toward Hong Kong has not changed. We
continue to think Hong Kong is a very important place, especially
because Hong Kong may be able to play a role when both sides of the
Taiwan Strait still have no formal communication channel."</P>
      <P>He pointed out the close trade exchanges between the two places,
with Hong Kong as the second-largest export destination for Taiwan,
and its third-largest trading partner, with two-way trade surpassing
US$30 billion.</P>
      <P>"From the angle of mutual benefits, we hope that Hong Kong can
set up a representative office in Taiwan, " Wu said, adding that a
lot of Hong Kong residents study in Taiwan, conduct business or go
sightseeing there, and that if there was a representative office,
administrative efficiency would be higher and relations between
Taiwan and Hong Kong closer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING SABOTAGED VANUATU TIES TO INFLUENCE TAIWAN ELECTIONS: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Kau Ying-mao
accused mainland China Saturday of maneuvering the Vanuatu parliament
into voting Prime Minister Serge Vohor out of office ahead of
Taiwan's legislative elections in an attempt to sabotage ROC-Vanuatu
diplomatic ties and influence the results of the polls.</P>
      <P>Kau warned that the mainland's diplomatic isolation of Taiwan has
hurt the feeling of the Taiwanese people and will further alienate
relations between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The Vanuatu parliament passed a no-confidence vote on Vohor early
Saturday over his decision to establish diplomatic relations with the
Republic of China last month.</P>
      <P>The vote was called soon after Vanuatu's Court of Appeals ruled
Friday that parliament has the right to hold a no-confidence vote on
the prime minister.</P>
      <P>According to Kau, the Vanuatu parliament had initially planned to
meet Monday to consider the case, but the opposition, supposedly
under strong interference from Beijing, requested the court's
permission for the parliament to meet immediately.</P>
      <P>This enabled the parliament to open a session Friday night and
pass the vote at around 3 a.m. Saturday, just before the legislative
polls opened in Taiwan, Kau said.</P>
      <P>Kau said this is yet another "surprise" that the mainland has
given Taiwan after it wooed away Nauru in 2002 around the time of the
inaugural anniversary of President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Kau said he is deeply impressed by Vohor's firm support for the
diplomatic relations between ROC and Vanuatu and expressed regret
that he was forced to step down because of this.</P>
      <P>Although Vohor was in office for only six months, he had started
to push the Vanuatu government to switch recognition from Beijing to
Taipei 12 years ago, Kau pointed out.</P>
      <P>Kau said he is not optimistic about the subsequent development of
ROC-Vanuatu relations in light of the pro-Beijing background of new
Vanuatu Prime Minister Ham Lini.</P>
      <P>Vohor and ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen signed a
joint communique to establish diplomatic relations Nov. 3, making
Vanuatu the ROC's 27th ally.</P>
      <P>Beijing has continued to woo Vanuatu away from the ROC, and a
diplomatic tug-of-war across the Taiwan Strait is playing out in the
South Pacific island state.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's two major airlines saw their
revenues drop in November, with revenues of China Airlines (CAL)
falling 5 percent and those of EVA Airways dropping 2.4 percent
compared to the October figures, according to statistics released by
the two companies.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that CAL revenues in November reached NT$8.43
billion (US$260.4 million), while that of EVA Airways totaled NT$7.40
billion.</P>
      <P>On aggregate, the revenues of CAL in the first 11 months reached
NT$87.40 billion, with its forecast for the year's revenue standing
at NT$93.54 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the revenues of EVA Airways in the first 11 months
totaled NT$75.09 billion, a growth of 27.35 percent over the same
period of last year. The company has estimated that it will register
revenues of NT$76.77 billion for the whole year.</P>
      <P>As for their prospects for next year, an industry analyst noted
that an expected increase in interest rates and a recent aviation
agreement between mainland China and the United States that will see
the number of flights and carriers flying between the two countries
increase significantly in the future are expected to affect Taiwanese
airlines next year.</P>
      <P>Noting that JetStar Asia, an airline based in Singapore, will
begin flight services between Taiwan and Singapore with cheap
tickets, while Southwest Airlines of the United States is also
expected to join the low-fare air market, the analyst estimated that
profits for Taiwanese airlines will slow next year.</P>

      <P>Wuchiu village under the jurisdiction of
the outlying Kinmen County was the first of nation's 319 villages and
townships to complete its vote count after polling stations for
Saturday's legislative elections closed at 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>Wuchiu election center officials said there were two polling
stations in the village, although despite having 262 eligible voters,
only 46, or 17.56 percent of the electorate, voted. Wu Cheng-tian of
the opposition New Party received the most votes of 24 out of the
four candidates. The vote count was completed in 10 minutes.</P>
      <P>Wuchiu village chief Tsai Yuan-cheng said that most of the
residents of Wuchiu work in Taiwan proper. As the outbound traffic
has to depend on navy vessels shuttling between Taiwan proper and
Wuchiu every 10 days, this greatly affected the willingness of Wuchiu
residents to return to vote.</P>
      <P>Wuchiu, 72 nautical miles northeast of Kinmen, comprises Wuchiu

Bernard B. Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner,
abruptly withthdrew his name from consideration to be President
Bush's secretary of homeland security late Friday night, citing
questions related to the immigration status of a former household
employee. Kerik was nominated only a week ago by President Bush to

called the president at 8: 30 p.m. to inform him of the decision. The
White House had not pressured him to withdraw. Tacopina said, Kerik
decided he had to do so because as homeland security secretary, he
would be in charge of supervising the nation's immigration laws.

Wall Street Journal: Kerik withdraws nomination as Homeland
Security Secretary.

In a surprise move, former New York Police Commissioner Bernard
Kerik abruptly withdrew his nomination as President Bush's choice to
be homeland security secretary Friday night, saying questions have
arisen about the immigration status of a housekeeper and nanny he

      <P>Wu elaborated on Taiwan's mainland policy, and reminded his

      <P>He stressed that Japan and Taiwan have common interests and said
the two sides need to step up cooperation and exchanges for the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT), the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party kept
its grip on central Taiwan in Saturday's legislative elections, which
helped thwart the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
target of wresting control of the legislature.</P>
      <P>The DPP originally hoped to gain new ground in central Taiwan to
realize its goal of capturing a working majority in the new
Legislative Yuan along with its "pan green camp" ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>However, the "pan-blue alliance" managed to prevent the
"pan-green camp" from gaining more than half of the seats in all four
central Taiwan constituencies -- Taichung County, Taichung City,
Nantou County and Changhua County.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's political landscape, the "pan-blue alliance" has
traditionally dominated northern and central Taiwan, while the
"pan-green camp" has enjoyed an edge in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the March 20 presidential election, the "pan-green camp"
ticket of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu beat
the "pan-blue alliance" ticket of KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP
Chairman James Soong in Changhua County and Taichung County, while
the Lien-Soong ticket outperformed the Chen-Lu team in Taichung City
and Nantou County. In terms of the number of votes, the Chen-Lu
ticket won about 20,000 votes more than the Lien-Soong team.</P>
      <P>That hard-won rare win prompted the DPP to have high expectations
of expanding its ground in the four constituencies in Saturday's
elections. However, it failed to reach the target because of an
unexpected loss in Changhua County.</P>
      <P>In the Taichung County constituency, the "pan-blue alliance" won
six seats, compared to the "pan-green camp's" four seats. The
remaining one seat was captured by a member of the newly established
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU).</P>
      <P>In Changhua County, the "pan-blue alliance" secured five seats,
while the "pan-green camp" gained only three seats; the remaining two
seats went to the NPSU and an independent. In the present
legislature, the "pan-green camp" holds four seats from that
constituency.</P>
      <P>In Taichung City, both camps garnered four seats each. In the
previous legislative elections, the constituency had only seven seats
up for grabs. This time around, the constituency had eight
legislative seats due to an increase in its population. The
additional seat went to the "pan-green camp."</P>
      <P>In Nantou County, both camps captured two seats each, the same as
in the previous election.</P>
      <P>As the "pan-green camp" failed to gain more seats in the four
central Taiwan constituencies, the DPP fell short of its target of
wresting a majority in the 225-seat new legislature.</P>

alliance" only won a marginal majority.</P>
      <P>The party will also seek to invite independent legislators to
join the party in the future, she said.</P>
      <P>NPSU Secretary-General Chen Chieh-ju, meanwhile, said the party
will not rule out cooperation with either the "pan-blue alliance" or
the "pan-green camp" and will not side with any particular camp.</P>
      <P>Chen said the NPSU supports any policy that is to the benefit of
the people and may change its cooperation partner based on the issues
at hand.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the opposition Kuomintang, People
First Party and New Party garnered a total of 114 seats in the
225-member Legislative Yuan, while the "pan-green camp" of the ruling

    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) said Saturday he was sorry to learn that the
TSU could only maintain its present 12 seats in the 225-seat
Legislative Yuan following that day's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Huang said he felt sad but that the party will respect the choice
of the people.</P>
      <P>He also said that former President Lee Teng-hui, the party's
so-called "spiritual leader, " told him that the party needs to keep
trying but should engage in some earnest soul-searching.</P>
      <P>The TSU garnered seven regional seats, four at-large seats and
one overseas seat which were filled on a proportional representation
system according to the total number of votes each political party
garnered in the elections, for a total of 12 seats, one less than in
the previous legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Su Ying-kuei, originally of the TSU, quit the party to run as an
independent, but failed in his re-election bid in Kaohsiung, southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But Huang was able to take some comfort from the fact that Huang
Shih-chou, his son, also representing the TSU, won a regional seat.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO DISCUSS PERSONNEL RESHUFFLE ISSUE NEXT WEEK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 11 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will discuss whether to reshuffle its leading personnel at the
weekly meeting of its Central Standing Committee next week, a senior
party official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung and his two deputies, Lee
Ying-yuan and Chung Chia-pin, offered to resign after the party
failed to reach its target of wresting control of the new Legislative
Yuan along with its ally of the Taiwan Solidarity Union in Saturday's
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan said President Chen Shui-bian, who doubles as DPP
chairman, has not immediately accepted their resignations.</P>
      <P>"The issue will be addressed at the DPP's weekly meeting
next Tuesday," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The DPP garnered 89 of the 225 legislative seats up for grabs, up
two seats from the present level, while its vote ratio also edged up
2.34 percent. Nevertheless, it fell far short of the DPP's target of
winning 96 to 101 seats.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Premier Yu Shyi-kun will step down and whether the
Cabinet should be reshuffled, Lee said the issue has not been
discussed.</P>
      <P>"The competition was very fierce. The fact that we managed to
gain more seats and more votes indicated that our reform agenda has
received popular support," Lee said.</P>
      <P>As 14 of the party's incumbent lawmakers failed to win
re-election, Lee said the DPP headquarters, and himself in
particular, will assume full responsibility for the failure of the
party's "voter allocation" campaign strategy.</P>

should take the initiative to push for reconciliation and cooperation

      <P>A total of 120 incumbent legislators won
re-election, while 37 legislators failed to get another term, the
Central Election Commission (CEC) said after Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>Among the 225 seats up for grabs, 179 were taken by male
legislators, with 47 taken by female legislators. They averaged 49.4
years old.</P>
      <P>Thirty-seven incumbent legislators failed in their re-election
bids, including many popular legislators such as Duan Yi-kang, Shen
Fu-hsiung, and Chiu Yi-ying of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, Chen Shei-saint, Chiang Chi-wen and Kuo Tien-chai of the
Kuomintang and Lin Chi-lung of the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>The youngest legislator-elect is 30-year-old Hsieh Kuo-liang.
Hsieh, currently a vice chairman of a middle high school in
Keelung, was considered a very daring choice when nominated by the
People First Party.</P>
      <P>The youngest at-large legislator-elect is 28-year-old Huang
Chi-hsiung, a taekwondo silver medalist in the Athens Olympics, who
represents the KMT.</P>
      <P>Wu Yu-sheng, a former spokesman of the Taipei city government,
also making his debut in the elections, won 73,164 votes in one of
the constituencies in Taipei County, the highest number of individual
votes in the nation.</P>
      <P>The children of political figures fared well in the day's
elections. Wu Chi-yang, son of the KMT Vice Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung,
came top in Taoyuan County. Kao Su-po, son of KMT Central Standing
Committee member Kao Yu-jen, Huang Shih-chou, son of Taiwan
Solidarity Union Chairman Huang Chu-wen and Chen Ying, daughter of
the Council of Aboriginal Affairs Chairman Chen Chien-nien also
secured seats.</P>
      <P>Ke Chun-hsiung, a movie-star-turned-politician, was top in
Hsinchu City, while Li Ao, a prolific writer who listed countering
the "barbaric administration" as his major platform, said that he
took victory in his stride, admitting that winning was not even his
major interest.</P>
      <P>Li also said, tongue-in-cheek, that "it is outrageous" for him to
be elected because he did not post banners or canvass voters in his
constituency.</P>
      <P>Li also said that he would take advice from Sisy Chen, an
incumbent legislator who acted as his chief strategist, to do
something for society after his election.</P>
      <P>The CEC said that there were 16,559,254 eligible voters this
year, up 736,671 from the previous legislative elections. But the
turnout rate Saturday was 59.16 percent, or 9.796,299 voters, setting

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE SOUGHT POLITICAL BALANCE AFTER ELECTIONS: U.S. SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 11 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of Taiwan's just-concluded
legislative elections show that the people of Taiwan are looking for
some balance between the Chen Shui-bian administration and the
Legislative Yuan, a scholar with a Washington-based think-tank said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Alan Romberg, a senior associate and director of the East Asia
Program of the Henry L. Stimson Center, said that many factors
contributed to the victory Saturday by the opposition "pan-blue
alliance" of the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the People First
Party, who retained a slim majority in the lawmaking body, but the
outcome reflects "a degree of caution" on the part of voters about
the handling of cross-Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>"While the voters are perhaps supportive of the sentiment behind
moves to deepen formal Taiwanese identity, their choice in this
election would appear to demonstrate a desire for greater reflection
by the government on the appropriate pace and extent of steps in that
direction [on cross-strait relations]," Romberg said.</P>
      <P>Constitutional revision was never going to be easy, but it now
would appear that any radical changes that could upset cross-strait
stability will be totally out of the question, said Romberg, who was
formerly a deputy spokesman for the State Department.</P>
      <P>Romberg said that he has always credited President Chen's pledges
that he would not touch on sensitive cross-strait issues in any case.</P>
      <P>However, Romberg said, President Chen was under pressure from
some quarters either to modify or abandon those pledges, or to find a
way around them.</P>
      <P>That prospect would now seem to have been put to rest, he said,
adding that whether the "good governance" aspects of constitutional
revisions proposed by President Chen will be possible is yet to be
seen, but most of those are quite separate from the question of
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>With less pressure on that front, this could be a moment for
Beijing to reconsider some aspects of its own cross-strait policies,
Romberg added.</P>
      <P>With a greater sense of confidence that this is not contributing
to momentum for "independence, " Romberg claimed that Beijing could
possibly accede to Taiwan's application for World Health Organization
observership, promote Mid-autumn Moon Festival charter flights, the
broader issue of the cross-strait links, and even consider some level
of authoritative dialogue.</P>
      <P>Romberg added that the United States will be consistent in
supporting Taiwan's well-being, but it will also continue to oppose
steps by either side that would threaten to upset cross-strait peace
and stability.</P>
      <P>It remains to be seen how the Legislative Yuan will handle the
special defense procurement budget, but based on the campaign, it
would seem that some of the items put forward by President Chen will
at the least be revised by the legislature, Romberg asserted.</P>
      <P>"In terms of the impact on U.S.-Taiwan relations, I think it will
be more important to see that Taiwan is willing to commit greater
resources to its defense in effective ways than that particular
weapons systems [to] be purchased," he said.</P>
      <P>"That is, it is less important that Taipei appropriate funds to
purchase submarines, for example, than that it demonstrate in its
overall approach to the defense budget that it is willing to accept

    <HEADLINE>CHEN URGED TO TALK WITH 'PAN-BLUES' ON PREMIER APPOINTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) urged
President Chen Shui-bian Sunday to respect the voters' will and talk
with the "pan-blue alliance" over the issue regarding appointment of
premier.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance, " which groups the KMT, the
People First Party (PFP) and the New Party, won a majority of 114
seats in the 225-seat legislature Saturday. The KMT now says that it
has the mandate to demand a coalition government in accordance with
the Republic of China Constitution, including collaboratively
appointing the premier.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng said that the president is
empowered in the Constitution to appoint a premier, but he should
also exercise magnanimity as a national leader and respect the
opinions of the legislature since the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) is a minority in the lawmaking body.</P>
      <P>Because the "pan-blues" retained their majority at the
legislature, Lin said President Chen's persistence in trying to
control all governmental branches is a move tantamount to "the
minority raping the majority."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yao Chiang-lin, a member of the KMT Central Standing
Committee, said that he will put forward a motion at a KMT meeting
next Wednesday to ask President Chen to accept Chiang Ping-kun, a KMT
vice chairman and the deputy speaker of the Legislative Yuan, as the
new premier.</P>
      <P>Yao said the motion is an active response to KMT Chairman Lien
Chan's statement that if the "pan-blue alliance" retained its
majority, the KMT would work to form a coalition government with the
ruling DPP.</P>
      <P>Yao said that if the "pan-blues'" appeal falls on deaf ears, the
KMT will not exclude the possibility of promoting a motion of
no-confidence in the premier at the Legislative Yuan or exerting
pressure to achieve that goal.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The just-concluded legislative
elections in Taiwan demonstrated the strength and vitality of
Taiwan's democracy, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The spokesperson said the elections show that the people of
Taiwan, like Americans, cherishes the right to choose their
representatives, and this is a tribute to the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a U.S. expert in Chinese affairs said the results of
the legislative elections in Taiwan, in which the opposition retained
its small majority, suggest that the people of Taiwan are reluctant
to endorse some of the more destabilizing proposals pertaining to
sovereignty that were promoted by the last weeks of the campaigning.</P>
      <P>David Lampton, director of China Studies at Johns Hopkins-SAIS
and The Nixon Center said the results also suggest that great
departures on policies with respect to sensitive issues will be
difficult to produce, and in this sense the results should be
somewhat reassuring to Beijing.</P>
      <P>He said most of the U.S. political analysts will see these
results as supportive of regional peace and stability, and both sides
of the Taiwan Strait should seize this opportunity to move forward
with practical steps to increase cultural, economic and other
dialogue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMATURE BABY MAKES LONG JOURNEY FROM SHANGHAI TO TAICHUNG FOR HELP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A sick baby who was born prematurely has
arrived in Taichung via Kinmen for emergency treatment after making a
1,500-kilometer freeway journey from an intensive care unit in
Shanghai and ensuing cross-strait sea and air transport.</P>
      <P>The seven-month-old girl, "little An-an, " born in Shanghai,
weighed only 900 grams at birth.</P>
      <P>The average birth weight is roughly between 3 kilograms to 3.5
kilograms. The baby was born on May 1, just 28 weeks into the
pregnancy. "Little An-an" currently weighs around 2.3 kilograms.</P>
      <P>A medical group, led by the president of Li Shin Hospital in
Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, arrived in Shanghai last Thursday to escort
the baby -- the daughter of a Taiwan computer businessman and his
Hangzhou wife -- from Shanghai back to Taiwan as the premature child
is in critical condition with breathing difficulties.</P>
      <P>The father of the child took advantage of the "mini three-links"
channel to return to Taiwan via the southern Chinese port city of
Xiamen to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The entire journey from Shanghai to Xiamen, Kinmen and finally to
the hospital in Taichung took about 22 hours.</P>
      <P>Because the father of the baby is a Taiwan citizen, "little
An-an" is covered by the country's national health insurance program
and the family decided to bring the baby back to Taiwan rather than
shoulder the costs of treatment themselves in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng and an official with the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council greeted the child and her
parents upon their arrival in Kinmen and gave them a red envelope
containing NT$6,600 as a token of their blessing to the youngest
passenger that the "mini three-links" has ever served.</P>
      <P>The emergency cross-strait transport of the premature baby was
originally scheduled to take place last Thursday night but was
delayed due to thick fog that closed the freeway connecting Shanghai
and Wenzhou for the day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU WILL CONTINUE WORKING WITH DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) will
continue to work together with the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) in the new legislature despite their fierce competition
in the just-concluded legislative elections, TSU Deputy
Secretary-General Huang Chin-lang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>One day after TSU saw the DPP expands its power base in the
legislature at its cost, Huang said the two parties share the same
political cause of pushing for Taiwan independence, adding that there
will be no political fall-out simply because they were competing to
woo support from the same group of people.</P>
      <P>However, Huang said, the TSU, which is more radical than the DPP
in its efforts to establish a country named Taiwan, will keep a close
eye on the DPP to see that the ruling party doesn't deviate from or
drag its feet on this goal.</P>
      <P>The TSU's spiritual leader, former President Lee Teng-hui, who
turned up the heat on President Chen Shui-bian by organizing a mass
rally in Taipei one week before the Dec. 11 elections to back up his
call for changing the name of the country to Taiwan, was absent from
public view Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsan, a director for the DPP Communications Department,
said Lee's extreme rhetoric ahead of the election is understandable
in light of his self-imposed mission to lead Taiwan to independence,
and there is much common ground between the TSU and DPP in politics,
which makes it easy to work together.</P>
      <P>Giving that the country is set to change the electoral system for
lawmakers by switching from a multi-member district system to a
single-seat constituency system, political analysts said small
parties like the TSU are likely to be wiped out, and TSU lawmakers
will have to join the DPP to survive under the new electoral system.</P>
      <P>Political analysts believe the TSU's setback in the elections
suggests that Lee's political clout is waning, and President Chen's
leadership in the pro-independence camp is reinforced, which means
TSU lawmakers face a choice between demise in the TSU or survival in
the DPP.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsan said the DPP would like to see TSU lawmakers join
its ranks, but that it will not absorb the TSU against its will.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong on Sunday ruled out the possibility of a merger between his
party and the Kuomintang ( KMT) after the PFP lost 12 seats in the
just-concluded legislative elections.</P>
      <P>During a tour of Tainan, southern Taiwan to thank supporters of
his party, Soong said the KMT has closed the door on a possible
merger by failing to honor its promises to the PFP. He did not
elaborate.</P>
      <P>He promised PFP supporters that his party will continue to focus
on issues concerning the country's ties with mainland China, do its
best to improve harmony among ethnic groups in Taiwan and play a role
as a strong opposition party.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung also said a merger
with the KMT is out of the question.</P>
      <P>Chang blamed the KMT for backing out of its agreement with the
PFP, which is a KMT splinter party, that both parties should refrain
from naming more candidates than their common supporters can afford
to vote for.</P>
      <P>The PFP vice chairman said that the KMT wriggled out of its
promise by allowing its party members to run outside of the KMT
ticket and therefore reduced the chances of PFP candidates' success.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chang claimed, the KMT excluded PFP candidates from
its vote-allocation scheme on the eve of the elections, which left
the PFP candidates to fend for themselves.</P>
      <P>The straw that broke the PFP's back was the fact that KMT party
officials prevented Soong from soliciting votes at living quarters of
family members of military personnel in Hsinchu City, northern
Taiwan. Military personnel and their families are traditionally
supporters of the KMT or the PFP.</P>
      <P>As a result, Chang claimed that six PFP candidates led the
list of losers in different constituencies. They could have won if
there were fewer candidates on the ballots.</P>
      <P>The PFP will continue to cooperate with the KMT on major polices
in the legislature, but there is virtually no possibility of a merger
between the two, Chang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SLIM CHANCE OF NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE IN NEW LEGISLATURE: DPP AIDES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the opposition retained its
majority in Saturday's legislative elections, officials of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) claimed Sunday that chances
of a no-confidence vote in the new legislature are slim if President
Chen Shui-bian rejects its power-sharing proposal.</P>
      <P>Lee Ying-yuan, deputy secretary-general of the DPP, predicted
that the feasibility of a no-confidence vote against the premier in
the new Legislative Yuan is extremely low, because such a move would
allow the president to dissolve the legislature and lead to new
elections, a situation that the opposition would not be happy to see.</P>
      <P>If the elections were held again, it is questionable that the
opposition would be able to retain more than half of the seats, he
claimed.</P>
      <P>Chung Chia-pin, another DPP secretary-general, said that society
must return to normal now that the heated campaigning is over and he
pointed out that the opposition parties will be punished by the
voters in new elections should they rashly call for a no-confidence
vote.</P>
      <P>He said that room is ample for two-way discussions on creating a
coalition government as President Chen has called for rational
exchanges and cooperation between the governing and opposition
parties after the elections.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the same day, Kuomintang (KMT) Secretary-General Lin
Feng-cheng urged President Chen to respect the new mandate in the
sixth legislature and take the initiative to discuss possible options
for the premiership with the opposition camp.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks after the "pan blue alliance" of the KMT,
the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party won 114 seats in the
225-member Legislative Yuan in Saturday's elections. The "pan green
camp" of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union won only 101 seats.</P>
      <P>The election results empower the KMT to back mainstream public
opinion and to strongly check and balance the government led by
President Chen, Lin said, urging the president to openly embrace the
issue and hold negotiations with the opposition.</P>
      <P>Opposition KMT Chairman Lien Chan said one day prior to the hotly
contested polls that he would ask President Chen to respect the
opposition's right to form a new Cabinet in compliance with the
Constitution's spirit if it won a majority.</P>
      <P>Lien also recommended P. K. Chiang, currently a vice chairman of
the KMT and deputy legislative speaker and former chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development in the
previous KMT-led government from 1996 to 2000, to serve as the new
premier as part of the KMT's efforts to help improve Taiwan's
economy.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of Saturday's legislative
elections show that Taiwan is a pluralistic and democratic society
and they will not affect Taipei-Beijing or Taipei-Washington ties,
a government official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Tai-san, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) , made the remarks while giving a speech at a seminar
sponsored by the Institute of International Relations at National
Chengchi University following the legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT), the People First
Party (PFP) and the New Party managed to retain a majority by winning
114 seats in the 225-member legislature, outperforming the "pan-green
camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union who garnered 101 seats.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that he believes that a "pan-blue alliance" majority in
the legislature will help the U.S. maintain its basic stance toward
Taiwan under the framework of the Taiwan Relations Act. Under these
circumstances, Taipei-Washington ties will not be much affected, he
pointed out.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, there will be no drastic changes in relations
across the Taiwan Strait, as the president has repeatedly pledged to
follow his "four noes plus one" policy, he said, adding that trade
and economic activities between the two sides will also continue to
expand.</P>
      <P>Chiu told another seminar held earlier the same day that the
executive branch was already prepared to face the new legislature
controlled again by the opposition and said that its impact on
Taipei-Beijing links are hard to predict in the short term.</P>
      <P>He contended that the administration must step up its lobbying at
the Legislative Yuan to ensure political stability at home and called
for the opposition camp and Beijing to jointly cooperate in making
peace across the strait, such as reopening cross-strait negotiations
as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Chang Jung-kung, a spokesman for
the KMT, said that cross-strait tensions have been temporarily
soothed, but added that the current deadlock will remain.</P>
      <P>As the "pan-blue alliance" is expected to play a "firewall" role
in the new legislature, Chang said that Beijing is very likely to put
aside its strong offensive to counter Taiwan independence. But he
said that the existing political impasse between the two sides will
remain in place since no solutions have been found to the "one China"
issue and the DPP's de-sinicization moves.</P>
      <P>Hsu Shu-feng, the head of the DPP's Mainland Affairs Department,
said that Beijing may be reluctant to rekindle close exchanges with
Taiwan in the short term. But she said that the DPP will continue to
handle cross-strait issues pragmatically and wait patiently for a
positive response from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Wu Jui-kuo, a former PFP official in charge of international
affairs, urged the ruling and opposition camps to drop their
political feuding and consolidate their stances on priority issues,
such as keeping the peace across the strait and mending Taiwan-U.S.
relations.</P>
      <P>He urged both camps to look to the fact that foreign influences
are playing an increasingly bigger role in cross-strait affairs.</P>

Confucius' lesson of the day: "If in governing you depend upon
laws and maintain order by enforcing those laws by punishments, you
can also make the people keep away from wrongdoing, but they will
lose the sense of shame for wrongdoing. If, on the other hand, in
government you depend upon moral sentiment and maintain order by
encouraging education and good manners, the people will have a sense
of shame for wrongdoing and, moreover, will emulate what is good."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>319 SHOOTING INVESTIGATION GROUP MAKES HEADWAY IN CRACKING CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of the special investigation group
on the March 19 shooting of the president and vice president said
Monday that they have made certain headway in cracking the case as
several underground gunsmiths have admitted involvement.</P>
      <P>Police recently rounded up more suspects after tracking a firearm
remodeling and sales ring in Tainan with information provided by Ho
Tun-ching, an underground gunsmith who was arrested in September.</P>
      <P>The suspects, who collaborated with Ho in making and dealing
illegal firearms, admitted that the two home-made bullets found at
the scene of the March 19 assassination attempt were made by the
ring.</P>
      <P>The suspects also confessed that about 70 remodeled Beretta
pistols from the ring's gunsmith have been sold on the black market
around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More than 10 of these remodeled Berettas have been seized by the
police, and the "machine marks" or "tool marks" of these weapons
match the characteristics of the bullets found at the scene of the
shooting, the special investigating task force members said.</P>
      <P>Over the past eight months, the investigators said, they have
followed up on more than 2,000 cases regarding violation of
regulations on guns and ammunition. Of these cases, some 600
underground gunsmith operations were searched, and 22 involved
ammunition that match the characteristics of the bullet found in
President Chen Shui-bian's jacket.</P>
      <P>U.S.-based forensic scientist Henry Lee, who had been invited by
the government in early April to help in the investigation, said at
the time that the best way to crack the case was to find the gun,
which he said he believed was a remodeled gun, or the underground
gunsmith where the weapon was made, or the gunman who fired the two
shots.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that an independent investigation committee be
established and made up of members from across the political
spectrum.</P>
      <P>In his report released recently, Lee said that the president's
injury to the abdomen was caused by a bullet and that the bullets
retrieved were not used in standard handguns.</P>
      <P>The most significant finding in his report was the special "tool
marks" on a shell casing found at the scene. Lee suggested in the
report that Taiwan law enforcement officers continue to aggressively
search for and seize all illegal firearms in the country and "examine
and compare all the guns."</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party has insinuated that the shooting was staged to
win President Chen sympathy votes in the bitterly contested
presidential election. Chen beat his rival, Lien Chan of the KMT, by
aslim margin.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ELECTION GAINS ALLOW 'PAN-BLUE' TO CONTINUE ACTING AS A CHECK: WANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  13  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The significance of the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" retaining its majority in the Legislative Yuan in
Saturday's elections is that the alliance will be able to continue
acting as a check on the administration, Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wang, who concurrently serves as a vice chairman of the
Kuomintang (KMT), said that only by following a "middle and rational
path" can the "pan-blue alliance" monitor the administration and act
as a check on it for the benefit of the country and people.</P>
      <P>Wang also said he does not support the notion of the KMT putting
forward a motion to request that President Chen Shui-bian respect the
opposition's "right based on the spirit of the Constitution to form a
new Cabinet" and pushing for a no-confidence vote against the premier
in the new legislature if the request falls on deaf ears.</P>
      <P>Wang said that a no-confidence vote against the premier would
allow the president to dissolve the legislature and hold new
elections, which he said would cause new tensions and further
undermine the country's political stability.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, the People First Party (PFP)
and the New Party won 114 seats in the 225-member Legislative Yuan in
Saturday's elections. The "pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union won only 101 seats.</P>
      <P>The elections result represents a strong mandate for the
opposition alliance to continue its checks-and-balances role, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Prior to Saturday's vote, KMT Chairman Lien Chan said that he
would ask President Chen to respect the opposition's right to form a
new Cabinet if the "pan-blue alliance" won a majority in the
elections.</P>
      <P>Lien also recommended P. K. Chiang, currently a vice chairman of
the KMT and deputy legislative speaker and former chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and Development in the
previous KMT-led government from 1996 to 2000, to serve as the new
premier as part of the KMT's efforts to help improve Taiwan's

    <HEADLINE>SATURDAY'S LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS CLEANEST IN HISTORY: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The just-concluded elections for the sixth
Legislative Yuan were the cleanest in Taiwan's history, Minister of
Justice Chen Ding-nan said Monday.</P>
      <P>The previous legislative elections in December 2001 were rated by
the British Financial Times as the cleanest in Taiwan's legislative
elections history, but Chen said the latest elections were even
cleaner.</P>
      <P>As of the eve of Saturday's elections, Chen said prosecutors'
offices around the nation had received 5,565 suspected vote-buying
tip-offs and a total of 151 people involved in 39 of those cases had
been indicted by Dec. 10. In comparison, 3,404 alleged vote-buying
cases were reported ahead of the 2001 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a pre-election public opinion poll
conducted by the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation
Commission, Chen said 43.5 percent of the respondents said they felt
an improvement in the election culture with the longstanding
vote-buying in check and only 26.9 percent said they didn't
find a decline in vote-buying.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said, the results of another survey conducted by
a local news media on the eve of Saturday's elections showed that
41 percent of those interviewed said they felt a decrease in
vote-buying deals, compared to 4 percent who said "no improvement"
was seen.</P>
      <P>Chen said the increase in the number of alleged vote-buying cases
accepted by prosecution authorities in the run-up to the elections
for the sixth legislature compared to the previous one could be
attributed to a combination of factors, including the huge cash
awards offered by the government for informers, an enhanced public
awareness of the anti-vote-buying campaign and close cooperation among
various law enforcement agencies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INVESTIGATORS IDENTIFY MAKER OF BULLETS USED IN 319 SHOOTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Investigators on Monday confirmed that they
have identified the maker of the two home-made bullets that were used
in the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>However, they admitted that there is still a long way to go
before the case can be resolved, saying they are still trying to
trace other essential clues such as the buyer of the bullets and the
origin of the gun used in the shooting.</P>
      <P>Hou Yu-ih, commissioner of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, who
is a key member of a special task force probing the shooting, said
the task force first discovered a batch of remodeled guns and bullets
made by the suspect, identified by the surname as Tang, in southern
Taiwan on August 15.</P>
      <P>But no breakthrough was made until Oct. 12 when the task force
raided Tang's residence on charges of drug dealing and found a bullet
design sketch, Hou said.</P>
      <P>The size and structure of the bullet shown in the design sketch
closely resemble that of the two bullets found at the scene of the
president's and vice president's shooting, Hou said.</P>
      <P>After further analysis, Hou continued, investigators discovered
that the bullets remodeled by Tang bore several special
characteristics, including their machine marks and unique shell
casing, that are not found in most remodeled bullets and they were a
perfect match with those found on the two bullets.</P>
      <P>In addition to making bullets, Tang is also good at remodeling
guns, investigators said.</P>
      <P>However, as the gun used in the March 19 shooting has yet to be
found, there is no way to prove as to whether Tang is the maker of
the gun as well, investigators said.</P>
      <P>Based on Tang's testimony, the task force has tracked down eight
buyers of the firearms remodeled by Tang but has ruled out their
involvement in the shooting, they added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATION'S HOPE MORE IMPORTANT THAN 'PAN-BLUE' MERGER: PFP'S SOONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A merger of the parties within the
"pan-blue alliance" is not the important issue now that the
legislative elections are over; rather, bringing hope to the nation
should be the alliance's aim, said People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong Monday.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong was responding to calls for a merger of
the "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT), and its two splinter
parties, the PFP and the tiny New Party, while he was in Taipei
County to thank his supporters.</P>
      <P>Soong said that if anyone within the party has any interest in a
merger, they can discuss the concept with the KMT, adding that he
will not be involved in such talks.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, Soong ruled out the possibility of a merger between
the KMT and the PFP one day after the PFP lost 12 seats from the
previous legislature to secure only 34 seats, saying that the KMT has
closed the door on a possible merger by failing to honor its
promises to the PFP.</P>
      <P>Although Soong did not elaborate, PFP Vice Chairman Chang
Chao-hsiung blamed the KMT for not restraining its party members and
instead allowing them to run outside of the KMT ticket, and that the
KMT had excluded PFP candidates from its vote-allocating scheme.</P>
      <P>Soong said that the PFP is adamant about its opposition to
a rapid Taiwan independence and will continue to work with the KMT on
the matter as well as on other issues related to the general public
to monitor the government and its handling of cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>He also said that the KMT is still burdened by its past, and that
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has become corrupt after four
years of rule, saying that only the PFP has a clean slate.</P>
      <P>He also said that the PFP has always considered the big picture,
although that has not always been appreciated, evidence that the
presidential ticket of KMT Chairman Lien Chan and Soong did not win
the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>He also said that he would not insist on heading the PFP, but he
will "insist on being himself."</P>
      <P>He said that the "pan-blue alliance" won a majority in the
legislature because the public wants stability and to maintain the
status quo. After the elections, the important thing is not about a
possible merger, but whether the alliance can bring hope to the
public, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Vice Chairman and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
expressed the hope Monday that the "pan-blue alliance" can put aside
their differences now and step up cooperation and coordination.</P>
      <P>Ma said that without unity, there will be no victory, adding that
it is "only an illusionary estimate" about reports that said the
"pan-blue alliance" can command more than 120 seats in the 225-seat
legislature if those legislators-elect who ran outside of the
alliance's ticket join forces with the 114 seats garnered by the
"pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-fu, KMT whip in the legislature, said that every
political party is reviewing the outcome of the just-concluded
elections, and it is not the best time to talk about a merger,
although "everyone should move toward that direction with faith and
patience."</P>
      <P>But he expressed the hope that a merger can be completed by
next February.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREHISTORY MUSEUM ACQUIRES AUSTRONESIAN OUTRIGGER CANOE FROM PALAU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung,  eastern Taiwan, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new outrigger canoe, a
traditional mode of transportation for Austronesian people across the
Pacific Ocean, has been built in Palau and is now on display in
Taiwan at the National Museum of Prehistory in Taitung.</P>
      <P>A ceremony was held at the museum Monday to mark the building of
the seven-seat outrigger canoe.</P>
      <P>In the ceremony, museum officials practiced a traditional Puyuma
worship ritual while four shipbuilders from Palau practiced their
traditional craft. Betel nuts, azure stones and hemp knitting were
offered in the rituals as sacrifices.</P>
      <P>According to Tsuei Jui-ming, deputy director of the National
Museum of Prehistory, the museum ordered a traditional outrigger
canoe from Palau early this year to enrich the museum's collections.</P>
      <P>The shipbuilders were appointed in person by Palau President
Tommy Remengesau, he said.</P>
      <P>Tsuei said that outrigger canoes have been used for thousands of
years by the Austronesian people across the Pacific Ocean. A wooden
structure that is fixed to the side of a boat is sturdy enough to
allow its riders to ferry cross the seas even when the Pacific Ocean
is stormy, Tsuei added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenous people as a whole are believed to belong to
the Austronesian-language group, which probably underwent the widest
physical dispersion of a single language family prior to the European
colonial expansion following Columbus, from the island of Madagascar
off the east coast of Africa all the way to the tiny, isolated Easter
Island (Rapa Nui) and extending to Taiwan, Vietnam, Northern
Australia, New Zealand and most of the Melanesian and Polynesian
islands.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenous people -- the native groups that predate all
other ethnic groups in Taiwan -- could have originated either from
the southern part of China or from a vast Austronesian-language
region.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's aborigines were considered the northernmost Austronesian
people. Among them, the government currently divides them into 12
major mountain tribes and 10 Pingpu groups. While elements of the
languages and culture of the 10 mountainous races have been
maintained, most of the native languages of the Pingpu people have
died out and no traces remain.</P>
      <P>Among the mountainous aborigines, the Saisiat and the Atayal are
believed to have migrated to Taiwan some 3,000 years ago.</P>
      <P>Anthropologists have no idea what exactly happened, or when, to
cause some of Taiwan's earliest natives to die out or disappear, but
efforts to seek traces of the original natives' existence via
anthropological, linguistic and historical studies have been
continuing.</P>
      <P>In a relatively newer theory developed in Australia and New
Zealand in recent years, anthropologists believe that Taiwan is the
place where the Austronesian-language people originated from.</P>
      <P>Professor Geoffrey Chambers of Victoria University in Wellington
believes that Maori people and other Polynesian peoples of the
Pacific "island-hopped" from Taiwan through the Philippines and
Indonesia to West Polynesia. From there, he says, they traveled to
the islands of East Polynesia and then southwest, eventually settling
in New Zealand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO REBUILD TRUST WITH U.S. AFTER ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should try to rebuild mutual
trust between Taipei and Washington in the wake of the
misunderstandings caused by several controversial issues raised by
President Chen Shui-bian during the run-up to last week's legislative
elections, a domestic academic said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-cheng, executive director of the Institute for National
Policy Research, made the remarks at a conference on post-elections
relations between Taiwan, the United States and mainland China held
in Taipei by the U.S.-based Formosa Foundation.</P>
      <P>Lo pointed out that President Chen's proposal to hold a
referendum in 2006 for a new constitution and his plan to change the
names of Taiwan's overseas missions and state-run enterprises have
caused misunderstandings with the United States and led Washington to
lessen its support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under this circumstance, it is the government's top priority to
rebuild mutual trust between the two sides, Lo said.</P>
      <P>Although the ruling Democratic Progressive Party did not win a
landslide victory in the legislative elections like it had expected,
this should not be interpreted as a lack of support from the people
for the establishment of the Taiwanese identity, Lo argued.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lo said the United States is expected to pressure for
the passage of the budget for the NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion)
Taiwan-U.S. arms procurement. Its focus will be the Kuomintang (KMT)
-led "pan-blue alliance" since it retained its majority in the
Legislative Yuan, Lo added.</P>
      <P>On the issue, opposition KMT legislative caucus whip Huang Teh-fu
said the KMT will continue to block the arms procurement legislation
proposed by the Executive Yuan unless it withdraws the budget bill
and submits it again after the legislation is passed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDIAN MERCHANT CHAMBER IN TAIWAN SEEKING BUSINESS ALLIANCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group representing the Indian Merchant's
Chamber (IMC) arrived in Taiwan Monday to expand procurements from
Taiwan, woo Taiwan investors and look into the feasibility of
creating business alliances.</P>
      <P>The IMC, established in 1907, is one of the most influential
trade organizations in India. It has more than 5,000 member
companies, said Chao Yuen-chuan, secretary-general of the Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>In addition to promoting trade exchanges, the IMC group is also
in Taipei to invite Taiwan companies to take part in the 2005
Asia-Pacific Chamber of Commerce Conference -- the Indian Expo.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, two-way trade between Taiwan and India has
grown by leaps and bounds in recent years, with figures for the first
10 months of this year surging nearly 30 percent over the
corresponding period of the previous year. Two-way trade is expected
to top US$17 billion for 2004.</P>
      <P>Business interactions between the two countries are expected to
grow even closer in the years to come if more companies from the two
sides forge strategic business alliances, Chao added.</P>
      <P>Vijav Gokhale, chairman of the India-Taipei Association, said
that many big-name Taiwan companies, particularly electronics and
computer-makers, have made successful inroads into the huge Indian
market in recent years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan companies are promising to gain an even bigger foothold in
the Indian market after many improvements have been made in
streamlining cross-border trade paperwork and airlines and cargo
transportation, Gokhale said.</P>
      <P>Bhano Abhilashi, the Indian Export-Import Bank's representative
in Singapore, said that India's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by
8.2 percent over the 2003-2004 period, while its export trade surged
a whopping 20.4 percent.</P>
      <P>It is expected that India's exports will further expand to post
an annual growth of 24 percent for the 2004-2005 period, Abhilashi
said, adding that the nation's economic growth will continue to
flourish as India has forged a free trade agreement with ASEAN
members Thailand and Singapore.</P>
      <P>India is particularly promising in development of its energy,
telecommunications, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, information
technology and civil air industries, Abhilashi said.</P>
      <P>Lee Chia-yi, a TAITRA researcher, said that Indian industrial and
business sectors are also interested in exploring mainland China's
huge market using Taiwan as a gateway.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP WILL LOOK AHEAD TO 2007 LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will focus on victory in the next legislative elections and
will only deal with cross-strait relations in a passive manner, a
scholar said Monday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-ming, a researcher at the nation's highest research
institute, Academia Sinica, made the remarks when he attended an
international seminar sponsored by the Los Angeles-based Formosa
Foundation in Taipei to discuss the new situation between Taiwan, the
United States and China after Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Hsu noted that the DPP suffered a setback by failing to win a
majority in the 225-seat legislature mainly because of two mistakes:
overestimating the growth of supporters for the ruling DPP, and
underestimating the impact a low voter turnout.</P>
      <P>Now that the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and its ally, Taiwan
Solidarity Union, managed to win only 101 seats compared with the 114
seats taken by the opposition "pan-blue alliance, " made up of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP), the outcome of the
next legislative elections in 2007 will be crucial to the
presidential election the following year. Predictably, the DPP will
have much soul-searching to do this time and make every possible
preparation for such issues as the drawing up of constituencies and
other related issues, he said.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the DPP will be more passive on cross-strait and
international issues so as to concentrate on victory in the next
elections, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shelley Rigger, professor at Davidson College of North
Carolina, said that it is too oversimplified to say that the outcome of
Saturday's elections is tantamount to a denial of President Chen
Shui-bian's pursuit for a bigger national identity.</P>
      <P>Whether a series of issues raised by the DPP -- such as President
Chen Shui-bian's demands that the opposition KMT change its party
emblem within three months because it is too similar to the nation's
emblem, and the advocacy of the name-change of its overseas missions
to include "Taiwan" to highlight its national identity, and the
writing of a new constitution -- had any impact on the elections
outcome would require more study to make an accurate assessment, she
said.</P>
      <P>She also warned about the change of the electoral system from the
present "multi-seat constituency," to "single seat, two votes" system
in the next legislative elections, saying that the voice of the
underprivileged groups are often ignored in the "winner takes all"
system, which is not necessarily good for Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>Daniel Lynch, a professor at the University of Southern
California, said that now the DPP can't effectively persuade the
international community that national identity is firmly established,
and that the international community will now see that rapid Taiwan
unification or independence is not the mainstream view of the Taiwan
public.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Foundation is a non-profit corporation formed in 2001
to promote greater understanding of the relationship between Taiwan,
the United Sates and the People's Republic of China, and to preserve
and enhance democracy, human rights and the freedom of the people of
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTRY ASSESSING IMPACT OF MAINLAND-ASEAN FTA ON TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has
started assessing the impact on Taiwan of mainland China's economic
outreach with Southeast Asian countries and is seeking to devise
business strategies for Taiwan's industry, according to MOEA
officials.</P>
      <P>In a bid to tackle the new development after mainland China and
the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) inked a free trade agreement (FTA) in late November, the
ministry has ordered the Industrial Development Bureau, the Bureau of
Foreign Trade and the Industrial Development and Investment Center to
evaluate the possible effects of the mainland-ASEAN FTA on Taiwan,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the FTA, customs duties on some 7,000 items
will be slashed to zero percent or 0.5 percent from 2010.</P>
      <P>Given that Japan and South Korea are slated to begin FTA talks
with ASEAN next year, while Australia, New Zealand and India have
also shown keen interest in doing so, Taiwan is set to become an
outcast once countries in the region succeed in forming the world's
largest trade bloc with a population of three billion.</P>
      <P>According to Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh, Taiwan is
left with the sole option to cope with the situation by using the
multi-lateral trade mechanisms under the framework of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to break into the bloc.</P>
      <P>Free trade unions in the European Union, ASEAN and America will
also have to take that path to boost exchanges, she pointed out,
suggesting that Taiwan companies minimize the impact through
globalization and industrial upgrading.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long claimed that the
mainland-ASEAN FTA will only have a limited impact on Taiwan in the
initial stage on the grounds that product levels are different.</P>
      <P>But Chen warned that Taiwan will face fiercer competition after
the "ASEAN plus one" has been set up.</P>
      <P>Saying that branching out is a global trend for enterprises
seeking expansion, such as been done by U.S. and Japanese companies
-- and as some Taiwan businesses have done in the mainland and
countries in Southeast Asia -- he said that the mainland-ASEAN free
trade pact will also benefit the many Taiwan investors in the two
regions and that this is the reason behind the government's efforts
to forge FTAs with other countries.</P>
      <P>On the other side, Taiwan firms will have to step up the pace in
industrial upgrading and engage in value-added creations to brace for
coming challenges, he urged.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun on Monday urged the
legislature to pass a list of 33 priority bills before the term of
incumbent legislators ends in January.</P>
      <P>Yu presented the list to Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
while paying a visit to Wang on the first day that the legislature
reopened after last week's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Yu said he hopes the operation of the legislature will return to
normal after the elections and that lawmakers will step up their pace
in reviewing the bills.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with Yu, Wang said it is time for the legislators to put
behind the rancor seen during the elections and work together for the
solidarity of the nation.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the 2005 central government budget bill must be
passed in this legislature, and the budget bill for the "10 major
construction projects" will be submitted to a committee for review
after an oral report by Yu.</P>
      <P>On the budget bill for the NT$610.8 billion (US$18.23 billion)
arms procurement from the United States, Wang urged Yu to withdraw
the budget bill as requested by the opposition and submit it again
after the legislature passes legislation on the arms procurement.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wang said the Legislative Yuan has the
responsibility of passing laws governing the election method and
execution of powers of the ad hoc National Assembly during this
legislature.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, there will not be enough time for the election of the
National Assembly members and for the passage of a constitutional

    <HEADLINE>TSU CHAIRMAN WILL STAY ON FOR THE TIME BEING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) said Monday that he has "reluctantly" decided
to stay on as head of the party for the time being after the TSU made
a poor showing in the latest legislative elections.</P>
      <P>An emotional Huang Chu-wen offered to resign during a review
meeting held by the party Monday to take responsibility for a
performance that was "far below expectations," TSU officials said.</P>
      <P>Since Huang was adamant in his desire ultimately to leave the
post, the TSU central executive members decided that the matter will
be further discussed Feb. 1, 2005, at which time a reshuffle of all
central executive members will take place via an election, they said.</P>
      <P>However, the TSU central executive members accepted the
resignations of TSU Secretary-General Lin Jih-jia and his
administration team, and said that their replacements will be announced
next Monday.</P>
      <P>The TSU, as an ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , had optimistically hoped that it could ride on the coattails
of the DPP's victory in the March 20 presidential election and
dramatically increase the number of its seats in the 225-seat
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Instead of the gains that the party had hoped for, the TSU
actually lost a seat from the number it held in the previous
legislature.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming, a TSU party whip in the legislature who failed
to win re-election, said that the party machine didn't function well
this time, and someone has to take responsibility to show that the
determination to make reforms is real.</P>
      <P>Chen added that the party will still have to ask for the views of
former President Lee Teng-hui, who serves as the spiritual leader of
the TSU, after the disappointing results.</P>
      <P>Chen also took a swipe at the DPP by saying that it did not do
all it could to help the TSU.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WANG MUST COME UP WITH REFORM INITIATIVES TO WIN SPEAKERSHIP: PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
must present visions for legislative reforms if he wants opposition
People First Party (PFP) support in his bid to secure another
speakership term, PFP Vice Chairman Chang Chao-hsiung said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang said Transparency International, a global non-government
organization devoted to combating corruption, recently listed
Taiwan's legislature, along with those of Argentina, Indonesia, South
Korea and Ukraine, as the world's five most corrupt lawmaking bodies.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chang said, both Wang, who has been speaker
for six years, and Vice Legislative Yuan President P.K. Chiang,
who has been in the post for three years, should be held responsible
for this.</P>
      <P>While seeking re-election as speaker of the newly elected
legislature that will be inaugurated Feb. 1, 2005, Chang said, Wang
should not just pay courtesy calls on those who won in Saturday's
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"Wang, who has been re-elected as a legislator-at large, should
instead come up with initiatives for upgrading legislative efficiency
and quality," Chang said, adding that the legislature can improve its
image by revising its internal operational rules.</P>
      <P>Wang, a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) which
won 79 of the 225 legislative seats up for grabs Saturday, will need
the support of PFP lawmakers if he wants to win another speakership
term.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the PFP, which captured 34 seats in the
just-concluded elections, covets the legislature's deputy
speakership, Chang claimed that the party has no interest in winning
either the speaker or deputy speaker posts.</P>
      <P>"What we are concerned about at the moment is that Wang must
unveil his legislative reform visions if he wants to secure PFP
support for his speakership re-election bid," Chang stressed.</P>
      <P>Chang would not comment on KMT Chairman Lien Chan's proposal that
incumbent Legislative Yuan Vice President P.K. Chiang be named the
next premier to form a new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"Our stance on the issue is that we will not express opinions on
any specific candidate," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He further said the three "pan-blue alliance" parties -- the KMT,
the PFP and the New Party -- have a consensus that the new premier
should be acceptable to a majority of legislators.</P>
      <P>Lien said before Saturday's elections that if the "pan-blue
alliance" wrests a majority in the new legislature, Chiang, a KMT
vice chairman and a former chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development, should be named the nation's new
premier.</P>
      <P>Lien's proposal has been rejected by President Chen Shui-bian,
who pointed out that under the Constitution, the right to name a
premier to form the Cabinet lies with the president, not the majority
party in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, the majority party in the
legislature can only initiate a no-confidence vote against a premier
named by the president. The president then has the power to dissolve
the legislature to pave the way for new elections if he does not
accept the result of the no-confidence vote.</P>
      <P>Chang said it is the norm in most democratic countries that the
president's nomination of a premier should be endorsed by the
legislature.</P>
      <P>The Constitution originally had a similar provision. However, it
was deleted in a 1997 round of constitutional amendments made during
former President Lee Teng-hui's tenure.</P>
      <P>Chang said the PFP will work together with its "pan-blue
alliance" allies in pushing for re-instatement of this provision.</P>
      <P>"We'll also seek the support of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) for this proposal because the re-instatement of this
regulation would help contribute to domestic political stability, "
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Any constitutional amendment proposal requires the consent of
three-fourths of the lawmakers. The DPP garnered 89 seats in
Saturday's legislative elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kinmen county government held a one-day
seminar for personnel in the cross-Taiwan Strait tourist business
Monday in an effort to upgrade the outlying island's services for
mainland Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>A total of 236 people in tourism-related businesses such as
hotels, restaurants, bus companies and souvenir shops attended the
seminar to take courses on mainland policies and laws, the tourism
regulations relating to mainland tourist groups entering Kinmen, as
well as the laws on transportation between Kinmen and Fujian,
according to county officials.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng addressed the opening ceremony of
the seminar and said the tourism industry is the only sector from
which Kinmen can benefit in terms of economic development.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Kinmen is now allowed to take in 600 mainland
tourists every day but claimed that if the current tourism and
security services were further improved, the number of mainland
visitors could be expanded to 6,000 per day.</P>
      <P>Dozens of mainlanders, including members of a coal association in
Fujian, landed on Kinmen Dec. 7 from Xiamen for sightseeing, becoming
the first mainland tourists in decades to visit the frontline island
fortress, located some 10 km west of Fujian.</P>
      <P>Taiwan opened limited links between Kinmen and Xiamen, as well as
between Matsu, another island off the Fujian coast controlled by
Taiwan, and the mainland's Mawei port in January 2001 in the absence
of full-scale direct transportation links across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>To facilitate bilateral exchanges, as well as to boost tourism on

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO FACE UP SQUARELY TO MAINLAND CHINA'S RISE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should squarely face up to the rise
of mainland China as an economic power and acclerate industrial
upgrading to deal with this new challenge, a noted U.S. political
scientist said Monday.</P>
      <P>Edward Friedman, Hawkins Chair professor of political science at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison, made the call at an
international seminar on possible new developments in relations
across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan-U.S. relations in the wake of
Taiwan's Dec. 11 legislative elections, as well as Taiwan's economic
prospects and Beijing's "one China" policy. The seminar was organized
by the Los Angeles-based Formosa Foundation and held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>With more and more Taiwan businessmen flocking to mainland China
to set up footholds to penetrate its vast market and cash in on its
cheap labor, Friedmen said Taiwan should not adopt ostracism and
should instead face up to this reality squarely.</P>
      <P>Friedman said Beijing has made it clear that any Taiwan
businessman operating in mainland China who dares to take part in the
pro-independence movement or the anti-China movement back in Taiwan
will be punished. For instance, the mainland subsidiary of Taiwan's
Chimei Group has been "penalized" because of its chairman's
pro-independence remarks.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China has made no secret of its attempts to win the
loyalty of Taiwan businessmen operating on the mainland, " Friedman
said, adding that the mainland has spared no effort to use its
economic clout to sway Taiwan's political development in its favor.</P>
      <P>Now that the legislative elections have concluded, Friedmen said,
Taiwan should speed up domestic reforms in various domains and take
effective steps to upgrade its industries, as well as adopt a
multi-racial cultural policy to boost domestic ethnic harmony and
ensure political stability.</P>
      <P>In his view, Friedmen said, Taiwan's ruling and opposition
parties should stop their war of attrition that has plagued its
legislature for the past more-than four years. Taiwan must rev up its
economic vitality, Friedmen said, otherwise its industry will be
hollowed out.</P>
      <P>Friedmen also lamented that although Taiwan is an independent
sovereign state, the mainland's rise as an economic power has made
many countries afraid to recognize Taiwan's statehood. He further
said it is unfair to blame Taiwan for provoking the mainland when
Beijing is quickly expanding its defense budget and military arsenal.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Jacques deLisle, a professor of
law and a faculty member of the Center for East Asian Studies of the
the University of Pennsylvania, said Taiwan should avoid becoming
overly reliant on the mainland economically and should diversify its
industries to maintain its competitive edge.</P>
      <P>After the legislative elections, deLisle said, Taiwan should pay
heed to three key problems -- whether the legislative procedures
continue to slow down, whether the confrontation between its two
political camps will continue to plague its legislature and whether
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can begin negotiations on the
opening of direct air and shipping links.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-feng, vice president of the Chunghua Institution for
Economic Research, a Taipei-based economic think tank, noted that
President Chen Shui-bian said in the run-up to Saturday's legislative
elections that he will do three things if his "pan-green camp" could
wrest control of the new legislature -- improve cross-strait
relations, push for sweeping domestic political reforms and write a
new constitution that fits Taiwan's present reality.</P>
      <P>Since the "pan-green camp" failed to win a majority, Chang said,
Chen now can only focus on improving cross-strait relations. He
reminded Chen that he should not sacrifice Taiwan's interests while
seeking a breakthrough to the long deadlocked cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Foundation is a non-profit corporation formed in 2001
to promote greater understanding of the relationship between Taiwan,
the United Sates and the People's Republic of China, and to preserve
and enhance democracy, human rights and the freedom of the people of
Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT COALITION GOVERNMENT: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is too early to talk about a coalition
government, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP)
legislative whip said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming was responding to questions surrounding a proposal
by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang, the People
First Party and the New Party, that it should form a Cabinet after
winning a majority in Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Ker noted that even PFP Chairman James Soong is opposed to such a
proposal and that there is no need to ask the DPP about its views on
the subject.</P>
      <P>"Any scenario of any cooperation is possible, " Ker said, but it
is too early to talk about the "coalition government" before Feb.
1, when the newly elected legislators will be sworn in and Premier Yu
Shyi-kun's Cabinet will resign en masse according to practice.</P>
      <P>He noted that the DPP will need some time for soul-searching
after its setback in the legislative elections, adding that President
Chen Shui-bian is in a position to make an overall consideration on
such issues as the formation of the Cabinet, the party caucus, and
the local city and magistrate elections scheduled for next year.</P>
      <P>"The DPP has weathered a series of grueling tests before, " Ker
said, adding that he has confidence in Chen's wisdom in handling the
latest setback.</P>
      <P>He also urged the KMT not to be overswept by joy in its victory
in the just-concluded legislative elections. "It had better sober
up," he added.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi also said that KMT Chairman Lien
Chan's request to form a Cabinet is "outrageous" and shows no respect
for the constitutional procedure. He told Lien not to be so arrogant
and said that Chen could not possibly agree to such a demand.</P>
      <P>But Lee said he supports the idea of a "coalition government" to
meet the aspirations of the new mandate after the elections, saying
that it would also be possible to consider cooperating with the PFP.</P>
      <P>Chen must consider the lineup of the new Cabinet before the
inauguration of the newly elected legislators, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a KMT party whip in the legislature said that the
party will respect the Constitution in that the president has the
sole power to appoint a premier.</P>
      <P>But Huang Teh-fu also said that the Taiwan people have expressed
their views through the elections and that the KMT recommendation of
economic expert P.K. Chiang, the vice legislative speaker and a KMT
vice chairman, to serve as the premier, is based on this new mandate.</P>
      <P>The KMT will be open to any possibility, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'PAN BLUE' LEGISLATIVE WIN EXPECTED TO BOOST CHINA CONCEPT SHARES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "pan blue alliance" majority in the new
legislature is expected to dilute tension between Taiwan and mainland
China and help provide leads for China concept shares over the short
term, market analysts said Monday.</P>
      <P>Market watchers said that the election results are proof that
Taiwan's people are keen for peace and maintaining the country's
status quo and that it also marks a setback for President Chen
Shui-bian and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), but they
also view the election outcome as a strong public demand for
effective checks and balances of the executive branch.</P>
      <P>The "pan blue alliance" of the Kuomintang, the People First Party
and the New Party managed to retain a majority by grabbing 114 seats
at the 225-member Legislative Yuan in Saturday's elections,
outperforming the "pan green camp" of the ruling DPP and its ally
Taiwan Solidarity Union which won only 101 seats.</P>
      <P>As political disputes are likely to gradually fade with the
president's call for conciliation and cooperation, they said, the
domestic stock market will eventually return to performing on
economic fundamentals.</P>
      <P>They contended that transport and shipping company shares and
stocks related to the mainland market will benefit in the wake of the
legislative elections on wider pubic expectations that Taiwan and the
mainland might reopen talks on setting up direct transport, trade and
postal links across the Taiwan Strait at an earlier date.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Stock Exchange's weighted index closed at 5,878.89
points Monday, a drop of 32.74 points from last Friday's finish.
Market turnover reached a moderate level of NT$85.351 billion
(US$2.63 billion).</P>
      <P>Despite the fall, the so-called China concept shares and shipping
and transport companies stocks all picked up in the day's early
trading session, analysts said, adding that the course of the new
Taiwan dollar, corporate operations reports and the world economy
will affect the domestic bourse more now that the heated election is
over.</P>
      <P>In the face of the new political developments, business and
industry leaders called for unity to work for Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Political feuding over the past few years has dragged down the
country's economy, allowing South Korea to outperform Taiwan,
according to Douglas Hsu, chairman of the Far East Group.</P>
      <P>Polaris Financial Group Chairman Pai Wen-cheng urged the
government to deliberate on how to bolster foreign investor
confidence in Taiwan and recruit high quality talent to sharpen the
country's core competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the governing and opposition parties must try
their best to compromise in order to secure Taiwan's economic and
business interest, Pai said the country needs more hi-tech
professionals and foreign capital. He suggested that the government
quickly revise the relevant laws to allow qualified professionals and
foreign investment into Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO STEP DOWN AS DPP CHAIRMAN FOR ELECTION SETBACK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has expressed his
intention to step down from his concurrent post as chairman of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to take responsibility for
the party's setback in Saturday's legislative elections, a DPP
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, DPP whip in the Legislative Yuan, made the
remarks after he and other key campaign members for Saturday's
legislative elections were asked by Chen to go to the Presidential
Office for a one-hour meeting.</P>
      <P>Also on hand were Vice President Annette Lu, Premier Yu Shyi-kun,
National Security Council Secretary-General Chiou I-jen, Presidential
Office Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang, DPP Secretary-General Chang
Chun-hsiung and Kaohsiung Mayor Frank Hsieh, according to Ker.</P>
      <P>Chen said he will announce his resignation from the chairmanship
during a regular DPP central standing committee meeting Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Although all participants urged the president to stay on to lead
the party, Chen said he would take all the responsibility for the
loss in Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Yu, Chang, Su and Hsieh said they should share the
responsibility, but the president said he will "take sole
responsibility," Ker said.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP charter, if Chen steps down, the 35 Central
Executive Committee members will recommend one among them to serve as
the acting chairman, and a new chairman will then be elected through
popular elections among its members.</P>
      <P>Ker said that whether the president concurrently serves as party
chairman is not important, adding that the president does not have to
decide everything and that major policies can be handled by the
coordination system between the party and the administration.</P>
      <P>He said that the DPP was deemed a loser in the elections because
it only managed to increase its legislative seats by two, far less
than its pre-election target.</P>
      <P>He urged the opposition Kuomintang and its ally, the People First
Party, which together garnered 114 seats compared with the combined
101 seats of the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, not
to be overwhelmed by its victory, saying that both camps need to work
for the nation's future.</P>

The Pentagon is engaged in bitter, high-level debate over how far
it can and should go in managing or manipulating information to
influence opinion abroad, senior Defense Department civilians and
military officers say. Such missions, if approved, could take the
deceptive techniques endorsed for use on the battlefield to confuse

deceptive missions could shatter the Pentagon's credibility, leaving

Wall Street Journal: As math skills slip, U.S. schools seek
answers from Asia Answers From Asia.

About five years ago, a statewide test in Massachusetts revealed
that students' math skills deteriorated sharply as they went from
fourth to sixth grade. Alarmed, the Massachusetts education
commissioner suggested an unconventional fix: importing the math
curriculum used in Singapore. Students in Singapore routinely score
among the highest in international math tests. The hope was that
American kids taught the Singaporean way would improve their math
scores. The approach has been adopt ed in about 200 schools
nationwide, from rural Oklahoma to the inner cities of New Jersey.
Early indications suggest that many U.S. students taught with
textbooks imported from Singapore do perform better in math. Some

    <HEADLINE>NEW OMBUDSMEN NOMINATION LIST TO BE REFERRED TO LEGISLATURE DEC. 20</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will refer a list
of nominees for Control Yuan seats to the Legislative Yuan for
approval before Dec. 20, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) legislative whip said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming said Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng has
suggested that the new ombudsmen nomination list be sent to the
legislature before Dec. 20 so that the legislature can arrange a
schedule to screen it.</P>
      <P>With only a month to go before the current legislative session
comes to an end, Ker said, the legislature still has many critical
bills pending, including the government's 2005 budget plan.</P>
      <P>Ker said the DPP legislative caucus has yet to discuss with its
opposition counterparts the timing for the legislature to exercise
its power of screening the new ombudsmen nomination list.</P>
      <P>According to the Additional Articles of the Constitution,
nominations for the Control Yuan require the consent of the
Legislative Yuan. The present legislature has to vote on the
nominations before its term expires Jan. 31, 2005. The new Control
Yuan members will assume office Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan is the nation's supreme watchdog body overseeing
government operations.</P>
      <P>In the run-up to Saturday's legislative elections, Chen said at a
campaign rally that more than 50 percent of the nominees for the 29
Control Yuan seats will be non-DPP members.</P>
      <P>After the DPP and its "pan-green camp" ally of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union failed to reach its target of wresting control of
the new legislature, it remains unclear whether Chen will uphold this
promise.</P>
      <P>Chen said he has attached great importance to the selection of
Control Yuan members and that the ombudsmen recommendation screening
team headed by Vice President Annette Lu has already furnished him
with a list of qualified candidates. Chen said he is scheduled to
refer a final list of candidates for the 27 Control Yuan seats, plus
nominations for the Control Yuan presidency and vice presidency, to
the Legislative Yuan in mid-December for approval.</P>
      <P>Chen said the number of female ombudsmen will be more than double
the present number. The present Control Yuan only has three female
members.</P>
      <P>Chen said the recommendation list includes hopefuls of different
ethnic origin and political stripes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN IN SHANGHAI HOPING FOR NEW YEAR CHARTER FLIGHTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen in mainland China are
very concerned about the possibility of exclusive charter flight
services for the coming Chinese New Year holidays in the wake of
Taiwan's hotly contested legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Lee-chun, an executive of the Taiwan Businessmen's
Association in Shanghai, told CNA that he is looking forward to
seeing the long-discussed charter flight services realized to carry
mainland-based Taiwan businessmen home for the lunar new year
holidays.</P>
      <P>"The issue will be highly indicative of the state of cross-Taiwan
Strait ties after Taiwan's legislative elections Saturday," he said.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan blue alliance" of the Kuomintang, the People
First Party and the New Party retained its majority by seizing 114
seats in the 225-member Legislative Yuan. The "pan green camp" of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
won just 101 seats.</P>
      <P>It is widely assumed that a "pan blue" majority in the new
legislature will put the brakes on some policies being promoted by
President Chen Shui-bian, such as putting forth a new constitution in
2006 or changing the name of the country's missions overseas by
including the word "Taiwan" in their official titles.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-ueh, director of the Institute of China Studies at
Tamkang University, said that the election results should be
conducive to reducing tension between Taiwan and mainland China
arising from Chen's pro-independence stance.</P>
      <P>As the Taiwan people have displayed their mandate in the
elections, the mainland authorities should know how to assess
cross-strait ties pragmatically, he said, urging the opposition to
play their role adequately in this regard.</P>
      <P>Under the current circumstances, the question of whether or not
there will be charter flights for Taiwan businessmen coming home to
spend lunar new year holidays will be highly symbolic in gauging
cross-strait relations and to helping rebuild two-way negotiation
mechanisms, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Should the mainland side still refuse to reopen such practical
talks with Taiwan, it will risk losing a good opportunity to improve
bilateral ties, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDIAN BUSINESS LEADER PITCHES TAIWAN INVESTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although business has been flourishing
between Taiwan and India, the flow of trade and investment between
the two countries is below its potential, an Indian business leader
told CNA Monday.</P>
      <P>Dilip Dandeka, an India business leader who is heading a
delegation of the India Merchants' Chamber to Taiwan to explore the
market, said this can be seen by the small percentage of their
exports to each other to their total exports in 2003.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, which exported US$7.7 billion-worth of goods to
India, it was 3.9 percent, while for India, which exported US$5.32
billion-worth of goods to Taiwan, it was only 11.9 percent.</P>
      <P>These figures do not reflect the fact that India is the world's
fourth-largest economy in terms of purchasing power parity, and the
second fastest-growing economy, said Dilip, who arrived in Taiwan
Sunday on a trade-promotion trip.</P>
      <P>Citing the ratings given by a foreign consultancy, Dilip said
India is a good destination for foreign investment because of its
strong economic fundamentals, such as a 6.5 percent growth in GDP in
2004-05, an inflation rate of 6.5 percent, a foreign exchange reserve
of US$125 billion and a 24 percent growth in exports.</P>
      <P>Dilip said India's GDP will equal that of the U.S.'s present GDP
in 25 years, not to mention its 1 billion population and 200 million
middle class, which constitute a vast market.</P>
      <P>There are other strengths for India in attracting foreign
investment, Dilip said, citing its well-educated population, which
has the world's second-largest English-speaking population, as well
as its high-skilled and low-cost workforce.</P>
      <P>Last but not least, Dilip said, is the government's policy of
encouraging foreign investment, with many sectors open to 100 percent
foreign direct investment.</P>
      <P>As a democracy, the ruling party in India is changing with the
elections but the policy of deregulation and glasnost laid down in
1991 remains unchanged, Dilip said.</P>
      <P>Dilip, who has already visited Taiwan twice before, pointed out
infrastructure as a potential sector for Taiwan investment.</P>
      <P>He said the Indian government envisions a total capacity addition
of 113,000 megawatts by 2012, entailing an investment of more than
US$115 billion in power generation, transmission and distribution.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the Indian government is focusing on expansion and
modernization of the country's roads. Forty-eight new road projects
worth US$12 billion are under construction. Development and upgrading
of roads will require an investment of US$24 billion until
2008.</P>
      <P>There is also potential for investment in the expansion and
modernization of ports, which will require US$33 billion investment
in the next 10 years and 100 percent foreign direct investment is
permitted for operation and maintenance of ports.</P>
      <P>The food processing industry will require investment of about
US$28 billion, and the healthcare industry will require investment
of US$23 billion by 2012, all of which offers great opportunities for
foreign investment, Dilip said.</P>
      <P>India, with an abundance of computer engineers, is good at
software development, while Taiwan is the world's largest
manufacturer of computers, Dilip said, adding that there are great
prospects for the two countries to work together in this sector.</P>
      <P>Noting that both Taiwan and India cherish democracy and market
economy, Dilip said, this will facilitate their cooperation in
business.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the lack of diplomatic ties between Taipei
and New Delhi has posed some difficulties for business exchanges. For
example, he said, he had to turn to Taipei's representative office in
New Delhi for a visa to enter Taiwan, although he and his Indian
Merchants' Chamber are based in Mumbai. Also, Taiwan refuses to issue
multiple entry visas to Indian people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS TO LIVE WITH CONSEQUENCES OF ACTIONS: U.S. SCHOLARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several scholars from the United States
have offered mixed opinions on Taiwan's recent name-change campaign
to include "Taiwan" in the names of its overseas missions and to
write a new constitution, but they agree on the risks of such a drive
and of deteriorating trust between Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>They expressed their views in an international seminar on
possible new developments in relations across the Taiwan Strait and
Taiwan-U.S. relations in the wake of Taiwan's Dec. 11 legislative
elections. The seminar was sponsored by the Los Angeles-based Formosa
Foundation and held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Edward Friedman, professor at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, said he believes Taiwan is a sovereign independent
country and is free to make any decisions, although it may have to
"live with the consequences."</P>
      <P>Asked whether this will mean that the United States will not
intervene if war is triggered by Taiwan's recent name-change drive
and its promotion of a new constitution, Friedman said nobody knows
how Washington will respond.</P>
      <P>He pointed out, however, that the United States has not made any
commitment to defend any countries, including its allies in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</P>
      <P>He also said that if the United States and other countries think
that mainland China is a threat to peace and stability in the
Asia-Pacific region and is the one making the provocation, then it
will be in the best interests of Taiwan, but if Taiwan is considered
to be the provoker, it will not be in Taiwan's interest.</P>
      <P>He said President Chen Shui-bian's recent name-change proposal
was a political risk, which he said is normal with politicians,
although in this particular case, Taiwan might have to pay "the
ultimate price."</P>
      <P>Shelley Rigger, a Brown associate professor at Davidson College
in North Carolina, expressed the opinion of nothing ventured, nothing
gained, adding that no action will have disastrous consequences,
although action could also lead to the same consequences.</P>
      <P>Rigger and two other scholars also said that the United States is
angry because a proposed NT$610.8 billion special budget for military
procurement from the United States was stalled in the Legislative
Yuan, as well as the recent name-change drive and the promotion of a
new constitution.</P>
      <P>There is a "great deal of annoyance" in Washington, she said,
adding that she has heard people say it is "incredible" that Taiwan
hopes for protection from the United States but will not provide for
its own defenses.</P>
      <P>She said that the mood in Washington "is very critical" and that
it is very irritated about the arms procurement project.</P>
      <P>Many people in the United States question whether Taiwan has a
plan to protect its own interests, because it does not want to buy
the arms it originally asked for. There is also a perception in the
Washington that Taiwan wants to stall its talks with mainland China,
and that it will not make efforts to improve relations with the
United States.</P>
      <P>Ross H. Munro, director of Asian Studies, Center for Security
Studies in Washington, D.C., and Richard Kagan, professor of Hamline
University in Minnesota, expressed similar views.</P>
      <P>Kagan said that if the arms procurement project does not pass the
legislature, Taiwan's voice in the United States will be weakened.</P>
      <P>Munro said that U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell's recent
remarks that Taiwan is not a sovereign state highlight an unfortunate
fact -- a deterioration of communication and trust between Washington
and Taipei.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Quality is everything in terms of Taiwan's
agricultural products being able to compete with those of other
nations, Taiwan's top agricultural official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chin-lung, chairman of the Council of Agriculture (COA), made
the remarks while attending an award ceremony for the nation's
premium dairy farms in Tainan County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee promised dairy farmers that the COA will provide needed
assistance to ensure the quality of domestically produced milk.</P>
      <P>He also cited statistics to show that the impact on Taiwan of the
island's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2002 has
not been as great as had originally been expected.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had estimated that in the first year after WTO entry,
agricultural losses would reach NT$24 billion (US$740.74 million) and
the agricultural population would drop by 22,000. But in fact,
agricultural losses only amounted to NT$1 billion, while the
agricultural population actually increased by 3,000, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that quality is the most important factor in terms
of Taiwan's agricultural products being able to compete
internationally. He said that the rice competitions held in Taiwan
have led to Taiwan rice exports to Japan after a 33-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also holds tea competitions, and its oolong tea is the
best in the world, Lee said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO MONITOR HOW NEW VANUATUAN CABINET HANDLES RELATIONS: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will closely monitor how the new
cabinet in Vanuatu handles its relations with Taiwan and will work to
the last minute to secure its relations with the South Pacific island
state, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said that after Vanuatu's parliament
voted Prime Minister Serge Vohor out of office Saturday, a new
cabinet headed by Ham Lini has been formed.</P>
      <P>Lu said there are two possible developments. The first is that
the nation will maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan
after "having thought it through" and realizing that this is in its
best interests in terms of its long-term development. The second is
that it will sever ties with Taiwan and accept the financial
assistance that mainland China has promised if it does so. Beijing is
willing to offer Vanuatu US$32 million, and more if it severs ties
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan is unwilling to engage in "dollar diplomacy" with
mainland China, it is possible that the new government in Vanuatu
will tell the staff of the ROC embassy to leave the country, Lu said.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the ministry will by no means give up efforts at
this stage and that the ROC embassy staff will stay on to observe
developments and "fight to the last minute."</P>
      <P>Vohor and ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen signed a
joint communique in Taipei Nov. 3 to establish diplomatic relations,
making Vanuatu the ROC's 27th ally.</P>
      <P>Beijing has continued to try to woo Vanuatu away from the ROC,
and a cross-strait diplomatic tug-of-war is playing out in the South
Pacific island state.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Kau Ying-mao said over the weekend
that he is not optimistic about the development of ROC-Vanuatu
relations in light of the pro-Beijing background of Prime Minister
Lini.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ROC's relations with the Caribbean nation of
Grenada have become another focal point following Grenadan Prime
Minister Keith Mitchell's departure for mainland China for a visit
last week.</P>
      <P>Lu claimed that the Grenadan government has had contacts with
both sides of the Taiwan Strait over the past year in the hopes of
using the cross-strait rivalry to gain maximum assistance from
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although Grenada hopes to reap benefits from both sides, the
ministry will never increase the amount of assistance because of the
Beijing factor, Lu said, adding that the ministry will no longer
engage in "dollar diplomacy."</P>
      <P>The ministry has learned that Beijing told Mitchell that the
assistance it will offer is several times more than that provided by
Taiwan, although Mitchell didn't elaborate on the amount.</P>

she has graciously declined becoming the acting chairwoman of the
ruling Democratic Progress Party (DPP), adding that the top priority
during her tenure of office is to help the president allow the
citizens of Taiwan to have healthy bodies and minds.</P>
      <P>Lu, who made the remarks while attending a meeting on the subject
of a "Healthy Life Strategic Alliance, " said that she and some other
high-ranking governmental and DPP officials were invited by President
Chen Shui-bian to participate in a consultation held Monday to
discuss his intention of resigning as DPP chairman.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that several of her senior colleagues would
support her becoming the acting DPP chairwomen, Lu said that she
declined their support because she will push for two important
projects -- activities related to living a healthy life and the
establishment of the Democratic Pacific Alliance.</P>
      <P>"These will keep me very busy next year and, therefore, I dare
not accept the post," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Touching on issues regarding various elections held this year and
those to be held in the future, including the presidential election
in 2008, Lu said that the whole nation's resources will be used up by
holding elections if the Legislative Yuan does nothing to reform
electoral institutions.</P>
      <P>Social resources are expended each time an election has been held
and they also destroy human nature and values, the vice president said,
adding that this is a price of democracy.</P>
      <P>For her, Lu said that rulers should not just be passionate about
elections, but remember that it is more important to govern the
nation and to love the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'10 MAJOR PROJECTS' TO CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH BY 0.6%: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday the
government's plan to launch "10 new major construction projects" next
year will contribute to the nation's overall annual economic growth
by an estimated 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while speaking at a legislative plenary
session on a special budget plan for the "10 new major construction
projects."</P>
      <P>The premier told lawmakers that the Cabinet has appropriated
NT$93.91 billion for a special budget for the "10 new major
construction projects, " which will begin next year. The special
budget will be raised by selling NT$15 billion worth of government
stakes in state-controlled Taiwan Power Co. and floating NT$78.91
billion worth of state bonds.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan's 2005 economic growth is projected at 4.56
percent, Yu said, the "10 new construction projects will contribute
at least 0.26 percent to the nation's economic growth. In addition, he
went on, the projects will help boost private investments and thus
result in a total of 0.6 percent contribution to next year's economic
growth.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Yu said, the new major construction projects will help
increase the government's tax revenues by NT$70 billion to NT$150
billion in the next five years. As the government has worked out
various complementary measures, Yu assured lawmakers that the
projects will not "leave debts to posterity" as some critics have
claimed.</P>
      <P>In addition to quantitative economic effects, Yu said, the "10 new
major construction projects" will also contribute to upgrading
manpower resources and economic quality as well as creating cultural
value, enrich the daily life of local people and inspire
technological advances.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet's special budget plan, NT$10 billion
will be earmarked for the top-rate university development plan;
NT$1.4 billion for construction of a world-class arts center; NT$2.8
billion for the "Mobile Taiwan" plan; NT$2.2 billion for the Taiwan
EXPO plan; NT$1.9 billion for the Taiwan railway modernization plan;
NT$9 billion for the new expressways construction plan; NT$13.7
billion for the Kaohsiung Harbor intercontinental container terminal
construction plan; NT$48 billion for mass rapid transit systems
construction in northern, central and southern Taiwan; NT$3.4 billion
for new sewer systems construction; and NT$400 million for
construction of new reservoirs.</P>
      <P>The aim of the "Mobile Taiwan" project is to set up the basic
infrastructure to combine cellular phone network service, IT computer
platforms, and broadband Internet links, Kao Tien-tzu, head of
telecommunication and information section at the advisory group, was
quoted as saying.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO EXCUSE FOR DPP'S DEFEAT: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday there
is no excuse for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP)
defeat in last week's legislative elections as he resigned from the
position of DPP chairman to take responsibility.</P>
      <P>Chen said the DPP must learn a lesson from the election outcome
and reflect upon whether the party has became over-confident after a
series of victories since the 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen said it certainly feels bad to be defeated, but the DPP must
admit its defeat since it failed to attain the goal it set and failed
to meet the expectations of its supporters.</P>
      <P>Though the DPP managed to win 89 seats in the elections, up two
seats compared with the previous polls in 2001, the figure was far
from the target of 100 seats the party had expected to gain.</P>
      <P>Chen said the DPP will not try to console itself after the
setback but will conduct self-examination using the highest standard.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that the DPP set three goals during the
party's 17th anniversary celebration last year, which included
holding the first referendum in Taiwan's history, winning the 2004
presidential election, and gaining a majority control in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP succeeded in achieving the first two goals, it
failed in the final one, Chen said, adding that he must apologize to
all DPP members and supporters and take full responsibility for the
failure.</P>
      <P>However, he said the DPP will not be knocked out by a temporary
setback but will review its policies, adjust its pace and make
improvement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEETING BETWEEN KMT, PFP, NEW PARTY HEADS BEING ARRANGED: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By LIlian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Lien Chan hopes to meet with his counterparts -- James Soong of the
People First Party (PFP) and Yok Mu-ming of the New Party -- this
week to try to resolve possible misunderstandings and discuss the
cooperation of the three parties of the "pan-blue alliance, " KMT
officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks amid reports that despite a call
for the merger of the three parties after the "pan-blue alliance"
gained more seats than expected in Saturday's legislative elections
to maintain its majority, Lien and Soong had not spoken to each other
since mid-November because of bickering over the allocation of more
than NT$100 million in subsidies for ballots garnered by the
"Lien-Soong" ticket in the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Soong was also angry about KMT's vote-allocation scheme, which
sidelined the PFP, in the just-concluded legislative elections. The
KMT and all eight but one of the New Party candidates ran under the
banner of the KMT, garnering 79 seats while the PFP slipped 12 seats
to 34 seats from the previous elections. The New Party had one seat.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the KMT and the PFP have been busy since
the legislative elections, and that they are still arranging for a
meeting of the three chairmen.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang Jin-pyng, speaker of the Legislative Yuan and a
KMT vice chairman, said that the KMT and the PFP are like brothers.
Even if there is no merger, they should at least cooperate.</P>
      <P>A PFP caucus whip said that cooperation between the KMT and the
PFP has never stopped, but the atmosphere and conditions for a merger
between the two are not yet ripe, and it is meaningless to talk about
a merger now.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung said that a merger should not be
done for the sake of doing it, and it should not be done to expand a
"certain party." When the opposition forces can bring the people hope
and the atmosphere and the environment are ripe, then it will be time
to talk about a merger.</P>
      <P>He also said that the ill-gotten assets of the KMT should be
discussed, adding that as a young party, the PFP has no reason to
shoulder the burden.</P>
      <P>Soong has said over the past two days that a merger of the
parties within the "pan-blue alliance" is not an important issue now
that the elections are over. The important thing is whether the
alliance can bring hope to the nation.</P>
      <P>Soong also said that he had no intention to be head of the PFP,
nor was he interested in serving as the second fiddle in the KMT,
adding that he would only "be himself."</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, legislative whip of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , was recommended to serve
as acting DPP chairman after President Chen Shui-bian stepped down
from his concurrent post as party chairman Tuesday.</P>
      <P>President Chen bowed deeply during a regular DPP Central Standing
Committee meeting to apologize to all party officials and supporters
over the less-than-expected performance of the party in Saturday's
legislative elections and said that he would resign as party chairman
to take responsibility for the setback.</P>
      <P>The DPP Central Standing Committee then recommended Ker to serve
as the acting chairman.</P>
      <P>According to the DPP charter, when the chairmanship is vacated,
the Central Standing Committee will recommend a pro tem chairman, and
the acting chairman's main task will be to preside over the election
of a new chairman through a popular vote among party members.</P>
      <P>Ker stressed that the post is not a glorious one, but a
responsibility, adding that the time he will be in the position will
be rather short, and his mission should be simple and clear.</P>
      <P>He noted that his main work will include the maintenance of the
normal functioning of party affairs, the preparation for the election
of the party chairman through popular vote among party members in the
shortest time, and the completion of the tasks assigned by the
president.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung said that the DPP Central
Standing Committee members and all local DPP chiefs had hoped that
the president would stay on to lead the party, but the president said
his resignation is not to shirk responsibility, but to shoulder
greater responsibility for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president said that his departure will be to create a
"broad-based" presidency to brace for a minority government in the
next three years.</P>
      <P>He wants to be a coordinator, which he said is more important
than being the chairman of the ruling party.</P>
      <P>The president also stressed that the DPP did not lose, but he
himself lost in the elections, and he alone must take the
responsibility.</P>
      <P>The DPP, which garnered 89 seats in the 225-member Legislative
Yuan in the just concluded elections, had expected to win over 100
seats and together with its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, gain a
majority in the legislature. The TSU garnered 12 seats.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A plan by the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
to build a petrochemical industrial park in central Yunlin County has
gained a warm response from the domestic industry, prompting a CPC
executive to call for government assistance for the investment
project.</P>
      <P>CPC General Manager Chen Pao-lian issued the call earlier this
week after having intensively and repeatedly explained the investment
project to mid- and downstream businesses in the industry.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the major investment plan, valued at more than
NT$300 billion (US$9.1 billion) , will be one of the biggest
investment projects that the state-run CPC has launched in recent
years.</P>
      <P>The plan represents a worthy investment opportunity and many
companies have responded positively to the idea, he said, urging the
government to give its full support to the plan.</P>
      <P>As an upstream supplier of crude materials to industry, the CPC
is keen on creating an industrial park with the participation of mid-

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's resignation as
chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should not
obscure the fact that the party's performance in last week's
legislative elections was "its best ever, " DPP Secretary-General
Chang Chun-hsiung said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen resigned from the party chairmanship to take responsibility
for the party's failure to win a majority in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chang offered Saturday to step down from the post of
secretary-general over the DPP's setback.</P>
      <P>However, Chang noted that the party garnered the largest number
of legislative seats and the highest vote share in the elections.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the DPP's mismanaged voter allocation strategy
was responsible for the defeat of a number of incumbent DPP
legislators who enjoy a high support rating in opinion polls, saying
the party will conduct a thorough review of the error.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, many DPP politicians thought that there is no hurry
for the party to hold a direct election for the position of party
chairman after Chen's resignation.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Shen Fu-hsiung said the party's legislative caucus
leader, Ker Chien-ming, should act as party chairman until the
government has completed a Cabinet reshuffle, which will take place
at the same time the new legislators are sworn in Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with Shen, Lin Yu-sheng, another DPP legislator, said it
makes no difference as to whether or not there is an election for the
DPP chairmanship, nor does it make any difference who is chairman,
because, he claimed, the party is "only a machine for elections."</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
Tuesday it will greatly expand recruitment of military volunteers
from 2005 with the aim of reversing the present conscript-volunteer
ratio of 60:40 by 2008.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news conference, Wu Kuo-sheng, an MND
division chief in charge of manpower planning, said the MND plans to
recruit a total of 45,000 volunteer soldiers between 2005 and 2008.</P>
      <P>In 2005 alone, Wu said, the MND expects to recruit 6,561
volunteer soldiers, both male and female.</P>
      <P>Volunteers can apply via two channels, Wu said. Senior high
school or vocational school graduates aged under 25 who have been
enlisted for mandatory military services for one month can take part
in qualification tests. Meanwhile, senior high school or vocational
school graduates who have completed mandatory military service in
three years and are aged under 26 can also apply to take
qualification tests.</P>
      <P>In connection with the increased recruitment of volunteer
soldiers, Wu said, the MND will phase out recruitment of
non-commissioned officers from next year.</P>
      <P>Hereafter, Wu said, all non-commissioned officers will be
promoted from the ranks of volunteers. All privates who have joined
the military for one-and-a-half years can apply to take tests to
become volunteer non-commissioned officers.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, salaries for volunteers will still fall
short of the level seen in the business sector. Basic monthly pay for
privates will range between NT$27,105 and NT$29,870 depending on
rank. They can also get additional pay in terms of the special types
of work and service areas. Those who work aboard submarines can get a
maximum additional pay of NT$12,000 per month.</P>
      <P>Volunteers who have served for more than three years can receive
a retirement pension of at least NT$130,000. If they serve as
non-commissioned officers and remain in the military for 20 years,
they will be entitled to receive a monthly pension for the rest of
their lives.</P>

Wall Street Journal: After 18-month battle, Oracle finally wins

Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle Corp., a won a measure
of vindication yesterday, when rival PeopleSoft Inc. agreed to be
acquired for US$10.3 billion, capitulating after 18 months of
resistance. To seal the deal, Ellison prevailed over the U.S.
government, which sued to block the merger on antitrust grounds. And
he defied skeptics who warned that a hostile software takeover
couldn't work because the target company's technical and management
talent would walk out the door. Once it is finalized, the PeopleSoft
acquisition will radically reshape the market for software that
companies use to run their financial, human-resources and other
business functions, leaving just two big suppliers -- Oracle and
Germany's SAP AG. More broadly, the deal creates a four-way battle
among tech giants Oracle, SAP, Microsoft Corp. and International
Business Machines Corp., each of which wants to offer corporations a
broad menu of software and reduce their customers' reliance on other
vendors.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO REIN IN KINMEN FOODSTUFF QUALITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation urged the
government Tuesday to allow the frontline island of Kinmen to import
certain daily necessities from mainland China under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) framework to facilitate quality control of
foodstuffs sold there.</P>
      <P>Acting on a request from the Control Yuan, the nation's supreme
watchdog body, the foundation purchased three categories of food
items at major marketplaces and sightseeing spots on Kinmen in late
November for testing, including 14 fresh fish, poultry, pork and beef
items, 16 kinds of fresh fruit, vegetables and tea, as well as three
brands of rice wine.</P>
      <P>Among the fresh vegetables and tea subject to testing, the
foundation said, residue of the banned insecticide alphacypermethrin
was found in celery, and residue of dicofol, a banned chemical that
kills mites, were found in green tea samples. The packagings of the
two substandard items did not identify the country of origin.</P>
      <P>All the remaining items tested met standards set by the health
authorities, the foundation said.</P>
      <P>Following the opening of Kinmen -- which lies closer to mainland
China's Fujian Province than to Taiwan -- to the direct "mini three
links" with Fujian, many mainland foodstuffs have made inroads into
the Taiwan-held defense outposts, either legally or clandestinely.</P>
      <P>Consumers' Foundation Secretary-General Huang Yi-teng said that
some dried foodstuffs, including mushrooms, sold in Kinmen have been
found to contain excessive amounts of heavy metals and preservatives.</P>
      <P>Huang suggested that the government further liberalize
Kinmen-Fujian trade under the WTO framework. Both Taiwan and mainland
China are WTO members. By so doing, Huang said, the government can
establish a comprehensive foodstuff screening system to ensure food
quality and protect public health.</P>
      <P>Several Control Yuan members are scheduled to meet Wednesday with
officials from the Council of Agriculture, the Coast Guard
Administration, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, the Department of Health, the
Mainland Affairs Council and the Kinmen county government, to discuss
the cross-strait "mini three links" issues, including contraband
goods smuggled into the Kinmen area from the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MUTUAL-TRUST MECHANISM DEPENDS ON BEIJING'S RESPONSE: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's idea of a
military mutual-trust mechanism with mainland China is no more than
pie in the sky unless Beijing responds to it positively, a defense
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lt. Gen. Hu Cheng-pu, the administrative vice defense minister,
said at a news conference called to unveil the 2004 Defense White
Paper that the defense ministry has set up three panels to work on
the mechanism, which includes norms for military conduct across the
Taiwan Strait and a declaration from Taiwan and mainland China the
end of hostility between them.</P>
      <P>The results of their work will be presented to the president by
January next year and will be translated into the country's policy
and made public after being approved by the president, Hu said.</P>
      <P>However, he admitted that the whole thing will just be a waste of
time unless Beijing responds positively.</P>
      <P>As usual, the 2004 Defense White Paper stresses the military
threat posed by Beijing to Taiwan, and the necessity for Taiwan to
improve its defense capability.</P>
      <P>In the same breath, the paper echoes the president's call for
peace with the mainland.</P>
      <P>In the paper's preface, Chen said Taiwan should be the defender
of security, rather than a dependant on security.</P>
      <P>Branding the mainland as the biggest threat to Taiwan's security,
Chen encourages the armed forces to improve their battle capability
by making good use of knowledge and turning knowledge into real
power.</P>
      <P>He also made a case for his call for a military mutual-trust
mechanism with the mainland, including the renouncement of weapons of
mass destruction, the laying down of a military buffer across the
strait and a set of norms for military conduct across the strait.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Lee Jye said in another preface to the paper
that security of the country lies in its strength to defend itelf
rather than the mercy of its enemy.</P>
      <P>"The task of preserving peace is all the more difficult when
anti-war becomes an universal trend," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee added that no investment is more worthwhile than the efforts
put in to strengthen the defense capability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND ISSUES NEW DEFENSE WHITE PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
issued its biennial defense report Tuesday outlining Taiwan's
military buildup plans and analyzing mainland China's military threat
and the possibility of a mainland attack on the island.</P>
      <P>In addition to introducing Taiwan's standing forces, including
missile defense and electronic warfare forces, the 298-page defense
white paper also introduces for the first time the nation's four
types of reservist units -- coastal defense, urban and rural defense,
critical places defense and extra reservists mobilization.</P>
      <P>Military spokesman Navy Capt. Liu Chih-chien said the MND has
regularly issued a defense white paper once every two years since
1992 in line with the nation's defense law to enhance military
transparency.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Vice Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Hu
Chen-pu said both mainland China and Taiwan are changing their
strategies for a possible war across the Taiwan Strait that separates
them.</P>
      <P>"It is not impossible that China will come directly across the
sea to attack, but the possibility is low, " Hu said, adding that the
mainland is more likely to try and paralyze Taiwan and after
paralyzing the island, mount a blitzkrieg-style attack.</P>
      <P>Hu said the mainland could use electronic warfare to shut down
Taiwan's communications systems before launching missile strikes or
starting a naval blockade.</P>
      <P>As a result, Hu said, Taiwan's annual round of war games next
year will take anti-terrorism as a major theme. The Han Kuang series
of exercises used to include amphibious landings and attacks on
approaching vessels.</P>
      <P>Hu said next year's drills will focus on anti-terrorism,
including fending off cyber warfare. "The computerized war games of
the Han Kuang series of exercises will be aim at drills to suppress
terrorist attacks at the earliest possible time," Hu explained.</P>
      <P>The newly published defense report also says the mainland's rapid
arms build-up will cause an imbalance of power in the Taiwan Strait
by 2008 and increase the likelihood of war if Taiwan fails to beef up
its defenses quickly.</P>
      <P>By 2006, the report says, the military advantage in the Taiwan
Strait will tilt in favor of the mainland.</P>
      <P>"If the situation continues to deteriorate, there will be an
imbalance of military power between the two sides, which will be
extremely unfavorable for our national security, " the report says,
adding: "The imbalance of military power will be conducive for
communist China to resolve the 'Taiwan issue' through military
means."</P>
      <P>The defense report further says the mainland's 2.23
million-strong army would most likely launch a surprise attack, such
as invading offshore islands, firing missiles or imposing a sea
blockade, and seek to paralyze government and military command.</P>
      <P>The mainland has deployed 610 ballistic missiles and can
mobilize 250,000 ground troops, 1,000 fighter aircraft and 730
warships against the island, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Although the military denied the report is part of its efforts to
drum up support for the government's plan to purchase NT$610.8
billion-worth of advanced defense weapons from the United States, the
MND made it clear that time is not on Taiwan's side.</P>
      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has blocked the deal
for six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-electric
submarines and 12 P-3C Orion submarine-hunting aircraft, saying they
are overpriced. The deal is expected to be stalled until the new
legislature, elected last weekend, takes office in February.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei Dec. 14 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
made anti-terrorism operations a part of the armed forces' 2005 Han
Kuan war games, Vice Defense Minister Lt. Gen. Hu Cheng-pu said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a news conference called to unveil the ministry's 2004 Defense
White Paper, Hu said Beijing may choose to launch a terrorist attack
against Taiwan instead of an all-out war, with the aim of paralyzing
the island's military command chain or administrative system with the
least amount of force.</P>
      <P>Noting that illegal mainland Chinese migrant workers are often
nabbed by police in Taiwan, Hu said it is only reasonable to gear up
for a fight against terrorists who could be working for the mainland
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The anti-amphibious raid drill that has featured past war
exercises will be preceded by an anti-terrorism operation next year
to prepare the armed forces for war within the country, Hu went on.</P>
      <P>Regional armed forces commanders have been asked to prioritize
strategic targets in their regions and to work out plans to suppress
terrorist attacks against these targets as soon as possible, Hu said.</P>
      <P>However, the general said Taiwan will not launch a counterattack
against the mainland even if Beijing is found to have been behind
terrorist attacks against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will not resort to counterattack unless Beijing
conducts the first strike, and only the defense minister has the
power to order such a counterattack.</P>

has built many sports centers and swimming pools, as well as
organizing numerous sporting activities, in addition to improving the
city's traffic system and imposing various environmentally friendly
measures.</P>
      <P>According to Hancock, a healthy city must be built upon sound
foundations on the environmental, economic and social fronts. The
private sector should cooperate closely with the government to
achieve that goal by making efforts from the ground up, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FITCH RATINGS KEEPS TAIWAN'S RATING UNCHANGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The international rating agency Fitch
Ratings kept Taiwan's rating unchanged Tuesday, with an A+ for its
long-term foreign currency, an AA for its domestic currency, and
a stable outlook for its long-term prospects.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs welcomed the
news, calling it an affirmation of the sound fundamentals of Taiwan's
economy, which will further improve now that the fierce legislative
elections are over.</P>
      <P>The ratings are based on a country's foreign debts, investment
and finance.</P>
      <P>The Fitch Ratings said the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) failure to win a majority in the just-concluded legislative
elections will slow down President Chen Shui-bian's movement toward
revising the Constitution, which will please Beijing and therefore
ease the strain between the two sides.</P>
      <P>However, the agency does not think Chen will give up his attempts
to rewrite the Constitution because of his party's
worse-than-expected performance in the legislative elections. Rather,
the agency predicted, Chen will postpone his reforms for the time
being.</P>
      <P>The possibility that Taiwan's political tension with the mainland
might culminate in a military conflict has dampened Taiwan's
prospects for an upgrading in its rating, Fitch Ratings said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the agency said, the DPP's failure to control
the legislature means its financial reforms will continue to be
bogged down in the Legislative Yuan, which will result in an increase
of its middle-term debt to an alarming level of 40 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP).</P>
      <P>An opposition-controlled legislature is certain to put the brakes
on the government's big price-tag projects such as the NT$601.8
billion (US$18.23 billion) arms purchase and its NT$500 billion "10
New Major Projects" program and ease the government's financial
burden, which is all the more important at a time when the
government's revenues have decreased to 13 percent of the GDP,
according to the agency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HAKKA AFFAIRS COUNCIL WORKING TO SAVE ENDANGERED DIALECTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs
(CHA) is sponsoring the establishment of three language teaching
centers around Taiwan in an effort to save the endangered dialects of
the Hakka language.</P>
      <P>Three of the five major Hakka dialects, namely the Rao-ping,
Dah-pu and Shao-an dialects, are on the verge of dying out in Taiwan
as few people speak them. Most of Taiwan's Hakka people, numbering
about 3 million, speak one of the two other major dialects, namely
the Si-hsien or Hai-lu dialects.</P>
      <P>Former CHA Chairwoman Yeh Chu-lan once said that the endangered
Hakka dialects, particularly the Shao-an dialect, are like Taiwan's
endemic land-locked salmon which faces extinction if replenishment
action is not taken to save it.</P>
      <P>The first of the three proposed Hakka dialect teaching centers
was formally inaugurated at Tunghsing Elementary School in the rural
township of Lunpei in Yunlin County Wednesday in a ceremony presided
over by CHA Vice Chairman Chuang Ching-hua.</P>
      <P>Chuang said the tasks of the center will include teaching the
Shao-an dialect, compiling a Shao-an dictionary, and setting up a
cyber data bank and a teaching corner on Hakka language and culture
in general and the Shao-an dialect in particular.</P>
      <P>The two other Hakka language teaching centers are expected to be
inaugurated later this month in Hsinchu City and Taichung County,
respectively, Chuang noted.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the ceremony, Tunghsing Elementary School
principal Chen Hsin-huang said that Hakka people of Shao-an origin
mostly reside in the rural townships of Siluo, Erlun and Lunpei in
the south-central county of Yunlin. Only the elderly Hakka people
there know how to speak the Shao-an dialect, he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the Shao-an dialect contains many words and
pronunciations that are similar to languages that originated in
central mainland China, including the Hoklo dialect on which
Taiwanese is based. He said this proves that the Hakka people and the
Taiwanese people have common ancestors who came from central China
near the Yellow River.</P>
      <P>To beef up the language center, Chen said, teachers and
volunteers will also step up field studies and material collections
in an effort to preserve the Hakka culture as much as possible.</P>
      <P>Although there isn't an exact figure on the Hakka population in
Taiwan, the Hakka people are believed to number at least 2.86
million.</P>
      <P>After a detailed survey of residents of 368 cities, counties and
townships nationwide over the past year, the CHA found that the
number of Hakka people and people of Hakka origin in Taiwan totals
6.08 million, representing 26.9 percent of the country's entire
population.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, about 1.66 million people in Taiwan who
are of Hakka origin had not been considered as Hakka people. Of these
people, many cannot speak any of the Hakka dialects.</P>
      <P>Some 42.5 percent of the survey respondents said that only those
people who are of Hakka origin and can speak a Hakka dialect can be
considered Hakka.</P>
      <P>In addition, 85 percent of the Hakka people think that their
mother tongue has increasingly lost ground in Taiwan due to a variety
of factors. About 72 percent of the Hakka people surveyed said they
are proud to be Hakka, although 46 percent said that they would not
mention their ethnic origin without first being asked.</P>
      <P>The Hakka people, whose ancestors originated in central China
more than 1,000 years ago, have been scattered around the world since
the early 19th century due to their trademark characteristics of
hard-work and perseverance.</P>
      <P>Last year, three top political leaders in Taiwan discovered that
they all have Hakka ancestors from the same area in today's Zhaoan
County in the mainland Chinese province of Fujian.</P>
      <P>After a series of activities heralding Hakka culture, President
Chen Shui-bian had his ancestry traced back to the village of Baiye
in Taiping Township, Zhaoan County. According to the Chen clan family
tree records, President Chen is a descendant of the first official
dispatched by the Tang emperor to explore the southern lands during
the Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.).</P>
      <P>President Chen is the ninth generation offspring of Chen Wu
(1739-1796) , the first Chen ancestor to cross the Taiwan Strait and
settle in Taiwan, according to the Chen family tree.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice President Annette Lu said in January 2003 that
she is half Hakka as her ancestors on her mother's side came from
Zhaoan, which is a well-known Hakka area. "Hakka" means "the guest
people" in Mandarin Chinese.</P>
      <P>The Hakka people were so defined during the Yuan Dynasty
(1277-1367) when residents from central and north-central China fled
to the south to escape famine and calamity.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun's ancestors have been traced to a village
only some 12 kilometers from where the president's ancestors resided.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR CONSULTATIONS AMONG PARTIES FOR STABILITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chen on Wednesday called for consultations between the ruling and
opposition parties for the sake of the nation's political and
economic stability.</P>
      <P>Lien, fresh from the "pan-blue alliance's" strong showing in
Saturday's legislative elections in which the alliance of the KMT,
the People First Party (PFP) and the New Party won a majority of
seats, made the remarks during a regular KMT Central Standing
Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>He said that the for the sake of political, economic as well as
cross-Taiwan Strait stability, the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and the opposition parties must cooperate.</P>
      <P>"One should not misconstrue such consultations as being aimed at
grabbing power, but instead at sharing responsibility," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that the DPP, hemmed by its de-sinicization
campaign and independence ideology, is incapable of handling
relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. With the KMT's
new mandate after the elections, the party wants to take the
opportunity to contribute in this matter, he said.</P>
      <P>On a merger of the "pan-blue alliance" parties, Lien noted that
the KMT has promised its supporters that it will continue to push to
achieve the goal with "patience and determination."</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong said after the elections that the KMT
had shut the door on a merger. He didn't elaborate, but reports said
that he and Lien had not been on speaking terms since mid-November
because of bickering over the allocation of the more than NT$100
million (US$3.1 million) subsidies for the "Lien-Soong" ticket in the
March 20 presidential elections.</P>
      <P>Soong was also reportedly angry because the "pan-blue alliance"
voter-allocation strategy shut the PFP out. The KMT garnered 79 of
the 225 Legislative Yuan seats in Saturday's elections, or 11 seats
more than in the previous elections, mostly at the expense of the
PFP, which managed to gain only 34 seats, or 12 less than in the
previous elections.</P>
      <P>A KMT-arranged meeting among the heads of the KMT, the PFP and
the New Party for this week was postponed after Soong's trip to the
United States Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP legislative whip Liu Wen-hsiung expressed that the
party-to-party consultations proposal is a good idea. However, he
added that the consultations should be completely transparent. The
parties should set an agenda, embark on pre-talk meetings, and start
by building mutual trust, he said.</P>
      <P>Liu said that issues that to be discussed in such consultations
should include the system of government, responsible politics,
national policies, as well as how to improve the economy, beef up
defense and better cross-strait relations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has devoted much
of his time to soul-searching since Saturday's legislative elections
and has not met with politicians as local news media reported, a
senior Presidential Office official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>James Huang, a Presidential Office deputy secretary-general, was
responding to media reports that President Chen has met with several
political heavyweights at his official residence after the "pan-green
camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) failed to reach its target of winning a
majority in Saturday's legislative election.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Chen had met with former Vice Premier
Lin Hsin-yi and two Judicial Yuan vice presidents -- Cheng Chung-mo
and Lai Ying-jaw -- in the past few days to discuss a possible
Cabinet reshuffle to cope with the post-election political situation.</P>
      <P>"The reports are not factual, " Huang said, adding that the only
person that the president has received at his official residence
since the elections is his mentor Lee Hung-hsi.</P>
      <P>Lee, a scholar versed in constitutional affairs who now heads the
Ketagalan Institute -- a school founded by President Chen to nurture
a new generation of leaders in public affairs, paid a visit to Chen
Sunday to encourage him not to be daunted by the elections setback.

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will elect a new party chairman before Feb. 1, 2005, DPP acting
chairman Ker Chien-ming said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ker, DPP party whip at the Legislative Yuan, said that the new
party chairman will be directly elected by DPP members.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian resigned from the DPP chairmanship
Tuesday to take responsibility for the DPP's failure to win a
majority in the Legislative Yuan in last Saturday's elections.</P>

acting chairman immediately after President Chen resigned.</P>
      <P>Ker said that the DPP Central Executive Committee is scheduled to

      <P>Meanwhile, Ker said that a Cabinet reshuffle is not expected

    <HEADLINE>ROC-VANUATU DIPLOMATIC TIES STILL STAND: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Vanuatu parliament has not nullified
formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan and the bilateral ties are
still valid, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said that although Taiwan's diplomatic
personnel have departed Vanuatu for Fiji under a cloud of
uncertainty, this does not mean that the formal diplomatic relations
are now invalid.</P>
      <P>Lu said the new Vanuatu Cabinet, which was formed last weekend,
has not announced or informed Taiwan about any flip-flop on bilateral
ties.</P>
      <P>Vanuatu's parliament ousted Prime Minister Serge Vohor out of
office Saturday in a no-confidence vote and a new Cabinet headed by
Ham Lini has been formed.</P>
      <P>Lu said that so far, Taipei has not heard a word from the new
Vanuatu government about any change in the Taiwan-Vanuatu diplomatic
relations established Nov. 3.</P>
      <P>Lu discounted a claim by the Beijing authorities earlier in the
day that Vanuatu will repeal all accords and consensuses reached with
Taiwan, adding that the Taiwan-Vanuatu formal diplomatic ties are not
built on claims made by Beijing.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the ministry will not give up its efforts at
this stage and that the Republic of China embassy staff will stay
"around the corner" to observe developments and "fight to the last
minute."</P>
      <P>The MOFA staff can return to Vanuatu at any minute, Lu noted.</P>
      <P>Vohor and ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Tan Sun Chen signed a
joint communique in Taipei Nov. 3 to establish diplomatic relations,
making Vanuatu the ROC's 27th ally.</P>
      <P>The diplomatic ties, however, have been since hanging in the
balance, mainly as a result of Beijing's interference. With Beijing
continuing to try to woo Vanuatu away from Taiwan, a cross-strait
diplomatic tug-of-war has been playing out in the South Pacific
island state.</P>
      <P>The MOFA is closely monitoring how the new Vanuatu Cabinet
handles its relations with Taiwan, Lu said, adding that there are two
possible developments. The first is that Vanuatu will maintain formal
diplomatic relations with Taiwan after "having thought it through"
and realizing that this is in its best interests in terms of its
long-term development.</P>
      <P>The second is that Vanuatu will sever ties with Taiwan and accept
financial assistance promised by the mainland if it does so. Beijing
is willing to offer Vanuatu US$32 million, and more if it severs ties
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Affairs Minister Michael Y.M. Kau said over the
weekend that he is not optimistic about the development of
ROC-Vanuatu relations in light of the pro-Beijing background of Prime
Minister Lini.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former first lady and widow of the late
President Chiang Ching-kuo died of pulmonary disease Wednesday at
Taipei Veterans Generals Hospital. She was 90.</P>
      <P>The Russia-born Faina Chiang, whose Chinese name is Chiang
Fang-liang, had a history of obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke
and asthma. She was admitted to the hospital in early October after
suffering from inflammation of the windpipe and acute asthma.</P>
      <P>Chiang had led a secluded life over the past decade because of
her poor health. Her last public appearance was when she paid tribute
to her late husband at his temporary mausoleum in Touliao, Taoyuan,
in April this year.</P>
      <P>The public also had a rare glimpse of the reticent former first
lady in her waning days when a local newspaper ran a photo of her
offspring and former guards and friends celebrating her 90th birthday
in May.</P>
      <P>The former first lady met her husband, who was sent to Russia for
study but was later banished for political reasons, while both were
working in a factory in the Ural mountains in 1933. They got married
two years later. After their eldest son, Chiang Hsiao-wen, was born
in Russia in 1937, they returned to mainland China and lived there
for 12 years.</P>
      <P>During her 53-year marriage, she kept her distance from politics,
although the two Chiangs -- late president Chiang Kai-shek and his
son Chiang Ching-kuo -- maintained a dynastic grip on Taiwan's
politics after they retreated to the island in 1949.</P>
      <P>Instead, she remained a quiet and modest person with her family
being the focus of her life.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party James Soong, who formerly served as
Chiang Ching-kuo's English secretary, once said that Chiang Ching-kuo
and his wife maintained a simple and frugal life even at the zenith
of their power.</P>
      <P>Chiang raised three sons and one daughter. After her husband died
in 1988, she lost her three sons consecutively in the following eight
years. This series of blows made her even more reticent, sources
closed to her said. She is survived by her daughter Chiang
Hsiao-chang and a dozen grandchildren and great grandchildren.</P>
      <P>In 1992, Minsk city mayor of Belarus visited Taiwan, the first
time that Chiang had met someone from her hometown since leaving
there in 1937.</P>
      <P>Although in declining health in recent years, she went to her
husband's temporary mausoleum whenever her physical condition
permitted. At the 15th anniversary of Ching-kuo's death in 2003, she
went as usual despite a severe cold weather.</P>
      <P>Many Taiwan people were disheartened to see the frail lady, in a
wheelchair and intubated, being helped to stand up before Ching-kuo's
picture in the mausoleum.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu visited
the former first lady at the Veterans General Hospital, and the vice
president also praised her as a gracious Taiwan woman.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Leaders of government and major political
parties in Taiwan shared their condolences Wednesday on the death of
Faina Chiang, widow of late President Chiang Ching-kuo.</P>
      <P>Chiang died of respiratory failure aged 90 at the Taipei Veterans
General Hospital Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Soon after receiving the news, President Chen Shui-bian,
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou all went to the hospital to extend their condolences to her
family.</P>
      <P>Chen said he regrets the death of the former first lady, who he
described as a "role model for women."</P>
      <P>Though born and raised in Russia, Chiang had the virtues of a
traditional Chinese woman and made her family her top priority,
spending most of her time taking care of her husband and children,
Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Chiang spent most of her life in
Taiwan with the late president and that she believes her virtuous and
gentle manner will be missed by the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said the government will offer
every possible help to assist with Chiang's funeral, while KMT
spokesman Chang Jung-kung said the party will set up a special task
force to help arrange the funeral.</P>
      <P>Chang said the KMT expresses its deepest condolences and sadness
on Chiang's death, praising her as an ordinary yet great first lady
who was always humble, thrifty, mild and patriotic.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong, who is on a
trip to the United States, phoned to send his condolences to the
bereaved family.</P>
      <P>Soong said he visited Chiang before he departed for the United
States and never expected it would be his last meeting with her.</P>
      <P>Soong, who served as an English secretary to the late president
for 15 years, noted that the former first lady led a simple life and
never interfered in national affairs.</P>
      <P>Soong said she seldom asked the late president's staff to do her
any favors except for when she wanted to write in English to some
foreign friends.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ruling Democratic Progressive Party spokesman Cheng
Wen-tsan and Taiwan Solidarity Union Secretary-General Lin Chih-jia
also extended their condolences on Chiang's death on behalf of their
respective parties.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan has no plans to pay a visit to mainland China presently, KMT
spokesman Chang Jung-kung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang quoted Lien as saying at a KMT Central Standing Committee
meeting Wednesday that the KMT -- the backbone of the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, the People First Party and the New
Party -- will make even greater efforts to optimize cross-Taiwan
Strait peace and stability now that the "pan-blues" have retained a
majority in the Legislative Yuan after Saturday's legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Lien, however, said he has no plans to visit the mainland,
although he said prior to the presidential election in March that he
would like to travel to Beijing to facilitate cross-strait
reconciliation if he were elected, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's State Council Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Li
Weiyi said at a press conference in Beijing earlier the day that the
mainland has been calling and will continue to call for Taiwan
politicians, regardless of political affiliation, to visit Beijing to

    <HEADLINE>'PAN-BLUE' COALITION A CERTAINTY: LEGISLATOR-ELECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A coalition or merger of the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" parties of the Kuomintang (KMT) , People First
Party (PFP) and the New Party is the mainstream consensus among the
parties for the cause of political stability, New Party
legislator-elect Joanna Lei said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blues" must consolidate themselves and "there are no ifs
or buts about it, " said Lei, hostess of a TV talk show, who has a
prominent resume behind her, including being the first Asian woman to
become a vice president of the American Broadcasting Corp.
(ABC).</P>
      <P>Lei, nevertheless, reminded the "pan-blue" leaders that a
three-party coalition is by no means a distribution of power or
"booty sharing."</P>
      <P>She called for "pan-blue" leaders to deliver on their campaign
promises now that the "pan-blues" have retained a majority in the
Legislative Yuan after Saturday's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>"Any political figure who does not heed public opinion will
eventually be dumped by the voters," she asserted.</P>
      <P>Lei's remarks were believed to be directed at PFP Chairman James
Soong, who has wavered in his stance on the much-discussed "pan-blue"
merger after Saturday's legislative elections, in which the PFP
suffered a major defeat by losing 12 seats.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the relatively much smaller New Party scored an
enviable performance in the elections, with the party taking four
seats out of seven candidates who ran, after it adopted an election
strategy of having its candidates run under the KMT banner, except
Legislator Wu Cheng-tien who ran a victorious re-election campaign as
a New Party candidate in Kinmen, a "win-win" approach that pushed the
"pan-blues" ahead to win the majority.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun ordered law enforcement
authorities Wednesday to continue to investigate vote-buying cases
reported during the legislative elections last week.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the first Cabinet meeting since Saturday's elections,
Yu said the authorities must make sure no voters were paid bribes
after the polls, which has become a popular new method of vote buying
among corrupt politicians.</P>
      <P>Yu said there were some 5,000 alleged vote-buying cases reported
during the run-up to the elections and that the authorities should
complete their investigation as soon as possible and bring the cases
to trial.</P>
      <P>He instructed the Ministry of the Interior review the
discrepancies existing in the country's election and recall laws and
to work out draft amendments to the laws to address the problem.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, the ministry must coordinate with the
Legislative Yuan to ensure that a bill governing the election method
of the ad hoc National Assembly is passed as soon as possible in
order to facilitate the preparation for a National Assembly election.</P>
      <P>Members of the National Assembly are supposed to be elected by
May 26 to consider a constitutional amendment package passed by the
Legislative Yuan Aug. 23.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yu requested all Cabinet members to coordinate with
legislators to assist the passage of 33 priority bills, including the
2005 central government budget bill, before the term of incumbent
legislators ends in January.</P>
      <P>Yu said these 33 bills are very urgent and important and must be

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS UNDERSCORE TAIWANESE IDENTITY: CABINET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The just-concluded legislative elections
have further underscored Taiwan's separate identity and the
unmarketability of Beijing's "one country, two systems" unification
scheme, Cabinet spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after mainland China's Taiwan Affairs
Office (TAO) claimed that peace with Taiwan can only be ensured if
the island's authorities agree to unify with the mainland and that
the top Taiwan leader's flirting with statehood "has been the source
of chaos in the Asia-Pacific region."</P>
      <P>In Beijing's first official response to Taiwan's legislative
elections, in which the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
its pro-independence allies failed to win a majority, TAO spokesman
Li Weiyi said there can be no peace if Taiwan becomes independent.</P>
      <P>Li further said there can only be a change in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations "if the authorities in Taiwan recognize that there is only
one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of it, and if they give
up their Taiwan independence stance and stop Taiwan independence
activities."</P>
      <P>Commenting on Li's remarks, Chen said the mainland should not
misinterpret the results of Taiwan's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Whatever the electoral results, Chen said, the elections per se
signified Taiwan's own identity as opposed to that of the mainland.
Moreover, he said, only one of those who publicly support
Beijing's "one county, two systems" overture was elected in the
legislative elections. This, coupled with the fact that few candidates
dared to mention Beijing's cherished "one China" principle or its
"one country, two systems" scheme in the run-up to the elections,
indicates that Beijing's unification overture is unpopular and
unmarketable in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The Beijing authorities should not misread the electoral results
and the mainstream public opinion in Taiwan," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also rebutted Beijing's accusation of President Chen Shui-bian
as the "source of chaos in the Asia-Pacific region, " saying that the
mainland is actually the biggest threat to Asia-Pacific security.</P>
      <P>"China's military budget reaches US$50 billion to US$70 billion
annually and the amount has continued to grow at a double-digit rate,
posing a grave threat to Asia-Pacific security, " Chen said, adding
that Beijing has also deployed more than 500 ballistic missiles
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the DPP administration's fundamental policy of
promoting peace, stability and rapprochement across the Taiwan Strait
as clearly expounded in the president's May 20 inauguration speech,
Oct. 10 National Day address and statements concerning Taiwan's
constitutional re-engineering plan, has remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>He urged the mainland leaders to work with Taiwan with wisdom to
create a viable mechanism for peaceful cross-strait engagement and
development.</P>
      <P>The most urgent task for the moment is for the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to negotiate the opening of direct cross-strait charter
flights during the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday to facilitate
the return of a large number of Taiwan businessmen operating on the
mainland for family reunions, Chen said, adding that the opening of
two-way, non-stop holiday charter flights could benefit both sides.</P>
      <P>With Beijing's consent, Taiwan carriers operated special charter
flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau
during the 2003 Chinese New Year period. The services were not
offered during the 2004 Chinese New Year holiday because Beijing
insisted that mainland carriers be allowed to also provide the same
flight services while declining to negotiate the necessary technical
details with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ROC government said that as the opening of two-way, non-stop
cross-strait charter flight services involves the exercise of public
authority, prior negotiations are necessary. The upcoming lunar New
Year holiday falls between Feb. 6, 2005 and Feb. 13.</P>
      <P>At Wednesday's news conference, TAO spokesman Li Weiyi didn't
address whether Beijing would allow direct cross-strait
charter flights during the forthcoming Chinese New Year holiday,
saying only that Beijing's position is unchanged.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong has reiterated that if the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) wants a merger with the PFP, it will have to cast away its past
burdens and hold out new vision for the public.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks upon arriving at the San Francisco
International Airport.</P>
      <P>Despite the call for a merger of the "pan-blue alliance" of the
KMT, the PFP and the New Party after it managed to maintain a
majority by garnering 114 seats in the 225-seat Legislative Yuan in
Saturday's elections, Soong said after the elections that it was the
KMT who had shut the door to a merger.</P>
      <P>Reports said that Soong and Lien have not been on speaking terms
since mid-November because of bickering over the allocation of a
NT$100 million (US$3.1 million) subsidy for the Lien-Soong ticket in
the March 20 presidential election and the voter-allocation scheme
used Saturday that shut out the PFP.</P>
      <P>The KMT garnered 79 seats, 11 seats more than in the previous
elections, mostly at the expense of the PFP, which managed 34 seats,
12 seats fewer than in the previous elections.</P>
      <P>Soong, who said he would not cling to the party chairmanship or
play second fiddle in the KMT, said Tuesday that he was not jockeying
for any position.</P>
      <P>But he said the KMT has to first display its sincerity by drawing
a line between "the corrupt `black gold' politics of the era of
former chairman Lee Teng-hui," and work out a reform plan, or the PFP
will pursue its own path.</P>
      <P>Soong also named three urgent tasks faced by Taiwan --
cross-Taiwan Strait reconciliation, ethnic reconciliation at
home and economic development.</P>
      <P>On newspaper speculation that the PFP could cooperate with the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), he said categorically that
"it is out of the question."</P>
      <P>Soong criticized the DPP for its tilt toward the Taiwan
independence and for what he described as its "disrespect to the
Constitution" and said that the two parties could not possibly
cooperate. Only in public policy will the PFP consider such
cooperation with the DPP, he said.</P>
      <P>Soong is here to visit his family and he also plans to visit the
East Coast of the United States.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan proposed Wednesday the formation of a coalition government of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the KMT.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said the KMT insists that any
members who join the new Cabinet must do so in the name of the party
and is opposed to any members joining the government in their
personal capacities.</P>
      <P>Chang said there should be a mechanism for cooperation between
the KMT and DPP under which they can exchange views on the formation
of a coalition government.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly meeting of the party's Central Standing
Committee, Lien said the ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan must
cooperate for the sake of national development.</P>
      <P>Lien said the KMT does not wish to see a repeat in the future of
the ruling-opposition confrontation that has been going on over the
past four-and-a-half years, which he said has left the country in a
deadlock.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that a new legislature was elected in Saturday's
elections, Lien urged the DPP to respect the legislative majority and
draw up its new Cabinet lineup according to the outcome of the
elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which won 79 legislative seats in the elections, is the
second-largest party in the 225-member Legislative Yuan after the
DPP, which seized 89 seats. However, the KMT, together with its "pan
blue alliance" allies the People First Party and New Party, controls
a legislative majority with 114 of the 225 legislative seats.</P>
      <P>Lien said it will be the responsibility of the next premier and
Cabinet to boost the country's economy, stabilize cross-Taiwan Strait
relations and improve the life of the people.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that the KMT's proposal to form a coalition
government is a means of sharing responsibility and should not be
mistaken as a bid to jockey for power.</P>
      <P>He called on the DPP to drop its petty mindset and accept the
goodwill offered by the KMT.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's exports earned US$18.612 billion
in foreign reserves in November, while imports cost US$19.186
billion, both posting record single-month highs, according to central
bank statistics.</P>
      <P>The figures formed an unfavorable trade balance of US$574
million, the largest amount since 1992, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Given the flourishing development of the international economy,
Taiwan's imports of agricultural raw materials and machinery
equipment grew, while crude oil prices on the international market
rose in the past months. These were two major reasons that led to the
unfavorable balance, according to a central bank official.</P>
      <P>However, accumulated earned foreign reserves from exports during
the period from January to November reached US$182.822 billion, while
the spending of foreign reserves on imports totaled US$172.806
billion, resulting in a favorable balance of US$10.016 billion, the
statistics show.</P>
      <P>The statistics note that the two figures registered growth of

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMIC FACTORS DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM HAVING CHILDREN: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 15 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic factors and high education costs
have discouraged local couples from having a second child, according
to the results of a public opinion survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The telephone survey of 2,546 randomly chosen people aged between
20 and 39 was conducted by the Department of Health in September to
explore local people's attitude toward having children.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 70 percent of those interviewed agreed
with the notion that having two children is ideal, but 51 percent of
those who have already had a child do not want to have a second one.</P>
      <P>The willingness to have a second child was especially low among
women aged over 30 and with middle-level education, survey results
showed. Major reasons cited by them were that they didn't have enough
financial resources to have a second child and that education costs
were too expensive.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that those residing in urban areas with a
monthly family income of less than NT$80,000 were most likely to opt
for "having only one child due to economic reasons."</P>
      <P>Thirty percent of the respondents said that having no children is
best.</P>
      <P>Asked what the government should do to encourage couples to have
more children given that the nation's birth rate has declined by 50
percent over the past four decades, the respondents cited four
measures -- improving the education system and lowering education
costs; improving the social welfare system; improving public order,
and offering financial aid or incentives to encourage couple to have
more children.</P>

      <P>A 21-member mainland Chinese delegation,

Government, arrived in the Taiwan-held frontline island of Kinmen
Wednesday via the direct "mini three links" route for a three-day
visit.</P>
      <P>It was the first official delegation from Fujian since mainland
Chinese authorities began earlier this month to allow Fujian
residents to travel to Kinmen for sightseeing trips via the "mini

      <P>Taiwan opened its two offshore defense outposts of Kinmen and
Matsu for direct trade, shipping and mail links, commonly known as
"mini three links, " with Fujian province Jan. 2, 2001. Until early

    <HEADLINE>MERGER OF KMT AND PFP IS INEVITABLE: KMT CHAIRMAN LIEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The path that will lead to the merger of
the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) is one that the
parties will inevitably travel, KMT Chairman Lien Chan said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lien said his party is resolute in seeing this happen and will
stay the course with patience, persistence and enthusiasm.</P>
      <P>He urged former KMT members who deserted the party for various
reasons in the last decade to return to its fold and work together
with the party.</P>
      <P>Recalling a resolution by the KMT Central Standing Committee on
May 19 that advocated a merger with the PFP, a KMT splinter, Lien
said his party would not back out of the commitment because it would
disappoint party supporters.</P>
      <P>Any political group that reneges on its promises and swims
against the tide will lose its credibility with voters, Lien said.</P>
      <P>The reunion of the two parties will satisfy the desire of their
supporters, and the KMT will do whatever it can to bring this about,
Lien said.</P>
      <P>He made the comment two days after PFP Chairman James Soong
backed down on his pre-election promise to merge hisp arty with
KMT, saying that a merger was out of the question because, among
other things, the KMT failed to fulfill its promise to allocate
voters between the two parties evenly.</P>
      <P>The two parties command a slim majority of 114 seats between them
in the new 225-seat legislature, with the KMT gaining 10 more seats
over the last legislature, while the PFP lost 12 seats.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that the party has a new vision after it performed
better than expected in the Dec. 11 legislative elections, declaring
that the KMT is willing to form a coalition with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party to rule the country.</P>
      <P>He promised to rejuvenate the party by bringing in a new leader,
streamlining the party apparatus to make it smaller and more
efficient, and dispose of party assets that have dubious origins in a
transparent manner.</P>

that the government administration has an ample room to improve.</P>
      <P>In a written statement read by Vice President Annette Lu at the

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING HAS MISREAD TAIWAN'S LEGISLATIVE ELECTIONS: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's misinterpretation of
Taiwan's just-concluded legislative elections is counterproductive to
relations across the Taiwan Strait, the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The mainland policy planning agency issued the statement in a
news release after mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) said
earlier in the day that peace with Taiwan can only be ensured if the
island's authorities agree to unify with the mainland and that top
Taiwan leader's flirting with statehood "has been the source of chaos
in the Asia-Pacific region."</P>
      <P>In Beijing's first official response to Taiwan's legislative
elections, in which the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
its pro-independence allies failed to win a majority, TAO spokesman
Li Weiyi said there can be no peace if Taiwan becomes independent.</P>
      <P>Li further said there can only be a change in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations "if the authorities in Taiwan recognize that there is only
one China in the world and Taiwan is a part of it, and if they give
up their Taiwan independence stance and stop Taiwan independence
activities."</P>
      <P>In response, the MAC said the international community has offered
positive comments on Taiwan's Dec. 11 legislative elections. For
instance, U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Monday
that Taiwan's weekend legislative elections showed the strength and
vitality of the island's democracy.</P>
      <P>The MAC said in its statement that mainland authorities have made
"unrealistic and erroneous" interpretations mainly because they can't
understand the values and meaning of democratic elections.</P>
      <P>The MAC also said it would not respond to the TAO's irrational
criticism against Taiwan's top national leader.</P>
      <P>Instead, the MAC urged mainland China to negotiate with Taiwan
for the opening of two-way, non-stop charter flights across the
Taiwan Strait for the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday to facilitate
the return of a large number of Taiwan businessmen operating on the
mainland for family reunions.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has unveiled principles and a feasible
consultative formula, the MAC said Beijing should show its sincerity
to improve cross-strait ties by deeds.</P>
      <P>With Beijing's consent, Taiwan carriers operated special charter
flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau
during the 2003 Chinese New Year period. The services were not
offered during the 2004 Chinese New Year holiday because Beijing
insisted that mainland carriers also be allowed to provide the same
flight services while declining to negotiate the necessary technical
details with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ROC government said that as the opening of two-way, non-stop
cross-strait charter flight services involves the exercise of public
authority, prior negotiations are necessary. The upcoming lunar new
year holiday falls between Feb. 6, 2005 and Feb. 13.</P>
      <P>At Wednesday's news conference, TAO spokesman Li Weiyi didn't say
whether Beijing would allow direct cross-strait charter flights
during the forthcoming Chinese New Year holiday, saying only that
Beijing's position is unchanged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE '319 COMMISSION' RULED PARTLY UNCONSTITUTIONAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Grand Justices undercut a
commission formed to look into the March 19 shooting of President
Chen Shui-bian by declaring its judicial investigation powers modeled
on that of prosecutors unconstitutional Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The council said in an interpretation of the Constitution that
the Legislative Yuan is working within its authority to set up a
commission to conduct investigations but that it could not give the
commission the power the legislature itself doesn't have.</P>
      <P>The council declared parts of Article Eight and Article 13 of the
Organic Statute for the Truth Investigation Commission
unconstitutional and, therefore, are no longer effective from the
day the interpretation is handed down.</P>
      <P>The paragraphs of Article Eight that were declared
unconstitutional tried to give the commission the same powers as
those of prosecutors and military prosecutors in carrying out
investigations into the March 19 shooting, and no individual or
government organization may invoke whatever law to exempt themselves
from giving testimony, handing over documents or extending assistance
to the commission.</P>
      <P>These paragraphs also attempted to give the commission the power
to impose fine and overseas traveling bans on people when it
considered such actions necessary.</P>
      <P>The paragraphs of Article 13 that were declared unconstitutional
tried to give the commission the power to prosecute persons involved
in the shooting.</P>
      <P>The council also said the Legislative Yuan's authority to form an
investigation commission should be exercised by the legislature using
due process of law; this means the members of the commission should
be appointed by the president of the Legislative Yuan with the
approval of the legislature.</P>
      <P>The interpretation was made at the request of lawmakers of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) who claimed the statute was
bulldozed through the legislature by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and the People First Party (PFP) and was unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>They also asked the council to impose a temporary moratorium on
the commission's operations before the council made
its ruling on the statute's constitutionality.</P>
      <P>The council turned down their second request on the grounds that
a temporary moratorium is unnecessary now that its decision on the
statute's constitutionality is handed down.</P>
      <P>The DPP was pleased with the council's decision, saying it bore
out their repeated claims that the commission had infringed on the
powers of the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>They asked the commission to stop operations immediately now that
it is virtually powerless after the two articles empowering it to
investigate the shooting were declared null and void.</P>
      <P>Minister without Portfolio Hsu Chih-hsiung lauded the council's
decision, calling the Legislative Yuan to address the
unconstitutional parts of the statute immediately, and the commission
should not probe the March 19 shooting outside its authority.</P>
      <P>Since the current commission was packed with members named by the
two opposition parties without the approval of the legislature, Hsu
called it an unconstitutional commission and one that should stop
operations immediately.</P>
      <P>Shih Chi-yang, the KMT-appointed convener of the commission said
the council's decision has robbed the commission of its major
investigating powers and has made it even more difficult to find the
truth behind the March 19 shooting.</P>
      <P> PFP lawmaker Liu Wen-hsiung criticized the council for what he
said was just serving politics, adding that it betrays the
government's attempts to block any investigations to find out what
really happened regarding the shooting.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, a spokesman for the KMT said his party regrets
the council's decision, adding that the government's all-out effort
to disrupt the investigation of the shooting only fuels the public's
suspects that the shooting was a political scheme.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu and Amy Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Thursday welcomed the decision by the Japanese government to issue a
visa to former Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>Lin Huan-chang, director of the MOFA's Department of East Asian
and Pacific Affairs, said the ministry had seen related reports and
welcomed the decision.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that Lee's trip to Japan will be private in nature
and that the ministry has not helped arrange the visit.</P>
      <P>Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda said Thursday
that the government has decided in principle to issue a tourist visa
to Lee.</P>
      <P>Hosoda said Lee requested a visa to take a sightseeing trip with
his family to Japan and that the Japanese government decided to issue
him a visa, which he said is not expected to affect chilled relations
between Japan and mainland China in the wake of the incursion into
Japanese waters by a Chinese submarine last month.</P>
      <P>Japanese media reported that Lee and his family want to travel to
hot spring areas in Japan and that the Japanese government saw no
reason to deny him a visa now that Taiwan's legislative elections
have concluded.</P>
      <P>Lee had revealed in September that he hoped to go to Japan for
sightseeing. Japanese officials from the Liberal Democratic Party
which is friendly toward Taiwan then sounded out the Japanese
government's reaction to Lee's request. The Japanese government
responded by asking Lee to delay his application until after the Dec.
11 legislative elections out of concerns that the matter might affect
the outcome of the elections.</P>
      <P>Japanese media quoted government sources as saying that Japan has
notified China through diplomatic channels of its decision to grant
Lee a visa, and that China, which considers Lee to be an advocate of
Taiwan independence, seemed to be upset by the news.</P>
      <P>Lee's last visit to Japan was in 2001 to receive treatment for a
heart condition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUNUN HUNTERS RETURN TO DANDAH FOREST REGION AFTER 15-YEAR HIATUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nantou,  central  Taiwan,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four aboriginal Bunun
hunters headed out on their first hunting trip in the mountains of
the Dandah Forest Region in 15 years Wednesday after the Hsinyi Rural
Township Office in Nantou County recently lifted a ban on hunting in
the region.</P>
      <P>Bunun tribesman Si Wen-chung and his aide set off on their
four-day hunting trip into the mountainous Dandah Forest Region near
an upstream location of the Chuoshuei Creek.</P>
      <P>Prior to their departure, Si and his aide offered rice wine and
betel nut to the gods, praying for a successful hunt and a safe
return for themselves.</P>
      <P>"It's like being back in the good old days, " Si said in high
spirits.</P>
      <P>Another Bunun hunter, Sung Ching-nan, and his aide started their
journey from another creek. Sung, an old hand in upstream exploration
and rock climbing, was set on trying his luck in areas near the
water.</P>
      <P>The prey that Si and Sung are hunting for include wild goats,
Formosan sambars, Formosan Reeve's muntjacs, squirrels and several
feathered species.</P>
      <P>Sung said he doesn't expect the hunting trip to be as "thrilling"
as he wants, "because there are too many restrictions and
regulations."</P>
      <P>The Bunun people, who have made the high mountains in central
Taiwan their home for hundreds of years, are said to be the best
hunters among the 12 officially-recognized aboriginal tribes in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the past, according to the Bunun elders, hunting in the
mountains was thrilling and rewarding, although there were many
taboos. The taboos included continuing a hunting trip even after
missing the prey with the first shot, letting a female touch the
hunting weapon, eating garlic or hot chili before hunting, killing
pregnant animals, and trespassing into others' hunting grounds.</P>
      <P>The Hsinyi Rural Township Office recently lifted the hunting ban
after consulting with wildlife and forestation specialists from
National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) , allowing a total of 32
aboriginal hunters to return to the mountains to hunt for a certain
amount of prey in a trial period of 10 days beginning Dec. 15.</P>
      <P>Hsinyi Rural Township Chief Tian Ping-yuan quoted NTNU academics
as saying that wild animal numbers in the Dandah Forest Region have
recovered over the past 15 years to the point of being able to
sustain limited hunting.</P>
      <P>However, over the past two days, wildlife conservationist groups
have expressed doubts about whether the lifting of the ban is a wise
move, saying that without proper protection measures, the re-opening
could signal the start of an ecological catastrophe.</P>
      <P>Brushing off such concerns, NTNU professor Wang Ying said that
after six years of field studies, the researchers found that allowing
hunting on a regulated basis would not disturb the ecosystem in the
mountains, given that the Bunun hunters traditionally know how to get
along with the Mother Nature and given that wild animal numbers have
sufficiently recovered to allow limited hunting.</P>
      <P>Regulated hunting can also serve as a means to stem poaching and
even inhumane slaughter, Wang added.</P>
      <P>Echoing Wang's ideas, Tian said that the Hsinyi Rural Township
Office may consider in the future opening the Dandah Forest Region to
"paid game, " allowing hunters from other counties to hunt in the
region for a fee. His office may also train rangers to offer
bird-watching and animal-watching tours for ordinary tourists, Tian
added.</P>

      <P>An opposition People First Party (PFP)
legislator Thursday expressed his opposition to any individual
attempt to jockey for the position of Legislative Yuan vice speaker
among his colleagues.</P>
      <P>Lee Hung-chun voiced his opinion after some PFP legislators had
proposed that the party should vie for the post of vice speaker while
supporting a bid for the post of speaker by its ally, the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT).</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, PFP and New Party managed to
win a slim majority in the legislature in Saturday's elections by
garnering 114 of 225 legislative seats.</P>
      <P>Lee said no individual within the party should make a plan for
the race until a consensus on the issue is reached within the party.</P>
      <P>Otherwise, Lee said, it will create a negative impression that
the PFP is giving its support for the KMT in exchange for the
position of vice speaker.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ORBIS TAIWAN HELPS TRAIN 60 'SEED' EYE DOCTORS IN MYANMAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan branch of ORBIS International
has just completed an anti-blindness mission in Myanmar, successfully
recovering the sight for 30-odd people and training 60 "seed"
ophthalmologists.</P>
      <P>At a news conference held at the Taipei Mayor's Residence Arts
Salon to announce the achievements of the mission, Cliff Chien,
executive director of ORBIS Taiwan, said that about 25 percent of the
people in Myanmar are living below the poverty level, and some
250,000 of these being blind.</P>
      <P>ORBIS International is a non-profit organization dedicated to the
prevention of blindness and saving the sight of the visually
impaired.</P>
      <P>Chien said that two senior Taiwan ophthalmologists -- Dr. Liu
Jung-hung, president of the Cheng Hsin Rehabilitation Medical Center,
and Lu Ta-wen, chief of the Ophthalmology Department of Tri-Service
General Hospital -- joined an ORBIS Flying Eye Hospital program
earlier this month to help treat Burmese suffering from blindness or
other vision problems.</P>
      <P>During their stay in Myanmar Dec. 6-10, Liu and Lu performed
operations to heal glaucoma and cataracts on more than 30 Burmese,
including two medical doctors, and most of them have regained at
least some vision, Chien said.</P>
      <P>Liu and Lu also gave instructions to local Burmese health care
workers in the treatment and prevention of blindness to enable them
to become "seed" eye doctors who will in turn train other eye doctors
to better care for their compatriots, Chien added.</P>
      <P>The ORBIS Taiwan mission in Myanmar, the first of its kind, was
co-sponsored by the International Cooperation and Development Fund
(ICDF) under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to Chien.</P>
      <P>The Flying Eye Hospital program was also part of the annual World
Sight Day activities, which have regularly been sponsored by ORBIS
International, the World Health Organization (WHO), the International
Agency for the Prevention of Blindness, the Lion's Club
International, Rotary International and 10 other public interest
organizations from around the world.</P>
      <P>Of the 42 million people in Myanmar, about 252,000 suffer from
blindness or severe vision problems. Nationwide, there are only 183
eye doctors, 32 optometrists and 150 ophthalmology nurses, Chien
said.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, there are 45 million blind people around the
world and 135 million others with severe visual impairment, 90
precent of whom live in countries with inferior medical resources.</P>
      <P>Mohan Jacob Thazhathu, chief operating officer of ORBIS
International, who came to Taiwan in August for a promotional event,
cited an estimate by the WHO that blindness costs society some US$25
billion every year, with Southeast Asian countries bearing
approximately US$5.6 billion of that burden.</P>
      <P>The number of people suffering from blindness in the world can be
stopped from increasing further by merely investing US$200 million
per year in blindness prevention and treatment programs, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is much room for India and Taiwan to
further expand trade and investment exchanges, an Indian business
leader said in an exclusive interview with CNA recently.</P>
      <P>Although business has been flourishing between India and Taiwan,
two-way trade between the two countries amounted to only US$1.3
billion over the past two years, said Dilip Dandekar, an Indian
business leader who headed a delegation of the India Merchants'
Chamber (IMC) to Taiwan Dec. 12-15 to explore the market.</P>
      <P>India, with an abundance of computer engineers, is good at
software development, while Taiwan is the world's largest
manufacturer of computers, Dilip said, adding that there are great
prospects for the two countries to work together in this sector.</P>
      <P>India and Taiwan can also cooperate in other areas, including
medical equipment, pharmaceuticals, auto parts and machinery, Dilip
said.</P>
      <P>He noted that, India, the world's fourth-largest economy in terms
of purchasing power parity and the second fastest-growing economy,
has great potential for Taiwan investment. Infrastructure
development, including building of roads and ports, power generation
and distribution, as well as food processing industry, are areas that
are particularly suitable for Taiwan investment, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that both Taiwan and India cherish democracy and a market
economy, Dilip said this will facilitate their cooperation in
business.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the lack of diplomatic ties between Taipei
and New Delhi has posed some difficulties for business exchanges. For
example, he said, he had to turn to Taipei's representative office in
New Delhi for a visa to enter Taiwan, although he and his Indian
Merchants' Chamber are based in Mumbai.</P>
      <P>Also, he said, Taiwan refuses to issue multiple entry visas to
Indian people, making Taiwan relatively less attractive for Indian
business people than other Asian countries such as Japan or Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Hsin-hung, a department director of the think
tank Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research, said that although
India is a rising economy with huge market potential, most of its
domestic markets remain off limits for foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Compared with China, which is a "world factory, " India is a
"world market, " Chen said. This is the reason why he has discouraged
Taiwan investors from using the same business strategies that they
have taken toward mainland China, Chen added.</P>

An important test of the United States' fledgling missile defense

carrying a mock warhead as a target was launched from Kodiak, Alaska,
the interceptor, which was intended to go aloft 16 minutes later and
home in on the target 100 miles over the earth, automatically shut
down because of "an unknown anomaly, " according to the Missile
Defense Agency of the Defense Department. The launching which had
been planned as the first full test in two years had been delayed
several times because of bad weather or problems with equipment at
the Pacific test range on Kwajalein Atoll, where officials must now
try to determine what went wrong.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged the
international community Thursday to unmask what she called the "fake
peace" of China.</P>
      <P>Lu pointed out that China, while continuing its military threat
against Taiwan, is planning to draw up an "anti-separatism law" in an
attempt to legalize its invasion of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks at the 10th Taipei roundtable co-organized by
the Chinatrust Commercial Bank and the U.S.-based Center for
Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).</P>
      <P>Lu said although China has advocated a "peaceful rise, " the
international community should recognize the "fake peace" of China
and the "true peace" of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is China's strategy to use its economic and cultural powers to
force the United States' influence out of Asia under the mask of
peace, Lu said.</P>
      <P>In addition to using its military power to intimidate Taiwan,
China is carrying out legal, psychological and media warfare against
the island and has sent several thousand secret agents to Taiwan,
according to Lu.</P>
      <P>On the status quo of Taiwan, Lu asserted that Taiwan is a de

      <P>She called the international community's attention to the fact
that a new national identity wishing for a release from the "one

      <P>Its efforts have achieved remarkable results, Bates said. For
instance, mainland China has pushed for the establishment of the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization with Russia, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to strengthen
confidence-building and disarmament in border regions.</P>
      <P>Bates further said he was surprised by mainland China's
diplomatic progress in relations with Southeast Asian nations. Bates
said he originally thought that conflicts might erupt between
mainland China and its Southeast Asian neighbors over South China Sea
territorial disputes. However, Bates said, such scenarios didn't
appear and its trade and economic relations with neighboring
countries have made substantial headway.</P>
      <P>In addition, Bates said, mainland China has projected an image in
the international community of being willing to resolve disputes
peacefully.</P>
      <P>Noting that China has also expressed willingness to cooperate
with other countries in military fields, Bates said its ultimate goal
is to forge a non-U.S. security framework through its good-neighbor
diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan-U.S. ties, Bates acknowledged that bilateral
relations truly have encountered bottlenecks recently and that the
United States has strongly asked Taiwan not to try to change the
present status quo across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Bates said although U.S.-China relations are getting increasingly
close, conflicts of interest between the two countries will increase
in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>When mainland China's military strength becomes strong enough to
resolve cross-strait issues, Bates said, military confrontation is
likely to break out between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
because of misjudgments.</P>
      <P>In the face of changing world situations, Bates said Taiwan
should pay more heed to issues of world concern, such as
anti-terrorism and anti-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
"Taiwan should show willingness to cooperate with other countries to
cope with such major global challenges," he added.</P>
      <P>The roundtable is being co-sponsored by Taipei-based Chinatrust
Group and the CSIS.

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE YUAN SPEAKER RESPECTS RULING ON '319 COMMISSION'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said
Thursday that he will respect the ruling of the Council of Grand
Justices on the constitutionality of a statute governing the
formation of a commission to investigate the election-eve shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks one day after the Council of Grand
Justices, at the request of lawmakers of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) for an interpretation, ruled on the "319
truth investigation commission statute, " which greatly undercut the
power of the commission established under the statute.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he welcomed the part of the ruling that gives the
legislature the right to form a commission to investigate the
shooting, but he will have to convene a meeting between the ruling
and opposition parties to discuss the other parts.</P>
      <P>He also said that new members of the "truth commission" will have
to be produced through a consultative process among the various
political parties, and the names will be submitted to the Legislative
Yuan for approval. The speaker only has a nominal right to appoint
members, he said.</P>
      <P>The term of the members of the current "truth commission" will
run until this legislature ends on Jan. 31, and the new members of
the "truth commission" will be decided by the new legislature, which
will be sworn in Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a DPP legislative whip said that the 10-member "truth
commission, " which started operations in early October but had gone
nowhere because the executive branch wouldn't cooperate with what it
termed an "unconstitutional" body, should stop operations now that
the ruling has been made official.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Huang-liang said that the DPP was gratified by
the ruling of the Grand Justices, which effectively rendered the key
parts of the special statute null and void, adding that the present
commission should suspend operations immediately.</P>
      <P>Responding to a call by the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the
Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) for a revision of
the statute, Tsai said that there will be not enough time for such a
revision with the current legislative session ending on Jan. 31.</P>
      <P>He urged the KMT and the PFP to support the DPP's own version of
the statute to embark on the investigation in a legal and
constitutional manner.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus said it will respect the ruling of the Grand
Justices, but would soon submit a revision to the statute targeting
those parts that the Grand Justices deemed unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chou Hsi-wei said the Legislative Yuan retains the
right to examine documents now that it is accorded with the power to
investigate after the ruling, adding that it should keep digging for
information that could lead to solving the mystery of the
presidential election-eve shooting.</P>
      <P>Chou pointed out that the Grand Justices also ruled that the
duties of the "truth commission" overlap with those of the Control
Yuan's, and that work on a constitutional amendment should begin now
to abolish the watchdog body.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung was displeased with the ruling that
reduced the "truth commission" to a body under the jurisdiction of
the Legislative Yuan, instead of being an independent body.</P>
      <P>The PFP and the KMT will ask for Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang to
convene a coordination meeting among the parties and will not rule
out a "radical approach" to dealing with the situation, Liu said, he
didn't elaborate.</P>
      <P>According to the ruling of the Grand Justices, the commission
should be made into a special commission under the jurisdiction of
the Legislative Yuan. The commission can exercise its investigative
rights on issues that it is concerned about, but it will not have the
same powers as those of civilian and military prosecutors in carrying
out investigations.</P>
      <P>Several paragraphs of Article Eight of the special statute, which
the current commission members consider to be paramount in carrying
out an independent investigation, such as no individuals or
government organizations may invoke any legal protection to exempt
themselves from giving testimony, handing over documents or extending
assistance to the commission, were also deemed to be
unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>The paragraphs of Article 13 that gave investigators recruited by
the commission the power to prosecute persons suspected to be
involved in the shooting were also ruled unconstitutional by the
Grand Justices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'319 COMMISSION' TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS DESPITE SETBACK: STATEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A commission set up to investigate the
March 19 presidential election-eve shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian issued a statement Thursday that it will continue its
operations despite a ruling by the Council of Grand Justices that
reduced it to little more than an ceremonial body.</P>
      <P>The statement by the "319 truth investigation commission" came
one day after a ruling by the Council of Grand Justices which was
considered to have greatly undercut the powers of the commission,
which began operations in early October.</P>
      <P>The commission said the ruling of the Grand Justices runs counter
to the five-branch government system under the ROC Constitution, and
may have unleashed a constitutional crisis.</P>
      <P>It said that when the commission was formed, it was modeled on
the Warren Commission in the United States which was to investigate
the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, or an independent
body, not as a body under the jurisdiction of the Legislative Yuan
according to the ruling of the Grand Justices.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that the ruling has circumvented a constitutional
amendment procedure to bestow comprehensive investigation rights to
the Legislative Yuan, which under the present Constitution is
non-existent.</P>
      <P>Under the present five-branch government system, the right of
investigation belongs to the Control Yuan, the statement said. For
this reason, the ruling has infringed on the rights of the Control
Yuan, adding that the investigation into gross dereliction on the
part of the government will now be divided between two government
agencies.</P>
      <P>The commission said that the ruling by the Grand Justices has
overstepped their authority under the Constitution, and this has not
only obstructed the investigation of the shooting, but may also
trigger a constitutional crisis.</P>
      <P>The commission concluded by saying that despite the setbacks
encountered by all members since its inauguration, it will continue
to operate in view of the public's expectation that the truth must
come out.</P>

      <P>JetStar Asia, a budget air carrier based in
Singapore, began regular flight services between Taipei and Singapore
Thursday.</P>
      <P>JetStar Asia executives said the air carrier offers ticket prices
20 percent and 40 percent cheaper than traditional air carriers. A
special price of NT$1,788 (US$55) is being offered during the first
week of flight services on the route.</P>
      <P>As Singapore is currently on school holidays, the inaugural
flight to Taipei was fully booked, while Taipei-Singapore route was
80 percent full.</P>
      <P>The executives said that reservations for the seats are mostly
done via the Internet, and extra charges will be added for booking
tickets through passenger service centers or specific travel
agencies.</P>
      <P>The airline, which is scheduled to open a Singapore-Kaohsiung

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SCHOLAR SEES WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY IN CROSS-STRAIT RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting U.S. scholar said Thursday he
sees a "window of opportunity" in relations across the Taiwan Strait,
even though cross-strait ties are not in a state of "perfect calm."</P>
      <P>Gerrit Gong, a research fellow at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS) , a noted U.S. think tank, made the
remarks at a roundtable discussion in Taipei co-sponsored by the CSIS
and the Taipei-based Chinatrust Holding Group.</P>
      <P>After both President Chen Shui-bian and U.S. President George
W. Bush won re-election, Gong said the development of triangular
Taiwan-U.S.-mainland China relations will hinge on flexibility shown
by all three parties.</P>
      <P>Gong predicted that there will be a "window of opportunity" for
improving cross-strait relations in the coming two years and said the
top leaders on both sides should grasp this opportunity to resolve
their disputes with creative and ingenious initiatives.</P>
      <P>Feasible measures, he said, include expanding exchanges, gradual
cooperation in military affairs, formation of a task force to work
out a code of conduct, and formulation of a policy framework to
enhance transparency and clarify the "one China" definition.</P>
      <P>He further said the United States should play a more active role
in pushing the two sides to conduct direct dialogue. With Taiwan
gradually losing its bargaining chips, Gong said, the country's
senior officials should exercise more prudence in deeds and rhetoric
to avoid provoking Beijing.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan should participate in international activities, Gong
said, it should avoid extremism in its moral appeal to prevent any
possible "moral hazard."</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that Taiwan-U.S. relations were hurt by rhetoric
and moves made by certain Taiwan officials in the past year, Gong
said Taiwan should take steps to mend the rifts and rebuild trust.</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's arms procurement plan, Gong said modernization of
Taiwan's military arsenals is in U.S. interests, but he added that
Taiwan's security also relies on several other critical factors,
including domestic political stability, cross-strait relations and
economic growth.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO INJECT LARGE FUNDS INTO NANOTECHNOLOGY PROJECTS: VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  15 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan authorities are planning to
spend NT$21.5 billion (US$663.27 million) over six years on a
national project to develop the nanotechnology and relevant
industries, Vice President Annette Lu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the 2004 Taiwan Chemical Technology Forum at the
Taipei International Convention Center, Lu said the goal of the
project is to create an output value of NT$300 billion in the
nanotechnology industry by 2008, with more than 800 companies in the
business, while by 2012, the output will expand to NT$1 trillion,
with over 1,500 companies in the sector.</P>
      <P>The project is expected to help local industries to upgrade or
transform and to further sharpen Taiwan's national competitiveness,
she noted.</P>
      <P>In her speech, the vice president pointed out that Taiwan is now
in good shape in terms of technological development compared with
other countries in the world, quoting the 2004 global competitiveness
report of the Switzerland-based World Economic Forum, which put
Taiwan in first place in Asia and second in the world in terms of
national competitiveness in technological manufacture and research.</P>
      <P>Despite the achievement, Lu said, Taiwan must still try to seek
advanced development to maintain its competitiveness. She raised the
island's chemical technology industry as an example, saying that the
sector's output has amounted to NT$2.2 trillion, a figure that makes
the sector one of the country's most important basic industries.</P>
      <P>The industry is closely connected to a broad spectrum of
manufacturing sectors, including petrochemicals, plastics, rubber,
high-tech textiles, chemical textiles, high-tech electronics and
semiconductors, Lu said, noting that the sectors' demand for key
chemical raw materials is expected to reach NT$600 billion by 2006.</P>
      <P>However, the nation should not content itself with the optimistic
prospects and in the face of stronger competition in the
international market, the chemical technology industry should still
think of the possibility of transforming, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MAY NOT FOLLOW U.S. ON INTEREST RATES: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is not likely to follow the U.S.
move to raise its key interest rates, as the country's inflationary
pressure has been eased due to an appreciating local currency,
according to a domestic economist.</P>
      <P>Wu Tsai-i, vice chairman of the Taiwan Research Institute, said
that the central bank is not expected to follow the interest rate
hike made by the U.S. Federal Reserve Wednesday on the grounds that
Taiwan has avoided the threat of inflation due to the strengthening
of the new Taiwan dollar on a weakening U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>If the Central Bank of China (CBC) thinks bringing down
inflationary pressure by maintaining the local currency at a
relevantly high value is a sound measure, it undoubtedly will not
make any increase to its key interest rates, Wu pointed out.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Federal Reserve lifted its key interest rates by a
quarter percentage point to 2.25 percent a day earlier, the fifth
hike since the beginning of this year, to stem inflation.</P>
      <P>Wu based his argument on economic forecasts that oil prices and
consumer product prices in the international market will fall next
year as a result of a slowed global economic upturn.</P>
      <P>He elaborated that Taiwan's wholesale price index and consumer
price index for 2005 are estimated to grow at an average of 2.04
percent and 1.61 percent, respectively, down from this year's average
of 7.04 percent and 1.68 percent.</P>
      <P>A stronger new Taiwan dollar will reduce import product prices,
and helping choking inflationary pressure at home.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, an appreciating local currency will eat up
earnings made by Taiwan businesses, he said.</P>
      <P>If the Japanese yen can maintain its value at 100 to US$1 next
year and mainland China's renminbi appreciates moderately by only 5
percent, it would be easier for the CBC to hold out against
appreciating pressure on the local currency by keeping the bottom
line at NT$31 to US$1 despite a sound economy that will push up its
currency, he explained.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is predicted to expand by 5.95 percent for the
whole of 2004, while the mainland and Japanese economies are forecast
to grow by 9.1 percent and 4.1 percent, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROSPECTS FOR CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS GROWING DIM: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Thursday that the prospects for opening two-way,
non-stop charter flights across the Taiwan Strait during the upcoming
Chinese New Year holiday have grown dim.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office
sternly criticized President Chen Shui-bian a day earlier and gave a
lukewarm response to a question about whether Beijing will allow
direct cross-strait charter flights during the forthcoming Chinese
New Year holiday to facilitate the return of a large number of Taiwan
businessmen operating on the mainland, commonly known as "Taishang,"
for family reunions.</P>
      <P>Noting that the mainland interpreted the results of Taiwan's
just-concluded legislative elections, in which the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and its pro-independence allies failed to win
a majority, as a success of its containment policy against the DPP
administration, Wu said he is not optimistic about the prospects for
a resumption of cross-strait talks any time soon.</P>
      <P>He added that he is also pessimistic about the possibility of
opening the special charter flight services for "Taishang" during the
Chinese New Year holiday, which falls between Feb. 6 and Feb.
13, 2005.</P>
      <P>With Beijing's consent, Taiwan carriers operated special charter
flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong Kong/Macau
during the 2003 Chinese New Year period. The services were not
offered during the 2004 Chinese New Year holiday because Beijing
insisted that mainland carriers also be allowed to provide the same
flight services but refused to negotiate the necessary technical
details with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ROC government said that as the opening of two-way, non-stop
cross-strait charter flight services involves the exercise of public
authority, prior negotiations are necessary.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has unveiled principles and a feasible consultative
formula for holiday charter flight negotiations. However, Beijing has
so far not made any positive response to Taiwan's repeated calls for
negotiations.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan called a meeting
Thursday on the promotion of women's rights and issues, hoping to
increase Taiwan's visibility on the world stage through upgrading
women's status and gender equality.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Yeh Chu-lan chaired the inter-ministerial meeting,
in which it was decided that the functions of a panel under the
Executive Yuan dedicated to women's issues at the activities held by
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum will be expanded
in an international context so as to help boost Taiwan's
international presence.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, women's issues are the world's mainstream
agenda. Taiwan's efforts in advocating women's rights and status
should be made known to the world, she said.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of a recent investigation by a private human
rights group in Taiwan, she reported that the country has made
noticeable progress in improving women's issues and sex equality by
scoring a passing mark of 60 points in women's rights this year for
the first time.</P>
      <P>The central government has allocated a combined budget of NT$4.72
billion (US$145.3 million) for women-related activities for 2005, up
from the 2004 level of NT$3.61 billion, she noted.</P>
      <P>In addition to APEC, the United Nations and many other world
bodies and non-governmental organizations are paying a higher degree
of attention to women's issues nowadays, a development which would
allow Taiwan to share its experience more actively in this field
with other countries, Executive Yuan officials said.</P>
      <P>Missions of the newly expanded Executive Yuan panel will be
convened by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the
Interior will assist the panel in carrying out operations, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RENOWNED FORENSIC EXPERT IN TOWN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Renowned Chinese-American forensic expert
Henry Lee arrived in Taiwan from New York Friday for an eight-day
visit.</P>
      <P>Lee said that he has come at the invitation of the Bureau of
Investigation under the Ministry of Justice (MJIB) , and that the
visit is mainly to prepare for an international forensic meeting to
be held in Taiwan next year.</P>
      <P>The meeting will discuss the implications of the latest high-tech
advancements on the field of forensic science as well as
international trends in the field, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee, who conducted a forensic investigation into the March 19
election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu in the summer, said that if time permits, he will also
visit the Criminal Investigation Bureau to learn the latest
developments in the case.</P>
      <P>Noting that an underground gunsmith has recently been detained by
the investigation team for making firearms and bullets, one of which
grazed President Chen's abdomen and lightly injured him, Lee said
that the team has found key evidence in the case after sifting
through myriads of seemingly unrelated things, which he said is a
"breakthrough."</P>
      <P>Pointing out that a forensic investigator starts by collecting
physical evidence, then gathers clues which lead to suspects, and
then determines the motives in a case, Lee said he was glad to learn
that Taiwan's investigation team has proceeded along this path in its
probe.</P>
      <P>Lee urged those who have purchased the guns from the underground
gunsmith to come forward and cooperate with the authorities, and
called for the government to offer amnesty to those who give
themselves up. He said that questioning those who have bought the
guns may lead to the apprehension of the person or persons involved
in the assassination attempt in Tainan, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party has said that the shooting incident won
sympathy votes for President Chen and unfairly swayed the election
outcome in Chen's favor. Chen beat his rival, KMT Chairman Lien Chan,
by a slim margin in the election.</P>
      <P>Sources said that members of the investigation team are expected
to meet with Lee during his stay in Taiwan, and if necessary,
physical evidence, including remodeled bullets, will be given to Lee
to take back to the United States for further examination.</P>
      <P>Lee is scheduled to take part in an activity introducing his
forensic works in Shihlin, Taipei, Dec. 19. The activity is being
sponsored by the National Taiwan Science Education Center.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is a graduate of Central Police University in 1959, will
also return to his alma mater to give a speech Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>He will then shuttle between Taipei and Hualien Dec. 21-23 to
attend meetings to prepare for the international forensic conference
in Taiwan next year. He is scheduled to leave Taiwan Dec. 24.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BALL IN BEIJING'S COURT ON CROSS-STRAIT FLIGHTS DURING NEW YEAR: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has made its stance explicitly clear
on cross-strait charter flights for the Chinese New Year holiday
period, and the ball is now in Beijing's court as to whether such
flights will materialize, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice
Chairman Chiu Tai-san said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has unveiled a set of principles and a feasible
consultative formula for holiday charter flight negotiations.
However, Beijing has so far not made any positive response to
Taiwan's repeated calls for negotiations, Chiu said.</P>
      <P>Whether the two-way, non-stop charter flights across the Taiwan
Strait during the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday can be
implemented hinges on Beijing's willingness, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiu noted that the MAC convened a meeting Nov. 12 with
representatives from six major industrial and business associations
in Taiwan on issues concerning the Chinese New Year charter flights,
adding that the MAC values the entrepreneurs' opinions and heeds them
when formulating related policies.</P>
      <P>Chiu also once again urged Beijing to heed the will of the Taiwan
people.</P>
      <P>Chiu's remarks came a day after MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said that
the prospects of cross-strait charter flights being implemented have
grown dim.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after mainland China's Taiwan Affairs Office
sternly criticized President Chen Shui-bian a day earlier and gave a
lukewarm response to a question about whether Beijing would allow
direct cross-strait charter flights during the forthcoming Chinese
New Year holiday to facilitate the return of large numbers of Taiwan
businesspeople operating on the mainland for family reunions.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing interpreted the results of Taiwan's
just-concluded legislative elections, in which the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and its pro-independence allies failed to win
a majority, as a success of its containment policy against the DPP
administration, Wu said he is not optimistic about a resumption of
cross-strait talks any time soon.</P>
      <P>He added that he is also pessimistic about the possibility of
opening the special charter flight services during the Chinese New
Year holiday, which falls between Feb. 6 and Feb. 13 in 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SECURITY DRAWS GERMANY'S ATTENTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin,  Dec.  16 (CNA)
(By Y.L. Lin and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several members from the ruling and
opposition parties in the German Bundestag voiced in a parliamentary
debate Wednesday their concerns about Beijing's military threat
against Taiwan, demonstrating that the island's security has drawn
the attention of the German government and people.</P>
      <P>The Bundestag held the debate on German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's request that the European Union lift its arms embargo
against mainland China. The E.U. imposed a ban on arms sales to China
shortly after the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989.</P>
      <P>During the debate, Hermann Groehe, a parliamentarian from the
main opposition Christian Democratic Union, criticized Schroeder's
request, saying that China has 600 missiles aimed at Taiwan and that
under such circumstances, any intention of selling weapons to China
is irresponsible.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan is a nation based on the rule of law and
democracy and that China can still obtain weapons from other
countries despite the fact that it is not a democratic country, a
parliamentarian from the opposition Liberal Democrats, said that one
should first consider what kind of signal would be sent to Taiwan by
lifting the arms sales ban against China.</P>
      <P>Lamwaker Winfried Nachiwei, of the Green Party, which is part of
the ruling coalition, said that the European Union should not
increase tensions in the Taiwan Strait or help China to strengthen
its military force as Beijing has still not renounced the option of
the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Defending Schroeder's request, a senior member of the ruling
Social Democrats caucus in the Bundestag, said that besides human
rights, regional stability and security are also important elements
in the current revised E.U. draft of code of conduct for arms
exports, and therefore, Taiwan will be included in it.</P>
      <P>The E.U. will also take into account the security of its allies
and friendly countries, he further said, adding that it is impossible
that the E.U. will export a large quantity of arms to China after a
lifting of the ban.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hans Martin Bury, German minister of state at the
foreign office, also reiterated in the debate that the German
government has continuously asked Beijing and Taipei to avoid
escalating cross-Taiwan Strait tensions, promising that Germany will
not sell arms to countries in regions where a high-level of tension
exists.</P>
      <P>Touching on issues related to Taiwan's Dec. 11 legislative
elections, Bury said that the elections results have helped reduce
cross-strait tensions.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China's top envoy in

remain stable despite the fact that Beijing has sent its ambassador
to the United Nations to visit the Caribbean country.</P>
      <P>Noting that he knew about the meeting that day between Beijing
Ambassador to the U.N. Wang Quang-yi and Haitian officials,
Ambassador Hsieh Hsing-ping said the main issues they discussed were
related to cooperation between mainland peace-keeping police
stationed there and local government.</P>
      <P>Although topics regarding mainland-Haiti relations were also
mentioned during the meeting, Hsieh said he was guaranteed by the
Haitian government after the meeting that diplomatic relations

      <P>He also guaranteed that bilateral relations will remain unchanged
as long as he remains ambassador.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, except for a trade mission to Haiti and an

diplomats have been allowed to visit Haiti. Wang, who arrived in the
capital of Port au Prince Tuesday to inspect the troops, was
scheduled to leave Friday.</P>
      <P>Touching on ROC-Haiti relations, Hsieh said that the two

    <HEADLINE>MACAU URGED TO FACILITATE EXCHANGES WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) called for the Macau government Friday to facilitate exchanges
between Taiwan and Macau in a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>In an analysis of the development and prospects of Taiwan-Macau
relations five years after the former Portuguese enclave returned to
mainland Chinese rule, MAC officials urged both Beijing and Macau to
reduce exchange and communication barriers so that interactions
between Taiwan and Macau can be accelerated based on the existing
framework.</P>
      <P>MAC officials appealed to the Macau government to raise the
administrative level of the agency in charge of Taiwan affairs and
related communications.</P>
      <P>MAC officials also called for the Macau authorities to push for
closer cooperation with Taiwan, efforts that would include
considering the establishment of a Macau representative office in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They said that bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and Macau have
gradually heated up in recent years since Taiwan adopted a series of
policies to facilitate interaction.</P>
      <P>These policies include Taiwan's decision to issue from February
2003 travel documents to Macau citizens and foreign nationals from
Macau planning to visit Taiwan; that Taiwan has twice, in 2001 and
2002, relaxed regulations on 14-day stays for Macau citizens; and
that Taiwan is scheduled to open cyber applications beginning Jan. 1,
2005 for visas to Macau citizens wishing to visit Taiwan, MAC
officials said.</P>
      <P>They added that Macau and Taiwan people have exchanged visits
frequently, with Taiwan visitors to Macau ranking the third-highest
in terms of arrival number. Quoting tallies from the Bureau of
Immigration, MAC officials said that more than 915,000 Taiwan
citizens visited Macau in the first 11 months of this year, up a
whopping 19 percent over the year-earlier level, while some 17,000
Macau citizens traveled to Taiwan during the same period, up 6
percent.</P>
      <P>The analysis also points out that Beijing has established an
affiliate of the China Council for Promoting Peaceful Reunification
in Macau, which Macau Chief Executive Edmund Ho and other elite
members in the special district have supported.</P>
      <P>This shows that Beijing is now using Macau as another important
arm in its united front efforts toward Taiwan, according to MAC
officials.</P>

      <P>Local companies hiring disabled workers are
entitled to government grants of up to NT$60,000 per employee in a
nine-month period, sources from the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
reported Friday.</P>
      <P>The CLA made public Friday a preliminary plan on subsidies to
businesses that hire physically challenged citizens, in an effort to
encourage the private sector to help improve treatment of the
disabled and to provide them with better access to jobs.</P>
      <P>According to the plan, a company hiring disabled workers can
apply to the government for up to NT$10,000 per month for each worker
in the first three months of employment. The grants will be halved to
NT$5,000 from the fourth month of employment.</P>
      <P>The NT$5,000 subsidy plan is applicable for six months, meaning
that the company can apply for subsidies totaling NT$30,000 in six
consecutive months, boosting the total of government grants up to
NT$60,000 in nine months for each disabled worker.</P>
      <P>The plan is scheduled to be implemented in January 2005, but with

    <HEADLINE>MARSHALL ISLANDS GOVERNMENT MODEL IS FOR PUBLIC REFERENCE: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's proposal to
change the government system to one similar to the
parliamentary-presidential system of the Marshall Islands is only a
constitutional amendment idea for public reference, Premier Yu
Shyi-kun said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen said a day earlier that the government system of the
Marshall Islands, under which the president is both the head of state
and head of government, might be a model that Taiwan can follow.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the president of the Marshall Islands is
elected by the parliament with majority support from among its
members, meaning that the majority party in the parliament has the
right to form the government.</P>
      <P>The proposal was put forth in response to an argument by the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) that the majority in the Legislative Yuan
should enjoy the right to form the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Yu said that any proposal for constitutional amendment must be
based on a consensus among the people, noting that a consensus is
still lacking in Taiwan as to whether the government system should be
changed to a three-branch presidential system or a parliamentary
system.</P>
      <P>Yu said Chen's proposal should not be taken as meaning that he
intends to act concurrently as premier.</P>
      <P>In reaction, KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung claimed that the
purpose of Chen raising the proposal was to turn down the KMT's
suggestion for a legislative majority to form the Cabinet and insist
on his "minority government."</P>
      <P>The KMT and its "pan-blue alliance" allies, the People First
Party and New Party, gained a slim majority by winning 114 of the 225
seats in the legislature in Saturday's elections.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, KMT Chairman Lien Chan suggested that the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party should cooperate with the KMT to
form a coalition government.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed that the "Marshall Islands model" will never be
accepted by the people of Taiwan because there would be no popularly
elected president under the system.</P>
      <P>Chang argued that according the Constitution, the government
framework now is a semi-presidential system and he claimed that the
party with majority control in the legislature has the right to name
the premier.</P>
      <P>In fact, it is the president who has the authority to name the
premier. While the legislature may launch a no-confidence vote on the
premier, the premier may request the president to dissolve the
legislature after the passage of a no-confidence vote.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tseng Yung-chuan, head of the KMT's policy committee,
said Taiwan will enter an era of dictatorship if the president is
allowed to act concurrently as premier.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thanks to an improved economy, more people
have shown interest in changing jobs this year as the Chinese New
Year holiday approaches, according to the results of a recent survey
by a headhunting Web site.</P>
      <P>As of Dec. 13 since the beginning of this year, a total of 60,547
people have logged on to www.104.com.tw seeking a job transfer after
the lunar new year -- a traditional high season for people wishing to
change to a new job, a Web site executive said. This year's lunar new
year falls on Feb. 9.</P>
      <P>The job seeker figure represents a marked increase over the
previous year's number of about 44,000, the executive said,
attributing the growth to a better domestic economy that has prompted
people to search for work with better pay.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, a vast majority of the people wishing
to change jobs were mainly employees laid off amid a serious
recession.</P>
      <P>According to the poll results, some 34.7 percent of the job
seekers wish to get work in the manufacturing sector, ahead of 28.2
percent keen on an administrative job. An equal ratio of 16.2 percent
expressed hope of getting a job in public relations and sales,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In terms of industry, 22.2 percent and 17.1 percent of the
respondents, respectively, said they wish to join the electronics
manufacturing and semiconductor sectors, while 14.2 percent and 13.6
percent, respectively, are interested in seeking a job in
computer-related companies and the opto-electronics sector. Around 11
percent said they would like to have a job related to foreign trade.</P>

      <P>Three opposition parties jointly put

monthly annuity insurance for each of the country's citizens aged 65
or older.</P>
      <P>Spokesmen for the legislative caucus of the Kuomintang (KMT), the
People First Party (PFP) and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU)
said at a press conference at the Legislative Yuan that the three
parties will jointly push for the passage of the NT$10,000 annuity
bill to provide better care for the elderly, in the face of Taiwan's
ageing society.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative party whip Tseng Yung-chuan said the
implementation of the program would not affect the existing
implementation of the NT$3,000 senior citizen subsidy program.</P>
      <P>After the NT$10,000 national annuity program is implemented
successfully for three or five years, military, education and labor
personnel who have been recipients of other insurance benefits can
also be included in the program, making it a truly "national"
welfare, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>According to the program, potential recipients of the national
annuity insurance should pay NT$800 per month once they join the
program, with the government paying 40 percent of the amount for
them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA URGES RECONSIDERATION OF REPORTED RALLY TO SUPPORT 'RICE BOMBER'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) urged
civic groups Friday not to stage a rally to lend support to the "rice
bomber, " a terrorist responsible for more than a dozen bomb
threats in Taipei over the past year, less they send "the wrong
message" to the public.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Chairman Lee Chien-chuan was responding to news reports
that several civic groups are planning a 10,000-man rally in Erlin,
in the central Taiwan county of Changhua, to support Yang Ju-men, who
they believe is not a terrorist but only "a tragic figure or a
sacrifice" for the government's entry into the World Trade
Organization. They feel that the government should attach importance
to the agricultural problems that have emerged since Taiwan's WTO
entry.</P>
      <P>The civic groups, which include the Democracy Action Alliance and
Erlin Community University, also said that they plan to establish an
anti-WTO action alliance and will seek to establish ties with other
anti-WTO organizations around the world to highlight their cause.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that since Taiwan joined the WTO Jan. 1, 2002, the
government has stepped up its efforts to take care of the nation's
farmers to mitigate the impact of entering the WTO. In addition,
Taiwan's agricultural products are being exported in ever-greater
amounts.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that Yang is a threat to society and that no
matter what his motives are, he should be condemned by society.</P>
      <P>The civic groups who are attempting to raise Yang's status to that
of a tragic hero have distorted social values, he continued.</P>
      <P>He said that the COA welcomes civic groups to communicate with
the COA and expressed the hope that the groups will gain a better
understanding as to whether WTO membership is a positive or negative
factor for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"A rash mobilization of the people will definitely send the wrong
message," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan, honoring its promise upon entering the WTO,
started to import a limited amount of 144,000 tons of rice annually.
But the government has in the meantime adopted several measures,
including purchasing rice at guaranteed prices, subsidizing fallow
land, readjusting irrigation, and increasing its purchase of domestic
rice, to ease the farmers' plight.</P>
      <P>He noted that the price of rice is currently NT$20.2 (US$0.62)
per kilogram, the highest in recent years.</P>
      <P>The effect of rising fertilizer prices has had only limited
impact on the production cost of rice (adding only between NT$0.15
and NT$0.19 per kilogram) , he said, adding that the government has
also immediately provided subsidies for transporting the fertilizer.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the WTO demands that all its members allow
imports of rice and agricultural products, and that not only Taiwan,
big other major rice producers such as Japan, South Korea and
mainland China also import 650,000, 205,000 and 1.1 million tons of
rice, respectively, every year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's agricultural products have had far greater global market
access since the country joined the WTO, which he described as an
inevitable trend.</P>
      <P>Since November last year, Yang, who claims to oppose the
government's policy of permitting rice imports, has placed home-made
explosives in public areas such as parks, trains, railway stations
and mobile toilets in the greater Taipei area. He is suspected of
having been involved with 11 of the 16 cases discovered so far.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that the
government will continue to push a proposal to change the names of
state-owned enterprises to include the word "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks when he was fielding questions in
the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian recently advocated including "Taiwan" in
the names of its overseas missions and state-owned enterprises to
highlight a separate national identity from mainland China, although
the United States does not support such a plan, believing that it
would unilaterally change Taiwan's status.</P>
      <P>The premier said that changing the names of state-owned
enterprises is an internal affair and will not involve the ideology
of unification versus independence, or any change of the status quo.
The government will step up communications with the United States in
this regard, he said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Alex Tsai of the opposition Kuomintang also asked
Perng Fai-nan, governor of the Central Bank of China, if he wants to
change the name of the central bank to Central Bank of Taiwan.
According to Perng, this would require "a careful study of the
English translation of the bank's name." He declined to elaborate.</P>
      <P>Although the government will continue to pursue the name-change

    <TEXT>
      <P>An estimated 4.5 million people in Taiwan
lack a sense of belonging and a quarter of the population feel they
do not have enough time for relaxation and rest, according to the
results of a survey released Friday by the Mental Health Foundation.</P>
      <P>The 2004 mental health index survey was conducted by the
foundation Nov. 2-8 among 1,083 Taiwan adults, with a margin of error
of plus or minus 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The overall mental health index is 80.6, which is only slightly
higher than the passing score of 80, the results show.</P>
      <P>The survey found that over the past year, 65 percent of the
respondents always or often felt that they belonged to a certain
group of people such as colleagues, neighbors, classmates, friends
and families.</P>
      <P>The figure compared with 8 percent who had the feeling
occasionally and 27 percent who seldom or never had such a feeling.</P>
      <P>Based on the results, the foundation estimated that there are 4.5
million people in Taiwan who lack a sense of belonging and who,
according to the foundation, are more susceptible to anxiety than
others.</P>
      <P>While 56 percent of the respondents said they always or often
have enough time to relax and rest, 17 percent said they do so only
occasionally, and 27 percent said they seldom or never do.</P>
      <P>The results indicate that people with a high educational
background and income and those who maintain frequent contact with
their families and friends tend to have a higher sense of belonging.</P>
      <P>Also, the sense of belonging is higher among working people and
students than among jobless and retired people.</P>
      <P>The major factors that affect mental health include economic
changes, the political situation, social stability, negative news
reports, public safety and terrorist activities overseas, according
to the foundation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHIEF REITERATES HIS WILLINGNESS TO STEP DOWN IN AUGUST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  17  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
reiterated his willingness Friday to quit his post as head of the
party in August next year when his term expires, but refused to say
who might succeed him.</P>
      <P>"It's a promise fulfilled or good riddance, however you want to
look at it, " an exultant Lien said in an interview with the media
five days after his party increased its seats in the Legislative Yuan
by 11. Observers had predicted that the KMT would not do nearly as
well in the elections.</P>
      <P>The KMT should institutionalize the succession of its chief to
keep the party young and the process transparent, Lien said.</P>
      <P>After stepping down, Lien said he would serve as a "lifetime
volunteer" for the KMT.</P>
      <P>He said he did not wish to play favorites between KMT vice
presidents Ma Ying-jeou -- Taipei mayor, and Wang Jin-pyng -- speaker
of the legislature, the two tapped as likely to succeed Lien, saying
both of them are well suited for the position, "But I should remain
neutral while they are vying for the chairmanship."</P>
      <P>As to the party's possible merger with the People First Party
(PFP), Lien said it was agreed by both parties before the election to
merge by February, and it is the overwhelming desire of their
supporters; therefore, the KMT is working toward this end.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong said Sunday after his party lost 12
seats in the Dec. 11 elections that merging with the KMT is out of
the question for the time being. He blamed the KMT for breaking its
promises to the PFP during campaigning about vote-allocation, which
strengthened the KMT as the expense of the PFP.</P>
      <P>Rebutting allegations that he refused to take Soong's phone calls
during the heat of campaigning, Lien said, "There have been no
problems of communication between Soong and me. The KMT's door is
always open to a merger with the PFP."</P>
      <P>Regard Soong's claims that a merger with the KMT would be
impossible unless the KMT ridded itself of the political line of
ex-chairman and former President Lee Teng-hui and returned its assets
that where obtained illegally, Lien said the KMT's political line is
totally different from Lee's. "I don't think that any of 'Lee's line'
remains in the current KMT," he said.</P>
      <P>"The KMT will dispose of its assets according to law. Anyone who
challenges the KMT's ownership of any of its assets is welcome to
bring legal action against the party, and the party will be more than
willing to settle these disputes in court," Lien said.</P>
      <P>However, Lien added that the Democratic Progressive Party's
attempts to enact special legislation to dispossess the KMT of its
assets "is unacceptable political persecution."</P>
      <P>Lien said he supports the re-election of Legislative Yuan
President Wang and Vice President Chiang Ping-kun, both of whom are
members of the KMT, but added that he would speak with Soong on the
matter if the PFP chairman wished to field a candidate for the vice
presidency.</P>

The United States, Europe and Arab countries are considering
greatly increasing aid to the Palestinians on condition that they and
Israel take certain steps toward reducing their conflict. The
possibility of an aid increase was the subject of intense discussions
at a donors meeting on Dec. 8 in Oslo. According to American and

billion would be forthcoming, if the Palestinian elections set for
Jan. 9 occurred successfully and if the new government cracked down
on militant groups and Israel lifted scores of roadblocks and
checkpoints to ease the transit of goods and people in Palestinian
areas.

Wall Street Journal: A hidden cost of China's growth: mercury
migration.

The airborne output of Chinese power plants was once considered
the price of China's economic growth, and a mostly local problem. But
just as China's industrial might is integrating the country into the
global economy, its pollution is also becoming a global concern.
Among the biggest worries: the impact of China's vast and growing
power industry, mostly fueled by coal, on the buildup of mercury in
the world's water and food supply.</TEXT>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>What Beijing is trying to achieve
ultimately with a planned law is to unilaterally alter the
cross-strait status quo by fabricating a "legal basis" for a future
invasion of Taiwan, a government official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu warned Beijing
of the serious consequences of a "unification law" that it is
planning to craft, stressing that such a law will not go down well
with the people of Taiwan and will pose a grave threat to peace in
the region.</P>
      <P>Wu issued the warning at a news conference. The Cabinet-level MAC
is Taiwan's top mainland policy-planning agency.</P>
      <P>According to Hong Kong media reports, the mainland authorities
will soon put forth legislation for the law and mainland Chinese
President Hu Jintao is expected to make an announcement on the issue
during a trip to Macau next week.</P>
      <P>Wu urged the Beijing regime to carefully think over the matter
and not to again miscalculate the Taiwan people's firm determination
to deter any military threat, warning that such a move is set to
further alienate Taiwan from mainland China and that it will also
become the biggest threat to peace in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>It would be extremely "unwise" for Beijing to reject President
Chen Shui-bian's offers of goodwill and turn a cold shoulder to the
Taiwan people's aspirations for peace if it goes ahead with the
legislation at the expense of cross-Taiwan Strait stability and
prosperity, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC chief, the planned legislation for the
"unification law" or an "anti-subversion law" forms one pillar of a
three-tier war strategy by Beijing against Taiwan on the legal,
psychological and public opinion fronts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan vowed Friday to cooperate closely with the United States on
Taiwan's military procurement and promised to do his best not to
waste a penny of the Taiwan people's money.</P>
      <P>Saying that the previous KMT-led government also worked closely
with the United States on acquiring weapons that Taiwan needed, Lien
said that the KMT will continue to do so in the future after the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT, the People First Party and
the New Party retained a majority in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lien made the comment during a trip to Taipei County to thank
voters for their support for the "pan-blue alliance" in the Dec. 11
legislative elections.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" won a majority in the 225-member
Legislative Yuan by gaining 114 seats, exceeding the 101 seats
garnered by the "pan-green camp" of the governing Democratic
Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>A major military procurement plan with a budget totaling NT$610.8
billion (US$18.23 billion) put forth months ago by the Ministry of
National Defense to the Legislative Yuan has failed to gain
legislative approval due to its controversy over the large price tag.</P>
      <P>Now with the inauguration of the new legislature slated for Feb.
1 next year, the disputed military procurement project has been
widely viewed again as a focal point in future fierce wrangling
between the opposition and ruling forces.</P>
      <P>"Pan-blue alliance" legislators have repeatedly said that they
are not opposed to purchasing necessary defensive arms to safeguard
Taiwan's security, but they have also made it clear that such deals
must be rational and adequate in order not to waste the money of
Taiwan's taxpayers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER SECURITY OFFICIAL TALKS ABOUT CHEN'S POLITICAL IDEAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  17 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An former security aide to President
Chen Shui-bian talked in the U.S. about Chen's policies and ideas
Thursday, claiming that how to strike a balance between the
consolidation of democracy and regional security is a huge challenge
facing the president.</P>
      <P>Antonio Chun-nan Chiang, a former deputy secretary-general of the
National Security Council, told a seminar organized by the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C. that Chen's
training and career as a successful lawyer has developed strength in
pragmatic problem-solving and negotiations and made him a conciliator
and arbitrator.</P>
      <P>Chen, with a humble origin, worked his way through university and
earned his reputation as a successful lawyer through hard work. This
experience bred in him a personality of a striver and challenger,
trying to be the first and the best in whatever he does. This may
explain why he would challenge his own country's constitution and
political structure, according to Chiang.</P>
      <P>Looking at Chen, Chiang said, you have to see these two forces in
contention; his professional role as an arbitrator and his aggressive
ambitions nature as a challenger.</P>
      <P>However, Chiang said, when Chen plays the role of conciliator his
own side claims he is betraying core principles. When he lets his
ambition rip, he is portrayed by the opposition at home as a
messianic crackpot looking for trouble, and Chen himself has yet to
find the right equilibrium between these two sides of his nature.</P>
      <P>Chiang disputed claims that Taiwan's situation is more unstable
under Chen than it was under his predecessor, Lee Teng-hui, saying
that the problems with which Chen has to deal are of a different
nature from those of his predecessor.</P>
      <P>During Lee's presidency, Chiang said, Taiwan was an successful
model of the so-called "third wave of democracy, " and China was
considered an international pariah after the Tiananmen Square
massacre.</P>
      <P>For Chen, the world has turned upside down. Security has been the
dominant geopolitical fixation after Sept. 11, 2001, and China is a
more significant player than Taiwan can hope to be.</P>
      <P>At home, Lee enjoyed the huge power of his Kuomintang (KMT) party
apparatus, the support of the KMT-controlled legislature, while Chen
has had to contend with a constant minority government, the
intractable hostility of the opposition, and a split political
identity.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Chiang said, it is unfair to ascribe Taiwan's
worsening stability, if it were true, to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen's success in re-election has bred some extent of conceit
which tends to lure him into overestimating his own powers, and this
is visible in his party's hubristic Dec. 11 legislative elections,
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>When the legislative campaign started, Chen took the right
direction by focusing on practical issues such as the support of
farmers, director links with China for businessmen and pensions for
the elderly, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>As the campaign progressed, Chen digressed to the ideological
topics concerned with Taiwan's identity which did not play well in
previous legislative elections, Chiang claimed.</P>
      <P>Maybe he thought he had to compete with Lee Teng-hui's Taiwan
Solidarity Union for the independence fundamentalist vote. He
appealed to the core supporters only, but scared away the swing
voters, and this mistake, Chiang said, was rooted in Chen's own
self-confidence.</P>
      <P>Chiang said in Chen's remaining years in office, the DPP is
unlikely to make any radical changes because the party has
transformed itself from being a revolutionary party to more of a
"middle class party" whose main task is to safeguard the status quo.</P>
      <P>As with any other ruling party, Chiang said, how to hold onto
power becomes much more important than any other agenda for the DPP.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading opposition People First Party
(PFP) legislator said Saturday that the party will support a piece of
legislation proposed by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
to probe the Kuomintang's (KMT's) assets.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, convener of the PFP legislative caucus, said the
party is giving its support because the DPP has shown its goodwill by
removing the term "ill-gotten" from the bill.</P>
      <P>Liu said the KMT assets have always been the target of attack by
the DPP during elections, and some people have even accused the PFP
of eyeing a share of the assets by planning a merger with the KMT.</P>
      <P>The PFP believes the passage of the bill will help clarify the
controversies surrounding the KMT assets and facilitate the merger of
the KMT and PFP, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu pointed out that although the PFP will clear the way for the
bill to enter legislative proceedings, it is against any
discriminatory articles in the bill that are designed to liquidate a
certain party.</P>
      <P>The DPP is expected to submit the bill next week to the
Legislative Yuan's procedures committee, which is in charge of
scheduling the legislature's agenda. It is unlikely that the bill
will be included on the agenda if it doesn't have the support of the
PFP.</P>
      <P>According to the bill, the assets owned by a political party and
its affiliated organizations are to be returned to the government
with the exception of membership fees, political donations and
campaign funding from the government.</P>
      <P>The bill also applies to assets that were sold after May 1, 1991,
with parties having to return a payment equivalent to the value of
the assets sold.</P>
      <P>Also, any transactions taking place after March 10, 2004 will be

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 17 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. government exhorts both sides
of the Taiwan Strait to really focus on engaging in dialogue and to
refrain from hardening their positions or taking any unilateral
actions to change the status quo, State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Friday.</P>
      <P>Boucher was responding to media reports that mainland China is
considering passing anti-secession legislation, with Taiwan as its
main target.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a daily news briefing, Boucher confirmed that the
Bush administration has had conversations with both mainland and
Taiwan authorities on the anti-secession law issue.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that since the U.S. government has not yet
seen the text of China's new legislation, it is not in a position to
comment on the law at the moment.</P>
      <P>"We have not seen the law. We've not had a chance to study it, so
we're not in a position to comment in any detail, " he said.</P>
      <P>However, Boucher reiterated the U.S. stance on cross-strait
issues. "I would repeat our longstanding position that we've stated
many times that both sides should really focus on engaging in
dialogue and try to peacefully resolve their differences."</P>
      <P>Neither side should do anything to unilaterally change the status
quo, Boucher said, adding: "So we think it's the time to focus on
dialogue and not for hardening of positions."</P>
      <P>Asked about his views on a senior Taiwan official's statement
earlier in the day that the U.S. government is against mainland
China's new anti-secession law, Boucher only confirmed that the Bush
administration has kept in contact with all the relevant parties on
the matter.</P>
      <P>"We certainly keep in touch with all the parties on this subject.
We talked to the Chinese and talked to some people in Taiwan and are
following this development. But our view is the that it's important
for both sides to focus on dialogue, it's not time to harden
positions or take unilateral stances," Boucher said.</P>
      <P>As to whether Beijing's anti-secession legislation coincides with
the United States' one-China policy and stances on maintaining the
cross-strait status quo, Boucher said Washington will have to see the
actual text of the legislation before making any further comments.</P>
      <P>Anyway, Boucher said, the United States has consistently
encouraged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to "look for dialogue
and not to look for staking out positions or hardening their
positions."</P>
      <P>Asked whether enacting such a law is hardening the position,
Boucher said: "I'd just leave it at what I said. I think we said the
same thing in other cases as well."</P>

      <P>Singaporean Senior Minister Lee Kuang
Yew has sent a letter of condolence to the family of former Republic
of China first lady Faina Chiang, who died of pulmonary and cardiac
failure Wednesday at the age of 88, Lee's press secretary said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lee wrote the condolence letter in his private capacity, the
secretary said, adding that the letter was addressed to Chiang-Hsu
Nai-chin, the eldest daughter-in-law of Faina Chiang, widow of the
late ROC President Chiang Ching-kuo.</P>
      <P>In his letter, Lee said he was a good friend of the late ROC
president. He also recalled how during his previous visits to Taiwan,
he had taken lunch with the Chiangs at their official residence in
suburban Taipei on several occasions.</P>
      <P>Russian-born Faina Chiang met her husband while he was in the
Soviet Union in the 1930s. A woman of simple tastes with a technical
school education, Faina Chiang left her homeland in 1936 when she
joined her husband to return to China. She had to adjust to joining
one of China's most powerful families at the time. China was ruled by
her father-in-law, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and the Kuomintang
during the period.</P>
      <P>She fled to Taiwan along with her family in 1949 after the
Chinese Communists took control of the mainland. Her husband became
president in 1978 and ended 38 years of martial law just months
before he died in 1988. He also oversaw the island's spectacular
economic development in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>Faina Chiang avoided the spotlight and was known to be Taiwan's
most low-key first lady.</P>
      <P>The couple had three sons and one daughter. The three sons all
died, while the daughter, Chiang Hsiao-chang, lives in the United

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academics and pro-independence activists
called Saturday for the government to take active steps to deal with
mainland China's plan to introduce an anti-secession law that they
claim is directed against the island.</P>
      <P>A draft of the law, which is seen by some as aimed at crushing
the pro-independence movement in Taiwan, is expected to be discussed
at an upcoming meeting of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, according to reports.</P>
      <P>To cope with the situation, Ng Yuzin Chiautong, leader of the
World United Formosans for Independence, proposed in an interview
with CNA that the government should seek international support by
releasing publicity materials to call Asia-Pacific countries'
attention to China's intent to change the status quo across the
Taiwan Strait and upset regional stability.</P>
      <P>Ng said that Beijing's claim of sovereignty over Taiwan is
totally groundless and that it has never been recognized by the
international community. He said the anti-secession law is
meaningless internationally, although he added that it may be used
for the purpose of political propaganda.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan New Century Foundation Chairman Chen Lung-chu
said at a seminar on cross-Taiwan Strait security held in Taipei that
the anti-secession law is part of Beijing's psychological, propaganda
and legal warfare aimed at making Taiwan collapse without the use of
force.</P>
      <P>He argued that China's laws do not apply to Taiwan because Taiwan
is a sovereign state.</P>
      <P>To protect itself from an invasion by China, Taiwan must draw up
a new constitution and adopt a new name to normalize its status and
must step up its bid to join the United Nations to declare to the
world that it is a sovereign state, Chen said.</P>
      <P>China's military threat against Taiwan is in violation of
international laws and the United Nations Charter and is unacceptable
to the international community, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Also at the seminar, Lin Wen-cheng, a professor of mainland China
studies at National Sun Yat-sen University, said China lacks the
confidence to win a war against Taiwan in the short run and is
therefore trying to suppress Taiwan by pressuring the international
community.</P>
      <P>Lin urged the government to beef up its relations with the United
States, which he said plays a key role in the national security of
Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should formulate a "red line"
mechanism to cope with mainland China's anti-secession legislation, a
scholar said Saturday</P>
      <P>Hsu Yung-ming, an assistant researcher at Academia Sinica,
Taiwan's top research institute, made the suggestion in a telephone
interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Hsu said both mainland China and the United States have their own
"red lines" regarding cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan should also formulate its own 'red line' mechanism in the
face of Beijing's anti-secession legislative plan," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>For instance, Hsu said, Taiwan should legislate an
"anti-annexation" law to protect itself from being taken over or
absorbed by mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the proposed "anti-annexation" law can set the
conditions for when the "red line" mechanism should be activated,
such as when the total number of Taiwan's diplomatic allies falls
below a certain level or when Taiwan's sovereignty is weakened to a
certain point, for example.</P>
      <P>He said the "anti-annexation" law concept has nothing to do with
the "unification vs. independence" debate and is instead aimed at
protecting the status quo of Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, Beijing's anti-secession law is aimed
at crushing the pro-independence movement in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) will
closely monitor developments regarding recent contact between China

      <P>Lu said the ministry has been informed that Grenadian Prime

China.</P>
      <P>The ministry will continue to watch whether Mitchell makes any

      <P>The Grenadian government had announced that Mitchell's visit to
Beijing was aimed at seeking funds for hurricane relief and economic
development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-SECESSION LAW HIGHLIGHTS BEIJING'S SUPPRESSION OF TAIWAN: VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's plan to legislate a
so-called anti-secession law will only help the international
community to better understand Beijing's ubiquitous suppression of
Taiwan, Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan has never been a part of the People's
Republic of China (PRC) , Lu said that the introduction of an
anti-secession law by Beijing "could not alter this fact."</P>
      <P>"The law would only show Beijing's true face by spotlighting its
suppression of Taiwan in the international arena," Lu told a group of
journalists after attending a seminar on higher education at National
Taiwan Normal University.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has been waging "psychological, media and
legal warfare" against Taiwan, Lu said the anti-secession legislative
plan is part of Beijing's "legal warfare."</P>
      <P>However, Lu said she is convinced that even if China does
introduce the law, Beijing's claim that Taiwan is a part of the PRC
would not be recognized under international law.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lu urged domestic political parties across the
political spectrum to cooperate closely in forming a cross-party
action committee to promote peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The ruling and opposition parties should stop their partisan
wrangling and instead work hand-in-hand to promote national
development in a stable environment," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu
said the United States has discussed with Taiwan Beijing's
anti-secession legislation plan.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. government is fully aware of our stance, " Wu said,
adding that both Taiwan and the United States are opposed to any
unilateral move to alter the Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Beijing's anti-secession legislation is a
unilateral move to alter the present status quo, Wu said the
legislation is a provocative action which Taiwan strongly opposes.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan is likely to file an international lawsuit
to counter Beijing's new legislation, Wu said relevant government
agencies will make a comprehensive evaluation and will discuss the
issue with international friends before working out response
strategies.</P>
      <P>According to a Friday report by Beijing's state-controlled Xinhua
News Agency, mainland China's National People's Congress (NPC) is set
to enact an anti-secession law, which will be submitted for
deliberation at the 13th session of the 10th NPC Standing Committee
scheduled for Dec. 25-29 in Beijing. Accordign to the report, the law
is directed against Taiwan and would not apply to Hong Kong and
Macau.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman LIen
Chan said Saturday the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
administration is to blame for strained relations across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks during a rally in Taipei organized by the
KMT to celebrate the three "pan-blue alliance" parties' success in
retaining its majority in the new legislature to be inaugurated next
February.</P>
      <P>Lien claimed that the DPP administration's incompetence and
inexperience has resulted in deterioration of cross-strait. He said
neither hasty unification nor hasty independence is the KMT's choice.</P>
      <P>"We want to maintain the status quo and shelve political dispute
to facilitate cross-strait dialogue," Lien said, adding that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait should negotiate to create a "win-win"
situation.</P>
      <P>Now that the "pan-blue alliance" has managed to win more than
half of seats in Saturday's legislative elections, Lien said the DPP
administration should respect this new situation and organize a new
administrative team in cooperation with the opposition camp to ensure
domestic political stability.</P>
      <P>The three "pan-blue alliance" parties refer to the KMT, the
People First Party (PFP) and the New Party. While New Party Chairman

Pricey drug trials turn up few new blockbusters

Three major drug companies - Pfizer,
Astra Zeneca and Eli Lilly - each disclosed
serious problems with important medicines 
yesterday, throwing a spotlight on the fact 
that the US$500 billion drug industry is
stumbling badly in its core business of finding 
new medicines. The decline in drug research and
deve lopment has been an open secret among
analysts and scientists for years. Drug company
executives have tried to off set their weakness
in creating profitable new drugs by pursuing
aggressive campaigns to market existing drugs
to doctors and patients, impose big price
increases and make efforts to extend patents on
existing medicines. Those tactics have protected
their profits but irritated consumers and
governments that pay for drugs, causing a

      <P>Taiwan had not heard anything tangible from the OECD Secretariat

the OECD Trade Committee.</P>
      <P>However, the OECD authority has approved a "package arrangement"

activities in their capacity as ad hoc observers.</P>
      <P>The designation is a temporary arrangement and not a formal
"status, " OECD sources said. Ad hoc observers of OECD committees
have no rights nor obligations and they do not have to pay annual
membership fees.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has had formal observer status at the OECD Committee on

    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. military officer is to be posted
to Taiwan as staff at the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) -- the
de facto U.S. embassy -- Hong Kong's Ming Pao Daily reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>Quoting the latest Jane's Defense Weekly to be published Dec.
22, the newspaper said the move is based on a U.S. bill enacted in
2002 but which was not implemented over concern about
protests from Beijing. However, these concerns are now overshadowed
by Washington's worries about Beijing's military build-up, according
to the report.</P>
      <P>The U.S. military official will serve as chief of the military
technology liaison officer under the AIT. The post used to be
occupied by a business executive chosen by the U.S. Defense
Intelligence Agency from defense contractors that manufacture weapons
purchased by Taiwan from the United States.</P>
      <P>Washington maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and U.S.
officials named by the government to work in Taiwan have previously
had to retire from the government first or quit their government jobs.</P>
      <P>Posting a serving military officer in Taiwan will be a departure
from previous U.S. policy, although military exchanges between Taiwan

Blair, regularly visiting Taiwan to observe its annual military

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN LIFTING FREEZE ON INDONESIAN WORKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beginning Monday, Taiwan will lift a freeze
on imports of workers from Indonesia, ending a
two-year-and-four-month hiatus, Taiwan's top labor affairs official
announced Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chu, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) , said at a press conference that Taiwan decided to
resume the introduction of workers from Indonesia after the
Indonesian government demonstrated sincerity and goodwill in efforts
to improve that country's brokerage treatment of Indonesians coming
to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, she joined her Indonesian counterpart,
Minister Fahmi Idris, at a ceremony held in Bali last Friday marking
the signing of a memorandum on labor affairs cooperation between the
two countries. The memorandum was signed by Taiwan's representative
to Indonesia, Lin Yung-lo, and Indonesia's representative to Taiwan,
Ferry Yahya, on behalf of their respective governments, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The memorandum deals with affairs pertaining to Indonesian
workers being introduced to Taiwan to work, including the rights of
Indonesian workers in Taiwan; a mechanism governing labor-management
disputes; health and medical services to the Indonesians and related
costs; closer supervision of labor brokerage; and accelerating a
"direct hiring" mechanism, according to CLA officials.</P>
      <P>Officials from the two sides also agreed that the first
Taiwan-Indonesian Labor Affairs Conference will be held in Taiwan in
January 2005 to continue an exchange of views on such cooperation
between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The memorandum marked the first exchange of official documents
between the two countries after the new Indonesian government led by
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was sworn in Oct. 20. Yudhoyono is
Indonesia's first directly elected president.</P>
      <P>The CLA suspended the introduction of Indonesian laborers and
caregivers to Taiwan Aug. 1, 2002 as a result of several factors,
including high absconding rate of the Indonesian workers; the
Indonesian labor brokers forcing their Taiwan counterparts to
withhold "guarantee" deposits from the workers; and Indonesia's
failure in lowering brokerage charges as demanded by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Most of the Indonesian workers in Taiwan work as caregivers. In
2002, in their heyday, more than 90,000 Indonesians worked in Taiwan.
But the number has declined to 30,000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen, who kept her recent Bali visit low-profile to
avoid Beijing's interference, noted that the cancellation of the
freeze on Indonesian workers has nothing to do with affairs involving
Thai or Vietnamese workers employed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen added that Taiwan will respect a promise made by the Vietnam
Economic and Culture Office (VECO) late last month that it will see
to it that some 2,000 Vietnamese absconders will be nabbed before the
end of this year to meet the deadline set by CLA as a condition to
prevent Taiwan from adopting a freeze on the import of Vietnamese
laborers.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that "anything (punitive measures) is possible" if
the goal is not reached in time and related situations are not
improved as expected.</P>
      <P>VECO accelerated its moves to round up absconders after a visit
to Taiwan in October by Nguyen Luong Trao, Vietnam's deputy minister
of labor, war invalids and social welfare, who promised the CLA that
he would see to it that the problem is tackled in a timely manner.</P>
      <P>In a sweeping operation, Taiwan police authorities managed to
capture nearly 500 absconders in the October-November period with the
help of Vietnamese officials.</P>
      <P>Under mounting pressure from the Taiwan authorities, who had
threatened to freeze imports of Vietnamese laborers if absconding was
not checked before the end of 2004, the Vietnamese authorities have
summoned some 100 labor brokerage personnel from Vietnam to Taiwan to
help find the Vietnamese absconders, who are believed to be still in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese labor brokers were able to help the local
authorities because they had detailed information about the
absconders, including the addresses and telephone numbers of their
direct relatives in Vietnam. Since most of the Vietnamese workers
regularly send money back to their hometowns, "it's easy to find them
via their contact information, " the VECO official said.</P>
      <P>According to CLA talles, 11,000 of the some 84,000 Vietnamese
workers currently in Taiwan had absconded as of the end of October.
Since about half of all the absconded foreign laborers in Taiwan are
Vietnamese nationals, Vietnam posted the highest rate of absconding
among all foreign laborers as of the end of August in terms of
nationality, followed by the Philippines and Thailand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINA'S ANTI-SEPARATISM BILL CATERS TO HAWKS: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An anti-separatism bill mainland China is
mulling is intended to please the hawks on the mainland, rather than
mark the beginning of a period of confrontation between the mainland
and Taiwan, a scholar said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Su-chien, an associate researcher of Academia Sinica, said
the proposal presented to the National People's Congress for
discussion next week indicates a further straining of relations
between Taiwan and the mainland after the Dec. 11 legislative
elections in Taiwan, in spite of Taiwan's repeated reach-outs to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>This bill, once enacted, would soothe mainland hawks who are
irritated by what they see as increased schism in Taiwan and are
leaning on Beijing's leaders to do something to check it, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The mainland leaders agreed to accelerate economic exchanges with
Taiwan just before it came up with the anti-separatism bill.
These seemingly contradicting gestures indicate that Beijing is
taking an iron hand in a velvet glove approach to Taiwan, according
to Hsu.</P>
      <P>This approach is widely employed by politicians both on the
mainland and in Taiwan and does not mean that a period of
confrontation is looming large, Hsu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'ANTI-SEPARATISM LAW' MAY HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON TAIWAN BOURSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>News of Beijing's plan to draw up an
"anti-separatism law" aimed at Taiwan may have a psychological impact
on the Taiwan stock market over the short term, but the effects will
be limited, market analysts said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Claiming that short-term negative effects on the Taiwan Stock
Exchange will be unavoidable in the wake of Beijing's move, market
watchers predicted that the domestic bourse will still rise
moderately in the coming days fueled by a continued influx of foreign
capital taking advantage of an appreciating new Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>They contended that the inflow of investment capital has been
especially obvious since the Dec. 11 legislative elections, but
pointed out that the 6,500-point mark will pose a major hurdle amid
mounting pressure at a time when investor confidence has been shaken.</P>
      <P>The value of the stock market totaled NT$ 1.37 trillion (US$42.2
billion) as of Friday last week, an increase of NT$22.38 billion, or
1.66 percent, compared to the previous week's level. But Friday's
market turnover slid to a low of NT$60.21 billion, with the bourse's
key weighted index standing at 6,009.32, a fall of 9.91 points from
Thursday's finish.</P>
      <P>Analysts called that a sign of eroded investor confidence and
pointed out that the stock market might plunge again as it is moving
toward a relatively high level range between 6,088 points and 6,135
points.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwan businessmen based in mainland China see Beijing's
move as an attempt to reiterate its sovereignty over Taiwan in the
international community, imposing greater political risks on the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, foreign exchanges experts predicted that the new
Taiwan dollar will further strengthen against the U.S. dollar this
week on the back of a firmer yen that finished higher against the
greenback last Friday. They forecast that the local currency will
hover between NT$32.2 and NT$32.5 to the U.S. dollar in the days
ahead.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar ended at 32.36 against the U.S. dollar
Friday, a rise of NT$0.115 over the level of a week ago.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  19  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The combined market value of listed
companies in Taiwan hit NT$13.702 trillion (US$425.55 billion) at the
close of trading Friday, up NT$223.84 billion, or 1.66 percent, over
the week-earlier level, according to statistics compiled by the
Taiwan Stock Exchange Co. (TSEC).</P>
      <P>The weighted index -- the benchmark index of the domestic bourse
-- moved up 97.69 points, or 1.65 percent, for the whole week to
finish at 6,009.32 Dec. 17.</P>
      <P>The surge was mainly due to stronger buying support by domestic
and foreign investors in the wake of the Dec. 11 legislative
elections, the TSEC report noted.</P>
      <P>Most of the investors believe that the outcome of the elections
contributed to maintaining Taiwan's political stability, analysts
said.</P>
      <P>Share prices for most of the 20 main categories gained ground,
with construction stocks moving up the most at 10.64 percent. Only
three categories -- foodstuffs, plastics and chemicals, and banking
and insurance, suffered setbacks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S ANTI-SEPARATISM BILL MAY SPUR TAIWAN MEMORANDA: ANALYST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   Dec.  19  (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's anti-separatism bill,
although still in the pipeline, may trigger counterattack moves in
Taiwan, including a memorandum for independence, a China hand with a
Washington-based think tank said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Alan D. Romberg, senior associate and director of the East Asia
Program of the Henry L. Stimson Center, noted that the anti-secession
bill will cause more fallout than consolidation for China.</P>
      <P>The most crucial issue at present is that leaderships in both
Taiwan and mainland China refrain from making the opposite side feel
that achieving the goal it cares for the most is now hopeless,
Romberg said during a seminar sponsored by the U.S.-China Policy
Foundation.</P>
      <P>If Beijing adopts the anti-separatism bill, it is highly probable
that Taiwan will adopt a series of counterattacks, measures that
would be hard to be opposed even by the opposition Kuomintang, which
is known as pro-unification, Romberg forecast.</P>
      <P>Romberg said that Beijing did not show pleasure with the defeat
of President Chen Shui-bian's Democratic Progressive Party in the
Dec. 11 legislative elections as widely expected, instead, it mounted
new wave of verbal attacks on Chen and reiterated its belief that
Chen will push for Taiwan independence even harder than before.</P>
      <P>Romberg said that he thought otherwise and that Beijing should
have taken an opposite approach.</P>
      <P>Noting that there still exist hopes across the Taiwan Strait,
Romberg said that Beijing should adopt "active" and "positive"
approaches toward Taiwan to avoid driving the island farther away.</P>
      <P>Quoting a Confucian paraphrase that says "improve the nation's
humanity and virtue if people faraway defy, " Romberg said that the
mainland should try its best to understand the cross-strait situation
as well as what the Taiwan people are thinking.</P>
      <P>A kinder and more thoughtful mainland will be much more
attractive to Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Romberg suggested that firstly, Beijing should not intervene any
longer Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Organization (WHO) ,
because WHO membership has nothing to do with politics.</P>
      <P>Secondly, he said, Beijing should resume its previous stance of
defining the "direct links" as "cross-strait transportation links, "
rather than "domestic routes, " and try to facilitate the re-opening
of direct charter flight exchanges across the strait during the
Chinese New Year period for the convenience of Taiwanese businessmen
operating on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Thirdly and most importantly, Romberg suggested that the two
sides resume the long-stalled cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>If Beijing continues to insist that Taiwan's acknowledgement of
its "one China" policy should be the premise on resuming dialogue, it
should at least let lower-level and officially authorized talks start
first, rather than letting go-betweens shuttle across the strait to
pass information that is not necessarily officially sanctioned,
Romberg stressed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A panel of economic advisors postponed
their briefings on major economic issues to president Chen Shui-bian
recently in order that they could review their opinions on the
issues.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy, president of the Chung Hua Institution for Economic
Research and a member of the advisory panel, told CNA the
postponement was made partly because the president's aide could not
fit the briefings into the president's heavy schedule.</P>

national health insurance program, taxation reform and the shortage

      <P>Higher education tuition is not very high compared to some
Western countries, but has stirred up widespread discontent in
Taiwan, and the president's economic advisers have recommended that
the government ensure disadvantaged people's access to higher
education by offering education assistance to people with low income,

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO STEM TRADE RELIANCE ON MAINLAND CHINA MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must stem its high trade dependence
on the mainland China market, as the situation is highly risky for
Taiwan due to long-standing political feuding between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait, according to an economist.</P>
      <P>Chang Chien-i, a researcher with the Taiwan Institute of Economic
Research, made the call while giving a speech at a seminar over the
weekend shortly after it was reported that Beijing is planning to
establish an "anti-separatism law" to quell Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Taiwan's trade and economic reliance on the
mainland market hit a high of 34.32 percent in 2003, meaning that
about one third of Taiwan's total outbound shipments went to the
mainland.</P>
      <P>The ratio is far higher than South Korea's record of less than 20
percent, Japan's 12.18 percent and the United States' 3.93 percent,
he reported.</P>
      <P>Citing mainland customs statistics, Taiwan exports to the
mainland in 2003 totaled US$49.362 billion, a 20-fold increase over
the 1990 level of US$2.255 billion, he said.</P>
      <P>Since 2001, the mainland replaced the United States as Taiwan's
No. 1 export outlet, he pointed out, adding that Taiwan outbound
shipments to the mainland in the first half of this year already
exceeded US$30 billion in value.</P>
      <P>Such close trade and economic relations represent a looming
crisis for Taiwan, a development upon which he blamed Taiwan's
long-term political wrangling with the mainland China.</P>
      <P>The special political situation between the two sides has
deprived Taiwan businessmen of adequate and normal channels to invest
in the mainland, putting them at much greater risk, he said, warning
that any uncertain factor on the mainland China may in turn pose a
grave threat to Taiwan's economic development and its market
deployment strategies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More Japanese feel estranged from China, as
the two countries are at odds over several issues, according to an
opinion poll released by the Office of the Prime Minister recently.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted from Oct. 7-17 among 3,000 adults around
the country found that 61 percent, or 18.1 percent more than in a
survey conducted the previous year, said "yes" when asked whether
ties between Japan and China are good, against 28.2 percent, or 18.8
percent less than the previous year, who answered "no."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, only 37.6 percent of the respondents said
"yes" to the question of whether China is a friendly neighboring
state. That figure is the lowest on record since the survey began in
1975, and far away from the peak of 78.6 percent in 1980.</P>
      <P>Political analysts ascribed the chilled relationship between
Japan and the mainland to Beijing's protest against Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, Chinese soccer
fans rioting in Beijing after Japan defeated China in the final of
the 2004 Asian Cup soccer, and the recent intrusion of a Chinese
submarine into Japanese waters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BIG GAPS IN SALARY FOR THOSE WORKING IN MAINLAND CHINA: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The gap between job seekers and companies
for work in mainland China is quite big, as job seekers hope for
higher salaries while employers say that salaries should be the same
as those paid at home, according to the findings of a recent survey.</P>
      <P>The poll conducted by www.104.com.tw discovered that about 60
percent of the respondents willing to work on the mainland think that
they will get a raise of at least 50 precent in pay to do so, while
some 40 percent of Taiwan companies surveyed said that they would
offer a salary on a par with the pay for the same work in Taiwan, an
executive of the headhunting Web site said.</P>
      <P>For the time being, there are an average 7,894 job opportunities
on the mainland per day for job seekers in Taiwan, the highest number
on record in recent years, while the daily number of job seekers
willing to work on the mainland also averages an all-time high of
15,168, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the poll, 46 percent of the respondents said they
would be willing to work on the mainland in order to get a promotion
in the future. Around 39 percent said they would do so to add value
to their abilities in the workplace, while 37 percent view the
mainland as a promising market and some 35 percent think that they
would get better pay.</P>
      <P>Some 60 percent of the people surveyed believe they would get a
pay hike of at least 50 percent for accepting a job on the mainland,
while 24 percent said they would ask for double their Taiwan
salaries. About 36 percent think that the mainland pay should be
between 1.5 times or double the Taiwan level.</P>
      <P>But at the same time, only 39 percent of the Taiwan companies
polled said they would be willing to pay double pay for a mainland
job, and 50 percent said they would offer the same pay for Taiwan
workers on the mainland, with their prime consideration being
cost-cutting, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The poll was carried out from Nov. 24-29, recovering 2,872 valid
questionnaires. It had a margin of error of 4.8 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO MONITOR BEIJING'S ANTI-SECESSION LEGISLATION: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Monday the
government will closely monitor developments in mainland China's plan
to enact an anti-secession law.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks at a breakfast meeting with a group of senior
business executives. Many Cabinet ministers were also present at the
meeting.</P>
      <P>The premier said that as senior mainland leaders have yet to
disclose details of the so-called anti-secession law, which is widely
viewed as mainly targeting at Taiwan, the government will adopt a
wait-and-see attitude.</P>
      <P>"It would be premature for us to announce response measures at
this time. We'll instead keep a close watch of the developments, " Yu
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang Mao-hsiung, president of the Taipei-based
Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce, said the
business community has continued its "business as usual" attitude and
will go ahead with its investment plans.</P>
      <P>"We have heard about mainland China's new legislative plan, but
the details and spirit of the legislation remain unclear. We need an
in-depth review before we can make any comments," Huang said.</P>
      <P>Beijing's official Xinhua News Agency created a stir in Taiwan
last Friday by reporting that the National People's Congress (NPC) ,
mainland China's rubber-stamp parliament, will screen an
anti-secession law at a meeting of the NPC Standing Committee Dec.
25-29 and that the bill could be passed at the annual NPC plenary
session in March 2005.</P>
      <P>There had been widespread speculation that mainland President Hu
Jintao might disclose details about the anti-secession legislation in
his speech at a Monday ceremony in Macau marking the fifth
anniversary of the former Portuguese colony's return to Chinese rule.</P>
      <P>However, Hu didn't raise the Taiwan issue in his speech and spent
most of his time praising Macau and the way it has adapted to the
"one country, two systems" model, designed to give Macau a wide
degree of autonomy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONTROL YUAN NOMINATION LIST SENT TO LEGISLATURE FOR APPROVAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has sent a Control
Yuan member nomination list to the Legislative Yuan for approval, the
president's top aide said Monday.</P>
      <P>Su Tseng-chang, secretary-general to the president, noted that he
earlier called on Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng to solicit
his support for speedy confirmation of the 29 names on the list to
serve as members of the new Control Yuan -- the nation's top watchdog
body.</P>
      <P>The president nominated Clement C. P. Chang, current presidential
adviser, as the Control Yuan head, and scholar Michael
Hsin-huang Hsiao as Chang's deputy, Su said.</P>
      <P>The 27 other names were selected by President Chen from a list of
53 names recommended by a screening team appointed by the president
himself, Su added.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu serves as the convener of the
five-member screening team -- which includes Su, current Control Yuan
President Fredrick Chien, Clement C. P. Chang and Michael Hsin-huang
Hsiao and Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) Chairwoman Nita Ing.</P>
      <P>"The president has kept his promise to nominate someone from
outside the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to serve as the
head of the Control Yuan. Even the vice president is a non-DPP
member," Su said.</P>
      <P>"This shows the impartiality of the president in preparing the
name list," he added.</P>
      <P>Clement C. P. Chang, 75, who holds a doctoral degree in education
administration from the University of Illinois, is a founder of
the Tamkang University. He served as Taipei City Council speaker
in the past. He also served as Transportation and Communications
Minister from 1989 to 1991, when he resigned due to
corrupt allegations involving the purchase of a large number of
government bonds and shares in a life insurance company under the
name of his daughter Chang Chia-yi. He was acquitted of any
wrongdoing this year.</P>
      <P>Su said that Chang is by no means a political appointment as the
media has reported, pointing out that Chang has rich experience in
various fields and is active, dynamic and clear-minded. "Chang's age
is not a problem," he added.</P>
      <P>Su also spoke highly of the clean image of Michael Hsin-huang
Hsiao, a fellow of the Institute of Sociology of the Academia Sinica,
Taiwan's top research institute. Hsiao, 56, has a doctoral degree
from State University of New York, Buffalo.</P>
      <P>Su said that eight out of 29 people on the nomination list are
women, almost three times more than the previous time. Six of those
nominated are current Control Yuan members, while eight are current
or former legislators. The average age of the those on the list is
59.2 years old.</P>
      <P>Notable among those nominated is Chang Fu-mei, current chairwoman
of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Meanwhile, Chao Shou-po,
chairman of Broadcasting Corporation of China and former chairman of
the Council of Labor Affairs, though widely-tipped, was not included
on the list.</P>
      <P>Addressing concerns about possible conflict of interest in having
THSRC Chairwoman Ing as a member of the nomination screening team
while the THSRC is under investigation by the Control Yuan, Su said
that this is not the first time that Ing has served on such a
screening team and that she has been praised for being a successful
entrepreneur.</P>
      <P>"If the opposition party rejects the name list and asks for a new
one, the constitutional process will not operate smoothly and the
public will be let down," he said.</P>
      <P>The 29 current Control Yuan members took office on Feb. 1, 1999,
and their six-year term will expire Jan. 31, 2005.</P>

Only days into Iraq's six-week election campaign, car bombs
struck crowds in Najaf and Karbala on Sunday, killing at least 61
people and wounding about 120 in those two holy Shiite cities. In the

midst of morning traffic and killed them with shots to the head.

Wall Street Journal: Burden of proof At 32, a decision: Is cancer
small enough to ignore.

Because detection methods have greatly improved in recent years,
more people are being diagnosed with cancer at its earliest stages.
This is creating new questions. When is cancer the kind that can kill
you and needs to be treated -- with all the toxic therapies and
damaging side effects that go along with that decision? And when is
it too small to matter? Autopsy studies have shown that people who
died of other causes sometimes have cancer in their bodies.
Researchers at Wayne State University in Detroit found 8 percent of
1,027 men in their 20s, who died of other causes, had small amounts
of prostate cancer. In its study of 1,500 men, which lasted more than
a decade, the percentage of those with cancer rose during each decade
of a man's life. Fully 80 percent of men in their 70s were found to
have microscopic cancers in their prostates during autopsies. Other
autopsy studies have found microscopic amounts of cancer in the
lungs, breasts, and thyroids of people who have died of other causes
and weren't known to have cancer.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) urged the opposition Monday to respect its confirmation right
and not block the nomination list of the next Control Yuan, the
nation's highest watchdog body, submitted by President Chen
Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, DPP party whip in the legislature, made the
remarks after the opposition Kuomintang and the People First Party
said they will not rule out the possibility of rejecting the
29-member list.</P>
      <P>Ker said that a five-member screening team that was nominated by
Chen, has met several times to work out the nomination list in an
open and transparent manner.</P>
      <P>The president nominated Clement C. P. Chang, presidential
senior adviser, as the president of the Control Yuan, and academician
Michael Hsin-huang Hsiao, as Chang's deputy. But the 27 other names
were selected by President Chen from a list of 53 banes recommended
by the screen team.</P>
      <P>Members of the screening team are Presidential Office
Secretary-General Su Tseng-chang, incumbent Control Yuan President
Fredrick Chien, Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp. (THSRC) Chairwoman Nita

the meetings were convened by Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>"Now that the legislative elections are over, the opposition
should return to rationality and put an end to continued
confrontation. The confirmation of the nominated members of the
Control Yuan will be a move in the right direction, " Ker said.</P>
      <P>If the opposition rejects the list, it will trigger a serious
confrontation, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang Teh-fu, KMT whip in the legislature, criticized
both Clement C.P. Chang and Michael Hsin-huang Hsiao as "forever
pro-ruling party" and "core-members of the ruling administration" and
that they are far from "just and impartial."</P>
      <P>Huang claimed that Chang has no deep connections with the KMT,
although he served as minister of transportation and communications
under the previous KMT administration, and that he has wide
connections with political and business figures, which makes him
unsuitable to head the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>Although Hsiao is a scholar, he was "practically" a campaign team
member for Chen in his presidential bid, he added.</P>
      <P>Huang also expressed regret over the other nominations, noting
that many incumbent Control Yuan members who have performed superbly
have not been nominated, while those members who investigated
possible abuses in the first family and the TRHSC were shut out of
the list.</P>
      <P>Although unsatisfied with the nominees, he said, the KMT will not
reject the list outright, but will nevertheless screen the list
rigorously.</P>
      <P>The PFP said that the nomination list is "highly controversial"
and claimed it will not be able to monitor the performance of the
government.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, PFP whip in the legislature, said the party will
hold a caucus meeting to reach a consensus on the matter.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said that as the head of
the body that will exercise the confirmation, he is not in a position
to criticize the nominated president and vice president of the
Control Yuan, saying only that "it will be left to the public to have
their say on the matter."</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks amid criticism that Clement C.P.
Chang and Michael Hsin-huang Hsiao, nominated by the president as the
head and deputy of the Control Yuan, are also part of the five-member
screening team, making them both "umpires and players" in the
nomination process.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming, legislative whip of the Taiwan Solidarity Union,
an ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, claimed that many
of those nominated are unsuitable and said he will suggest that the
list is rejected.</P>
      <P>Chen said that even though TSU Secretary-General Lin Jih-jia is
included on the 29-name list, the list still needs to be discussed.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>National Taiwan University (NTU) forged a
sisterhood relationship with the University of Tokyo (UOT) Monday,
turning a new page in the ever-growing cultural and educational
exchanges between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>NTU President Chen Wei-jao and UOT President Takeshi Sasaki
signed a memorandum of understanding on the establishment of
sisterhood ties and bilateral academic exchanges in a ceremony held
at the NTU's second conference hall in Taipei.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that the UOT has ever signed a
cooperative agreement with a Taiwan university.</P>
      <P>Chen said he hopes the cooperation with the prestigious Japanese
university can contribute to NTU's ultimate goal of globalization.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the agreement, the two top universities will
exchange and students, cooperate on research projects in various
professional fields and share information and materials, as well as
co-sponsor workshops and academic forums.</P>
      <P>The UOT is the oldest university in Japan and famous in the
international community for its academic achievements. Many elite
members of various Japanese social quarters are UOT graduates.</P>
      <P>Both NTU's precursor -- Taipei Imperial University -- and the UOT
belonged to the same imperial university system during the Japanese
colonial rule of Taiwan. In addition to this historical tie, the two
universities have long maintained close interaction.</P>
      <P>The two universities are similar in scale. While NTU has 27,000
students, the UOT's enrollment reaches 28,000.</P>
      <P>Both NTU and the UOT are members of the Association of East Asian
Research Universities (AEARU) , which was founded in 1996 by the
member university presidents as a forum for leading research-oriented
universities in East Asia to exchange faculty and students, develop
common curricula and transferable credits, share facilities,
information and materials, cooperate on research projects, and
conduct other mutual academic endeavors. Both Chen and Sasaki have
served as AEARU president.</P>

      <P>Now that the legislative elections are
over, the ruling and the opposition parties should "replace
confrontation with cooperation," an official of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday.</P>

      <P>Commenting on reports that Lin Feng-cheng, secretary-general of
the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , said the DPP is continuing its
"cut-throat" tactics -- wooing 15 KMT and independent legislators to
the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity
Union, Chang said that he was not aware of such a thing, nor had he
met the 15 legislators in question.</P>
      <P>The "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the People First Party
managed to maintain its slim legislative majority after the Dec. 11
elections, compared with the "pan-green camp, " which ended up with
only 101, below its original expectations.</P>
      <P>Chang said that cooperation is different from the "cut-throat"

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  20  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan officials took pride in the
country's admission to the Trade Committee of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Monday, calling it an
affirmation of Taiwan's economic strength.</P>
      <P>One month after the OECD allowed Taiwan to take part in the
meetings of its Trade Committee as an "ad hoc observer, " Chen
Chih-mai, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan, said the admission will
facilitate Taiwan's efforts to explore foreign markets.</P>
      <P>Although the OECD gave Taiwan the status under the name of
"Chinese Taipei" rather than the "Separate Customs Territory of
Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu, " the name the country used in
applying for OECD access, Chen said the Bureau of Foreign Trade,
which was in charge of the application, will keep negotiating with
the OECD in hopes of having the designation changed.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-peng, director-general of the Board of Foreign Trade,
said Taiwan has already been admitted to the OECD Competition
Committee under the name of "Chinese Taipei" as an observer, but the
country applied to join the Trade Committee under the same name it
used in the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Michel Lu, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
echoed Chen's statement by saying that the country is trying every
avenue to change its name in the OECD to match that used in the WTO.</P>
      <P>Yeh Min-feng, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development under the Executive Yuan, said the Trade Commission
is the most important committee in the OECD and Taiwan's access to it
will give the country a chance to get international trade information
first hand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HENRY LEE MADE HONORARY CITIZEN OF TAIPEI BY MAYOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou granted honorary
Taipei citizenship to Dr. Henry Lee, a famous Chinese-American
forensic scientist, Monday in recognition of his assistance in
training the city's forensic personnel.</P>
      <P>Lee was born in Jiangsu province in mainland China and came to
Taiwan at the end of the Chinese Civil War when he was six. He
graduated in 1960 from the Taiwan Central Police College with a
degree in Police Science. Lee became the youngest captain in modern
Chinese history when he was promoted at the age of 22 during his
service at the Taipei City Police Headquarters.</P>
      <P>Ma said Lee has helped the Taipei City Police Headquarters for
years train a new generation of forensic professionals.</P>
      <P>"The conferment of honorary citizenship represents our gratitude
for Lee's contributions to our forensic investigation work," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Lee is the ninth non-Taipei citizen to obtain the honor since the
Taipei City Government set up the system for individuals who have
make significant contributions to the city.</P>
      <P>Lee, who is currently on an eight-day visit in Taipei, said he
was honored to receive the recognition from the city of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lee visited the Ministry of Justice
Investigation Bureau (MJIB) to discuss preparations for an
international seminar on forensic science to be held in Taiwan next
year.</P>
      <P>Lee, who conducted a forensic investigation into the March 19
presidential election-eve shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and
Vice President Annette Lu this summer, said that if time permits, he
will also visit the Criminal Investigation Bureau to learn the latest
developments in the case.</P>
      <P>Asked about his view on the controversial "319 truth commission"
formed by the opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan to pursue look
into the mysterious shooting, Lee said he recognizes the necessity of
setting up a special commission to look into the high-profile
incident, but he added that the investigative work itself should be
handled by the CIB.</P>
      <P>"It's all too common in foreign countries to form a
supra-ministerial and non-political commission to pursue the truth
behind major cases that have caused widespread public concerns, " Lee
said, adding that the most important thing is that the commission
should transcend "ministries and politics."</P>
      <P>Noting that the gist of forensic work lies in "letting the
evidence speak for itself, " Lee said the conclusion of his forensic
investigation of the March 19 shooting is that President Chen indeed
sustained a gunshot wound.</P>
      <P>Lee stressed that the conclusion has nothing to do with whether
he sympathizes with Taiwan's "pan-green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and its pro-independence allies or the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party.</P>
      <P>If local individuals or groups have different views about the
March 19 shooting, Lee said, they can convey their views to the "319
truth commission" for the reference of its members.</P>
      <P>Lee said he himself has received at least 500,000 e-mails from
the United States, mainland China and Taiwan about the March 19
shooting.</P>
      <P>"I would have to stay in Taiwan for three years if I were to read
all of them. But I have never read any of them because I don't want
my professionalism being affected by speculation," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He also hailed the recent identification of an underground
gunsmith by the CIB investigative team as the one who made the
bullets used in the shooting as a "breakthrough."</P>
      <P>The team has sifted through a myriad of seemingly unrelated
things to determine that the now-detained gunsmith, Tang Shou-yi, was
the manufacturer of the bullets used in the shooting. One bullet
grazed Chen's abdomen and slightly injured Lu.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that a forensic investigator starts by collecting
physical evidence, then gathers clues that lead to suspects, and then
determines the motives in a case, Lee said he was glad to learn that
Taiwan's investigation team has proceeded along this path in its
probe.</P>
      <P>Many "pan-blue alliance" politicians and supporters have
disseminated a lot of outrageous speculation about the shooting,
including that it was staged by President Chen to sway sympathy votes
in his favor.</P>
      <P>Chen beat his sole challenger, KMT Chairman Lien Chan, in the
March 20 presidential election. Lien filed two lawsuits to nullify
Chen's re-election victory and even the entire election so that a new
one could be held. The Taiwan High Court rejected the re-election
annulment suit, but Lien has appealed the case to the Supreme
Court,which has yet to hand down a ruling.</P>

      <P>Chen and Lu were shot while they were campaigning in a motorcade

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA MUST UNITE AGAINST CHINA: VP LU</HEADLINE>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu called for the
formation Monday of an alliance of Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to
stand up to mainland China's nefarious schemes.</P>
      <P>Meeting Japanese business leader Uichiro Niwa, chairman of ITOCHU
Corporation, a globally integrated trading company, Lu said the
world, attracted by mainland China's large market, has invested huge
amounts in mainland China without realizing that it is developing
into a military power with designs on other countries' territory.</P>
      <P>To contain mainland China's expansion, Lu said Japan, South Korea
and Taiwan -- the three democracies sharing Confucianism in East Asia
-- should form a triangle to check mainland China's power.</P>
      <P>Lu urged the ITOCHU Corporation to play a pivotal role in
bringing about a Japan-South Korea-Taiwan triumvirate.</P>
      <P>Albeit small in size, Taiwan can boast of having advanced,
hi-tech industries and is devoted to bringing its trade practices in
line with those of the international community in every field, Lu
added.</P>
      <P>Lu said Taiwan is working hard to develop itself into a global
business hub where goods can be delivered to any corner of the world
within 48 hours.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, noting that Taiwan is planning to build a rapid
transportation system between Taipei City and the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport in Taoyuan, Lu told Niwa that Taiwan encourages

    <HEADLINE>'ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS' NOT APPLICABLE TO TAIWAN: CABINET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "one country, two systems" formula used
by Beijing to administer Hong Kong and Macau is not applicable to
Taiwan because Taiwan is an independent sovereign state, Cabinet
spokesman Chen Chi-mai said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao
praised the merits of the "one country, two systems" formula in a
speech delivered in Macau marking the fifth anniversary of the former
Portuguese colony's return to Chinese rule.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan's status fundamentally differs from Hong Kong
and Macau's, both of which were previously Western colonies.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Chen said that since the two former colonies reverted
to Beijing' s control, they have both retrogressed in democracy,
freedom, human rights and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>With the number of Beijing's violations of its "one country, two
systems" promise in Hong Kong and Macau increasing steadily, Chen
said the formula cannot withstand the test of time and a changing
environment. Such a formula can never be applicable to Taiwan, he
added.</P>
      <P>Quoting tallies compiled by Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), Chen said that as of June this year, Beijing had violated "one
country, two systems" promises 157 times in Hong Kong since the
former British colony's return to Chinese rule in July 1997,
including Beijing's veto of Hong Kong's popular election plan and
requiring Beijing's prior consent to any of Hong Kong's political
reform plans.</P>
      <P>Nine major controversial cases also occurred in Macau in the past
five years, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The results of an MAC survey conducted shortly after Hong Kong's
return to Chinese rule showed that 76 percent of Taiwan people
interviewed said they were opposed to the "one country, two systems"
unification formula, Chen said, adding that the ratio of "naysayers"
had risen to 81 percent in a similar survey conducted in September
this year.</P>

      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun unveiled the nation's
economic goals for next year Monday, including a gross domestic
product of NT$11 trillion (US$339.76 billion) , a national income
average of US$15,000, an unemployment rate below 4 percent and an
economic growth rate of 5 percent.</P>
      <P>In a breakfast meeting with members of the Chinese National

criticized as being too feeble when he was friendly to the opposition
in the Legislative Yuan in the beginning of his premiership, and was
criticized as being too arrogant when he found it was difficult to
press through his legislative agenda and tried to bring public
pressure to bear on the legislature.</P>
      <P>Yu, who is supposed to resign with his Cabinet before the new
legislature begins its session next February, said he found his
premiership was like walking a tightrope between being too feeble and
too arrogant.</P>

growth rate for next year could hit 5 percent, which is much higher

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN AN IMPORTANT INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY: AIT OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  20(CNA)
(By C.J. Lin and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) has affirmed that Taiwan has become an
important international economy and a driving force of world trade.</P>
      <P>David, J. Keegan, deputy director of the AIT Taipei office, made
the affirmation in his remarks given at a reception held recently in
honor of the continuing competition policy dialogue between the AIT
and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office. The AIT
published the remarks on its Web site Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is the world's 17th largest economy and the fourth leading
economy in Asia, ranking behind only Japan, China and South Korea,
the official said, adding that the island's GDP reached US$282
billion and its total trade hit US$271 billion in 2003.</P>
      <P>He also noted that Taiwan is the United States' ninth largest
export market and eighth largest trade partner, adding that it is
also the sixth largest market for U.S. agricultural exports.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has seen a series of successful transitions over the last
five decades, from import substitution to export-led growth, from
labor-intensive products to more capital-and-technology-intensive
goods, and from doing all operations in Taiwan to moving production
off-shore to take advantage of an increasingly globalized economy, "
Keegan said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that U.S. aid in earlier years had helped Taiwan's
economic development, he said that one should also attribute the
island's development to its appropriate policies, healthy economic
foundation, excellent education system, high quality labor force and
flexible industrial structures.</P>
      <P>"At every stage, Taiwan's companies have been able to find
opportunities that maximize the island's unique mix of resources. As
a result, Taiwan has emerged as a ranking international economy and
an industrial powerhouse," he said.</P>
      <P>However, he also noted that Taiwan is at a crucial point where
both international trade and domestic market reforms will figure
prominently in its economic future. He suggested that "to take its
economy to the next level, Taiwan will need economic policies that
attract new investment in services and manufacturing."</P>
      <P>He also suggested that in order to ensure the success of Taiwan's
economy in the future, the island should continue to push forward
with its financial reform, to improve its investment climate, to
implement its commitments to the World Trade Organization, to further
liberalize its trade in labor service and goods, and to further
protect intellectual property rights.</P>
      <P>The AIT is the United States' de facto embassy in Taiwan in the
absence of formal diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENTAGON TO POST ACTIVE DUTY OFFICER IN TAIPEI: U.S. EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  20 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Defense is
considering posting an active duty army officer in Taiwan to serve
as a liaison with Taiwan's military, a U.S. expert with close ties
to the Pentagon said Monday.</P>
      <P>The expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the Central
News Agency that the United States will not be the first country with
no diplomatic ties with Taiwan to have stationed an active duty
officer in Taipei.</P>
      <P>For example, the expert said, France has long posted an active
duty officer in Taiwan. To the best of his knowledge, he said, a
French military officer was promoted to the rank of major-general
after concluding his stint in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since the United States switched diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing in 1979, military exchanges with Taiwan have been
handled by civilian contractors at the Taipei office of the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT).</P>
      <P>The expert said the current U.S. law must be revised before the
Pentagon sends active duty military staff to Taiwan. Under its
present law, active duty military personnel must first apply for duty
suspension before going to Taiwan and their service stint in Taiwan
cannot be counted into their seniority when they return to continue
their service in the military. As the suspension of seniority can
affect promotions, few U.S. military officers would be interested in
serving in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon will discuss possible law revisions with Congress
with reference to French provisions, the expert said.</P>
      <P>Jane's Defense Weekly reported Sunday that the Pentagon would
gradually send active duty military personnel to replace civilian
contractors at AIT, starting with the deployment of a U.S. army
officer to head a Technical Liaison Section in mid-2005.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon had considered stationing an active duty officer in
Washington's de facto diplomatic mission in Taiwan in 2000, but put
off the plan because of concerns about Beijing's protests, the weekly
said, quoting an unidentified source.</P>

      <P>The 75-year-old Chang resigned from the position of
transportation and communications minister in 1991 over corruption
allegations involving the purchase of a large number of shares in Kuo
Hua Life Insurance at what appeared to be undervalued prices using
his daughter's name.</P>
      <P>Though he was acquitted of any wrongdoing when the case was
closed in April this year, politicians from the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and People First Party (PFP) are challenging his nomination
because of the case.</P>
      <P>The opposition politicians pointed out that even President Chen
Shui-bian, who was then a legislator, had criticized Chang as "taking
the law into his own hands" for ignoring court subpoenas.</P>
      <P>At a news conference, Chang dismissed the allegations as a
"misunderstanding, " saying he was never indicted in the case and was
only asked to testify as a witness.</P>
      <P>Chang said he accepted President Chen's offer to assume the
country's top position of the supreme watchdog body because he wanted
to do something for Taiwan and end the confrontation between the
"pan-blue" and "pan-green" camps.</P>
      <P>Chang, who is a permanent member of the KMT and a member of the
party's Central Evaluation Committee presidium, said it was totally
unreasonable for KMT politicians to attack him.</P>
      <P>Chang said he will not quit the KMT but will stop participating
in partisan activities and suspend his membership immediately after
becoming Control Yuan president.</P>
      <P>Chang said he is trying to arrange a visit with KMT Chairman Lien
Chan and will also visit PFP Chairman James Soong and former
President Lee Teng-hui to try to win their support.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan Tuesday decided to put
off its consideration of the Control Yuan nominations made by
President Chen Shui-bian owing to objection from opposition
lawmakers.</P>
      <P>President Chen's request for legislators to consent to the

week.</P>
      <P>The opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and People

Clement C.P. Chang, who was nominated for Control Yuan president.</P>
      <P>The nomination of Chang, who resigned from the position of
transportation and communications minister in 1991 over corruption
allegations, has been criticized by the opposition as representing
the degeneration of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Disagreeing with the criticism, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said the
nominations are very proper because they have taken into
consideration partisanship, gender, ethnic and professional

    <HEADLINE>MND TO INTRODUCE SECURITY CLEARANCE SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A plan to implement a security clearance
system in the military is mainly aimed at protecting national
security information and has nothing to do with investigating
personal party affiliations, a defense official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news conference, military spokesman Navy
Capt. Liu Chih-chien said the Ministry of National Defense (MND) has
drafted comprehensive regulations governing security clearance
investigations.</P>
      <P>Under the new system, Liu said, only those who have passed
security clearance investigations can assume important or sensitive
military positions.</P>
      <P>A security clearance investigation generally refers to an inquiry
into an individual military officer's loyalty, character,
trustworthiness and reliability to ensure that he or she is qualified
to be given access to national security information.</P>
      <P>Asked whether having relatives in mainland China would affect an
individual's security clearance, Liu said that will be decided on a
case-by-case basis.</P>
      <P>Those who admit to having relatives on the mainland but have no
close contact and have been certified by security units will not be
subject to monitoring, Liu said.</P>
      <P>"We decided to adopt the security clearance measure after we
found that human factors have played an important part in a spate of
communist espionage cases uncovered recently," he said.</P>
      <P>There is nothing unusual about implementing this kind of positive
vetting, as it has long been employed in advanced democratic
countries, including Britain, Germany and the United States, Liu
said, adding that domestic civil servants have also been subject to
similar security checks.</P>
      <P>Liu said those who fail security clearance investigations will
not suffer any loss in their work rights. But, he added, they will
not be given important or sensitive positions.</P>
      <P>According to the MND-drafted scheme, individual officers will be
required to submit a self-confession statement that will be subject
to in-depth investigation by police or other investigative
authorities. The specific officer will be informed of the
investigation results and those who are dissatisfied with the results
can appeal their cases.</P>
      <P>In an effort to protect the rights and interests of those who are
subject to security clearance investigations, Liu went on, some
existing rules concerning the service of military officers and
non-commissioned officers will be revised to ensure that there are no
violations of their human rights in the process of security clearance
investigations.</P>
      <P>"Abiding by due procedure, legal use of investigation results and
protection of the legitimate rights of those subject to security
clearance probes will be our top work guidelines, " Liu added.</P>

      <P>The United States is trying to upgrade its
administrative efficiency by posting serving military and Department
of Defense personnel in Taiwan, an American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>AIT spokeswoman Dana Shell Smith said the policy was approved by
the U.S. Congress in October 2002.</P>
      <P>"Historically, AIT has hired retired American military officers
as contractors to coordinate defense assistance to Taiwan, " Smith
told the CNA.</P>
      <P>"Non-uniformed active-duty military and Department of Defense
civilian personnel will now replace these contractors. They are being
detailed to the AIT as part of the normal rotation of personnel," she
added.</P>
      <P>Smith stressed this is nothing more than an effort to promote
administrative efficiency in personnel matters and that Washington's
policy towards Taiwan has not changed.</P>
      <P>Smith made the statement after Jane's Defense Weekly reported
Sunday that the Pentagon would gradually send active duty military
personnel to replace civilian contractors at AIT, the de facto U.S.
embassy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This will start with the deployment of a U.S. army officer to
head a technical liaison section in mid-2005, according to the

      <P>Meanwhile, Ministry of National Defense spokesman Liu Chih-chien

    <HEADLINE>FREEDOM HOUSE RANKS TAIWAN'S CIVIL LIBERTIES IN TOP GRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan continued to be rated as a "free
country" in an annual Freedom House report released Tuesday, while
its civil liberties were promoted from the previous year's second
grade to the top grade for the first time.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Director-General Lin Chia-lung said
the progress in the Freedom House's civil liberties rating is an
honor for all local people and also marks recognition of the
government's strenuous efforts in human rights protection and
consolidation of Taiwan's young democracy.</P>
      <P>Freedom House, a Washington-based nonpartisan group, ranks civil
liberties and political rights in the world's 192 countries in terms
of a seven-grade rating system.</P>
      <P>A country is rated "free" if both its civil liberties and
political rights rank as first or second grade.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan has been promoted to the "free country" category
from the "partly free" category since 1997. Until 2003, both Taiwan's
civil liberties and political rights were rated second grade. This
year, its civil liberties were rated first grade for the first time,
while its political rights remained at second grade.</P>
      <P>In comparison, mainland China continued to rank in the "not free"
category, with its civil liberties at the lowest seventh grade and
its political rights at sixth grade.</P>
      <P>Lin said the wide gap between Taiwan and the mainland in the
rating system highlights the absurdity of Beijing's attempts to force
Taiwan to accept its "one country, two systems" unification formula.</P>
      <P>Freedom House was founded nearly 60 years ago by Americans
concerned about threats to democracy. It conducts advocacy, research
and training to encourage and nurture democracy.</P>
      <P>Freedom House said that, on balance, the world saw increased
freedom in 2004: 26 countries showed gains, while 11 showed declines.
Of the world's 192 countries, it judged 46 percent as "free, " 26
percent as "not free" and the rest as "partly free." Eight rated
among the most repressive -- Myanmar, Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Saudi
Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Turkmenistan.</P>

F.B.I. memorandums portray abuse of prisoners by American

and having lit cigarettes placed in their ears, according to newly
released government documents released on Monday in connection with a
lawsuit accusing the government of being complicit in torture. The,

Wall Street Journal: Columbia's pursuit of patent riches angers
companies.

In the fall of 2000, Columbia University faced a problem familiar
to many drug companies: A group of lucrative patents was about to
expire. The patents were based on the work of three Columbia
professors who laid the groundwork for a powerful new way to
manufacture biotechnology drugs. Columbia had licensed these methods
to more than 30 biotech companies and was bringing in nearly US$100
million annually in royalties when, after 17 years, the patents ran
out. Through legal maneuvering, Columbia won a new patent in 2002
with similar claims as the old ones. Soon, Columbia demanded more
royalties -- until 2019 -- from various companies. Many balked. The
Columbia case has added fuel to the debate over how aggressive
universities should be in securing and protecting patents. Some argue
that giving universities free rein to grab patent riches can damage
academic values such as open inquiry and stifle basic research, since
university scientists typically patent early- stage discoveries.
Writing in the American Scientist last year, Arti Rai of Duke
University and Rebecca Eisenberg of the University of Michigan
compared patent-hungry universities to the Wright brothers, who tried
to impede aeronautical progress until forced to license their patents
by the U.S. government.</TEXT>

      <P>The number of arrivals, departures and

Airport is expected to reach a record high of 20 million within the
next few days, airport officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by CKS authorities, the numbers

7.46 million, 7.4 million and 1.95 million, respectively, bringing
the total to 16.81 million.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the total number for the year will reach 20

      <P>After the inauguration of the airport in 1979, the number of

    <HEADLINE>CONGRESS WILL CALL SHOTS IN WAR AGAINST CHINA FOR TAIWAN: U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Congress will decide whether
the United States should go to war with mainland China should it
attack Taiwan, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage said
here Monday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the PBS television station, the number two
man at the State Department said the Taiwan Relations Act requires
the United States to maintain sufficient force in the Pacific to be
able to deter attack but does not require the country to defend
Taiwan should it come under attack from the mainland. He added that
the power to declare war rests with the Congress.</P>
      <P>He admitted that Taiwan is "probably the biggest landmine" in
U.S. ties with the mainland, although the United States
has managed to develop relations with the mainland while maintaining
good relations with the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the United States deals with the mainland based on the
three comuniques with Beijing, including an acknowledgement that
there is but one China, of which Taiwan is a part, and added that
"we'll have to continue that way."</P>
      <P>Armitage's statement caused ripples in Taipei political circles
Tuesday, with a spokesman for the opposition Kuomintang calling it a
warning to Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which has
pushed for the country's permanent separation from the mainland.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said it is an indication that
Washington is trying to keep Taiwan at arms length amid increased
pressure from Beijing, which bodes ill for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that many DPP leaders who push for Taiwan independence
have claimed that Washington will come to the defense of Taiwan in
case it is attacked by Beijing, Chang said they should mend their
ways because Armitage has made it clear that Washington will not be
drawn into a military conflict with the mainland if Taiwan makes a
reckless pursuit of independence.</P>
      <P>However, Huang Chieh-cheng, director of the Institute of American
Studies at Tamkang University in Tamshui, Taipei County, described
Armitage's remarks as no more than a reiteration of Washington's
recent calls for both sides of the Taiwan Strait to refrain from
taking drastic action against each other.</P>
      <P>In an interview with CNA, Huang said he did not see any intention
on Armitage's part to give a warning to Taiwan or to pressurize
Taiwan into drawing in its horns.</P>

purchase Taiwan passports and use them to apply for visas to the
United States, Canada and European states before selling them to
mainland Chinese who would then use the passports to enter these
countries.</P>
      <P>The police searched eight locations in the Taipei and Taoyuan
areas Tuesday and arrested seven suspects, as well as seizing 50

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen should diversify their
overseas investments, putting India, Bangladesh, Latin America and
new eastern European member nations of the European Union on their
priority lists, government officials suggested Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to a report by a cross-Taiwan Strait trade observation
panel established by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) , the officials said, Taiwan investment in
mainland China in the first 10 months of this year accounted for 65.3
percent of its total overseas investment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's overseas investment has been concentrated too heavily on
the mainland in recent years, making it Taiwan's largest overseas
investment destination and market, they said.</P>
      <P>The government is seeking to sign free trade agreements with
Taiwan's main trading partners, except for the mainland, to lower
customs tariffs, lift trade barriers and simplify administrative
processes in order to increase bilateral trade and avoid what the
government sees as over-reliance on the mainland market, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate Taiwan businesses' global deployment, they
said, the government is also encouraging business groups to organize
trade missions to promote their products in overseas markets and
increasing financial assistance to them by granting export loans and
offering export insurance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA BANS U.S. APPLE IMPORTS AFTER DISCOVERING CODDLING MOTH LARVAE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) imposed a
temporary import ban on apples from the United States Tuesday after
discovering a coddling moth larvae in a shipment of apples from
Oregon State.</P>
      <P>The suspension took effect immediately, COA officials said,
adding that the ban will be lifted only after the United States
conducts a thorough inspection and makes necessary improvements that
are endorsed by the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine.</P>
      <P>Quarantine officials discovered coddling moth larvae in apple
shipments from the United States on Sept. 1, Oct. 7 and Oct. 14,
respectively, and warned the U.S. authorities that they would have to
make improvements in efforts to prevent the dangerous pest from
making its way into apples destined for export.</P>
      <P>However, quarantine officials discovered another coddling moth
larvae in an apple shipment from Oregon Dec. 20. The insect was
immediately sent to National Chunghsing University for DNA testing
that confirmed the insect species.</P>
      <P>According to a Taiwan-U.S. pact signed in August 2003 concerning
working procedures for U.S. apple exports to Taiwan, the COA can
suspend imports if the United States fails twice to improve the
contamination situation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan discovered coddling moth larvae in a shipment of U.S.
apples for the first time in 1992 and imposed a temporary ban at that
time. Imports resumed only after quarantine officials confirmed that
the United States had made necessary improvements.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is keeping a close eye on its ties
with Grenada after Grenada's Prime Minister Keith Mitchell returned
home from a trip to mainland China, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan
Sun Chen said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Mitchell did not mention anything about switching
diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to the mainland in a nationally
televised speech that morning, Chen said "We will wait and see how he
develops this play."</P>
      <P>As a ally of Taiwan, Mitchell caught Taiwan off guard last week
with his mainland trip.</P>
      <P>Chen said he can understand that Mitchell was trying to "get more
money" from overseas after his country was ravaged by a hurricane in
September and added: "We don't blame him for this but we won't give
in to his blackmail for more money. We can only extend aid to Grenada
within our means."</P>
      <P>It is not unusual for tiny states to alternate their diplomatic
allegiance between Beijing and Taipei in attempts to get the maximum
amount of cash and aid from each. As former rivals in a civil war,
Taipei and Beijing are now fighting against each other for diplomatic
allies by promising generous aid to countries that forge diplomatic
ties with them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARMITAGE'S REMARKS SIMPLY A RESTATING FIXED U.S. POLICIES: STATE DEPT.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Dec. 22 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P. C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior State Department press officer
said Wednesday that the recent remarks made by U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State Richard Armitage regarding Taiwan were only a restating of
fixed U.S. policies.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Richard Boucher made the comments in response to media
questions regarding Taiwan seeking U.S. clarification on Armitage's
remarks. The Executive Yuan has asked Taiwan's representative office
in the United States to gain a better understanding of the matter.</P>
      <P>Armitage said in an interview with U.S. Public Broadcasting
Service Dec. 10 that Taiwan is "probably the biggest land mind" in
Bejing- Washington relations. The interview was televised Dec. 20.</P>
      <P>"We have the requirement under the Taiwan Relations Act to keep
sufficient force in the Pacific to be able to deter attack; we are
not required to defend. And these are questions that actually reside
with the U.S. Congress, which has to declare an act of war," Armitage
also said in the interview.</P>
      <P>Boucher said in Wednesday's press conference that he is unaware
of whether there have been discussions between the United States and
Taiwan on Armitage's remarks. However, he said that if Taiwan asked,
the United States would tell it that all Armitage did was restate
U.S. policy in very familiar terms.</P>
      <P>"We all know that Taiwan is an important issue to many countries,
to us, and it's an issue that comes up in not only our bilateral
relationship with China but in the region as well," he further said.</P>
      <P>"It's an issue that we spend a lot of time working on, and we try
to help people move towards a peaceful dialogue and a peaceful
resolution of the issues," he added.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States' policy toward Taiwan
remains unchanged, a Republic of China Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) spokesman reaffirmed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu made the remarks after the Nielson Report in
Washington, D.C. reported Tuesday that if Taiwan provokes mainland
China, the United States will not come to the island's defense if it
is attacked.</P>
      <P>The report also said that since ROC President Chen Shui-bian
broached his "one country on each side of the Taiwan Strait" in the
summer of 2002, U.S. President George W. Bush has changed his attitude
from "whatever it takes" to defend Taiwan from a mainland Chinese
attack in 2001 to clearly stating that if Taiwan makes moves similar
to provocation, then it is almost certain that the United States will
not come to Taiwan's defense.</P>
      <P>Lu said that Taiwan is pragmatic and that it is out of the
question for the island to provoke a war with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lu stressed that the U.S. policy toward Taiwan remains unchanged,
adding that if Washington wants to change its policy, it will express
it in a clear way.</P>
      <P>He said that the Taiwan-U.S. relationship used to be one of
"creative ambiguity" but that the United States has now clearly
stated its stance. However, he added, Washington's basic policy
remains the same.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's communications with the United States have been good,
and "the message we've received is that the U.S. policy toward Taiwan
remains unchanged," he said.</P>
      <P>What the United States wants is that the two sides of the Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>BOTH SIDES OF TAIWAN STRAIT `OBLIGED' TO WORK FOR PEACE: MOFA</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both sides of the Taiwan Strait are
"obliged" to work for peace and Taiwan is more than willing to do its
part to contribute to peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lu was commenting on a report by the Rand Corporation, a noted
U.S. think tank, speculating that mainland China is likely to launch
an attack on Taiwan in 2012.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, the Rand Corporation
has completed a study on the cross-strait situation at the request of
the U.S. Army. The report predicts that the mainland will adopt a
"conquer" strategy toward Taiwan after 2012. By that time, the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait may have a showdown war and the mainland
will probably send ground forces to occupy parts of Taiwan to force
the nation's authorities to hold talks on cross-strait unification.</P>
      <P>Lu said the Foreign Ministry is aware of the report. "We know
it's professional research that will be presented to the U.S.
Department of Defense for reference, " he added.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lu said, maintaining peace and stability in the
Taiwan Strait requires the joint efforts of both Taiwan and the
mainland. Taiwan should not be held solely responsible for
cross-strait peace and stability, Lu said, adding that the mainland's
plan to enact an anti-secession law could sabotage regional peace and
stability and lead to a change in the status quo.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan has no reason to provoke a conflict with
the mainland, Lu said Taiwan has always endeavored to work toward
regional peace and stability.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States is facing a "very
serious" choice in the cross-Taiwan Strait issue, Foreign Affairs
Vice Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The United States has a strategic need to develop close
cooperative relations with mainland China on the one hand, while
having a keen interest in the security of Taiwan on the other, Kau
said at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting.</P>
      <P>However, Kau said, Washington is concerned about Taiwan's
security despite the ambiguous wording of the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA) and seemingly pro-mainland remarks made earlier in the week by
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage.</P>
      <P>Armitage said in an interview with the PBS television station in
Washington Monday that the TRA requires the United States to maintain
sufficient force in the Pacific to be able to deter attack but does
not require the country to defend Taiwan should it come under attack
from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Armitage noted that the power to declare war rests with Congress
and that Taiwan is "probably the biggest landmine" in
Washington-Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>Kau said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is trying to verify
Washington's position with the U.S. Department of State and the
American Institute in Taiwan to better understand what Armitage
actually meant by his remarks.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Legislator John Chang said he believes
Armitage's remarks are related to President Chen Shui-bian's plan to
change the names of Republic of China overseas missions in two years
to include the word "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chang said the government should not have put forth such an
impractical plan.</P>
      <P>Kau admitted that the name-change for U.S. offices would be the
most difficult among all overseas missions because of Beijing's
opposition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT APOLOGIZES TO  CONTROL YUAN NOMINEES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian apologized
Thursday to all 29 nominees of the new Control Yuan -- the nation's
highest watchdog body -- for having been smeared following his
nomination of them.</P>
      <P>The president met with the 29 nominees, including Control Yuan
President nominee Clement C.P. Chang and Vice President nominee
Michael Hsin-huang Hsiao, over a tea party. Also on hand were Vice
President Annette Lu and Presidential Office Secretary-General Su
Tseng-chang.</P>
      <P>Chen first explained the formation of a five-member screening
panel and the nomination procedure, and expressed hope that all the
nominees will be confirmed by the Legislative Yuan soon.</P>
      <P>Noting that the nomination process was a daunting test and
challenge, he said he told Lu that if possible, he wished all 53 of
the people recommended by the screening panel could have been
nominated instead of just 27 -- the Control Yuan president and vice
president were decided by Chen himself.</P>
      <P>For this, the president offered his deepest apology to those
"jewels left behind."</P>
      <P>Apologizing to all the nominees for being smeared after the list
was unveiled earlier this week, Chen cited Fredrick Chien, incumbent
Control Yuan president as an example, saying that Chien excels in his
erudition, integrity and political experience. After he was asked by
Chen to serve as the convener of a commission to investigate his
election-eve shooting, however, he was viciously and relentlessly
attacked.</P>
      <P>"Some people in this society, because they are dissatisfied with
me, oppose everything I do," the president said, adding that he does
not feel this is a sign of a healthy society.</P>
      <P>The president also said that after the Dec. 11 legislative
elections, some people expressed the opinion that several excellent
legislative aspirants who failed in the elections could have been
included on the Control Yuan recommendation list.</P>
      <P>However, out of respect for the screening panel, the president
said, he dared not change the recommendation list, which was
completed a week before the legislative elections, for which he also
apologized.</P>
      <P>Eight of the 29 nominees are women, six are incumbent Control
Yuan members and eight are incumbent or former legislators.</P>
      <P>The president also explained that the nominations were not put up
for consultation among political parties because he wanted to
preserve the clean image of the Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>He said that from his past experience in nominating Control and
Examination Yuan members through consultation among political parties
or designated people representing political parties, he found that it
did not contribute to harmony between the different parties or
avoidance of confrontation, but rather was seen as a divvying up
among the political parties.</P>
      <P>The president defended his decision to nominate Clement C.P.
Chang as Control Yuan president amid reports that he had blasted
Chang as "brazenly playing with the judicial system as a rich and
influential man" when he was a legislator. He was referring to
Chang's alleged involvement in the buying of large numbers of stocks
in his daughter's name. After a 13-year lawsuit, Chang was acquitted
of any wrongdoing early this year.</P>
      <P>Chen said Chang will be able to protect the innocent and be a
guardian of civil rights.</P>
      <P>On Nita Ing, chairwoman of the Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp.
(THSRC), who served as one of the five-member screening panel, while
the THSRC has been the target of investigation by the Control Yuan,
the president also said that Ing does not represent the THSRC and
that she maintained impartiality throughout the screening
process.</P>
      <P>Lu presided over the screening panel, which also included Clement
C.P. Chang, Michael Hsin-huang Hsiao, Fredrick Chien and Su
Tseng-Chang in addition to Ing. Controversy also surrounded the
fact that Chang and Hsiao served as both "umpire and player."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan's Budget Committee
completed Thursday the first reading of a special budget bill for the
government's "10 new major construction projects" program to be
launched next year.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has appropriated NT$93.91 billion for the program,
with the funds to be raised by selling NT$15 billion-worth of
government stakes in state-owned Taiwan Power Co.
and floating NT$78.91 billion-worth of state bonds.</P>
      <P>The Budget Committee passed the first reading of the special
budget bill without undercutting any of the listed costs for the
program. The bill is now pending a second reading at legislative
plenary sessions.</P>
      <P>The program is the government's core work agenda following
President Chen Shui-bian's campaign promises for his second term.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said earlier this month that the program will
contribute to the nation's overall annual economic growth by an
estimated 0.6 percent in the coming year.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet's special budget plan, NT$10 billion
will be earmarked for a top-rate university development plan; NT$1.4
billion for construction of a world-class arts center; NT$2.8 billion
for a "mobile Taiwan" plan; NT$2.2 billion for a Taiwan EXPO plan;
NT$1.9 billion for a railway modernization plan; NT$9 billion for a
new expressways construction plan; NT$13.7 billion for a Kaohsiung
Harbor intercontinental container terminal construction plan; NT$48
billion for mass rapid transit systems construction in northern,
central and southern Taiwan; NT$3.4 billion for new sewerage systems
construction; and NT$400 million for construction of new reservoirs.</P>
      <P>The aim of the "mobile Taiwan" project is to set up the basic

    <HEADLINE>DOH SUGGESTS OPTIONS TO PROP UP NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top health official said
Thursday that if health insurance premiums cannot be raised to make
up for losses in the national health insurance project, he would
suggest either lowering reimbursements or raising the proportion of
self-payment.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) Minister Chen Chien-jen made the
remarks in a legislative committee in which several legislators
expressed concern about the dire financial situation of the nation's
health insurance system.</P>
      <P>Liu Chien-hsiang, CEO and president of the Bureau of National
Health Insurance (BNHI) , reported that BNHI safe deposits currently
stand at NT$4.2 billion (US$130.43 million) . As the revenues raised
from health insurance premiums cannot cover expenses, he estimated
that the system will have a shortfall of NT$12.8 billion by the end
of next year.</P>
      <P>He noted that according to current health insurance regulations,
if the quality of medical care is to be maintained, the government
has three options -- raise premiums, raise the self-payment ratio or
lower reimbursement.</P>
      <P>Chen said that BNHI revenues and expenditures have grown at a
pace of 4 percent and 6 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>To learn more about the views of the public, the DOH will hold a
meeting early next year in which representatives selected from the
general public will listen to expert explanations of the national
health insurance system, after which they will make suggestions
regarding the future of the national health insurance system.</P>
      <P>The report will be sent to the Legislative Yuan by the end of
January, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on questions as to whether the repeated use of renal
dialysis equipment has resulted in the squandering of health
insurance resources, Chen promised to look into the matter and give a
report within one month.</P>
      <P>Legislators asked why, although the equipment can be repeatedly
used, hospitals fraudulently apply for payment for new equipment but
do not actually use the money for the stated purpose, a situation the
Taiwan Health Reform Foundation (THRF) claims has resulted in losses
of NT$12.1 billion in health insurance reimbursements.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Society of Nephrology said Thursday that the high-tech
dialysis machines can indeed be repeatedly used, adding that the
dialysis quality in Taiwan is on a par with Japan's, but the cost is
only half of that in Japan at around NT$4,000 for each treatment.</P>
      <P>The society also said that THRF's allegation that repeated use
can cause infection has caused unfounded alarm and panic.</P>
      <P>Yang Wu-chang, director of the department of nephrology at
Taipei's Veterans General Hospital, noted that there are 4,000
patients in Taiwan who have survived on dialysis for 10 years and
1,000 patients who have survived for 15 years. He further said that
the survival rate of dialysis patients in Taiwan is next only to that
of Japan's, although treatment in Japan is four times as expensive as
in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has fully
respected the opinions of a screening and recommendation panel in
nominating Control Yuan members, Vice President Annette Lu said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lu, who chaired the panel, said during a meeting with the
nominees that the nominations were finalized one week before the Dec.
11 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>However, many people have expressed concern as to whether Chen
would reconsider the nominations after the polls to include some
legislators who lost their re-election bids, Lu said.</P>
      <P>She said she told Chen that if the nominations were to have been
changed because of the election outcome, it would have undermined the
impartiality of the panel and would have damaged the image of the
Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chen fully respected her opinion and did not change the
nominations, Lu said.</P>
      <P>She said the screening and recommendation process was open,
creative and liberal.</P>
      <P>While the Presidential Office placed advertisements in newspapers
for the first time to invite public recommendations, members of the
panel were forbidden from recommending any candidates, Lu noted.</P>
      <P>In addition, the panel did not take the ethnic background, place
of birth, partisan factors or gender of the candidates into
consideration while screening their qualifications, she said.</P>
      <P>Chen, meanwhile, pointed out that a relative of Lu and several of
her former schoolmates were deliberately excluded for fear that their
nominations would be mistaken as owing to their connection with the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dr. Henry Lee, a renowned Chinese-American
forensic scientist, handed over the original copy of his forensic
report on the March 19 shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu to Taiwan's top prosecutor Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee said after forwarding the report to State Public
Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao that he now feels he can relax.</P>
      <P>"The original copy of the report is extremely important. I have
kept it with me since I arrived in Taipei Dec. 18. I did not place it
in a safe nor was it taken by any other person. To my great relief, I
finally handed it over to the state public prosecutor-general, " Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Lee upon receiving the
original copy, which bears the signatures of all the members of Lee's
forensic investigation team.</P>
      <P>Lee's team concluded a forensic investigation into the
presidential election-eve shooting of Chen and Lu this summer.
Duplicate copies were sent to Taipei in August.</P>
      <P>Over the past more-than nine months, Lee said he has kept close
contacts with Taiwan's investigation team. He said he is glad to
learn that the team, headed by Criminal Investigation Bureau
(CIB) Director Hou You-yi, has managed to determine that a
now-detained underground gunsmith was the one who made the bullets
and gun used in the shooting.</P>
      <P>"It's a breakthrough. We should give the investigation team more
encouragement," Lee said, adding that there is still a long way to go
before the mystery case can be resolved.</P>
      <P>During his current eight-day visit, Lee said he has offered the
team some new suggestions concerning the direction of follow-up
probes.</P>
      <P>"The most important tasks now are to locate the gun used in the
shooting and the person who bought the gun, " Lee said, adding that
the chances of solving the case will increase greatly if these two
tasks can be accomplished.</P>
      <P>Chen and Lu were riding in an open-top jeep when they were shot
while campaigning in the southern city of Tainan March 19. One bullet
grazed Chen's stomach, while Lu was hit in the knee.</P>
      <P>Chen beat his sole challenger, opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan, in the March 20 presidential election by a slim margin.
Lien filed two lawsuits in an attempt to nullify Chen's re-election
victory and even the entire election so that a new one could be held.
The Taiwan High Court rejected the re-election annulment suit, but
Lien has appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which has yet to
hand down a ruling.</P>
      <P>The CIB has offered a reward of NT$53 million for information
leading to finding the weapon. CIB Director Hou You-yi called on
people who had bought bullets and guns from the arrested suspect,
identified as Tang Shou-yi, to come forward. The suspect had produced
more than 3,000 bullets and remodeled scores of guns. The
investigation team has managed to retrieve 19 of those guns and
300-plus bullets.</P>
      <P>CIB officials also showed examples of what the weapon should look
like to the media Thursday. The gun used in the attack was a
converted 8-mm handgun with special marks, which would make it easier
to trace the weapon, Hou said. The gun could fire two bullets in
rapid succession, making it likely that one gun fired both shots in
the March 19 shooting, Hou added.</P>
      <P>Many opposition politicians and supporters have disseminated
outrageous speculation about the shooting, including allegations that
it was staged by Chen to sway sympathy votes in his favor.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Administration overhauls
rules for U.S. forests.

The Bush administration issued broad new rules Wednesday
overhauling the guidelines for managing the nation's 155 national
forests and making it easier for regional forest managers to decide
whether to allow logging, drilling or off-road vehicles. The
long-awaited rules relax longstanding provisions on environmental
reviews and the protection of wildlife on 191 million acres of
national forest and grasslands. They also cut back on requirements
for public participation in forest planning decisions. Forest S
ervice officials said the rules were intended to give local foresters
more flexibility to respond to scientific advances and threats like
intensifying wildfires and invasive species. The rules give the
nation's regiona l forest managers and the Forest Service increased
autonomy to decide whether to allow logging roads or cellphone
towers, mining activity or new ski areas.

Wall Street Journal: Continent's drift; at expense of U.S.,
nations of Europe are drawing closer.

Opinion polls show a big majority of Poles want their troops out
of Iraq and also want Europe to have a common defense policy,
something Washington views as a possible threat to the U. S.-led
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Washington's ebbing influence in
this most pro-American swath of Europe reflects a broader phenomenon:
Some of the largest challenges facing the U.S. now flow from the
sources of its great power. America's sheer size and might breed
resentment and, in the geopolitical marketplace, stir competition.Its
economic example spurs Europe to band together to compete. Its faith
in elections prompts an effort, in Iraq and Afghanistan, to impose
democracy through arms. For many abroad, America' s goals inspire,
but its actions often exasperate.</TEXT>

said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Shih-ming made the remarks while fielding questions in a
national defense committee meeting at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Hsueh said that Beijing had floated the harsher law as a test
balloon to see what sort of reaction the international community
would have. Sensing that such a law, should it actually be put into
effect, would necessitate a timetable for action and that the bill
would be a move to destabilize the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait, Beijing leaders decided to soften the bill to one less
proactive.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsi-tien, deputy secretary-general of the National Security
Council, speaking on the same occasion, said that mainland China made
similar rumblings several years ago to oppose moves by Taiwan toward
independence and to promote cross-strait unification. At that time,
Europe, the United States, Japan, and the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) were all firmly against any expressions of
independence by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Believing that the drive had gained sufficient momentum, mainland
China unveiled a draft unification law in 1999. But since the law
would have not only affected the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, but
the United States, Japan, ASEAN and India as well, Beijing
backpedaled on the bill.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the standing committee of Beijing's National
People's Congress will start to review the draft anti-secession law
Dec. 25. Although in the past it has taken as long as two or three
years to review a draft law, Beijing may want to pass this one
quicker, he added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage's
recent remarks that the U.S. was not obligated to defend Taiwan if a
war were to break out across the Strait and that Taiwan was the main
obstacle in U.S.-China relations, calling Taiwan the "biggest
landmine," Wang said that Armitage is versed in East Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>Armitage's words were meant to remind both sides of the Taiwan
Strait not to change the status quo, which Wang said were not only
for the ears of Taiwan, but also for mainland China.</P>
      <P>Armitage said that although the Taiwan Relations Act requires
that the U.S. maintain a sufficient force in the Pacific to deter
attack, it does not require that the country defend Taiwan should it
come under attack from the mainland. He also said that the power to
declare war rests with Congress.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER TOUTS ECONOMIC  ACHIEVEMENTS DURING HIS TIME IN OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun Thursday touted the things he
has done during his time as premier to improve the nation's economy,
saying that economic growth is expected to reach a seven-year high of
5.93 percent this year.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks to parry comments by members of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -led "pan-blue alliance" that the
alliance should have the right to form the next Cabinet after winning
a majority in the Dec. 11 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party as lacking in
economic talent, the KMT has also recommended that Legislative Yuan
Vice Speaker P.K. Chiang, an economics expert and former vice
premier, be appointed as the next premier.</P>
      <P>Yu dismissed the KMT's criticism as a myth, pointing out that
this year's economic growth will be the highest since the 6.37
percent recorded in 1997.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yu said, the unemployment rate is expected to decline
to below 4.5 percent this year from a high of 5.35 percent during the
past two years of his term.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic performance now is not inferior to the three
years until May 2000 during which Vincent Siew was premier and Chiang
was vice premier and chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, Yu said.</P>
      <P>The economic growth rates in the three years of Siew's leadership
were 4.33 percent, 5.32 percent and 5.78 percent, respectively,
according to official statistics.</P>
      <P>Yu's Cabinet is set to resign en masse next month in preparation
for a Cabinet reshuffle simultaneous with the formation of a new

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-U.S. TIES SOLID, BUT TAIWAN CANNOT ABUSE U.S. TRUST: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and the United
States are solid, but Taiwan cannot abuse the trust of the U.S.,
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard
Armitage said earlier this week that Taiwan is probably the "biggest
landmine" in U.S.- China relations.</P>
      <P>In an interview with PBS television, Armitage also said that the
Taiwan Relations Act requires the United States to maintain
sufficient force in the Pacific to be able to deter attack but does
not require the country to defend Taiwan should it come under attack
from China. He further said the power to declare war rests with
Congress.</P>
      <P>Wu said he has been to the United States twice since Taiwan's
March 20 presidential election. During the two visits, Wu said he was
very much aware of the firmness of Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>In the future, Wu said he believes that relations between the two
countries will remain steadfast.</P>
      <P>Wu recalled that U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs James Kelly presented a lengthy policy statement
during a congressional hearing in April this year. His testimony will
serve as the basic guideline for future U.S. foreign policies.</P>
      <P>"Kelly's testimony showed that the United States hopes Taiwan can
refrain from taking any unilateral move to change the status quo. As
far as mainland China is concerned, the United States is opposed to
Beijing using force against Taiwan," Wu said.</P>
      <P>In his statement, Wu said, Kelly clearly mentioned that Taiwan
can cooperate with the United States in helping other countries to
democratize.</P>
      <P>"Kelly's statement let us know that we can continue to cooperate
with the United States on some policy issues. We can also continue to
rely on this good friend. But we certainly cannot abuse U.S. trust.
We cannot take U.S. support as a blank check, " Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION TO TOP NT$200 BILLION NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Investment in public construction projects
will hit NT$200 billion (US$6.21 billion) next year, Premier Yu
Shyi-kun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Fifth Public Construction Golden Awards ceremony,
Yu said that the Legislative Yuan had approved a special budget of
NT$93.1 billion for the government's 10 major construction projects
for next year, while private participation in public construction
projects is estimated to top NT$110 billion.</P>
      <P>The government's efforts to encourage private participation in
public construction have produced results in light of the fact that
the private sector's investment increased to NT$110 billion this year
from NT$62.4 billion in 2003 and NT$7.2 billion in 2002.</P>
      <P>The government has given increasing importance to investments in
public construction in recent years now that they can not only create
more job opportunities but also expand domestic demand, which are
very contributive to the nation's economic development, Yu noted.</P>
      <P>The ratio of the government's budget for public construction
projects implemented has increased in recent years with an average of
93.5 percent for the past three years, far better than during
Kuomintang-led administrations, the premier continued.</P>
      <P>The government is also more closely monitoring public
construction projects worth more than NT$100 million to improve
budget implementation efficiency.</P>
      <P>These listed projects had a combined value of NT$360 billion this
year, Yu said, adding that the amount will increase to NT$400 billion
if the public construction projects that are worth less than NT$100
million each are also taken into account.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'ANTI-SECESSION LAW' UNACCEPTABLE TO TAIWAN: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's plan to enact an
"anti-secession law" targeting Taiwan is unacceptable because it is a
provocative, unilateral move to change the status quo across the
Taiwan Strait, the nation's top mainland policy planner said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"It's an extreme and drastic move. We cannot tolerate it, "
Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu said.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, Wu continued, it's a very serious issue because the
planned legislation not only implies that the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait would eventually unite but also presumes that the present
status quo is that the two sides are connected under the same roof.</P>
      <P>"The reality is that the two sides are separate and do not belong
to each other. We are the Republic of China on one side and they are
the People's Republic of China on the other side. This status quo has
existed for 55 years," Wu explained.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Beijing's planned legislation, if passed, would
unilaterally change the cross-strait status quo, Wu said it is also a
grave provocation.</P>
      <P>Since President Chen Shui-bian's inauguration for a second term
on May 20, Wu said, the ROC government has continued to extend olive
branches to Beijing. However, he said, Beijing has consistently
responded with scathing criticism. "Their scornful rhetoric
constitutes a provocation," he asserted.</P>
      <P>In the face of Beijing's provocative legislative plan, Wu said,
Taiwan has been compelled to step up communications with key
countries around the world to help the international community
understand the seriousness of the issue.</P>
      <P>As to the U.S. views on the issue, Wu said the United States has
told the mainland in private that its planned "anti-secession law"
would have grave consequences and could trigger regional instability
and insecurity.</P>
      <P>Wu said the United States is fully aware of Taiwan's stance
on the issue and is still watching how events unfold.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOVEMBER MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION INDEX GROWS: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's manufacturing production index in
November stood at 130.89, up by 4.82 percent over the 2003 level, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials predicted that the index for December will
continue to pick up, hopefully helping achieve a double-digit growth
rate for the whole of this year. Robust investment from the private
sector and strong demand in the pre-holiday season will be the main
factors, they said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the country's industrial production index stood at
128.78 in November, an increase of 5.43 percent over the previous
year's level, according to the MOEA statistics.</P>
      <P>By industry, the index for the home construction industry climbed
by 35.78 percent compared to the level set in the same month last
year, while the mining industry index posted a growth of 1.52 percent
and the electricity, gas and water sector saw a rise of 1.51 percent
in production.</P>
      <P>The industrial production index averaged at 126.56 for the
January-November period, reflecting a growth rate of 10.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, business conditions in the domestic market
are expected to maintain brisk, in part due to the government's
efforts in launching and carrying out major public construction
projects and in part owning to the continued influx of private-sector
investment, the officials forecast.</P>
      <P>They are confident that the manufacturing production index for
this month will still record double-digit growth, in light of rising
demand to be spurred by strong buying sprees prior to the Chinese
Lunar New Year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOVEMBER EXPORT ORDER VALUE FOR TAIWAN COMPANIES 2ND HIGHEST: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  23 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign export orders placed for Taiwan
companies in November hit US$19.75 billion, the second-highest
monthly level on record, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>The figure represents a noticeable growth of 30.11 percent over
the previous year's level, MOEA statistics show. The combined value
for the first 11 months of this year totaled US$195.29 billion, a
rise of 26.56 percent year-to-year.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials attributed the increase to strong demand in the
pre-holiday season in foreign markets, particularly for computer-
related goods and steel products.</P>
      <P>But they also forecast the growth rate for the whole of next year
will slow markedly, as the impact of this year's major factors, such
as mainland China's economic cooling measures, a weakened U.S. dollar
and soaring prices for crude oil and raw materials, is yet to be
gauged.</P>
      <P>According to MOEA tallies, foreign orders for domestically made
information technology, telecommunications and electronics goods
contributed the most in setting the second-highest level in
single-month export order value, while the value of orders for
precision machinery jumped by the largest level of 61.53 percent as
compared to the 2003 record.</P>
      <P>In terms of industry, November orders for electronics products
reached US$4.338 billion in value, up by 35.52 percent compared to
the year-earlier level. Orders for IT and telecommunications devices
were worth US$3.933 billion, marking an annual growth rate of 16.19
percent.</P>
      <P>Order values for textile goods and basic metals hit US$1.018
billion and US$1.754 billion, up by 0.1 percent and 37.46 percent
year-to-year, respectively.</P>
      <P>Annual increase rates for the rubber, machinery and electrical
engineering industries all topped 30 percent, ranging from 35.59
percent to 39.18 percent, the same tallies show.</P>
      <P>In terms of country, orders from the United States last month
were worth US$5.56 billion, representing an annual growth rate of
33.69 percent. Hong Kong orders hit US$4.51 billion, up by 32.27
percent from the level a year ago. Order values from Japan and Europe
expanded by 31.49 percent and 37.04 percent to US$2.13 billion and
US$3.52 billion, respectively.</P>
      <P>According to the findings of a recent survey by the MOEA, 20.65
percent of the companies questioned last month believe that the value
of their orders will increase for December, while 45 percent think
that business will maintain stable. About 34 percent contend that
their business will slide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORENSIC EXPERT OFFERS MORE ADVICE ON SOLVING '319 SHOOTING'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dr. Henry Lee, a renowned Chinese-American
forensic scientist, said Thursday the ROC government should offer
more cash rewards and offer to reduce sentences for cooperative
criminals to help solve the March 19 shooting of President Chen
Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Lee, who arrived in Taipei last Friday for an eight-day visit,
made the remarks while meeting with Premier Yu Shyi-kun.</P>
      <P>Lee said the recent identification of the source of the gun and
bullets used in the presidential election-eve shooting does not mean
that the sensitive, high-profile case has been solved.</P>
      <P>"We must discover where the gun is and then determine who fired
the shots. This is no easy task," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the ROC government offer reduced sentences to
encourage those who have bought guns and bullets from the
now-detained underground gunsmith to come forward.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lee said, the government can increase cash rewards to
encourage local people to offer leads that may be helpful in solving
the case. The government has offered NT$53 million to whomever offers
clues leading to finding the shooter or shooters.</P>
      <P>For his part, Yu expressed his heartfelt gratitude to Lee for
assisting in investigating the unprecedented assassination attempt on
Taiwan's top leaders.</P>
      <P>Lee had headed an expert team to conduct a forensic investigation
into the shooting in April and concluded a comprehensive forensic
investigation report this summer. While duplicate copies were sent to
Taipei in August, the original copy was not handed over to Taiwan's
top prosecutor until Thursday.</P>
      <P>Before his meeting with Yu, Lee personally forwarded the original
copy of his forensic report on the shooting to State Public
Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao.</P>
      <P>"The original copy of the report is extremely important. I have
kept it with me since I arrived in Taipei Dec. 18. I did not place it
in a safe nor was it taken by any other person. To my great relief, I
finally handed it over to the state public prosecutor-general, " Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Over the past more than nine months, Lee said he has kept in
close contact with Taiwan's investigation team. He said he was glad
to learn that the team, headed by Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
Director Hou You-yi, managed to determine that a now-detained
underground gunsmith was the one who made the bullets and gun used in
the shooting.</P>
      <P>"It's a breakthrough. We should give the investigation team more
encouragement," Lee said.</P>
      <P>During his current visit, Lee said he has offered the team some
new suggestions concerning the direction of follow-up probes.</P>
      <P>"The most important tasks now are to locate the gun used in the
shooting and the person who bought the gun, " Lee said, adding that
the chances of solving the case will increase greatly if these two
tasks can be accomplished.</P>
      <P>Chen and Lu were riding in an open-top jeep when they were shot
while campaigning in the southern city of Tainan March 19. One bullet
grazed Chen's stomach, while Lu was hit in the knee.</P>
      <P>Chen beat his sole challenger, opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan, in the March 20 presidential election by a slim margin.
Lien filed two lawsuits in an attempt to nullify Chen's re-election
victory and even the entire election so that a new one could be held.
The Taiwan High Court rejected the re-election annulment suit, but
Lien has appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which has yet to
hand down a ruling.</P>
      <P>Many opposition politicians and supporters have disseminated
outrageous speculation about the shooting, including allegations that
it was staged by Chen to sway sympathy votes in his favor.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A man from Hsichih, Taipei County, was
questioned late Thursday night on suspicions of spying for the
mainland Chinese military. He was released hours later on NT$30,000
bail.</P>
      <P>The man, surnamed Tai, is alleged to have since August collected
military intelligence, including taking pictures of the Hengshan
Command Headquarters, and to have sent it to mainland China,
officials from the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice
said.</P>
      <P>The Hengshan Command Headquarters is one of the most secretive
and important military bases in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the investigators, Tai, in his 40s, mailed at least
two parcels of military information, including hand-drawn pictures of
Hengshan Command Headquarters' layout and terrain, to mainland
Chinese military and public security authorities. The parcels were
even directed to former mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, they
added.</P>
      <P>During the questioning, Tai admitted that he had collected
information on the Hengshan Command Headquarters and sent it to
mainland Chinese authorities out of indignation with Taiwan's
tumultuous politics.</P>
      <P>He denied, however, that any of the information he had sent was
"military intelligence." He also accused the investigators of
physical abusing him and asked to be sent to hospital to get
documented proof that he had been abused.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors from the Shilin District Prosecutors' Office released
Tai early Friday morning after the questioning, deciding to conduct
further investigations into the case before determining what crime to
charge him with.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT, PFP HEADS SHOULD MEET AS SOON AS POSSIBLE: KMT SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A meeting between the heads of the
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First
Party (PFP) should be held as soon as possible, KMT spokesman Chang
Jung-kung said Friday.</P>
      <P>However, Chang added that the date for such a meeting has not yet
been determined, pointing out that the date depends on the schedule
of PFP Chairman James Soong, who is currently visiting the United
States. Soong is set to return to Taiwan Sunday to attend the funeral
Monday of Faina Chiang, widow of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo.</P>
      <P>Chang said that it is a good thing for both party leaders to
meet, adding that "the sooner the better."</P>
      <P>Major topics expected to be discussed at such a meeting are a
merger of the KMT and its two splinter parties -- the PFP and the New
Party, the upcoming speaker and vice speaker elections in the
Legislative Yuan, a bill concerning the KMT's assets, the
confirmation of 29 nominees for the Control Yuan, and cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The two leaders are also expected to discuss how to respond to a
scheduled ruling Dec. 30 by Taiwan High Court on a lawsuit they filed
to try to have the March 20 presidential election nullified for
alleged widespread fraud.</P>
      <P>Following the Dec. 11 legislative elections in which the
"pan-blue alliance" surprisingly maintained its majority in the
225-seat Legislative Yuan, supporters of the alliance have called for
a quick merger to solidify the opposition force.</P>
      <P>However, Soong said right after the elections that the KMT had
shut the door on a merger. Although he didn't elaborate, reports said
that he and Lien had not been on speaking terms since mid-November
because of bickering over the allocation of a more than NT$100
million (US$3.1 million) subsidy for the Lien-Soong ticket in the
March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Soong was also reportedly dissatisfied that the KMT
voter-allocation strategy excluded the PFP legislative candidates in
the Dec. 11 elections. The KMT garnered 79 seats, up 11 seats from
the previous elections, but mostly at the expense of the PFP, which
managed to win only 34 seats, down 12 seats from the previous
elections.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taichung,  Taiwan,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Su
Jia-chyuan announced Friday that 2005 will be designated as the year
for an intensified campaign against crime.</P>
      <P>Su made the announcement while attending a joint SWAT forces
live-fire training drill in the central Taiwan city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>In addition to tackling major criminal cases, Su said, police
will prioritize a crackdown on burglary as part of the government's
all-out efforts to protect the safety of people's life and property.</P>
      <P>Noting that many people have complained about rampant burglary,
Su said the National Police Administration under the Ministry of the
Interior will cooperate with other law enforcement authorities in
fighting this crime in the coming year.</P>
      <P>He further said the Interior Ministry is determined to increase
the police headcount by 3,000 officers over the next two years to
help local governments improve grassroots law and order.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Su said, a manpower increase alone is not enough to
fight crime and improve public order. "We need to put together the
best, most agile and efficient SWAT forces deployed in different
parts of the island to take on criminals and thwart their activities,
" he said, adding that he hopes SWAT forces in various central
counties and cities can strengthen cooperation in crime fighting.</P>
      <P>SWAT forces in central Taiwan practiced live-fire shooting,
land-air combined operations and anti-kidnapping skills during the
training exercise. Taichung City Council Speaker Chang Hung-nien,
Taichung Deputy Mayor Hsiao Chia-chi and many senior police officers

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators across the political spectrum
have decided to extend the last legislative session of the
present Legislative Yuan to Jan. 21, a legislative whip of the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan, who concurrently serves as executive
director of the KMT Policy Committee, made the remarks after
Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng convened a coordination meeting
between the ruling and the opposition party caucuses on the length of
the current legislative session.</P>
      <P>The legislature resumed meeting after the Dec. 11 legislative
elections following a one-month recess. New legislators will be
sworn in Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>Tseng said legislative caucuses of various parties hey agreed that
the last session of this legislature will be extended to Jan. 21 and
will review the general budget of the central government and various
bills "related to the general public."</P>
      <P>But Tseng said that the legislators have reached no consensus on
matters related to the confirmation of the 29 nominees to the Control
Yuan.</P>
      <P>The 29 would-be members nominated by President Chen Shui-bian do
not live up to the expectations and the public are not satisfied with
them, he claimed, adding that under those circumstances, the KMT
cannot screen the list.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, caucus whip of the opposition People First Party,
noted that Chen has the right to nominate the Control Yuan members
and that the Legislative Yuan has the right to decide whether
to confirm them.</P>
      <P>"The Legislative Yuan can choose to either screen or not screen
them. Even if they do screen them, they will not be confirmed
completely, " Liu said, adding that even if the legislature cannot
complete the confirmation by Feb. 1, there is no constitutionality
question.</P>
      <P>The six-year-term tenure of the current Control Yuan is due to
expire Jan. 31 and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party has urged
the confirmation of the nominated new members so as not to trigger a
constitutional crisis.</P>
      <P>Liu said that for those nominees who have not met the
expectations of the public, the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and
the PFP will not approve them. The confirmation of the Control Yuan
nominees will also not be put on the legislative agenda next week.</P>
      <P>If President Chen Shui-bian redraws a list by Jan. 10, "then
there is some room for discussion," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming, caucus whip of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union, an ally of the DPP, said his party will respect the name-list
submitted by Chen but will screen the list rigorously.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A report by the Rand Corporation that
outlines a war scenario across the Taiwan Strait in 2012 is
hypothetical in nature and not a prediction, a senior policy analyst
at the U.S. think tank said Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the study titled "Assuring Access in Key Strategic Regions:
Toward a Long-term Strategy" for the U.S. Army, Rand posited a
scenario in which mainland China attempts a conquering strategy
designed to seize part of Taiwan with ground forces in 2012 with the
aim of pushing Taipei directly into a fast-track framework for
unification talks.</P>
      <P>Eric Larson, one of the authors of the report, said the purpose
of the study is to help the U.S. Army better understand its regional
military access in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.</P>
      <P>It is not a forecast of a military crisis across the Taiwan
Strait, Larson clarified.</P>
      <P>He said the study mainly examines the anti-access strategies of
potential adversaries and potential U.S. counters to these
strategies.</P>
      <P>On the cross-Taiwan Strait situation, Larson said he does not
wish to see war break out between Taiwan and the mainland and expects

    <HEADLINE>OVERHAUL OF BASIC NATIONAL POLICIES NEEDED: RDEC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top official in charge of research
and evaluation said Friday that the nation should rethink the logic
of interaction between the administration system and the legislative
power hierarchy and overhaul important basic national policies while
re-engineering the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Yeh Jiunn-rong, chairman of the Cabinet-level Research,
Development and Evaluation Commission, said that human rights
protection and basic national policies on the country's economic
future, as well as social and cultural development, should also be
included when the nation is talking about constitutional
re-engineering.</P>
      <P>Yeh, a scholar-turned-official, made the call during a speech to
the regular Sun Yat-sen monthly meeting held at the Presidential
Office.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the notion of Taiwan's constitutional re-engineering is
by no means an isolated case in the world. Instead, he said, Taiwan's
constitutional reform is an important section in the development of
what he described as "global constitutionalism."</P>
      <P>Yeh said that changes in the constitutions of various countries
have been diverse but can be roughly divided into four modes -- a
total rewriting of the constitution; a large-scale revision; gradual
re-engineering implemented in different stages; and step-by-step
rewriting.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan's case, the third mode would be the best option,
according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>He claimed that it is "old-fashioned" to think that a country
should hold a nationwide referendum only when it is writing a new
constitution, Yeh said, adding that the new world constitutional
reform trend has had many breakthroughs. For example, he said, some
countries have held referenda even for simple constitutional reforms.
Some countries, such as Hungary, have changed their national
designation via constitutional reform, he added.</P>
      <P>It is "pitiful" that Taiwan has ignored some aspects of the world
constitutional reform trend when the country conducted constitutional
reforms during the 1990s, aspects that include procedures,
participation by the people, human rights protection and
constitutional governance, Yeh argued.</P>
      <P>He said that President Chen Shui-bian has planned to see the
rebirth of a new constitution by 2006, paving the way for its
implementation in 2008, the year his term concludes.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who was vice president of the National Taiwan University
Institute of Law before being appointed a Cabinet official, said that
Taiwan's forthcoming "new constitutional movement" should at least
have three "new" characteristics -- a new timeframe, a new procedure
and a new arena.</P>
      <P>Taking the "new procedure" as an example, Yeh said it should be a
procedure during which democracy-strengthening moves are adopted,
including large-scale public debates, civic meetings and education
for the general public. The government can also set up an exclusive
constitutional reform Web site to gauge public opinion.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan needs a constitution that is conducive to
deepening democracy, fostering efficiency and consolidating its
national identity.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, Taiwan also needs a procedure for such
constitutional reform.</P>

Progressive Party (DPP) said Friday that what he described as the
"irrational attitude" of the opposition parties to block a NT$610.8
billion (US$18.23 billion) special budget for arms purchases from the
United States has become a "landmine" in Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Chiu Yung-jen was responding to recent remarks by
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage that Taiwan is
"probably the biggest landmine" in mainland China's relations
with the United States.</P>
      <P>He stressed that Armitage's remarks underscore Taiwan's need to
buy advanced weaponry to defend itself. Taiwan people have to realize
that they cannot rely on others and have to beef up their defenses
and have confidence in those national defenses, he added.</P>
      <P>The NT$610.8 billion special budget is for the purchase of eight
diesel-electric submarines, six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries
and a squadron of 12 anti-submarine P-3C aircraft from the United
States.</P>
      <P>He noted that a Japanese television station has reported that the
United States has deployed forces in Japan that will be able to
respond quickly in the event of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Cheng-nan also said that Taiwan's safety

Cheng-yi, superintendent of the Chiayi Branch of Chang-Gung Memorial
Hospital.</P>
      <P>The project is estimated to cost NT$8 billion (US$240.96 million)
and is scheduled for completion in March 2006, he said.</P>
      <P>Calling Chiayi his "second hometown," Wang Yung-ching said Chiayi
is where he started his business career and that he hopes to do
something meaningful to upgrade the standard of local medical
services.</P>
      <P>In the company of Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen, the tycoon
later visited the designated site of a retirement community.</P>
      <P>Chen said the community will cover an area of 265 hectares and
will be the largest of its kind in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the community is a five-minute drive from the
Taipao station of the Taiwan high-speed railway and 9 km from
Chang-Gung's Chiayi Branch, adding that he welcomes FPG's decision to
invest in the development of the community.</P>
      <P>The NT$20 billion project will include a golf course, farm, hotel
and theme park, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Wang Yung-ching, meanwhile, said the community will not only be a
retirement home but will also provide entertainment and recreational
facilities, as well as care for senior citizens.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GROWTH RATE SECURED WITH BUDGET APPROVAL FOR MAJOR CONSTRUCTION PLANS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislature's recent approval of the
budgets for the Cabinet's "Ten New Major Construction Projects" plan
will help the government meet the goal of achieving a 5 percent
economic growth rate for 2005, according to an economist.</P>
      <P>Kung Ming-hsin, a division chief at the Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research, said that the budget approval will provide massive
momentum for the country's infrastructure development, helping secure
a 5 percent economic growth rate forecast set by the Cabinet-level
Council for Economic Planning and Development -- the highest ratio
ever predicted by domestic or foreign agencies.</P>
      <P>Kung's comments came after the Legislative Yuan gave its go-ahead
Thursday to a special budget allocation by the Executive Yuan with a
combined value of NT$93 billion (US$2.9 billion).</P>
      <P>More than NT$71.1 billion of that money will go toward the
traffic network development, while some NT$10 billion will be used to
improve the quality of higher education.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics forecast that the Taiwan economy will expand by a moderate
4.56 percent for the whole of next year as a result of a slowed
global economy.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth rate will hit 5
percent next year due to the government's public construction drive
and continued investment by the private sector, a government official
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) , made the remarks during a
gathering with business leaders in central Taichung City. Minister of
Finance Lin Chuan was also present.</P>
      <P>Hu based his optimism on the fact that the country is set to
achieve an economic growth rate of 5.9 percent for the whole of this
year, the best performance in seven years, coupled with an improved
jobless rate. Taiwan's November unemployment rate stood at a
relatively low 4.14 percent -- the lowest level since May 2001.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, the CEPD is confident of meeting its 5 percent
target for 2005 on the back of start of the government's "10 New
Major Construction Projects" plan.</P>
      <P>However, Huang Mao-hsiung, chairman of the Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce, was less upbeat about the
domestic economy's performance in the coming year due to a slowed
world economy as has widely been predicted by major international
forecasting agencies.</P>
      <P>Huang said that he would rather be "cautiously optimistic" in
this regard and called for more investment from the private sector
and speedier industrial upgrading to help the government achieve its

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN TO ATTEND FORMER FIRST LADY'S FUNERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will head senior
government officials to attend the funeral of former first lady Faina
Chiang scheduled for Monday, the Ministry of National Defense (MND)
said Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an impromptu news conference, MND spokesman Navy
Capt. Liu Chih-chien said President Chen had directed the ministry to
help with funeral arrangements for Faina Chiang, widow of late
President Chiang Ching-kuo.</P>
      <P>Russian-born Faina Chiang, better known as Chiang Fang-laing in
Taiwan, died of pulmonary and cardiac failure Dec. 15 at the age of
88.</P>
      <P>As the Chiang family insisted on financing funeral costs on their
own, Liu said, the defense ministry need not use its reserve funds to
foot the bill.</P>
      <P>The funeral will be held at the Chieh Shou Hall of Veterans
General Hospital in suburban Taipei, Liu said.</P>
      <P>At the start of the news conference, Liu and other MND officials
observed a moment of silence in memory of the former first lady.</P>
      <P>On Monday, a family service will begin at 7 a.m. The public will
be welcome to pay their last respects to Faina Chiang from 8 a.m.
onward. Opposition Kuomintang party elders, including Lee Huan, Hau
Pei-tsun, Chiu Chuang-huan and Shih Chi-yang, will drape Chiang's
casket with the ROC national flag and the KMT flag.</P>
      <P>A memorial service will commence at 9:30 a.m. to be officiated by
the Reverend Chou Lien-hua, who has been pastor to the Chiang family
for decades.</P>
      <P>At 11 a.m., Chiang's casket will be moved to the Keelung
Municipal Crematorium. Her ashes will then be moved to her husband's
temporary mausoleum in Touliao, Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>An exhibition of photos of Faina Chiang and some of her personal
effects will open at an art gallery in the KMT headquarters in Taipei
Saturday, a KMT spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>On display will be 90 rare photos featuring Faina's life in
Russia, mainland China and Taiwan, the spokesman said, adding that
many of them have never been shown in public before.</P>
      <P>The exhibits will also include 50-plus furniture items from her
residence in suburban Taipei as well as some personal effects,
including clothes, handbags and jewelry.</P>
      <P>On Friday, the KMT also presented a plaque to honor Faina Chiang
posthumously.</P>
      <P>Faina Chiang met her husband while he was in the Soviet Union in
the 1930s. A woman of simple tastes with a technical school
education, Faina Chiang left her homeland in 1936 when she joined her
husband to return to mainland China. She had to adjust to joining one
of mainland China's most powerful families at the time. Mainland China
was ruled by her father-in-law, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and
the Kuomintang during the period.</P>
      <P>She fled to Taiwan along with her family in 1949 after the
Chinese Communists took control of the mainland. Her husband became
president in 1978 and ended 38 years of martial law just months
before he died in 1988. He also oversaw the island's spectacular
economic development in the 1980s.</P>
      <P>Faina Chiang avoided the spotlight and was known to be Taiwan's
most low-key first lady.</P>
      <P>The couple had three sons and one daughter. The three sons all
died, while the daughter, Chiang Hsiao-chang, lives in the United
States with her family.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Bush tries again on court
choices stalled in Senate

U.S. President Bush said Thursday that when the new Congress

convenes next month he will renominate 12 candidates to the

federal appeals courts who were denied confirmation in his

first term. In doing so, he signaled his willingness to begin

what is expected to be another bitter fight with Senate

Democrats over what they assert are his efforts to shift the

courts in a markedly more conservative direction. Although the

announcement appears at odds with Mr. Bush's post-election

remarks that he would reach out to opponents, it is in line

with what had been a principal campaign theme for him and Vice

President Dick Cheney, namely that Bush would battle Democratic

opposition to his judicial choices.

Wall Street Journal: Visible hand to fix Venezuela. ex-guerrillas
want to make 'new man'

Venezuela's fiery president, Hugo Chavez is adopting a policy of
"development from within, with materials from within, by those within
for those within."

To accomplish that goal, the Chavez government is plowing
billions of dollars into new programs, called "missions, " which act
as social welfare agencies. The missions are largely devoted to
health-care education and jobs training. Chavez plans to combine the
dozen or so existing missions into a megaproject dubbed "Mision
Cristo, " or Christ's Mission, which he proclaims will end poverty in
Venezuela by 2021. The programs are a hit among Venezuela's poor and
are helping solidify Chavez's political base. Chavez has made a
political career of exacerbating Venezuela's bitter social divisions.

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHAIRMAN SHOULD LEAD PARTY TO VICTORY IN ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR: VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Friday that
the new chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
should have the ability to lead the party to victory in the county
and city chief elections scheduled for next year.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks during a tea party with reporters covering
Presidential Office news.</P>
      <P>She said that before the next presidential election in 2008,
there are six major elections and that the DPP needs to be
well-prepared for each of them.</P>
      <P>She stressed that anyone who aspires to serve as the next
chairman of the DPP will have to pass the first major test in the
mayoral and magistrate elections in 2005, adding that these elections
are crucially related to the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>She noted that President Chen Shui-bian stepped down from his
concurrent post as DPP chairman in the wake of the
worse-than-expected performance of the DPP candidates in the Dec. 11
legislative elections. The next party chairman will also need to take
responsibility for the performance of the DPP in the 2005 elections.</P>
      <P>Lu said that "the party chairman must be capable of giving the
DPP a victory in the mayoral and magistrate elections next year. It's
as simple as that."</P>
      <P>Lu quoted Chen as saying that he has no specific person in mind to
serve the next chairman and that the new leader should be more
capable than he is and one who can revive the party.</P>
      <P>Lu also said that the next party chairman will have to be an
election genius and should be well aware of all the problems that
plagued the DPP in the Dec. 11 legislative elections. The DPP had
expected more than 100 seats in the 225-seat legislature so as to
clinch a majority with its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, but
ended with only 89 seats.</P>
      <P>Lu also said that while having lunch with Chen Friday, she asked
him if the premier will be changed, but the president said he had yet
to consider the question.</P>
      <P>Chen said he had been busy with the nomination of the Control
Yuan members and had not yet had time to think about the premiership.
He said he will start to think about the question and will also
listen to views from all sides, according to Lu.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun is expected to lead his Cabinet in a mass
resignation Feb. 1, the day the new legislature is sworn in, in line
with constitutional practice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORENSIC EXPERT CONCLUDES TAIPEI VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dr. Henry Lee, a renowned Chinese-American
forensic scientist, departed Taiwan Friday after an eight-day visit.</P>
      <P>Lee said prior to his departure that one purpose of his visit was
to review preparations for an international seminar on forensic
science to be held in Taiwan next November.</P>
      <P>Lee said he hopes the seminar can provide a conduit for
international exchanges of forensic expertise and for forging
cooperative ties in forensic investigation technolog research.</P>
      <P>During his stay, Lee met with Premier Yu Shyi-kun. Lee said he
has suggested that the ROC government upgrade the status and
authority of police to facilitate the campaign against crime.</P>
      <P>With violent crimes, including kidnapping, homicide and arson,
increasing, Lee said police need support and cooperation from the
general public to maintain law and order.</P>
      <P>Noting that public order and social stability are critical to a
country's economic development, Lee said Taiwan should improve its
crime-fighting operations, including upgrading forensic investigation
technology.</P>
      <P>Lee was born in Jiangsu province in mainland China and came to
Taiwan at the end of the Chinese Civil War when he was six. He
graduated in 1960 from the Taiwan Central Police College with a
degree in Police Science. Lee became the youngest captain in modern
Chinese history when he was promoted at the age of 22 during his
service at the Taipei City Police Headquarters.</P>
      <P>During his meeting with Yu, Lee also said the ROC government
should offer more cash rewards and offer to reduce sentences for
cooperative criminals to help solve the March 19 shooting of
President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Lee said the recent identification of the source of the gun and
bullets used in the presidential election-eve shooting does not mean
that the sensitive, high-profile case has been solved.</P>
      <P>"We must discover where the gun is, who bought the gun and then
who fired the shots. This is no easy task," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the ROC government offer reduced sentences to
encourage those who have bought guns and bullets from the
now-detained underground gunsmith to come forward.</P>
      <P>Lee had headed an expert team to conduct a forensic investigation
into the shooting in April and concluded a comprehensive forensic
investigation report this summer. While duplicate copies were sent to
Taipei in August, the original copy was not handed over to Taiwan's
top prosecutor until Thursday. Lee personally forwarded the original
copy of his forensic report on the shooting to State Public
Prosecutor-General Wu Ying-chao.</P>
      <P>"The original copy of the report is extremely important. I have
kept it with me since I arrived in Taipei Dec. 18. I did not place it
in a safe nor was it taken by any other person. To my great relief, I
finally handed it over to the state public prosecutor-general, " Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Over the past more than nine months, Lee said he has kept in
close contact with Taiwan's investigation team. He said he was glad
to learn that the team, headed by Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB)
Director Hou You-yi, managed to determine that a now-detained
underground gunsmith was the one who made the bullets and gun used in
the shooting.</P>
      <P>"It's a breakthrough. We should give the investigation team more
encouragement," Lee said.</P>
      <P>During his just-concluded visit, Lee said he has offered the team
some new suggestions concerning the direction of follow-up probes.</P>
      <P>Chen and Lu were riding in an open-top jeep when they were shot
while campaigning in the southern city of Tainan March 19. One bullet
grazed Chen's stomach, while Lu was hit in the knee.</P>
      <P>Chen beat his sole challenger, opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan, in the March 20 presidential election by a slim margin.
Lien filed two lawsuits in an attempt to nullify Chen's re-election
victory and even the entire election so that a new one could be held.
The Taiwan High Court rejected the re-election annulment suit, but
Lien has appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which has yet to
hand down a ruling.</P>
      <P>Many opposition politicians and supporters have disseminated
outrageous speculation about the shooting, including allegations that
it was staged by Chen to sway sympathy votes in his favor.</P>

      <P>The last thing that Washington wants to see
is Beijing enact an "anti-secession law" aimed at Taiwan since it
would change the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, Minister of
Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen said Friday.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the upcoming debate of the draft law by
Beijing's National People's Congress, Chen warned that the United
States, which is busy handling the deteriorating situation in Iraq
and the threat posed by North Korea, has repeatedly cautioned
mainland China and Taiwan against trying to change the status quo
unilaterally.</P>
      <P>Chen said his ministry is sure that Washington will consider
Beijing's "anti-secession law" a change to the status quo and will
press Beijing to withdraw the draft bill.</P>
      <P>Beijing has complained to Washington about Taiwan's possible plan
to rename its overseas missions using the word "Taiwan, " and,
consequently, Washington has expressed its disapproval to Taiwan. By
the same token, Chen said, Washington will relay Taipei's disapproval
of Beijing's "anti-secession law" to Beijing and will warn Beijing
that it is tantamount to a change in the status quo.</P>
      <P>Citing a government poll, Chen said that the people of Taiwan are

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of lawmakers, lawyers and scholars
urged activists for farmer rights Friday not to stage a public rally
in support of the "rice bomber, " a man now detained who is suspected
of being responsible for a spate of bomb threats in Taipei over the
past year.</P>
      <P>They made the appeal as several civic groups announced that they
are planning a 10,000-person rally in Changhua County's Erlin
township in central Taiwan this Sunday to support Yang Ju-men, who
they believe is not a criminal, but only "a tragic figure" or a
"sacrificial lamb" on the alter of Taiwan's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Legislator Chao Yung-ching of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party urged the civic groups to cancel the planned rally because it
could send the wrong message to the public.</P>
      <P>"Local farmers are indeed facing difficulties in their
livelihoods. But nobody can rationalize terrorist actions for any
excuse. If labor and farmer rights activists support Yang, the action
might inspire other people to follow suit and eventually disrupt
social stability and public safety," Chao said.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yi-lan, a professor at Central Police University, said
different opinions can be expressed through legal channels and
rational debates.</P>
      <P>"Supporting legitimate farmers rights and agricultural
development should be delinked from any terrorist. We should never
make a criminal a hero. Such a move could inspire emulation at the
expense of society as a whole," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Yang, who claims to oppose the government's policy of permitting
rice imports, allegedly placed homemade explosives in public areas
such as parks, trains, railway stations and mobile toilets in the
greater Taipei area since late last year. He is suspected of having
been involved in 11 of the 16 cases.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MATSU RESIDENTS UNSATISFIED WITH 'MINI LINKS': POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 24 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Residents on Matsu Island are not satisfied
with the direct transport and trade links maintained between the
frontline island and Mawei Port in mainland China's Fujian province,
according to the results of a recent poll.</P>
      <P>Matsu residents responding to the poll gave the links a ranking
of 59 on a 100-point scale, indicating that they were unsatisfied
with the so-called "mini three-links, " which were started Jan. 1,
2001 between Taiwan-held Kinmen and Matsu islands and the Fujian
ports of Xiamen and Mawei to compensate for the long-standing absence
of full links between Taiwan proper and the mainland.</P>
      <P>As the links near their four-year anniversary, analysts of the
survey said that sentiments so close to the failure line of 60 points
indicate that most of the people on Matsu are not pleased with the
results of the links but consider them tolerable.</P>
      <P>When asked how to increase Matsu's competitive edge, a majority
of local residents pointed to traffic improvement between Matsu and
Taiwan proper as their top concern, followed by economic development,
job creation, administrative proficiency and security.</P>
      <P>Academics praised the poll, the first of its kind with Matsu
residents, on the grounds that its findings should serve as a
valuable reference for the central government when crafting policy to
help with local development. The poll was carried out by Ming Chuan
University.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China have been at odds since 1949, when the
island split from the mainland in the wake of a civil war. Taiwan has
banned direct transport, trade and postal services with mainland
China since that year despite the fact that private-sector exchanges
have become frequent and close in recent years.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although relations between Taiwan and
mainland China have remained deadlocked for some time, Taipei is
still waiting for a response from Beijing to create an environment
beneficial to both sides, a liaison official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Sheng-fa, vice chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) , made the remarks on behalf of SEF Chairman C. F.
Koo at a board of directors meeting of the quasi-official
organization.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan has never rested in its efforts to try to
build a "win-win" situation in its ties with mainland China, Hsu
urged Beijing to respond swiftly with visionary moves to Taipei's
overtures for peace and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to the SEF vice chairman, the two sides can talk about
many mutually beneficial issues, such as reopening two-way
institutionalized negotiations, charter flight services for Taiwan
businessmen in mainland China wishing to spend the coming lunar new
year at home and direct cargo transport.</P>
      <P>Now that high emotions arising from Taiwan's recent legislative
elections are already over, the two sides should put aside their
political feuding and work jointly for the welfare and benefit of the
people on both sides. Cross-strait relations have become kind of
sensitive in recent months after the Taiwan authorities launched a
series of activities to increase national identity among its people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and mainland China have long been at odds since 1949, when

drinks his cup of forfeit. Thus, even in this case of competition, he
shows himself to be a gentleman."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. EXPERT CALLS FOR FREE TRADE PACT WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Dec.  25 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should sign a free
trade agreement with Taiwan, Greg Mastel, an international trade
adviser at the law firm Miller &amp; Chevalier in Washington, D.C. said
in an article published in the Dec. 27 issue of the Washington-based
Standard weekly.</P>
      <P>Greg said Taiwan is the United States' eighth largest trading
partner and the fifth largest economy in Asia, and is therefore a
much more promising partner for a free trade agreement than any of
the two dozen countries with which the United States is currently
negotiating such agreements. He added that a U.S.-Taiwan free trade
agreement would benefit American farmers and manufacturers and the
U.S. economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>Greg also noted that China is emerging as one of the world's
largest economies and trading powers and is vigorously building a web
of free trade agreements with its Asian neighbors which could
effectively exclude Taipei from expanding its own trade with the rest
of Asia.</P>
      <P>Some have suggested that Taiwan could pursue enhanced trade ties
with China directly, but many in Taiwan fear that increasing the
island's economic dependence on the mainland would effectively strip
Taiwan of its political autonomy.</P>
      <P>As the world's leading democracy, the United States should offer
Taiwan an alternative to dependence on totalitarian China, Greg said.
Just as the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan has secured U.S.
military support for the island, so the threat of Chinese economic
domination of the island should prompt the United States to offer an
alternative to Taipei in the form of a free trade agreement, he
argued.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States is now negotiating free trade
agreements with Asian countries which have less to offer than Taiwan
for fear of being shut out of the region by China's emerging web of
free trade agreements, Greg said the United States should by the same
token also negotiate a free trade pact with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Greg mentioned in his article that Taiwan's Minister of Economic
Affairs Ho Mei-yueh visited Washington in early December to urge the
United States to negotiate a free trade agreement with Taiwan but was
given the cold shoulder.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANY FOREIGN CHINESE-LANGUAGE STUDENTS PREFER TAIWAN TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many Chinese-language students think that
Taiwan is a better place than mainland China to learn the language,
given Taiwan's safer environment and better teaching force, among
other reasons.</P>
      <P>Febrana Tanudjaja, an Australian of Chinese origin who is
currently a student at the Mandarin teaching center of Tunghai
University, Taichung, said that it was her parents' vision that she
learn Chinese in Taiwan to acquire proficient command of the language
of their ancestors.</P>
      <P>Tanudjaja said that although she could have studied Chinese in
Australia, she found it difficult to secure a Mandarin-friendly
environment there because few people back home speak Chinese.</P>
      <P>Many of her seniors in the Chinese community in Australia
suggested that she go to Taiwan instead of mainland China to study
Chinese because Taiwan is safer and has better living conditions,
Tanudjaja said.</P>
      <P>Shida Akinobu, another student from the Tunghai Mandarin center,
echoed Tanudjaja's words, saying that Taiwan is a better choice for
foreign students trying to learn Chinese.</P>
      <P>Akinobu, who had studied Chinese in Harbin, northeastern China
during his college years, said the Chinese spoken in Taiwan is easier
for Japanese speakers to master because the retroflex sounds are
milder.</P>
      <P>A Rotary Ambassador Prize winner, Akinobu said he found that the
number of foreigners coming to Taiwan to learn Chinese has not
declined since mainland China opened its doors to foreign students.</P>
      <P>Akinobu said that he went to Harbin to learn Chinese on a student
exchange program because he had no other options. However, he said,
he decided to come to Taiwan to learn Chinese after he graduated from
a university in Japan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, both Tanudjaja and Akinobu said that the Tunghai
center is by no means inferior to other similar centers in Taipei or
elsewhere, because the center's teaching force is superb.</P>
      <P>Tanudjaja attributes her ability to deliver a speech in Chinese
after only three months of study in Taiwan to her "demanding"
lecturers at the center who stressed the importance of proper
pronunciation and use of tones.</P>
      <P>Akinobu said that Taiwan's use of complex Chinese characters, as
opposed to the simplified characters used in mainland China, as well
as its National Phonetic Symbols make it easier for foreign students
to pick up the language and speak it more proficiently.</P>
      <P>Akinobu said he strongly encourages Japanese and Korean students
to learn Chinese in Taiwan simply because the Mandarin phonetic
symbol system used here is the most efficient system for helping
foreigners pronounce Chinese correctly and eventually conversing with
Taiwan people in the shortest possible period of time.</P>
      <P>Max Woodworth, a European who studied Chinese culture at
Washington's Georgetown University, is a prominent example of a
foreigner successfully learning Chinese.</P>
      <P>Woodworth went to Beijing and Nanjing to study Chinese for a year
after his third year at Georgetown.</P>
      <P>Five years ago, when his Chinese studies in China concluded and
he had acquired a good command of mandarin Chinese, a Chinese teacher
of his suggested that he go to Taipei to attend National Chengchi
University's Sun Yat-sen Institute of Humanity and Social Studies,
which has maintained academic cooperation ties with Georgetown
University.</P>
      <P>In Chengda, Woodworth said that he found the Chengda Mandarin
Language Center to be one of the best in the world in terms of
learning Chinese.</P>
      <P>After studying for a year at the Sun Yat-sen Institute, Woodworth
joined the English daily Taipei Times as a reporter covering mainly
arts and literature news.</P>
      <P>Now able to understand about 80 percent of Chinese-language news
stories without the aid of a dictionary, Woodworth said he feels most
confident in listening and speaking Chinese but still finds writing
Chinese characters to be the most difficult part.</P>
      <P>Woodworth, who is now even venturing into learning the Taiwanese
dialect, said that the sky is the limit in learning Chinese.</P>
      <P>Another young man, William Laxton from France, has been in Taiwan
for more than two years, learning Chinese, which he described as
"very difficult."</P>
      <P>Laxon said that he was in Taiwan three years ago working on a
post-production team for the film "Millennium Mambo" directed by
Taiwan avant-garde director Hou Hsiao-hsien.</P>
      <P>Finding Taiwan an interesting place to live, Laxon decided to
return to Taipei six months after returning to France.</P>
      <P>Fascinated by Chinese culture, Laxon said he has even studied the
ancient Chinese philosophers Laoz and Chuangzhou.</P>
      <P>John Vaughan, an associate professor in the Department of Music
at Soochow University in Taipei, speaks mandarin Chinese so fluently
that he has no foreign accent.</P>
      <P>Vaughan's Taiwanese wife, Liu Yi-chih, a flutist, has been his
Chinese teacher during their marriage of 15 years.</P>
      <P>Like Woodworth, Vaughan has also developed a strong interest in
learning the Taiwanese dialect.</P>

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui is scheduled
to depart for Japan Monday for a week-long sightseeing tour, informed
sources said Sunday.</P>
      <P>This will mark Lee's first visit to Japan since 2001 when he

      <P>Lee will be accompanied by his wife, Tseng Wen-huei; their
granddaughter, Lee Kun-yi; their daughter-in-law, Chang Yue-yun; as
well as family friends Peng Rong-tsi and his wife; and Lee's
physician, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Despite strong protest from Beijing, the Japanese government
granted a visa to Lee last week after the former president presented
his visa application Dec. 17 to the Taipei Office of Japan's
Interchange Association, the de facto Japanese embassy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Officials from Taiwan's representative office in Japan said last
week that their office will extend special assistance to Lee,
including giving him preferential treatment at immigration and
customs, during his stay in Japan.</P>
      <P>Lee and his group will arrive in Nagoya Monday to start their
visit, which will also take them to Kyoto and Kanazawa.</P>
      <P>Hiroyuki Hosada, Japan's chief Cabinet secretary, said in Tokyo
last Monday that Lee's visit is private and that he will not
participate in any political activities during his stay. Hosada asked
Japan's media not to bother Lee during his visit.</P>

      <P>Chang Chun-hsiung, secretary-general of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said Sunday that he will
not run for DPP chairman and that he has informed President Chen
Shui-bian, the outgoing DPP chief, of his decision.</P>
      <P>However, Chang stressed that his decision has nothing to do with
whether or not he'll vie for the position of Legislative Yuan
speaker which depends on the DPP's overall needs.</P>
      <P>Chang announced his decision at a news conference one day before
the DPP begins registration of would-be candidates for the post of
party chairman.</P>
      <P>Noting that there will be seven important elections in Taiwan
over the next four years, including the national assembly elections
and local government chiefs elections in 2005 and the mayoral
elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung in 2006, Chang said the party
requires someone of great vigor and ability to lead it. The other
elections he was referring to are the legislative elections of 2007
and the presidential and vice presidential elections of 2008.</P>
      <P>Chang said he has informed President Chen that he has no
intention of running for party chief. Chen was reported as saying
that he understands Chang's decision.</P>
      <P>Chen Shui-bian resigned as DPP chairman after his party failed to
live up to his expectations in the Dec. 11 legislative elections. The
"pan-green camp" of the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union was
unable to win a majority in the new legislature, instead gaining only
a single seat over its pevious total.</P>

      <P>Some 90 percent of the people in Taiwan
support the government's garbage classification policy set to be
implemented at the start of next year in selected areas, according to
the results of a recent government survey.</P>
      <P>Nearly 80 percent of the respondents in the survey conducted Nov.
29-Dec. 2 by the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) said they
are confident the classification policy will effectively help reduce
the amount of rubbish.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN INVESTORS RESERVED ABOUT BEIJING'S ANTI-SECESSION DRAFT LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the fact that mainland China's
National People's Congress has begun drafting a proposed
"anti-secession law" widely believed to be aimed at Taiwan, foreign
investors have been reserved about its impact on Taiwan's stock
market, market analysts said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Market watchers said that most foreign investors have in the
current holiday season taken a wait-and-see attitude concerning the
effects of the proposed legislation on the Taiwan Stock Exchange as
the legislation's contents are still not clear at present.</P>
      <P>The turnover in the domestic bourse hit a low of less than NT$45
billion (US$11.38 billion) on Friday due to the combined effect of
the news of Beijing's move and the Christmas and New Year holidays,
during which foreign investors traditionally prefer not to
significantly move their capital in Asian markets, the analysts
explained.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's economic fundamentals remain in good shape, foreign
capital is expected to enter the domestic market in the wake of the
New Year holidays, they forecast, pointing out that political factors
should play a smaller role in the Taiwan bourse after various major
incidents over the past decade.</P>
      <P>They noted that the impact on the Taiwan stock market of
political crises has reduced with each successive event, pointing out
that the market dropped after the missile crisis in the Taiwan Strait
in 1996, after former President Lee Teng-hui's "two states" theory
remarks in 1999 and after President Chen Shui-bian's "one country on
each side of the strait" comments in 2002, but to a lesser degree
each time.</P>
      <P>Although some foreign investors said they think it is good that
domestic retail investors have become calmer when the market is hit
by a political crisis, others expressed worry that as mainland China
emerges as a world power, it will harden its stance toward Taiwan, as
witnessed by the proposed legislation, which they said could pose a
major threat to Taiwan's economic development and its capital market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, domestic institutional investors also opined that the
impact on Taiwan of the "anti-secession" law shouldn't be to
significant so long as its contents do not go far beyond what is
expected.</P>
      <P>The effects should be limited because the legislation will not
carry an immediate risk to Taiwan and because the stock market will
eventually perform on economic fundamentals, they claimed, adding
that political elements will be quickly digested by the market which
is set to catch up with the rising streak in the world's major
markets.</P>
      <P>However, some are concerned that the latest development will cast
a shadow over the so-call China-concept shares, which have strongly
rebounded in Taiwan's stock market after the Dec. 11 legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>Beijing's anti-secession draft law will put Taiwan and mainland
China at greater political risks, unavoidably provoking a
psychological effect on Taiwan investors, they said and asserted that
shipping and transport stocks as well as real estate and property
shares will mostly be affected.</P>
      <P>Ahead of mainland China's expected passage of the
"anti-secession" legislation into law in March next year, the Taiwan
stock market will be jolted by political uncertainties over the short
term, they said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should further promote
technological assistance to foreign nations, or the so-called
"technology diplomacy, " as a means of breaking China's diplomatic
embargo against Taiwan in the international arena, experts said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The experts suggested in a technology forum organized by the
Ketagalan Institute that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs integrate
officials assigned by domestic economic, trade and technological
agencies to work abroad for further promoting the country's overall
diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Tsan Ting-yi, a secretary of the Institute for Information
Industry, said that Taiwan's experience in developing science-based
parks, information industry and technology services can be used in
its foreign aid.</P>
      <P>Also, the government can offer scholarships to students in Third
World nations to come to Taiwan to learn its agricultural
technologies, she added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan can also share its experience in technological,

    <HEADLINE>LARGER NUMBERS OF THIRTY-SOMETHINGS QUITTING: DGBAS SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With widespread business closures and
company streamlining, more and more workers aged between 30 and 39 in
Taiwan have been quitting the workplace, according to a recent survey
by the government.</P>
      <P>According to the Cabinet-level Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) survey, 1.78 percent of the
country's workforce in the 30-39 age group quit the workplace,
exceeding the 1.73 percent who found work.</P>
      <P>Except for 2001, in which Taiwan was seriously hit by an economic
recession, the number of thirty-something workers finding jobs has
traditionally outstripped the number losing their jobs, DGBAS
officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials pointed out that this indicates that the job
turnover rate among the country's most productive population is
picking up despite the fact that Taiwan's economy recorded growth of
3.3 percent last year.</P>
      <P>They ascribed the phenomenon to the fact that more and more
Taiwan enterprises are relocating overseas, such as to mainland
China, and to their streamlining strategies.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS survey, the turnover rate of workers aged
over 30 years increases with age. Last year, only the 20-29 year age
group and workers older than 60 years and those younger than 20 years
saw a drop in turnover rates over the previous year's levels.</P>
      <P>Also according to the survey, respondents had worked an average
of 6.13 years for the same company as of the end of December of last
year. About 45 percent of the respondents said that they had worked
for the same company for between one and five years, while 39 percent
said that they had done so for more than five years, and 16 percent
said they had worked for the same company for less than one year.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS carried out the survey on workers at 9,600 companies in
the manufacturing and service sectors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said Monday that his party will cooperate
closely with the Kuomintang (KMT) to work out feasible policy
directions for the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The PFP chief made the comments at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport upon his return from a trip to the United States where he
visited family.</P>
      <P>According to Soong, the policy directions include maintaining the
cross-Taiwan Strait status quo and pursuing peace. He also said that
the Republic of China is the only option for the Taiwan people and
that pursuing Taiwan independence would only lead the island toward
war.</P>
      <P>The most important thing is to push for the enactment of a
cross-strait peace law and for ethnic equality in Taiwan, Soong said,
adding that both the KMT and PFP are concerned about the well-being
and future of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>He noted that the basic policies and principles of the KMT-PFP
cooperation have been set, saying that the Republic of China is the
only option and that the two parties absolutely do not favor
provoking the other side of the Taiwan Strait at the present time.</P>
      <P>"We must use reform and the promise of a better future for all in
order to win the confidence and trust of the people," he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the PFP will present clear and definite policies in
order to give the Taiwan people peace of mind, Soong promised that
his party will push for the enactment of a cross-strait peace law and
will cooperate with the KMT in order to offer the people the best
options -- namely maintaining the status quo, pushing for the opening
of the "three direct links" across the strait, and rescuing Taiwan's
economy.</P>
      <P>Soong was greeted by Legislative Yuan President Wang jin-pyng,
leading members of the PFP, and several of his supporters at the
airport. He is scheduled to attend the funeral of former first lady Faina
Chiang later in the day in Taipei.</P>

      <P>More than 346,000 American tourists
visited Taiwan in the first eleven months of this year, or an
increase of 44 percent over the figure for the same period a year

      <P>The statistics show that a total of 240,000 U.S. tourists visited

year's level due to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) on the island.</P>
      <P>The fact that the number of U.S. tourists to Taiwan for the
Jan.-Nov. period of this year was already over the figure for the whole
of 2003 demonstrates that the shadow cast by SARS has been lifted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FUNERAL SERVICE FOR FORMER FIRST LADY HELD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People in Taiwan bid farewell Monday to
former first lady Faina Chiang, who was born in Russia but dedicated
most of her long life to helping Chinese people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>A formal funeral service for Faina Chiang, widow of the late
President Chiang Ching-kuo, was held at Taipei Veterans General
Hospital's Chieh Shou Hall, with at least 1,000 politicians and
people from all walks of life paying their last respects to the
beloved former first lady.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu attended
the funeral service for Faina Chiang, who died of respiratory and
cardiac failure Dec. 15 at the age of 90 according to the Chinese
calendar.</P>
      <P>President Chen issued a posthumous citation in honor of Faina
Chiang, better known as Chiang Fang-liang, praising her as a "woman
of talent and virtue."</P>
      <P>Vladislav Verchenko, director of the Moscow-Taipei Economic and
Cultural Coordination Commission, also attended the funeral service
to pay his last respects to the former ROC first lady.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairmen Wang Jin-pyng, Lin
Cheng-chih, P. K. Chiang and Ma Ying-jeou draped Faina Chiang's
casket with the party flag, and four party elders, Lee Huan, Hau
Pei-tsun, Chiu Chuang-huan and Shih Chi-yang, draped the casket with
the ROC national flag in recognition of her contribution to the party
and the nation.</P>
      <P>The funeral was followed by a Christian memorial service led by
Rev. Chou Lien-hua, who has been the Chiang family's pastor for
decades.</P>
      <P>At 11 a.m., Faina Chiang's casket was moved to the Keelung
Municipal Crematorium. Her ashes were later taken to her husband's
temporary mausoleum in Touliao, Taoyuan County. The couple's ashes
will be buried together at a military cemetery next year.</P>
      <P>Faina Chiang met her husband while he was living in the Soviet
Union in the 1930s. A woman of simple tastes with a technical school
education, Faina Chiang left her homeland in 1936 to accompany her
husband back to mainland China. She had to adjust to joining one of
mainland China's most powerful families at the time. Mainland China
was ruled by her father-in-law, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, and
the Kuomintang during the period.</P>
      <P>She fled to Taiwan along with her family in 1949 after the
Chinese Communists took control of the mainland. Her husband became
president in 1978 and ended 38 years of martial law just months

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S MILITARY EXPANSION THREATENS REGIONAL SECURITY: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's military expansion has not
only affected the situation in the Taiwan Strait, it has also
seriously threatened the security in the Asia-Pacific region, an
official in charge of mainland Chinese policy said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chiu Tai-san, a vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), was responding to an 85-page white paper issued earlier in the
day by Beijing's State Council on the Chinese military's
modernization plans.</P>
      <P>Chiu said that Chinese authorities ought to understand by now
that " military expansion will not help the development of
cross-strait relations, and will only instill bad feelings in the
Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>He noted that in recent years, mainland China has increased its
national defense and arms procurement budgets, undermining regional
security, something that South Korea and Japan have responded to.</P>
      <P>"The international community will now wonder whether China will
move...toward becoming an 'evil force,'" he said, adding that Beijing
should squarely address the reaction of Taiwan and the international
community regarding its actions.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another MAC vice chairman also said that problems
resulting from mainland China's recent policy to cool down its
overheated economy have begun to emerge.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-hsun said that Beijing's overheated economy has been
"controlled" to a certain degree through government policies, but
inflationary pressures and an imbalance in supply and demand have yet
to ease. Also, the unemployment rate continues to rise, the
short-term credit for businesses is greatly reduced because of a
tightening in the credit market, and the banks are awash with money,
which he said will increase the risks of bad loans and the collapse
of the financial system.</P>
      <P>Liu said that mainland China's economic growth has relied too
much on fixed investments and exports, and that if it can't
effectively raise the ratio of private consumption in its gross
national product, problems surrounding the overheating of its economy
will still be present in the very basic structure of the economic
framework.</P>
      <P>Moreover, small- and medium-sized enterprises and farmers are the
biggest victims of the policies, underscoring that fact that the gap
between the rich and the poor has continued to widen, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu said that since Beijing implemented its policies, two-thirds
of mainland Chinese provinces still lack sufficient electricity.
Energy shortages have become the biggest problem in the economic
development of mainland China, and if this situation cannot be
resolved, it will be difficult for mainland China to maintain its
rapid economic development, he added.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is unlikely to

message, a Presidential Office spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-chung, director of the Public Affairs Department of the
Presidential Office, was responding to a newspaper report that
President Chen will announce his choice for the next premier in his
New Year's Day message.</P>
      <P>The report was incorrect, Chen Wen-chung said, adding that
President Chen will only expound on his vision for future national
development and the government's work agenda for the new year in his
New Year's Day message.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun has on many occasions said he and all Cabinet
members will resign en masse before the new Legislative Yuan is
inaugurated on Feb. 1, 2005.</P>
      <P>Speculation about who will be the next premier has been rife.
After the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang (KMT) and
the People First Party managed to retain its slim majority party in
the Dec. 11 legislative elections, senior KMT officials have claimed
that the majority party in the legislature should have the right to
form a new Cabinet. However, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
has insisted that the right to name a premier rests with the
president, not anybody else, under the existing constitutional
provisions.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Union has decided to send a
group of information technology and e-health experts to Taiwan in
April next year to explore bilateral cooperation, a spokesman for the
Cabinet-level National Science Council (NSC) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Under the E.U.'s Framework Programme for Research and
Technological Development, its directorate general of Information
Society Technologies hopes to increase contacts and understanding
with Asian countries by inviting them to take part in various
research and development projects, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>The 40-member E.U. delegation is slated to travel to Taiwan in
late April and host a series of activities, including holding
seminars with local counterparts and visiting the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park and the Tainan Science-based Industrial
Park.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is one of the four countries that the E. U. delegation
plans to visit in line with its GAPFILL Project for the first half of
2005, in addition to Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.</P>
      <P>According to NSC Vice Chairman Chi Gou-chung, E. U. officials got
a strong impression of the country's e-health industry's development
after a local mission, jointly put together by National Taiwan
University President Chen Wei-chao and medical school professors,
showcased Taiwan's medical care technology at an annual exhibition,
which opened Nov. 15 in The Hague.</P>
      <P>That contact helped create an opportunity for the two sides to
cooperate in related fields at a time when the E. U. is keen on
developing a portable sensor that could be applied in the textile
industry for broader uses in health care for babies, children,
pregnant women and elderly people, he said.</P>
      <P>E-health is defined as the use of advanced telecommunications,

advanced networks and new design approaches that are aimed at

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING NIXES CHARTER FLIGHT SERVICE DURING CHINESE NEW YEAR: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is not interested in a
proposed charter flight service for Taiwan businessmen operating on
the mainland that would operate during the Chinese New Year holidays,
the head of the nation's top policy-planner for mainland Chinese
affairs said Monday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made
the remarks on the sidelines of a seminar on mainland China's
finances.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that his council and other related government agencies
had prepared for the charter flight service for the Chinese New Year,
which falls on Feb. 9, 2005, and that they were hoping that a good
time for both sides to discuss the matter would have been after the
Dec. 11 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>But information received by the MAC shows that Beijing will not
consult with Taiwan on the issue or any others, and that Chinese
officials even said that "they have no interest" in the charter
flight service.</P>
      <P>Wu said earlier that Beijing was lukewarm to the idea of charter
flights, and that if cross-strait consultations became too difficult,
Taiwan would have been willing to adopt the 2003 model -- meaning
that six Taiwan air carriers would make the one-way service via a
third place to pick up the Taiwan businessmen in the mainland for the
Chinese New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait charter flight service was inaugurated in 2003
on a trial basis, but the service was not continued during Chinese
New Year holidays in 2004 because both sides failed to consult each
other on Beijing's request for two-way flight services without
stopping in a third place.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the government and civic groups have
urged leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to promote the
charter flight service for the welfare of the people and use it to
break the cross-strait impasse.</P>
      <P>They made the appeal in a public hearing sponsored by the Council
for Industrial and Commercial Development (CICD) and the Friends of
Hong Kong and Macau Association. Participants included Fu Don-cheng,
director of MAC's Department of Economic Affairs, CICD President Kuo
Tai-chiang, association Secretary-General Chang Wu-ueh, and
representatives from six Taiwan air carriers.</P>
      <P>Fu noted that the charter flight service would have required
effort and goodwill from both sides, while Kuo said despite both
sides being pessimistic about the flight service because of political
factors, the service would have been crucial to cross-strait peace
and the wellbeing of the people, and that even the slimmest hope must
be maintained regarding the issue.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Beijing is now reviewing its "anti-secession
law, " which he said will seriously affect cross-strait relations and
deepen the differences between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, there are more reasons for both sides to cooperate to
promote this charter flight service to resolve cross-strait
misunderstanding and differences," he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's top mainland China policy
charter urged Beijing Monday to consider the impact on cross-Taiwan
Strait relations of its proposed anti-secession law.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made
the remarks amid reports that Beijing's National People's Congress
(NPC) Standing Committee agreed Sunday to submit the proposed law to
the full NPC for consideration next March.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the MAC is trying to learn more about the details of
the draft law, but he stressed that the proposed law is a provocation
to Taiwan and a serious unilateral violation of the cross-strait
status quo.</P>
      <P>Nearly 80 percent of Taiwan's people are opposed to the proposed
law, Wu claimed, which shows that the mainland's attempts to lure
Taiwan people has in fact made them drift further away.</P>
      <P>At a reception for foreign media, Wu also urged the international
community to "block" the mainland from enacting the anti-secession
law.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the international community will respond only
after it sees the contents of the proposed law, but this, he said,
"will be too late" as the law by that time will have been promulgated</P>
      <P>He claimed that the international community is ignoring the
mainland's hostility toward Taiwan, which he said seems to send a
message to Beijing that it "can do whatever it wants with Taiwan, "
including enacting a law that would be used as a legal basis for
using force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that since 1949, the Republic of China and the People's
Republic of China have been two separate independent entities that
have no jurisdiction over each other. This is the cross-strait status
quo, Wu said. Peaceful co-existence should be the common goal of both
sides, he went on, adding that one side should not use force against
the other or violate the status quo without prior peaceful
consultations.</P>
      <P>Through the proposed law, Wu said, Beijing has defined the
cross-strait status as "unification" and that it has jurisdiction
over Taiwan, which is a unilateral change of the status quo.</P>
      <P>While Beijing returns Taipei's goodwill with intimidation,
squeezes Taiwan's maneuvering space in the international community
and continues to impose its "one China" principle, the international
community has "remained silent," according to Wu.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing's missile and submarine deployments have posed a
serious threat to regional peace and stability, Wu said the
international community has yet to express worry about its military
expansion, nor has it opposed the anti-secession law.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan is willing to consult with Beijing on any issues,
including political issues, so as to mitigate cross-strait tension,
but until that time, the mainland must terminate and forego its
anti-secession law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CENTRAL BANK MAY NOT RAISE RATES AS PRESSURE EASES: TIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The central bank may not raise key interest
rates in a forthcoming meeting, as inflationary pressure has largely
eased due to various factors at home and abroad, Taiwan Institute of
Economic Research (TIER) President Wu Rong-i said Monday.</P>
      <P>Wu made the forecast in a news conference, citing reasons such as
falling international prices of crude oil, a rising New Taiwan dollar
and growth rate drops in salaries.</P>
      <P>The various elements have brought down inflationary pressure,
greatly reducing the chances of the Central Bank of China (CBC)
deciding to hike its key interest rates in the meeting scheduled for
Thursday, despite an obvious rate gap with the United States, Wu
said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Federal Reserve already increased key interest rates
five times this year since June, with its latest hike Dec. 15.
However, the CBC only lifted its interest rates once -- by a quarter
percentage point -- in late September.</P>
      <P>The TIER president forecast that the new Taiwan dollar will
continue to appreciate on the grounds that it is widely assumed that
mainland China's renminbi will pick up in value next year, prompting
the local currency to gain in value as well.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar is expected to remain at a relatively
strong level for some time, as the CBC is unlikely to allow the local
unit to fluctuate sharply, in order to secure continued economic
development, he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a monthly survey conducted by the TIER on the domestic
business climate shows that most Taiwan enterprises are cautiously
optimistic about their business conditions for the months ahead,
despite the fact that the index for November fell to 102.58 points
from October's 104.2 points -- the fourth decrease in a row.</P>
      <P>It finds that 20.2 percent of the Taiwan companies polled in
November felt positive about their business conditions in the first
half of next year -- an increase from 11.7 percent in October.</P>
      <P>Some 61.3 percent thought their businesses would remain stable, a
drop from 65.7 percent, while the percentage of those that foresaw
worsening business fell to 18.5 percent from 22.6 percent, the poll
finds. It also indicates that car accessories, insurance, bicycle
manufacturing, retail sales, steel and basic metal are promising
businesses in the coming months.</P>
      <P>TIER analysts attributed the optimistic sentiments to the
government's "10 New Major Construction Projects" plan that will be
launched next year with budget allocations approved recently by the
Legislative Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TAKES ACTION TO HELP EARTHQUAKE, TSUNAMI VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  27  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian sent his
condolences to the Asian countries hit by an earthquake and tsunamis
Sunday that killed thousands of people in the largest regional
disaster in a century, a spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu also noted that the MOFA has set up a taskforce, with
Foreign Minister Tan Sun Chen serving as convener, to deal with
Taiwan's relief to the affected countries, including Indonesia,
Thailand and Sri Lanka, while opening a telephone hotline
(0912-581-007) to accept donations from the public.</P>
      <P>The 9.0-magnitude earthquake rocked Indonesia Sunday and
triggered massive tidal waves that swept across the Indian Ocean,
affecting areas as far away as Somalia on Africa's eastern coast.</P>
      <P>The natural disaster hit at least nine countries -- Indonesia,
India, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar, Somalia and
Bangladesh.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official pointed out that his ministry has mapped out a
preliminary relief plan, with US$100,000 cash aid to Indonesia, as
well as US$50,000 for each of the three worst-hit countries --
Thailand, India and Sri Lanka.</P>
      <P>Due to the fact that it normally takes two to three weeks to open
an official account for relief funds, a situation that will slow down
Taiwan's aid to the affected countries, the government might take the
same action as that in aid to Iraqi war refugees last year -- having
the MOFA chief launch a public activity aimed at calling for
donations to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Taiwan that are
able to transfer the relief to the affected countries in the shortest
possible time, according to the MOFA spokesman.</P>
      <P>Lu said the MOFA is scheduled to open a meeting with
representatives of the country's nearly 20 NGO groups Tuesday to
discuss the best ways to provide humanitarian aid to the affected
countries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOFA has listed the Thai island of Phuket, Sri
Lanka, the Maldives, and the Malaysian islands of Penang and Langkawi
as yellow-alert zones for tourism because of the utter devastation
wrought by the tsunami, while the whole of Indonesia has been put on
the yellow list due to a potential danger of terrorist attack,
according to the MOFA.</P>
      <P>The MOFA reminded people who want to travel to those regions to
check relevant information and warnings on the MOFA Bureau of
Consular Affairs' Web site before setting off, and to pay more
attention to their safety during their visits.</P>

      <P>More than 20,000 people were reported dead around southern Asia
and as far away as Somalia on Africa's eastern coast, most killed by
massive tidal waves that smashed coastlines after a magnitude 9.0
earthquake off the northern tip of Sumatra Sunday, followed by
aftershocks in the region.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, about 150 Taiwan fishing boats
usually operate in the areas that were swamped by the tidal waves.
They usually make port calls at Phuket, Malaysia's Penang, Sri
Lanka's Colombo and the Indonesian resort island of Bali.</P>
      <P>Because of often inconvenient communication services in those
regions, the officials said, they could only get information through
Taiwan's representative offices in those countries and local agents
of Taiwan fishing companies.</P>
      <P>To the best of their knowledge, the officials said, Taiwan
fishing boats operating in waters off Colombo, Bali and Penang have
not been affected by the devastating tsunami disaster. Only 35 Taiwan
fishing boats operating in the waters around Phuket were beached and
some of their fishing gear damaged. Several of the ships have already
resumed operations after minor repairs, the officials said, adding
that property and catch losses have not yet been estimated.</P>
      <P>The officials said they will keep in contact with Taiwan fishing
boats operating in those areas through local fishery radio stations
in order to offer timely assistance.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a six-member advance relief team organized by the
Taipei city government will leave for the Indonesian city of Medan
Tuesday on their way to the quake-stricken northern tip of Sumatra.</P>
      <P>A municipal official said the team will bring with it 3 tons of
relief goods, including food, tents and medicine to help the
survivors.</P>
      <P>The six-member team will be headed by Tsai Chia-lung, deputy
chief of the municipal Fire Department's international rescue
division.</P>
      <P>A 35-member rescue team organized by the nation's
post-disaster relief association will also leave for Phuket Tuesday
for search and rescue missions.</P>
      <P>Also on Monday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
listed Phuket, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Penang as "yellow"-travel
alert zones, and urged people intending to visit those regions to be
careful. The whole of Indonesia has been listed as a "yellow"-travel
alert area due to potential terrorist attack threats.</P>
      <P>An infectious disease expert also advised local people to refrain
from making non-essential visits to those areas for the time being
because epidemics could break out in flooded areas.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said the ROC government will
offer US$100,000 in relief aid to Indonesia and US$50,000 to each of
the three other worst-hit countries -- Thailand, India and Sri
Lanka.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS PERSONNEL RESHUFFLE ISSUE WITH NEW THINKING: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will address
personnel reshuffle issues involving the premiership, legislative
speakership and chairmanship of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) with "brand new thinking, " a party heavyweight said
Monday.</P>
      <P>DPP acting Chairman Ker Chien-ming, who concurrently serves as
the top DPP legislative whip, was responding to media speculation
that Premier Yu Shyi-kun is likely to vie for the DPP chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Ker said what is certain at the moment is that DPP
Secretary-General Chang Chun-hsiung will not vie for the post left
vacant by Chen, who resigned as DPP chairman earlier this month to
assume responsibility for the party's failure to reach its target of
winning a majority in the Dec. 11 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Ker said Chen will employ a "brand new angle" in tackling
personnel reshuffle issues, including the DPP chairman and premier as
well as the Legislative Yuan president and vice president.</P>
      <P>Yu has on many occasions said he and all Cabinet members will
resign en masse according to protocol before the new legislature is
inaugurated Feb. 1, and speculation about who will be the new premier
has been rife.</P>
      <P>DPP members will elect their new party chairman Jan. 30 and
candidacy registration began Monday. Ker said the Cabinet reshuffle
situation might become a bit clearer after DPP chairman candidacy
registration ends Dec. 31.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ker said Chen is also making an overall review of
relations between the opposition and ruling camps, Taiwan-U.S.
relations and relations across the Taiwan Strait, and will work out
new strategies with new vision.</P>
      <P>He also urged major factions within the DPP to stop squabbling
over the legislative election shambles. As the ruling party, he said,
the DPP should project a positive image of intraparty unity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ECONOMY STABLE, FLASHES GREEN LIGHT FOR NOVEMBER: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan economy remained stable in
November compared to October, flashing a green light according to a
government rating system, the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>In the five-color rating scheme designed by the CEPD, red means
an overheated economy, yellow-red indicates a heating up economy,
yellow-blue represents sluggishness and blue points to recession.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the composite index for November stood at 29 points --
the same level as the previous month, according to the CEPD. The
leading index and the current indexes came to 105.2 and 109.8,
marking falls of 1.5 percent and 0.3 percent month-to-month,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department, said that five leading elements -- consumer product
prices, interest rates, oil prices, staple commodity prices and
Taiwan's relations with mainland China -- will significantly
influence the domestic economy in the coming year.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials forecast that international oil prices should
remain between US$40 and US$45 per barrel next year. A price below
US$40 a barrel will not be possible, they claimed.</P>
      <P>As the world economy has widely been forecast to slow down in
2005, coupled with possible effects related to the course of the U.S.
dollar and the mainland efforts to cool its overheated economy, most
Taiwan companies are reserved about their business conditions in the
three months to come, according to the results of a CEPD survey
carried out in November.</P>
      <P>Some 12 percent of the companies interviewed last month thought
their operations would improve over the next three months, down from
13 percent in October.</P>
      <P>A drop from 72 percent to 67 percent expected their business to
remain regular, while a fall from 21 percent to 15 percent -- the
largest decrease since April 2003 -- forecast a decline in their
business, the survey discovered.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials said that the domestic economy will continue to
develop soundly, basing their argument on the fact that the jobless
rate has declined for three consecutive months and that
private-sector investment continues to grow, in addition to the
much-expected massive momentum to be produced by the government's "10
New Major Construction Projects" plan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's jobless rate stood at 4.14 percent for November -- a new
low since May 2001.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC HEAD BLAMES MAINLAND CHINA FOR ALIENATING TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will draw fire from around
the world and aggravate Taiwan's hostility if it resorts to force
instead of peaceful means to solve its disputes with Taiwan, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a comment on Beijing's Defense White Paper in which the
mainland vows to crack down on Taiwan independence by whatever means
necessary, Wu said Beijing has exposed its naivety by believing it
can stop Taiwan from moving toward independence with military
intimidation.</P>
      <P>The mainland is flying in the face of the civilized world by
insisting upon keeping the option of force to iron out disputes in a
world that, according to Wu, stresses peaceful dialogue as the only
means of settling disputes.</P>
      <P>He dismissed Beijing's claims in the white paper that it is
disarming, claiming that the mainland is simply shifting its
resources to develop missiles and submarines that pose a serious
threat to its neighbors.</P>
      <P>Wu said Beijing has bent over backward to set back its relations
with Taiwan ever after President Chen Shui-bian was sworn in for his
second term May 20, including spurning an olive branch from Chen in
his double-ten National Day speech.</P>
      <P>In a related development Monday, the Ministry of National Defense
reserved its comment on Beijing's defense white paper.</P>
      <P>Vice Defense Minister Huo Shou-yeh said his ministry has not yet
read the white paper but added that he will not be surprised if it
shows that Beijing is getting tough with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Huo said, his ministry will keep trying to build a
military mutual-trust mechanism with Beijing which, according to
Beijing's white paper, is possible only if Taiwan forsakes any
attempts toward independence and acknowledges itself to be a part of
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. TO WORK WITH TAIWAN TO RESOLVE CODDLING MOTH CONCERNS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will work with Taiwan to
resolve coddling moth concerns with regard to apples imported from
the United States, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) said in a
press release Monday.</P>
      <P>The AIT was responding to a temporary import ban imposed by the
Council of Agriculture (COA) on apples from the United States Dec. 21
after discovering a coddling moth larvae in a shipment of apples from
Oregon.</P>
      <P>The AIT said that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S.
apple exporters and itself are all taking the matter extremely
seriously and appreciate Taiwan's cooperative approach to resolving
quarantine issues.</P>
      <P>The goal of both the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service (APHIS) and the COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health
Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) is to prevent the introduction of
coddling moths to Taiwan from the United States, according to the
press release.</P>
      <P>As a result of the recent detection, APHIS will begin an
investigation of the most recent coddling moth discovery immediately,
it continued.</P>
      <P>COA officials said that the import ban will be lifted only after
the United States conducts a thorough inspection and makes necessary
improvements that are endorsed by the COA's BAPHIQ.</P>
      <P>Quarantine officials discovered coddling moth larvae in apple
shipments from the United States Sept. 1, Oct. 7 and Oct. 14, and
warned the U.S. authorities that they would have to make improvement
in efforts to prevent the dangerous pest from making its way into
apples destined for export.</P>
      <P>However, quarantine officials discovered another coddling moth
larvae in a apple shipment from Oregon Dec. 20. The insect was
immediately sent to National Chunghsing University for DNA testing
that confirmed the insect species.</P>
      <P>According to a Taiwan-U.S. pact signed in August 2003 concerning
working procedures for U.S. apple exports to Taiwan, the COA can
suspend imports if the United States fails twice to improve the
contamination situation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan discovered coddling moth larvae in a shipment of U.S.
apples for the first time in 1992 and imposed a temporary ban at
that time. Imports resumed only after quarantine officials confirmed
that the United States had made necessary improvements.</P>

      <P>A total of 346,000 American tourists
visited Taiwan in the first 11 months of this year, up 44 percent

Americans to make overseas trips.</P>
      <P>TECRO officials said that the number of American tourist arrivals
to Taiwan has been back to the level of 2002 from a sharp drop in the

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's buildup of military forces
belies its claims that its defense is focused on protecting its
security, an Executive Yuan spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a response to Beijing's 2004 defense white paper issued in
Beijing earlier that day, Chen Chi-mai said Beijing's sharp increase
in military spending every year and its deployment of missiles
targeting Taiwan give the lie to its claims that its defense policy
is aimed at protecting its territory.</P>
      <P>Without revealing his sources, Chen said the mainland's defense
budget is growing by double digits every year and has hit 211.7
billion renminbi (US$25.57 billion) this year, which represents an
increase of 12.5 percent over the previous year and next only to the
United States and Russia.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the mainland has deployed 600 missiles and 730
bombers within range of Taiwan, and the range of its long-distance
missiles cover Japan, South Korea and U.S. bases in Asia.</P>
      <P>Chen said Beijing's aggressive military buildup has tipped the
military balance across the Taiwan Strait in its favor and has
effectively destroyed the peace between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>In order to address the military imbalance, Chen called on
the Taiwan people to support the government's plan to purchase
US$18.23 billion-worth of arms from the United States.</P>

(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell
said Monday that this is not a time to escalate tension in the Taiwan
Straits.</P>
      <P>Powell made the comments while responding to reporters' questions
at a press conference regarding China's just-released defense white
paper and its proposed anti-secession law.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he is worried that the defense white paper, which
emphasizes the possibility of the use of force against Taiwan, and
the anti-secession legislation could have a negative effect on the
situation in the Taiwan Strait, Powell said: "I'm aware that there is
modernization taking place in the Chinese armed forces, and we are
monitoring that closely, and we're in conversations with our Chinese
colleagues about it."</P>
      <P>"So I don't see reason for immediate concern at the moment. I
think everybody realizes that this is not the time to escalate
tension in the straits. And we hope that that will continue to be the
case," he further said.</P>
      <P>The secretary also reiterated that the United States is still
committed to its one-China policy.</P>
      <P>"It rests on the three communiques and our obligations under the
Taiwan Relations Act. And we have always encouraged both parties to
find ways to reach out to one another, " he said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Agriculture Chairman Lee
Chin-lung said Tuesday he takes pride in seeing Taiwan-grown rice
make successful inroads into Japan.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks while presiding over a ceremony at Kaohsiung
Harbor in southern Taiwan marking the delivery of 90 tons of "Fuli"
rice grown in the eastern county of Hualien to Japan.</P>
      <P>Noting that Japan has imposed extremely stringent standards in
rice quality examination, Lee said the export of Fuli rice to Japan
is a mark of pride for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It was the second shipment of Fuli rice to Japan, following an
initial shipment of 18 tons in October of this year. With the October
shipment receiving an enthusiastic response from Japanese consumers,
Lee said, Japanese importers placed an additional order for 90 tons
of Fuli rice. Lee said the export volume is expected to reach 300
tons next year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan last exported rice to Japan in 1971. The resumption of
rice exports to Japan indicates that the quality of locally grown
rice has received foreign recognition and that the government's
response measures to cope with the impact of Taiwan's entry into the
World Trade Organization have been appropriate, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The Fuli rice was grown in the unpolluted upper stretch of the
Hsiukuluan Creek in Hualien with organic farming methods, Lee
explained, adding that the rice has a wonderful taste and texture.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IS MAINLAND CHINA'S MILITARY FOCUS: DEFENSE MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is the prime motivator behind the
military buildup in mainland China, an official of the Ministry of
National Defense maintained Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Shih-chien, deputy director of the information center under
the defense ministry's Office of the Deputy Chief of General Staff
for Intelligence, was responding to questions about an annual defense
policy report released by mainland China Monday.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is increasing its efforts to modernize its
military to better deal with threats of independence from Taiwan and
because of ever-changing global situations, according to the white
paper.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that the 2004 white paper produced by the Chinese
Defense Ministry is basically the same as in previous years; however,
mainland China this year is emphasizing the buildup of its amphibious
forces, the ability of its air force to have advanced defensive and
offensive capabilities, and enhancing its artillery's ability to
respond quickly to events as they happen.</P>
      <P>"One can see from its [the white paper's] contents that the
buildup is aimed at us," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's national defense budget expenditures have
increased every year at a double-digit rate, he said, adding that the
report only listed the budgets that Beijing believes ought to be made
public. The paper also compared mainland China's national defense
budget with those of the United States, Japan and Great Britain.</P>
      <P>However, Wang said, the actual figure for mainland China's
defense budgets should be three or four times that of the amount
published.</P>
      <P>The main aim of the paper, according to Wang, is to assuage
concerns that mainland China is a global threat and to assure the
world that it is only following the path of peace as a nation on the
rise.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Taiwan's military buildup aims at achieving
effective deterrence and defense, and its arms purchases are based on
defense purposes only.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's rise in presence and power is the main threat to
Asia-Pacific regional security, he said, urging the establishment of
confidence-building mechanisms between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait to safeguard stability and peace.</P>
      <P>Faced with mainland China's continued military expansion, he also
urged the public to support the government's proposed arms purchase
of eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12 P-3C
anti-submarine aircraft and six Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile batteries
from the United States to safeguard the nation's security.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THREE VERSIONS OF DRAFT BILLS CONCERNING PARTY ASSETS PUT ON AGENDA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three versions of draft bills concerning
party assets were put on the legislative agenda Tuesday for
discussion in Friday's floor meeting.</P>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) tried in vain to block the version by the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party -- a draft bill to examine and
dispose of assets obtained by political parties and their subsidiary
organizations -- and the one offered by its ally, the Taiwan
Solidarity Union, on ill-gotten assets of civic groups.</P>
      <P>The versions by the DPP, the TSU, and the People First Party
(PFP) followed a discussion in the Legislative Yuan on a political
party draft bill proposed by the KMT earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>However, the ruling and opposition parties could not agree on the
draft bill, so Chiang Ping-kun, vice speaker of the legislature, who
was presiding over the meeting, ruled that the draft bill be shelved
until further consultations among the various political parties.</P>
      <P>Faced with dogged controversy over its many party assets, the KMT
proposed a draft bill that stipulates that sources of income for
political parties must be transparent, restricts political parties
from running businesses and regulates the scope of party assets.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the DPP said the KMT's bill fails to address the
use of party assets in the past and whether these assets can be
recovered, and proposed its own draft bill.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Sun Ta-chien said the PFP's draft bill aims to
serve as a "reminder, " meaning that after the "pan-blue alliance"
managed to maintain its majority in the Dec. 11 legislative
elections, it should live up to expectations by the public for
reforms regarding KMT party assets.</P>
      <P>Sun said that the PFP's version of the draft bill on the
examination and disposal of party assets will be a "reminder of good
intentions, " adding that there will be little time for it to be
enacted into law before this legislative session ends in late
January.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming, TSU caucus whip in the legislature, said that
the most troublesome part of the KMT's political party draft bill is
the section that states that "a party should not hold more than 20
percent of shares in a business," and that before the bill is enacted
into law, parties must seek to reduce their shares to less than 20
percent in two years.</P>
      <P>Chen criticized the section as trying to give the KMT a legal
framework for selling off its ill-gotten assets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO COMMENT FROM MOFA ON REPORTS ABOUT VISIT BY SECRET U.S. ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
declined to comment Tuesday on media reports that the United States
has recently sent a special envoy to Taipei to meet with President
Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular news conference, Victor J. Chin, director
of the MOFA's North American Affairs Department, said there have been
close communication channels between Taiwan and the United States and
that the two sides may also send special envoys from time to time to
address matters of mutual concern under certain extraordinary
circumstances.</P>
      <P>While some of those exchanges could be made public, several other
engagements could not be revealed due to the terms of a Taiwan-U.S.
tacit understanding, Chin said.</P>
      <P>As an example, he noted that the United States publicly sent
Congressman Jim Leech to attend the May 20 inauguration of President
Chen Shui-bian, while other engagements have been kept confidential.
Consequently, Chin said, the Foreign Ministry must refrain from
making any public comments on topics falling within that category.</P>
      <P>According to a newspaper report, the Bush administration sent an
"important representative" to Taipei a few days before Christmas to
meet with Chen. During their meeting, the report quoted unidentified
sources as saying that the envoy had assured Chen that the U.S.
stance and attitude toward relations with Taiwan will remain
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The report further said the envoy was positive toward Chen's
major policy statements outlined in his May 20 inauguration speech
and that the two sides had discussed Beijing's plan to enact a
so-called anti-secession law.</P>
      <P>At Tuesday's news conference, Chin said that as the United States
is still on Christmas holiday, it may be some time before the Bush
administration comes up with a comprehensive response to the
anti-secession legislation.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he acknowledged that U.S. Secretary of State Colin
Powell said at a Monday news conference on the recent earthquake and
tsunami disasters in South Asia that this is not the time to escalate
tension in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Powell made the comments while responding to reporters' questions
regarding mainland China's just-released defense white paper and its
proposed anti-secession law.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he is worried that the defense white paper, which
emphasizes the possibility of the use of force against Taiwan, and
the anti-secession legislation, could have a negative effect on the
situation in the Taiwan Strait, Powell said: "I'm aware that there is
modernization taking place in the Chinese armed forces, and we are
monitoring that closely... I think everybody realizes that this is
not the time to escalate tension in the straits."</P>
      <P>Chin said the United States has consistently opposed any move
that could lead to changes to the Taiwan Strait status quo. In other
words, Chin said, the United States would definitely oppose Beijing's
anti-secession legislation if it involves changes to the Taiwan
Strait status quo.</P>
      <P>Since Beijing announced its plan to enact an anti-secession law
targeting Taiwan, Chin said the Republic of China government has
continuously exchanged views with the U.S. authorities on the issue.</P>
      <P>"Beijing has yet to reveal the text of the legislation and the
government will continue to maintain close contacts with the U.S.
authorities and express our grave concern about Beijing's new
legislation," Chin said.</P>
      <P>Since Chen's inauguration for a second term in May, Chin said,
Taiwan has on numerous occasions extended olive branches to Beijing.
However, Beijing has so far not made any goodwill response, Chin
said, adding that the government will let the Bush administration
fully understand this situation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS KMT'S PROPOSAL FOR CHARTER FLIGHTS TO MAINLAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) fully
supported the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) idea of inaugurating
charter flights between Taiwan and mainland China during the Chinese
Lunar New Year holidays, MAC Spokesman Chiu Tai-san said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chiu made the statement after members of KMT caucus at the
Legislative Yuan called on MAC Chairman Joseph Wu to exchange views
with him about the KMT's plan.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the MAC would like to see the KMT go through
with its plan of having charter flights between Shanghai and Taoyuan,
and would agree to expand them to other mainland cities such as
Guangzhou and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The KMT is seeking the MAC's support to open charter flights
following the pattern used in 2003 under which the Taipei authorities
allowed local carriers to discuss charter flights with the Beijing
authorities.</P>
      <P>Once approved, the flights would be used exclusively for Taiwan
businessmen operating on the mainland during the Chinese Lunar New
Year holidays, which begins on Feb. 9.</P>
      <P>Beijing has insisted on having mainland carriers join their
Taiwan counterparts in providing the charter services and the flights
between Shanghai and Taoyuan should not stop in a third place,
usually Hong Kong or Macau, as is necessary under Taiwan's policy of
not having direct flight between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities said it was interested in the proposal but
that details needed to be worked out between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Beijing, which boycotts any official contact with Taiwan
authorities for fear of giving credit to Taiwan's claim that it is an
independent state, refused to negotiate this year. Instead it
proposed to have private carriers apply for flight permission from
aviation authorities in Taiwan and Shanghai separately.</P>
      <P>With only 40 days to go before the Chinese New Year holiday,
industry analysts said that the chances the KMT could succeed in
lining up the charter flights for Taiwan businessmen who want to
return to Taiwan for the holiday is slim.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that there are 500,000 Taiwanese living on the
mainland, and it won't be easy for them to get a flight ticket to
return to their homeland during the new year's holiday, which is the
traditional time for family reunions.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 28 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The scale of Taiwan's information security
market is expected to expand to some NT$16.7 billion (US$522 million)
in value by 2007 from this year's level of NT$9 billion, an analyst
for the Institute for Information Industry's Market
Intelligence Center said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Fang Yi-wen said that the total value of information security
products such as anti-virus software, as well as network security
mechanisms, purchased by domestic businesses amounted to NT$5.2
billion in 2004, an 18 percent increase over last year, while the
market scale in terms of information security services was valued at
NT$3.8 billion this year, a 38 percent surge.</P>
      <P>The need for active self-defense mechanisms and efficient
security appliances in the face of information security threats has
accelerated Taiwan enterprises' moves to institute security
facilities against information technology crime, Fang said.</P>
      <P>He added that it is also expected that the market scale in terms
of information security services will surpass that of security
appliances for the first time by 2007, with an expected value of
NT$8.5 billion for services and NT$8.2 billion for products.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
said Tuesday he is firmly convinced that substantive Taiwan-U.S.

      <P>The minister was responding to a press inquiry about his views on

with President Chen Shui-bian, which the report claimed was a sign
that there is no change in Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen did not respond directly to a question as to whether
the report was correct. Instead, he said that after Deputy U.S.
Secretary of State Richard Armitage described in a television
interview earlier this month that Taiwan was the "biggest landmine"
in U.S.-China relations, some domestic politicians and pundits have
taken President Chen to task for so-called "deteriorating"
Taiwan-U.S. ties.</P>
      <P>Some politicians have even claimed that U.S. President George W.
Bush dislikes President Chen and has cursed him. In the face of all

not been clouded by any problems as some people have claimed, " the

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called on the
public Tuesday to make good use of the ocean around Taiwan because,
he said, the ocean is where the island's future lies.</P>
      <P>Presiding over the opening of a maritime cultural and art museum
financed by the Yang Ming Marine Transport Corp. in Keelung, a harbor
city in northern Taiwan, Chen said Taiwan owes much of its marvelous
economic achievements to the ocean.</P>
      <P>Taiwan people, most of whose ancestors came to the island by
sailing across the risky Taiwan Strait from mainland China, are
predisposed to taking risks for a better future, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The risk-taking mentality of its people has played a big role in
shaping the island's unique culture and has contributed greatly to
the country's prosperity, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan ranks 25th in the world in terms of average
national income, first in the world in terms of the extent to which
the government has made public government-related information, third
in terms of the amount of foreign exchange reserves, seventh in terms
of the amount of its overseas investments and 16th in terms of the
volume of its international trade, Chen said all these factors depend
to a large extent on the island's well-developed maritime shipping
industry.</P>
      <P>The president also lauded the performance of the Yang Ming Marine
Transport Corp., which has been ranked first among the nation's

      <P>The Buddhist Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation -- Taiwan's largest charity group -- said Tuesday it will
send a 29-member medical team to Sri Lanka Wednesday to help with
post-disaster relief work there.</P>
      <P>The team will be composed of medical professionals, as well as
relief volunteers and counselors, a foundation spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Sri Lanka is one of the countries hit hardest by massive killer
tidal waves over the weekend. In addition to offering emergency
medical services, the spokesman said, the team will survey the extent
of the devastation, as well as provide relief goods to the people
there most in need.</P>
      <P>The team, to be headed by Wang Li-hsin, deputy chief of Tzu Chi
Hospital in Hualien, will begin its work in Hambantona in southern
Sri Lanka, which was one of the worst-hit zones.</P>
      <P>The team will take with it 3,000 body bags, 8,000 blankets,
antibiotics and other medicines, as well as various other medical
equipment.</P>
      <P>The Tzu Chi foundation, which has branches in many countries
around the world, will launch a global fund-raising campaign to help
the victims in nine countries affected by Sunday's strong earthquake
off the Indonesian island of Sumatra and ensuing tsunami, the
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, Tzu Chi branches in Indonesia,
Thailand and Malaysia have already begun post-disaster relief work in
the three countries, including distributing relief goods.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a team of 10 medical and relief workers organized by
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) left for Medan, Indonesia
early Tuesday morning, bringing with them some 3.5 tons of food,
medicine, tents and sleeping bags.</P>
      <P>Another 35-member team, organized by the non-profit Rescue
Headquarters of Taiwan, left for the Thai resort island of Phuket at
around noon, carrying relief supplies and advanced rescue equipment,
including an underwater robot.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said the government will
offer US$100,000 in relief aid to Indonesia and US$50,000 to each of
the three other worst-hit countries -- Thailand, India and Sri Lanka.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan citizen was killed when a tsunami devastated Phuket, a
popular tourist destination, while two others are still missing, Lu
said.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, MOFA listed Phuket, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and
Penang as "yellow"-travel alert zones, and urged people intending to
visit those regions to be careful. The whole of Indonesia has been
listed as a "yellow"-travel alert area due to potential terrorist
attack threats.</P>
      <P>An infectious disease expert also advised local people to refrain
from making non-essential visits to those areas for the time being

    <TEXT>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) will work
together with the Kuomintang (KMT) in defending the existence of the
Republic of China but will compete against it in pushing for reforms
while firmly opposing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) drive for Taiwan independence, PFP Chairman James Soong said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Soong, who took a break from a visit to the United States to
return to Taiwan for Monday's funeral of Faina Chiang, widow of late
President Chiang Ching-kuo, made the statement before flying back to
the United States to continue his visit.</P>
      <P>He said his party will not compromise on its stance of defending
the existence of the ROC and the Constitution, opposing Taiwan
independence and promoting peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As for its ties with other major political parties, Soong said
the PFP cannot agree with DPP's policy of pursuing Taiwan
independence, but will not rule out the possibility of cooperating
with any party in dealing with issues concerning the public good.</P>
      <P>The PFP will cooperate with the KMT -- from which it split
several years ago -- in defending the ROC, but will compete against
it in pushing for reforms, Soong said.</P>
      <P>Claiming there are no urgent pending issues between the PFP and
the KMT, Soong said he did not meet with KMT Chairman Lien Chan
during his brief return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Soong, who was Lien's running mate in the latter's unsuccessful
second bid for the presidency in March, fell out with Lien after the
PFP lost 12 seats in the Dec. 11 legislative elections.</P>
      <P>He blamed the KMT for contributing to the PFP's
worse-than-expected performance in the legislative elections by
backing out of its commitment to the PFP.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of this, Soong reneged on a promise he made to
merge his PFP with the KMT after Dec. 11 and was reported as having
refused to meet with Lien to work out a united front between the two
parties on many political issues in the Legislative Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC RECALLS AMBASSADOR POSTED IN GRENADA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  29 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has recalled its
ambassador posted in Grenada to express its indignation with the way
that the Caribbean ally has handled its formal diplomatic relations
with Taiwan, sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ambassador Allan L.S. Jiang returned over the weekend to Taiwan
where he will stay "indefinitely," MOFA officials said.</P>
      <P>The move is an uncharacteristically "sharp" one for Taiwan in
dealing with diplomatic allies that have wavered between maintaining
ties with Taipei and switching diplomatic recognition to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taipei notified the Grenadian government Dec. 24 of its decision
to recall Jiang after Grenadian Prime Minister Keith Mitchell visited
Beijing recently, during which Mitchell said that Grenada would seek
to normalize relations with mainland China, MOFA officials noted.</P>
      <P>Mitchell had hinted that Grenada would switch its recognition
from Taipei to Beijing following his trip to China in mid-December.
Mitchell reportedly said relations between Taiwan and Grenada have
worsened since President Chen Shui-bian took office in 2000 and that
"it is clear that Grenada is no longer important to Taiwan, " since
"Taiwan has not taken its diplomatic relations with Grenada
seriously."</P>
      <P>Mitchell also disclosed that Beijing had promised to provide a
large amount of funding to finance a number of development projects
in Grenada.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Michel Lu dismissed Mitchell's accusations as rude
and unfair soon after Mitchell made the remarks upon his return to
Grenada from Beijing Dec. 17. Lu said that the ROC government has
treated all its diplomatic allies with equal respect and has not done
any disservice to Grenada.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan refuses to engage in "dollar diplomacy, " Lu
told Mitchell to "go ahead" if he believes Beijing will cash its
checks. Lu said that Taiwan is prepared for the worst-case scenario
as far as its diplomatic relations with Grenada are concerned.</P>
      <P>According to Jiang, Mitchell's remarks made in a televised speech
to the nation Dec. 20 showed that Grenada was paving the way for
normalization of relations with mainland China, although the prime
minister did not say that his nation was severing ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Jiang said he reckoned that Mitchell was trying to please Beijing
and justify his trip to mainland China by intentionally criticizing
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that bilateral cooperation projects between Taiwan and
Grenada have never ceased since the two countries established
diplomatic ties 15 years ago.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen even visited Grenada in
September to show Taiwan's concern for the damage done by Hurricane
Ivan, and Taiwan has offered US$4 million as relief aid to Grenada in
the aftermath of the disaster.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading member of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Wednesday proposed that opposition People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong serve as convener of the
cross-strait peace development committee.</P>
      <P>DPP Acting Chairman Ker Chien-ming made the proposal while
talking about DPP-PFP cooperation issues at a press conference held
at the Legislative Yuan. PFP Chairman James Soong said a day earlier
that his party would not exclude the possibility of cooperation with
any political parties on issues regarding the public interest and the
well-being of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Welcoming the outcome of Tuesday's xxxx meeting in which three
versions of draft bills concerning party assets were put on the
legislative agenda for debate in Friday's meeting, Ker, who also
serves as the convener of the DPP caucus at the Legislative Yuan,
said that the outcome is a good start for interactions among the
different political parties.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the people of Taiwan want to see reconciliation
between the "pan-blue alliance" and "pan-green camp" and hope to see
the two opposing camps engage in dialogue, the acting chairman said
that he is well aware that the PFP head is for cooperation with the
DPP on issues regarding the people's well-being.</P>
      <P>Ker said that the DPP hopes to strengthen cooperation and engage
in dialogue with the PFP, the KMT and the Non-Partisan Solidarity
Union on various issues, including judicial, political and
financial reforms, as well as government restructuring, the economy,
and issues regarding the people's well-being.</P>
      <P>Touching on the PFP's different stances on unification versus
independence issue, Kei said that the most important thing for the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait is to create stability and put aside
issues related to unification versus independence.</P>
      <P>Noting that the PFP has already proposed the enactment of a law
to promote cross-strait peace, Ker said that it would be suitable to
have Soong act as an "icebreaker" in cross-strait relations by
serving as convener of the cross-strait peace development committee.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S MONITORING SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF DETECTING TSUNAMIS: MOTC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Dec.  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's earthquake monitoring and
detecting systems are among the most advanced in the world and are
capable of detecting tsunamis, Vice Minister of Transportation and
Telecommunications Oliver F. L. Yu said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yu said that although there are not any regulations or laws in
place in Taiwan regarding responses to tsunamis, the Executive Yuan,
the Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications (MOTC) , and
harbor bureaus around the country have maintained standardized
operational policies and measures against natural disasters.</P>
      <P>It is believed that the earthquake detecting systems installed
around the island are capable of monitoring and reporting tsunamis so
that relevant agencies can issue alarms in time to prevent major
damage, Yu noted.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks during an interpellation session at the
Executive Yuan, where opposition Legislator Lee Hsien-jung asked him
whether and how Taiwan is capable of meeting challenges that would be
brought by tsunamis. Lee's question came following Sunday's massive
earthquake offshore western Indonesia and ensuing tsunamis which
killed tens of thousands of people and caused major damage in many
countries in the region.</P>
      <P>Yu said the chances of Taiwan being hit by tsunamis are low
because of the deep waters to the east of the island. He added that
if tsunamis were to hit, the most likely spot would be Keelung harbor
on Taiwan's northeastern cape. However, he said the waters off
Keelung as well as the inner and outer dikes off the northern port
city would absorb most of the devastating force.</P>

      <P>The National Health Insurance IC cards will
from Jan. 1 record information of major physical examinations and

Health Insurance (BNHI) officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The new function will help the bureau monitor repeat

      <P>The new monitoring system was announced in the wake of reports
that some chronic patients have visited different hospitals to get
repeated prescriptions in order to give them away to their families
and friends in mainland China or sell them on to other people.</P>
      <P>Repetition of expensive examinations such as computed tomography
scanning, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography
is also very common, especially when a patient is being transferred
from one hospital to another, Liu said.</P>
      <P>He said the bureau will provide special counseling to any
patients found to have obtained repeated prescriptions and will
encourage hospitals to digitize the examination reports of their
patients to facilitate the transmission of such reports between
hospitals.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan Wednesday urged the Taiwan High Court to hand down a ruling
which "offspring will be proud of" on an opposition lawsuit to
nullify the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Lien made the call at a weekly meeting of the party's Central
Standing Committee, a day before the court is scheduled to release
its ruling on the case.</P>
      <P>Lien has alleged that the results of the election were swayed by
various electoral scandals, a referendum held on the same day of the
election, the activation of a "national security mechanism" that he
claims barred a number of police and military servicemen from going
to the polls, and the election-eve shooting of President Chen

    <HEADLINE>AIT LAND LEASE SYMBOLIZES U.S. AMITY TOWARD TAIWAN: MOFA REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A decision by the United States to lease a
piece of land in Taipei to accommodate its representative office
symbolizes its amity toward the Republic of China, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said in a report released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ministry was referring to a 99-year lease on a 6.5 hectare
plot of land in Taipei's Neihu district signed by the American
Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and its Taiwanese counterpart, the
Coordination Council for North American Affairs (CCNAA), Dec. 22.</P>
      <P>The MOFA report said the United States will invest US$160 million
in building a new office complex on the land. As it will be a massive
investment project, the report said, the U.S. authorities went for a
99-year lease according to U.S. practice in similar construction
projects in many other countries.</P>
      <P>The new lease will take effect Jan. 1, 2005, the report said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan-U.S. relations are critical to Taiwan's
development in the international community and Taiwan Strait
security, the report said the U.S. decision to build a brand new
office complex is a concrete move to show its amity toward Taiwan and
will bring positive effects for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report was supposed to have been delivered at a joint meeting
of the Legislative Yuan's foreign affairs and budget committees, but
the meeting was canceled when many of the legislators did not bother
to turn up.</P>
      <P>The AIT, which was founded under the terms of the Taiwan Relations
Act, represents U.S. interests in Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties. It has offices in Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA report, the ownership of the site that
accommodates the AIT's existing office on Taipei's Hsinyi Road will
be returned to the Taipei city government once the lease expires.</P>
      <P>Addressing the new lease signing ceremony last Wednesday, Douglas
Paal, head of the AIT Taipei Office, described the new lease as an
important milestone in substantive relations between the people of
Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>The lease was signed by Paal and CCNAA Secretary-General Chen
Chung. ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen also attended the
signing ceremony.</P>
      <P>Paal said AIT is designing a new building to be constructed on
the Neihu plot. Paal said he hopes the new building will not only
help enhance the beauty of Taipei's landscape but will also become
the pride of Taipei citizens.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA officials, the rent will be paid in a lump sum
of about NT$339 million at the start of the contract. If all goes
well, the officials said, the new AIT building will be completed by
the end of 2008 or early 2009.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Olympic gold medalist Chen
Shih-hsin will be told by the government to decline offers to teach
in mainland China, the top official in charge of athletic and sports
affairs said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chuan-shou, chairman of the Cabinet-level National Council
on Physical Fitness and Sports, said at the Legislative Yuan that
taekwondo fighter Chen Shih-hsin will be instructed to follow the
country's rules governing top athletes from national teams, including
prohibition of such people from heading to the mainland for formal
teaching jobs.</P>
      <P>The top sports affairs official said that Chen Shih-hsin and her
father called at his office Tuesday and clarified recent media
reports that a Shanghai-based martial arts institute has presented
her a letter of appointment inviting her to teach at the school.</P>
      <P>Chen Shih-hsin said she indeed received a letter of appointment
from the Shanghai Qingpu Martial Arts Institute during a recent
tourism visit she made to Shanghai, but she said she thought it was
just a kind of honor and that she received no payment from the
school. "I didn't even bring the letter back to Taiwan," she said.</P>
      <P>The sports affairs minister said that if Taiwan sporting talent
intend to be employed in mainland China as coaches, they must first
obtain approval from the Mainland Affairs Council and the National
Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.</P>
      <P>Citing the country's regulations, Minister Chen said that
recipients of national sports medals should also return their cash
prizes to the nation if their behavior infringes upon national
interests.</P>
      <P>Chen Shih-hsin and another taekwondo fighter, Chu Mu-yen, won gold
medals at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, breaking Taiwan's gold medal
duck in its 72-year history of taking part in the Olympics.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for a visiting nine-member delegation from
the Shanghai Physical Fitness and Sports Association said Wednesday
that the association has no precise ideas as to whether Chen
Shih-hsin has promised the Shanghai martial arts institute to be a
coach nor when she will be there coaching.</P>
      <P>The spokesman noted, however, that outstanding Taiwan athletes
like Chen Shih-hsin are always welcome to be coaches on the mainland
so that "both sides will complement each other and in turn further
rev up their overall athletic standards."</P>

as causing major damage to the infrastructure in many countries
around the Indian Ocean region.</P>
      <P>The 23 vessels were among 35 Taiwan fishing boats operating near
Phuket.</P>
      <P>Only one crewman on one of the Taiwan fishing boats was known to
be injured and it remains to be learned exactly how much property and
catch losses the boats sustained during the disaster, Fishery
Administration officials said.</P>
      <P>The Fishery Administration has also not decided whether the
administration will dispatch officials to Thailand or other South
Asian countries that were swept by Sunday's tsunami to gain further
understanding of the aftermath.</P>
      <P>The Fishery Administration called for owners and operators of the
affected Taiwan fishing boats and their crews to call the fishermen's
associations with which they are registered for help and subsidies in
the wake of the disaster.</P>
      <P>Some 150 Taiwan fishing boats regularly operate in the Indian
Ocean. They usually make port calls at Phuket, Malaysia's Penang, Sri
Lanka's Colombo and the Indonesian resort island of Bali.</P>
      <P>The officials said they will keep in contact with Taiwan fishing
boats operating in those areas through local fishery radio stations
in order to offer timely assistance.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Allowing Taiwan's banking
institutions to operate branches in mainland China would be a "win
win" policy benefiting the economies of both Taiwan and the mainland,
the chairman of Chinatrust Financial Holding Co. said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top banking magnate, Jeffrey Koo, said that the mainland
is currently the largest financial market in the world, but Taiwan's
financial institutions are not allowed to open branches there as a
result of the political deadlock across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the mainland's financial market will be
dominated by foreign banks in several years, Koo said.</P>
      <P>It will be a daunting task for Taiwan banks to win the custom of
Taiwanese businessmen operating on the mainland once they have
established solid relations with foreign banks, Koo said.</P>
      <P>Koo said that Chinatrust Financial Holding only maintains a
representative office in Beijing. According to norms of the World
Trade Organization, of which both Taiwan and the mainland are
members, a bank's representative office can be upgraded into a branch
after two years of operations as an office.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Koo said, he has no answer as to whether and if the
Chinatrust Financial Holding representative office in Beijing will be
allowed to be upgraded into a branch, given the political situation
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Koo made the remarks during a ceremony to mark the 31st founding
anniversary of the Lukang Folk Arts Museum, which was established by
the Koo family in the building their ancestors lived in hundreds of
years ago.</P>

      <P>Vice Minister of National Defense Michael
Tsai declined to comment Wednesday on a report that Minister of
National Defense Lee Jye offered to resign last week over the delay
in the passage through the legislature of a NT$610.8 billion
(US$18.23 billion) arms procurement plan.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai said that as political appointees, Lee and himself
are supposed to tender their resignations in the process of a Cabinet
reshuffle.</P>
      <P>Tsai was asked about the report at the Legislative Yuan's
National Defense Committee but said only that he regrets the fact
that the legislature has shelved the arms procurement plan and
admitted that the ministry should be held responsible for failing to
win legislators' support for the plan.</P>
      <P>Lee had previously said that he would step down if the arms
procurement plan fails to obtain the legislature's approval.</P>
      <P>On the shopping list are six Patriot-III anti-missile batteries,

(By Amy Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President
Lee Teng-hui arrived Wednesday in Kanazawa, capital of the Ishikawa
prefecture in central Japan, on the second stop of a seven-day
sightseeing trip.</P>
      <P>Lee was greeted by a crowd of well-wishers when he disembarked
from an express train at Kanazawa railway station in the company of
friends and members of his family.</P>
      <P>The 300-plus well-wishers included Lee's Japanese friends and
Taiwanese expatriates in Japan. They waved Japanese and ROC national
flags and held up a Japanese banner that said: "Mr. Lee Teng-hui,
welcome to Kanazawa."</P>
      <P>Lee smiled and doffed his hat to wave to the cheering crowd.
Later in the day, he toured major tourist attractions in Kanazawa
where traditional Japanese urban landscape has been well preserved.</P>
      <P>In addition to visiting Kenrokuen -- one of Japan's three most
famous gardens, Kanazawa Castle and a kimono fabric production
facility, Lee also paid a visit to the ancestral house of Yoichi
Hatta, a Japanese engineer who designed the Wushantou reservoir in
the southern Taiwan county of Tainan during Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>Lee and his entourage arrived in Nagoya Monday to start his trip,
which will also take them to the ancient capital of Kyoto, where Lee
attended university in 1943 when Taiwan was a Japanese colony, and
Osaka.</P>
      <P>Even though Lee's visit is private in nature, it still drew loud
protests from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee riled Beijing during his 12 years in office from 1988-2000
when he campaigned to raise Taiwan's international profile. He
redefined the island's ties with China in 1999 as a "special
state-to-state" relationship, causing Beijing to break off
fence-mending talks which remain suspended to this day.</P>
      <P>Japanese officials said Lee is visiting as a private citizen and
as such, had no basis for turning down his visa application.</P>
      <P>Lee last traveled to Japan in April 2001, when he had treatment
for a heart condition. He will conclude his current visit and return
to Taiwan Jan.2.</P>

      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen
met Wednesday with representatives in Taiwan of tsunami-hit nations,
including India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, to find out what
Taiwan can do to assist their countries.</P>
      <P>The meetings were arranged after Premier Yu Shyi-kun announced
earlier in the day that the government would offer US$5 million in
humanitarian aid for the countries affected by deadly tidal waves
triggered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake under the Indian Ocean on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen said after the meetings that Indonesia and Thailand are in
dire need of aid, especially coroners and medical supplies.</P>
      <P>Malaysia and India do not require any foreign assistance for the
time being because the post-disaster situations are being taken care
of by their governments, Chen added.</P>
      <P>India, meanwhile, promised to help pass on Taiwan's assistance

offices in Taiwan, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen said his ministry will comprehensively formulate how the

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF LOCAL ELDERLY CITIZENS TO DOUBLE IN 20 YEARS: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of elderly citizens will double
in the next 20 years, with those aged over 75 registering the fastest
growth, a National Taiwan University (NTU) professor said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-chiung, a public health policy professor, said at a
ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of the NTU's population and
gender research center that with post-World War II baby boomers
aging, Taiwan's elderly population will show "explosive growth."</P>
      <P>According to the latest tallies by the Council for Economic
PLanning and Development, Taiwan had about 2.14 million people aged
65 or older in 2004. Among them, 1.28 million aged between 65 and 74,
accounting for 59.8 percent of the total elderly population, while
860,000, or 40.2 percent of the total, were aged 75 or older.</P>
      <P>By 2031, Wu said, the number of elderly citizens will reach an
estimated 5.65 million, with those aged between 65 and 74 totaling
about 3.2 million or 56.7 percent, with those older than that surging
to 2.45 million or 43.3 percent.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Wu said, the percentages of the working population --
those aged between 15 and 64 -- to the non-working population was
71.3 percent versus 28.7 percent. Wu said the financial burden of
Taiwan's working population will reach a serious level in 2051 when
the ratio will be 55.6 percent versus 44.4 percent.</P>
      <P>With women generally living longer than men by five to six years,
Wu said women will dominate elderly age groups. In 2000, the
female-male ratio among those older than 65 was 898 to 997 and the
ratio for those aged over 80 was 134 to 149.</P>
      <P>According to Wu's estimate, the female-male ratio among those
aged over 65 will be 1,231 to 1,125 by 2010, and the ratio will be
253 to 240 among those aged over 80. By 2030, the ratio will be 2,711
to 2,328 among those aged over 65 and 543 to 371 among those aged
over 80.</P>
      <P>In her view, Wu said, care for elderly single women, including
those widowed or divorced, will be a serious problem along with the
aging of the population in general.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ELECTRICITY AND WATER RATES TO BE RAISED: ECONOMICS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Electricity and water rates will be raised,
Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At a year-end news conference, Ho said electricity rates will be
raised no more than NT$0.5 per unit, or one kilowatt/hour.</P>
      <P>Since the average household consumes 300 units a month, the rate
hike will increase the electricity bill of each household by about
NT$150 (US$4.71), Ho said.</P>
      <P>In order to justify the raise in electricity rates, Ho said
Taiwan's electricity costs NT$2.07 per unit on average, which is far
less than the NT$4.8 per unit in Japan, NT$3.74 per unit in Hong
Kong, NT$3.56 per unit in the Philippines, and NT$2.13 per unit in
South Korea.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Ho argued, the increase in international oil prices
has driven up the cost of producing electricity, and the Taiwan Power
Company is expected to lose NT$9 billion (U$281.95 million) next year
if it does not adjust rates.</P>
      <P>For the same reason, the price of water will also be raised, the
minister said, arguing that Taiwan's water rates, now NT$10.77 per
ton, are unreasonable cheap compared to NT$62.7 per ton in Germany,
NT$56.7 per ton in Denmark, NT$17.5 per ton in the United States,
NT$14.4 per ton in Canada, and between NT$17 to NT$44 per ton in Hong
Kong.</P>
      <P>Although the cost of water is not particularly affected by the
price of oil, the minister said Taiwan's water rates have remained
unchanged for 10 years. A rate hike will also encourage users not to
waste water and will give the water company the resources to fund
replacing aging pipelines.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as to the question of whether to allow local
manufacturers of small LCD panels and integrated circuits to invest
in mainland China, Ho said her ministry understands local
businessmen's desire to get the green light from the government, but
the economics ministry can't make that decision by itself.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing is crafting an "anti-secession law" with
Taiwan as its target, Ho said some policy-makers believe this

    <TEXT>Manila Bulletin: Hunger,

Thousands of corpses rotted in Indonesia's
tropical sun on Wednesday as many who escaped death
in the worst tsunamis in recorded history faced a
fight for survival against hunger and disease.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: 25 Filipinos
feared dead 

IVY CATHERINE Tomenio, along with her Japanese
husband and their three young children, left their
hotel in Phuket, Thailand, that Sunday morning to see
the island's famed beaches when the killer waves came.

The Philippine Star: 16 Filipinos feared dead but
no confirmation yet

More Filipinos are feared to have died in the
killer tsunamis that struck southern Thailand, with
the likely death toll climbing to 16 after eight more
"Filipino-sounding" names were submitted by Thai
authorities, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA)
said yesterday.

The Manila Times: Epidemics threaten to raise
death toll

Confirmed deaths and warnings that disease could
multiply the horror of Asia's tsunami catastrophe
took estimates of the final toll to more than 100,000
as the world's biggest ever relief operation

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SENDS NATIONAL-LEVEL MEDICAL TEAM TO INDONESIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An 11-member medical team organized by the
Cabinet-level Department of Health headed for Medan, Indonesia
Thursday to offer post-disaster medical aid to areas devastated by
killer tsunamis.</P>
      <P>Minister of Health Chen Chien-jen came to the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport to support those preparing to face the grim
realities of dealing with the aftermath of the death of thousands.
Chen thanked the volunteers for their selflessness.</P>
      <P>It was the first national-level medical aid team from Taiwan to
lend a hand since a magnitude-9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunamis
tore through in a dozen countries around the Indian Ocean Sunday.</P>
      <P>Under the health department's coordination, Chen said, more than
100 other medical professionals are also waiting to join aid missions
in tsunami-hit countries, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand
and India. Out of humanitarian concerns, Chen said the Cabinet has
directed the health department to organize medical aid teams to help
with post-disaster relief work.</P>
      <P>The team, headed by Tsai Ming-tse, director of National Cheng
Kung University Hospital's emergency room, will travel to Aceh, the
northern Indonesian province closest to the quake's epicenter.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, Indonesia has suffered
the largest number of victims, with 45,268 known dead, although the
toll could rise to 80,000 in Aceh alone.</P>
      <P>The team carried with it medical supplies and equipment as well
as power generators, tents and daily necessities to ensure
self-sufficiency.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure, Tsai said the team will first work at the
provisional relief center set up by the Indonesian government in
Medan, which lies close to Aceh province.</P>
      <P>"Our initial focus will be on surveying the damage wrought by the
killer quake and tsunamis on public health systems in the region and
drafting follow-up medical aid plans," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>As rebels have been active in Aceh province, Tsai said his team
will coordinate with Indonesian authorities to ensure the safety of
the team.</P>
      <P>The team should complete its survey in five to seven days, Tsai
added.</P>
      <P>Two Taiwan relief teams already left for Indonesia and Thailand
Tuesday, bringing with them more than three tons of medical and
relief supplies.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, two medical groups, organized by the Buddhist
Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Foundation and the Taiwan Roots Medical
Peace Corps headed for Sri Lanka to lend medical assistance.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO WORD YET ON PREMIER NOMINATION, CONTRARY TO REPORT: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office dismissed a
newspaper report Thursday that had claimed that Premier Yu Shyi-kun
would step down and be replaced by Lin Hsin-i, the convener of an
economic advisory team to the president.</P>
      <P>The Department of Public Affairs of the Presidential Office sent
text messages to all news media saying that President Chen Shui-bian
has yet to finalize his lineup for the new Cabinet. The action was in
response to a front-page report in the China Times that detailed the
reshuffle.</P>
      <P>The messages also asked that the media not report on wild
speculation to avoid misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>A ranking official of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) , speaking on condition of anonymity, also said that the
candidate for premier will only become clearer after an overall
consideration of several key posts.</P>
      <P>He said that President Chen is focusing now on creating good
relations between the ruling and opposition parties, and that this is
currently more important than considerations on the makeup of the new
Cabinet.</P>
      <P>If the premiership is decided now, how can the DPP talk about
cooperation with the People First Party (PFP), an ally of the largest
opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), adding that the posts of DPP
chairman, premier, and the speaker and the vice speaker of the
Legislative Yuan will have to be taken into overall consideration.</P>
      <P>There is still some time before the new Cabinet takes office on
Feb. 1, he said. The more immediate task is to select a new chairman
of the DPP, he added.</P>
      <P>As Friday is the last day for registration for party chairman
hopefuls, the president is bound to nominate a candidate, widely
believed to be Premier Yu, he said. The legislature will then discuss
major issues, such as the general budgets of the central government
for next year. Only after taking care of all these things will the
issue of who should head the Cabinet be addressed in earnest, he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT caucus whip in the legislature said that if
the president nominates Lin as the new premier, the KMT will
strenuously oppose the move.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-fu claimed that although in the past Lin served as a
Minister of Economic Affairs, a chairman for the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, and a vice premier, it was while on his
watch as economics minister that Taiwan's economy began declining, in
particular because of the suspension of the ongoing construction of
the Fourth Nuclear Power Plant in 2000, which caused a great deal of
drag on the country's economy.</P>
      <P>Responding to Huang, Ker Chien-ming, acting DPP chairman, said
the ruling and opposition parties should put a halt to their
bickering, adding that if the rivalry continues, regardless of who
ends up being the next premier, no one will be able to work with him
because of the fragmented nature of the political landscape.</P>
      <P>Both the KMT and the PFP also criticized the reported nomination
of Lin as an indication of the dearth of talented people in the DPP
camp.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said that the premier Taiwan needs
now must be capable of upgrading Taiwan's economy, bettering
cross-strait relations and promoting harmony between the ruling and
the opposition parties. It is "obvious that neither the core members
nor the succession team of the DPP have this caliber of individual, "
Chang said.</P>
      <P>The KMT had foreseen this scenario and had recommended before the
Dec. 11 legislative elections that Chiang Ping-kun, legislative vice
speaker and a seasoned economic expert, head the Cabinet. Every poll
has shown that Chiang meets all the conditions to be the next
premier, Chang claimed.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, PFP caucus whip, questioned the contributions of
Lin during his stint as economics minister, asking if he had come up
with any policies to address the hollowing out of Taiwan's industry
and the shortage of talented people.</P>
      <P>Liu said that if Lin really becomes the next premier, it will
only show that the DPP had no one left to turn to.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ping-kun, however, said that he was confident of Lin's
financial background and his performance in various government posts,
saying that he would be a "good premier."</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan had suggested to President Chen that
Chiang head the Cabinet, but Chiang said that if the position is not
his, he will not " feel sorry."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HOPES FOR EARLY RESTORATION OF TSUNAMI-HIT NATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
it is his hope that tsunami-hit nations will get back on their feet
as soon as possible with help from the international community.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that a lot of civic groups from Taiwan have joined
the rescue and relief effort, Chen said the disaster highlights both
the fragility of human lives and the borderlessness of human love.</P>
      <P>The president voiced his view on the matter in the latest issue
of his online newsletter.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that Taiwanese rescue workers had been back in
Taiwan less than a month after going to Turkey to help victims of an
earthquake there when the deadly earthquake hit Taiwan on Sept. 21,
1999 turning Taiwan from a rescuer to a victim.</P>
      <P>A total of 38 rescue teams from 21 countries arrived in Taiwan to
offer their help immediately after the catastrophe, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said this experience shows that the world is like a big
family and there is no way to tell when a disaster is going to occur.</P>
      <P>While the boundary between countries is getting vaguer and vaguer
today, civic organizations are more flexible and efficient than the
government sector in terms of offering foreign aid and conducting
international economic and cultural exchanges, Chen said.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Taiwan has for a long time helped its
diplomatic allies in Africa turn deserts into paddy fields through
various international cooperation projects.</P>
      <P>He stressed there may be different realistic considerations as
far as international politics is concerned, but the international
community speaks a common language -- the pursuit of human well-being
and peace.</P>
      <P>As a member of the global village, Taiwan must positively
contribute to the international community, he added.</P>
      <P>Also on Thursday, a number of private and public organizations in
Taiwan such as the Kaohsiung County Government, International
Investment Trust Co. and the Splendor Hotel launched fund-raising
drives to encourage their staff to donate one-day's pay to help the
tsunami victims.</P>
      <P>More than 80,000 people have been reported killed in tsunamis
triggered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake off Indonesia's Sumatra
island on Sunday. In addition to Asian countries including Indonesia,
Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, the Maldives and
Bangladesh, the tsunamis also hit African nations such as Somalia and
Kenya.</P>

      <P>India should be able to complete
post-disaster reconstruction soon, Vijay Gokhale, director general of
the India-Taipei Association, said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Gokhale said that Tamil Nadu, a state in coastal southeastern
India, and the outlying Andaman Islands, were badly hit by tsunami
triggered by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake under the Indian Ocean
Sunday, resulting in heavy casualties, but otherwise, the impact of
the catastrophe on India's overall economy is not great.</P>
      <P>He expressed appreciation for the concern and assistance offered
by the Taiwan government and civic groups, but stressed that except
for assistance from the United Nations and other international relief
organizations, India has no need for Taiwan's help.</P>
      <P>India has embarked on disaster-relief and reconstruction work and
should be able to deal with the aftermath with its own resources and
manpower, he said.</P>
      <P>Apart from Tamil Nadu and the Andaman Islands, scenic spots and
other infrastructure in the country's other states remain intact, he
said, urging Taiwan tourists and businessmen to have no fear of
visiting.</P>
      <P>All international and domestic airports, stations, and other
public facilities in India are unaffected by the recent disaster and
there are also no worries about health hazards, he assured Taiwan
people.</P>
      <P>He said the countries worst-hit by the lethal tidal waves are
Indonesia, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The Indian government has
donated US$15 million to Sri Lanka and US$5 million to the Maldives
for relief and post-disaster reconstruction.</P>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen met with representatives
in Taiwan of tsunami-hit nations, including India, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Thailand, Wednesday to find out what Taiwan can do to
assist their countries.</P>
      <P>Chen learned that Indonesia and Thailand are in urgent need of
aid, especially coroners and medical supplies, while Malaysia and
India do not require any foreign assistance for the time being.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING INTENDS TO CHANGE TAIWAN STRAIT STATUS QUO WITH LAW: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday that
mainland China's so-called anti-secession legislation is aimed at
altering the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo and further thwarting the
Republic of China's survival in the international community.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while addressing a ceremony to mark the
promotion of 41 new generals in his capacity as commander-in-chief of
the ROC armed forces.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Chen said, the mainland has declined to renounce
the option of using force against Taiwan and has never ceased its
military maneuvers targeting Taiwan. Besides continuing to enhance
its military spending and overall combat capabilities, Chen said, the
mainland is now even working on a so-called anti-secession law aimed
at changing the cross-strait status quo and blocking Taiwan's
presence in the world arena.</P>
      <P>Noting that mainland submarines can now reach waters within the
"second island chain" of the Pacific Ocean covering the Kuriles,
Hokkaido, the Marianas and Palau, Chen said Taiwan's security faces a
grave threat and Asia-Pacific regional security is also at stake.</P>
      <P>In the face of this new challenge, Chen said the ROC armed forces
must speed up combat training and arsenal renovation to effectively
deter any possible mainland invasion and ensure permanent peace in
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen also took advantage of the occasion to appeal for public
support for the government's NT$610.8 billion arms procurement
project.</P>
      <P>"Kuwait was once taken over by Iraqi forces in a very short
period of time. We should learn from that lesson. Without advanced
defensive weapons, we can't deter aggression, nor can we safeguard
peace," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The special budget bill for the massive arms procurement project
is still pending legislative approval. Under the project, Taiwan
intends to buy eight diesel-electric submarines, a squadron of 12
P-3C Orion submarine-hunting aircraft and six PAC-III Patriot
anti-missile batteries from the United States.</P>
      <P>A total of 41 military officers will be promoted to the rank of
general from Jan. 1. Among them, 11 will be promoted to either
lieutenant-general or vice admiral and 30 will be promoted to either
major general or rear admiral.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ministry of National Defense officials said 36
general-rank officers will retire or transfer to civilian positions
in January. In addition, the officials said, 88 generals will change
position in line with the ongoing military streamlining project.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's gross domestic product (GDP)
growth is expected to slow to 4.05 percent in 2005 owing to high raw
material and oil prices, international interest rate hikes and
appreciation of major currencies, according to an annual economic
outlook report released Thursday by the Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Citing a forecast by the International Monetary Fund, Academia
Sinica economist Wu Chung-shu said the world GDP growth will rise to
5 percent in 2004 from the 3.9 percent of 2003.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's GDP growth will expand to 5.99 percent in
2004 from the 3.34 percent of 2003, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Although the momentum of private investment will remain strong in
Taiwan in 2005, international demand for exports from Taiwan is
likely to dwindle because of high international raw material and oil
prices, international interest rate hikes and appreciation of major
currencies due to a weak U.S. dollar, Wu said.</P>
      <P>These negative factors are thus likely to slow GDP growth to 4.05
percent in 2005, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the growth of private consumption will fall to
2.51 percent in 2005 from the 2.96 percent of 2004, while the growth
of private investment will decline to 7.86 percent in 2005 from a
high of 25.82 percent in 2004.</P>
      <P>International oil prices are expected to stabilize and stand at
US$37.25 per barrel in 2005, which will help Taiwan's consumer price
index growth to drop slightly to 1.53 percent from the 1.58 percent
of 2004, Wu said.</P>
      <P>In terms of foreign trade, the growth in the export of Taiwan
products and services will slide to 8.8 percent in 2005 from the
17.49 percent of 2004, while the growth in imports will shrink to
8.36 percent from the 19.65 percent of 2004, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, the tension across the Taiwan Strait and
mainland China's measures to cool its overheating economy are also
likely to affect Taiwan's economic performance in 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND TEAM ARRIVES ON KINMEN TO INVESTIGATE DEPOT EXPLOSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A team of experts headed by Vice Chief of
the General Staff Gen. Feng Shih-kuang arrived on the frontline
island of Kinmen Thursday to inspect the cause of an explosion at two
ammunition depots in an idle military barracks a day earlier.</P>
      <P>The Neiyang military barracks has 11 ammunition depots, two of
which exploded in the incident, military sources said.
Fortunately, nobody was injured or killed in the blast.</P>
      <P>The two depots had contained a total of 1,881 rounds of 81 mm
mortars, 175 rounds of 60 mm mortars and an unspecified amount of
machine gun bullets.</P>
      <P>Initial investigations show that the blast might have been caused
by the burning of weeds by civilians in the vicinity of the barracks,
military sources said.</P>
      <P>The first blast occurred at 4: 10 p.m. and sporadic explosions
were still being heard at 9: 15 p.m. The military cordoned off the
region and imposed traffic controls in the surrounding area.</P>
      <P>According to the military's standard operation procedures, nobody
can enter an explosion site within 24 hours of the last blast.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at a Legislative Yuan Defense Committee
meeting, Vice Defense Minister Hou Shou-yeh confessed to human
negligence as being the cause of the incident.</P>
      <P>Hou said the ministry will carefully investigate the cause of the
explosion and adopt necessary measures to improve ammunition depot
management.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WATER, ELECTRICITY RATE HIKES REST WITH NEW CABINET: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
said Thursday that electricity and water rates face pressure to be
increased, but added that it will be up to the new Cabinet to decide
if and when such hikes are made.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks after she reported to the caucus whip of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party about government policy on
adjusting electricity and water rates.</P>
      <P>She had said a day earlier that electricity and water rates will
be raised, drawing immediate criticism from the opposition, but noted
that Premier Yu Shyi-kun has said he will not address the issue
during his term "out of consideration" for the burden of the people
and the manufacturers, as well as to avoid stimulating price hikes of
other consumer goods."</P>
      <P>Yu is scheduled to lead his Cabinet in an en masse resignation
Feb. 1, according to protocol, when the new Legislative Yuan is
scheduled to be sworn in.</P>
      <P>She said that sufficient funds are needed to maintain water and
electricity supplies, that the rate hikes will be sent to the
Legislative Yuan for review and that the Executive Yuan will respect
the result of the review.</P>
      <P>The various political parties responded to the rate hike
proposals along party lines.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, said that the adjustment of water and electricity
rates needs to be further considered and that a final decision has
yet to be made.</P>
      <P>But he also said that the rates must reasonably reflect costs,
otherwise the national coffers will have to make up for any
shortfalls and the taxpayers will eventually have to cover such
losses.</P>
      <P>However, the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said that it will
pool the strength of the people to oppose to the rate hike proposal.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-fu, KMT caucus whip in the legislature, claimed that
the number of poor people is increasing along with the economic
slump, and that the KMT could therefore not accept a hike.</P>
      <P>KMT legislator Chen Chieh also said that state-run businesses
such as Taiwan Power Company and Chinese Petroleum Corp. have
reported handsome profits, yet the government clamors for rate hikes,
which he claimed has "caused panic" among the general public.</P>
      <P>Liu Wen-hsiung, caucus whip of the People First Party, an ally of
the KMT, said that when the legislature is reviewing the general
budget of the central government, it will demand all related agencies
not to hike the rates before a rigorous assessment has been made.</P>
      <P>Liu said that his party will ask the government to immediately
freeze all planned hikes in water, electricity, air and other
transportation fares, as well as national health insurance premiums,
or it will not rule out the possibility of mobilizing a rally to
protest the hikes.</P>
      <P>According to the Consumers' Foundation, the government's plan to
raise water, electricity and transportation rates will impose an
average additional spending of between NT$2,000 and NT$3,000 per
month per person.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials said that the Civil Aeronautics
Administration has convened several meetings with air carriers to
discuss air fare hikes, but the information concerning the cost of
the air carriers has never been published and that such an air fare
hike plan will seriously undermine the rights of consumers.</P>
      <P>Ho said in a year-end press conference Wednesday that electricity
rates will be raised by no more than NT$0.5 per unit, or one
kilowatt/hour.</P>
      <P>She said that Taiwan's electricity costs NT$2.07 per unit on
average, which is far less than the NT$4.8 per unit in Japan, NT$3.74
per unit in Hong Kong, NT$3.56 per unit in the Philippines, and
NT$2.13 per unit in South Korea.</P>
      <P>She also argued that the increase in international oil prices has
deriven up the cost of producing electricity and that the Taiwan
Power Company is expected to lose NT$9 billion (US$281.95 million)
next year if it does not adjust rates.</P>
      <P>For the same reason, the price of water will also be raised, Ho
said, arguing that Taiwan's water rates, now NT$10.77 per ton, are
unreasonably cheap compared to NT$62.7 per ton in Germany, NT$56.7
per ton in Denmark, NT$17.5 per ton in the United States, and NT$14.4
per ton in Canada.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Thursday that it welcomes any members of the public who wish to attend
a flag-raising ceremony in downtown Taipei Saturday to usher in the
New Year.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said Thursday that the

      <P>The ceremony will also feature a "young and dynamic" atmosphere,

Chang said.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan will then lead the crowd to sing the
Republic of China national anthem, joined by a youth chorus, he
continued.</P>
      <P>A prayer activity will also be arranged for the representatives
from all ethnic groups -- Hoklo, Hakka, aborigines and those who
consider themselves to be of mainland Chinese descent -- to express
their good wishes for the New Year, Chang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVERSEAS TAIWANESE GROUP URGES BEIJING TO DROP ANTI-SECESSION LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Lin and Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An overseas Taiwanese organization urged
mainland China Wednesday to stop its efforts to enact an
"anti-secession law" targeting Taiwan, branding it an attempt to
unilaterally alter the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo.</P>
      <P>The call was made in a joint statement released by several New
York State branches of the Global Alliance for Democracy and Peace
(GADP).</P>
      <P>The law will be highly provocative because it will authorize a
unilateral change in the status quo across the Taiwan Strait and
intensify cross-strait tensions, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that President Chen Shui-bian has repeatedly
offered olive branches to the mainland to try to improve cross-strait
relations after his re-election in March this year, but Beijing has
ignored the goodwill and has continued to attack Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The GADP noted that the Republic of China and the People's
Republic of China have been two independent entities since 1949 and
that this remains the status quo across the strait today.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and the mainland should seek peaceful co-existence and
avoid using force to destroy the status quo, it said.</P>
      <P>By enacting the law, Beijing is trying to define the current
status between Taiwan and the mainland as "unified " and to claim
jurisdiction over Taiwan, according to the GADP.</P>
      <P>The law will accept unification as the only outcome of
cross-strait negotiations, with all other scenarios subject to
punishment, it said.</P>
      <P>Also, it added, Beijing's bid to introduce the law exhibits its
intention to invade Taiwan because the law will authorize the launch
of military action against the country.</P>
      <P>The National People's Congress of China is expected to vote on a
draft of the law during its full session scheduled for March.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST COMMERCIAL WIND POWER PLANT BEGINS OPERATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun presided Thursday over
the opening of a commercial wind power plant in Shihmen village,
Taipei County, calling its operations a display of the government's
resolve to make Taiwan nuclear power-free.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the start of the plant's operations means a stride
closer by the government toward its goal of building Taiwan into a
nuclear-free country, Yu said that the plant will also stand tall as
a new landmark in the scenic northeast coastal area.</P>
      <P>The Shihmen wind power plant, the first of its kind in Taiwan for
purely commercial purposes, has six power-generating units with a
combined capacity of nearly 100 million kilowatt-hours per year that
will help reduce the emission of more than 8,600 tons of carbon
dioxide each year and replace some 3,820 tons of fuel coal.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, the government earmarks around NT$3
billion (US$93.75 million) each year for the research and development
of alternative energies in line with a global drive to reduce the
emission of carbon dioxide as obliged by the Kyoto Protocol that will
take effect next year in most of the world's developed countries.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh and Taiwan Power Company
(Taipower) Chairman Lin Ching-chi were also present at the opening.</P>
      <P>Echoing Yu's remarks, Lin said that the state-run Taipower has
been devoted to the development of alternative energy sources and he
pointed out that the company is determined to increase the portion of
its power generated by recyclable energy sources from the current
level of 5.4 percent to 10 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>Taipower has been advocating wind force power and is planning to
establish 400 sets of equipment capable of generating 600,000
kilowatts per year, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The Shihmen wind power plant is the first completed by Taipower
out of its planned first-stage installation of 60 sets of
power-generating facilities by the end of 2006.</P>
      <P>Construction of the plant kicked off in December 2003 at a cost
of about NT$200 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-SECESSION LAW `CRUCIAL VARIABLE' IN TRIANGULAR TIES: ROC ENVOY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, Dec. 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If mainland China insists on enacting a
so-called anti-secession law targeting Taiwan, it would be a "crucial
variable" in the delicate triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing
relations, the top ROC envoy in the United States said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a year-end gathering with Chinese-language reporters
stationed in the U.S. capital, David Ta-wei Lee said both Taiwan and
the United States think the timing is not right for mainland China to
legislate such a law at the moment.</P>
      <P>Noting that the anti-secession legislation marks a unilateral
move to alter the Taiwan Strait status quo, Lee said Beijing should
stop before it commits a serious blunder.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the U.S. authorities informed the Republic of
China representative office right after they found out about
Beijing's plan.</P>
      <P>Both sides have since kept close contact and have fully discussed
the issue, Lee said, adding that both Taiwan and the United States
see no need for Beijing to enact such a bill.</P>
      <P>"Now is also not the right time for Beijing to work on such a
piece of legislation," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Beijing announced its plan to legislate an anti-secession law
Dec. 17 and Lee said that if Beijing goes ahead with its plan, that
day will mark a "turning point" in the development of the delicate
triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations. He did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that a resumption of cross-strait dialogue is the
most important factor in the triangular ties, Lee said the chances
for cross-strait dialogue would be even slimmer if Beijing were to
push ahead with its plan.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan-U.S. relations, Lee dismissed as "incorrect"
speculation that some recent statements by U.S. Secretary
of State Colin Powell and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage
might signal a backtracking of U.S. commitment to Taiwan or a change
in U.S. policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee said both Powell and Armitage have been and are still
Taiwan's good friends. Some controversial words uttered during media
interviews were just "slips of the tongue," Lee said, adding that the
U.S. authorities have consistently assured him that their policy
toward Taiwan remains unchanged and that their security commitment
remains valid.</P>
      <P>Asked who will represent Taiwan at President George W.
Bush's upcoming inauguration ceremony for a second term, Lee said he
was not in a position to make an announcement.</P>
      <P>"It should be announced by our government in Taipei, " Lee said,
adding that the representative will certainly be a high-level
politician.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng headed the Taiwan
delegation to Bush's 2000 inauguration ceremony but Lee would not
reveal whether Wang will be the chief delegate this time around,
although he stressed that the representative's level will definitely
not fall below that of Wang.</P>
      <P>As to Vice President Annette Lu's application to make a
weeklong transit stay in the United States on her way to visit the
ROC's diplomatic allies in Central and South America, Lee said the
representative office is still negotiating the visa issue with
the U.S. authorities and that no conclusion had been reached.</P>

stood at 40.04 percent as of Thursday, according to the results of a
public opinion poll released that day.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll of 1,068 randomly chosen residents around
Taiwan was conducted by Shih Hsin University from Dec. 22-27, with a
margin of error of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, 40.04 percent of the respondents said

who gave a thumbs-down to his performance.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu's approval rating was 36.6 percent,
compared to a disapproval rating of 49.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Nearly 53 percent of those interviewed said they were content
with Premier Yu Shyi-kun's performance, while 37.5 percent said

    <HEADLINE>CENTRAL BANK RAISES KEY INTEREST RATES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of China (CBC) raised key
interest rates Thursday by an eighth of a percentage point (0.125
percentage point) in an effort to combat increased inflationary
pressure in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>The CBC made the interest rate hike announcement following a
meeting of its board of directors, putting a damper on rampant
speculation that the central bank might not do so.</P>
      <P>The increase will lift the CBC's re-discount rate to 1.75
percent. One-year short term rate and rate on accommodation with
collateral will stand at 4 percent and 2.125 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference in the wake of the meeting, CBC
Governor Perng Fai-nan stressed that the move was made in order to
maintain domestic product prices as inflationary pressure is mounting
in the face of imminent raises in public utilities early next year,
such as bus and air fares, as well as water and electricity rates.</P>
      <P>Citing a forecast by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Perng said that the domestic
economy and consumer product prices will expand by 4.56 percent and
by about 2 percent, respectively, in 2005.</P>
      <P>In an effort to ease speculation over soaring product prices, the
central bank decided to make the move to help stem looming inflation,
he said, adding that "the country's interest rates should be adjusted
upward to normal levels."</P>
      <P>The impact of the hike on domestic companies should be limited,
as Taiwan's interest rates are still relatively low, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>It is the second time the CBC has raised its key interest rates
this year. It first lifted its rates by a quarter percentage point in
late December.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council
for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) -- the country's top
economic policy planner -- said at a year-end news conference that
his council will do its best to keep the growth rate of the consumer
price index below 2 percent for the whole of next year.</P>
      <P>As long as international oil prices can be controlled at a price
below US$35 per barrel next year, it will be easier to bring down
product prices in the domestic market and also possible for the CEPD
to meet its target, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT, PFP LEADERS  LOSE CASE TO ANNUL PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan and his running mate in the March 20 presidential race, People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong suffered another setback
Thursday after a court threw out a case they brought to invalidate
the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>A panel of three judges from the Taiwan High Court said in the
judgment that the grounds on which the two plaintiffs claimed the
presidential election should be invalidated could not stand up in
court.</P>
      <P>In the reasoning behind its judgment, the judges said that
although the plaintiffs claimed there were more than 900,000 ballots
issued to voters inappropriately by election workers, a review of the
electoral rolls found that only 3,700 ballots were given out in
questionable situations.</P>
      <P>Even all these ballots were considered invalid it would not
reverse the results of the outcome of the election in which President
Chen Shui-bian won by a margin of 29,518 votes, the judgment said.</P>
      <P>As to the plaintiffs' claims that the first national referendum,
held concurrently with the presidential election, gave Chen an unfair
advantage, the court said that whether the referendum and
presidential election could be held simultaneously should be
determined by the Council of Grand Justices through an interpretation
of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The court said it would be difficult anyway to determine that
Chen's campaign was unfairly boosted by the referendum.</P>
      <P>Citing opinion polls conducted before the elections that showed
Lien and Soong were ahead of Chen and Chen's running mate Annette
Lu, the court said these surveys further contradicted the plaintiffs'
claims.</P>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) , which organized the
election and referendum and thereby became the defendant in the case,
was ordered to hold the referendum and the presidential election at
the same time, and there is no evidence that it failed to do its
job fairly, according to the judgment.</P>
      <P>The court also did not agree with the plaintiffs argument that by
conducting the referendum and election simultaneously, the secrecy of
the vote, which is enshrined in law, was compromised, as most
supporters of Lien and Soong did not even vote in the referendum --
upon Lien's instructions.</P>
      <P>In regard to the mysterious shooting of Chen on the eve of
election day, the court said there is no evidence to substantiate the
plaintiffs' claim that the government kept an unreasonably large

    <HEADLINE>KMT, PFP LEADERS  LOSE CASE TO ANNUL PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION(UPDATE WITH INFORMATION THAT KMT, PFP WILL APPEAL)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 30 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan and his running mate in the March 20 presidential race, People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong suffered another setback
Thursday after a court threw out a case they brought to invalidate
the March 20 presidential election.</P>
      <P>A panel of three judges from the Taiwan High Court said in the
judgment that the grounds on which the two plaintiffs claimed the
presidential election should be invalidated could not stand up in
court.</P>
      <P>In the reasoning behind its judgment, the judges said that
although the plaintiffs claimed there were more than 900,000 ballots
issued to voters inappropriately by election workers, a review of the
electoral rolls found that only 3,700 ballots were given out in
questionable situations.</P>
      <P>Even all these ballots were considered invalid it would not
reverse the results of the outcome of the election in which President
Chen Shui-bian won by a margin of 29,518 votes, the judgment said.</P>
      <P>As to the plaintiffs' claims that the first national referendum,
held concurrently with the presidential election, gave Chen an unfair
advantage, the court said that whether the referendum and
presidential election could be held simultaneously should be
determined by the Council of Grand Justices through an interpretation
of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The court said it would be difficult anyway to determine that
Chen's campaign was unfairly boosted by the referendum.</P>
      <P>Citing opinion polls conducted before the elections that showed
Lien and Soong were ahead of Chen and Chen's running mate Annette
Lu, the court said these surveys further contradicted the plaintiffs'
claims.</P>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) , which organized the
election and referendum and thereby became the defendant in the case,
was ordered to hold the referendum and the presidential election at
the same time, and there is no evidence that it failed to do its
job fairly, according to the judgment.</P>
      <P>The court also did not agree with the plaintiffs argument that by
conducting the referendum and election simultaneously, the secrecy of
the vote, which is enshrined in law, was compromised, as most
supporters of Lien and Soong did not even vote in the referendum --
upon Lien's instructions.</P>
      <P>In regard to the mysterious shooting of Chen on the eve of
election day, the court said there is no evidence to substantiate the
plaintiffs' claim that the government kept an unreasonably large
number of police and military personnel on duty as a result of the
shooting, thereby stripping them of their right to vote.</P>
      <P>The court acknowledged the plaintiffs' claims that 35 polling
stations around the island mistakenly issued ballots in the
presidential elections based on the rolls meant for the referendum,
but pointed out that the rolls were found to be the same as the
electoral rolls and therefore would not have affected the results of
the election anyway.</P>
      <P>Lee Tsung-teh, the leading attorney for Lien and Soong, decried
the judgment as "not being grounded on law" but refused to say
whether his client will appeal against it.</P>
      <P>Chang Shih-hsing, the attorney for the CEC, said he was pleased
with the judgment, which vindicates the country's 180,000 election
workers.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-mai, a spokesman for the Executive Yuan, urged the KMT

the results of the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen said the two opposition parties should devote their energy
to promoting the wellbeing of the public rather than keeping
struggling against the people's choice.</P>
      <P>However, KMT secretary-general Lin Fong-cheng and
PFP secretary Ching Chin-sheng told a news conference Thursday
evening that Lien and Soong will appeal against the judgment.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Gung-bing, a spokesman for the PFP, condemned the judgment
as a travesty of justice and of having "disappointed the public."</P>
      <P>PFP official Chang Hsieh-yao said the court had breached the

      <P>The mercury in the Taiwan area has dropped
sharply since Friday morning as a cold front from northern China
approaches, with temperatures expecting to plummet to 5 degrees
Celsius at the coldest between Friday night and Sunday morning, the

      <P>Friday through Sunday is expected to have the coldest weather yet

    <HEADLINE>TSU WILL NOT JOIN A DPP-PFP ALLIANCE: TSU WHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An influential Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) lawmaker said Friday that if the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (PFP) forms an alliance with the People First Party (PFP), his
party will not join.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming, deputy convener of the TSU legislative caucus,
said that as the DPP's ally, the TSU can understand why the DPP has
to cooperate with the PFP on major policy issues.</P>
      <P>Over the past four years, the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of
the Kuomintang (KMT) and the PFP, which controls a slim majority in
the current Legislative Yuan, has blocked the DPP administration's
reform agenda nearly at every turn.</P>
      <P>Following the Dec. 11 legislative elections, relations between
the two "pan-blue alliance" parties soured over a combination of
factors. Against this backdrop, there has been speculation that the
DPP may turn to the PFP for cooperation in the new legislature.
Should that be the case, the DPP administration will have a working
majority in the 225-seat legislature, with the DPP holding 89 seats
and the PFP controlling 34 seats.</P>
      <P>Noting that party realignments are not uncommon in democratic
countries, Chen said the TSU, which will have 12 seats in the new
legislature to be inaugurated Feb. 1, can understand the rationale of
the proposed DPP-PFP cooperation on some policy issues.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, the TSU will not join such a new alliance.
The TSU will insist on playing the role of an opposition party, Chen
added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT CHARTER FLIGHTS CAN BE BASED ON 2003 MODEL: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Cross-strait charter flights during the
Chinese New Year holiday for Taiwan businessmen working in mainland
China could be modeled after similar services that were put into
place in 2003, an official in charge of mainland China policy said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-shun, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) , made the remarks after the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
that it would work to see if it could secure the flights. Chinese
Lunar New Year's Day falls on Feb. 9, 2005.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the MAC has repeatedly tried to get the mainland
side to come to the table and talk about the charter flights but to
no avail.</P>
      <P>With only a little more than a month before Chinese New Year Day,
he suggested using the 2003 model in which the government coordinated
with air carriers to organize the flights.</P>
      <P>With Beijing's consent, Taiwan carriers operated one-way, special
charter flights between Shanghai and Taipei/Kaohsiung via Hong
Kong/Macau during the 2003 Chinese New Year holiday. The services
were not offered the following year because Beijing insisted that
mainland carriers also be allowed to provide the same flight services
but refused to negotiate the necessary technical details with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu said that if Taiwan businessmen believe that more cities
should be included in the services, the MAC is willing to consult
with air carriers to expand the services to Guangzhou and Beijing.</P>
      <P>If mainland air carriers want to apply to Taiwan for charter
flights, then the operations will be more complex in that both sides
would need to consult each other to come to an agreement.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislative caucus said in a news conference earlier
Friday that the government has not actively promoted the charter
flights and that the KMT will step in and take control in paving the
way for the services to be opened.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Tseng Yung-chuan noted that many Taiwan
businessmen in the mainland have expressed their interest in the
flights to the KMT caucus.</P>
      <P>"Since the government is incapable of accomplishing this task,
the KMT legislative caucus will take over, " Tseng said, adding that
the KMT caucus and six Taiwan air carriers will go to the mainland
next week to communicate with air carriers there.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator John Chang said that if the cross-strait charter
flights can be implemented during the Chinese New Year holiday, it
will not only ease cross-strait tensions but will also establish a
model for direct cross-strait flights.</P>
      <P>He said he hoped that Taiwan businessmen, their dependents,
students and tourists who hold Republic of China passports and valid
travel documents can use the service.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BILLS TO PROBE KMT ASSETS PUT ON FAST TRACK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan put three bills aimed
at investigating the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) alleged ill-gotten
assets on the fast track Friday.</P>
      <P>Legislators agreed that the bills, proposed by the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) and
People First Party (PFP), will skip a committee review procedure and
enter the second reading directly.</P>
      <P>Inter-party consultations will be held to seek to integrate the
three versions before the second reading, according to the
legislature's decision.</P>
      <P>However, it remains highly uncertain as to whether any of the
bills will be passed by the end of the current legislature, which
ends Jan. 21, with the KMT insisting on opposing the enactment of any
law that it believes is designed to "liquidate" the party.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-fu, whip of the KMT legislative caucus, said the fact
that the KMT did not obstruct Friday's proceeding does not mean it
supports the law.</P>
      <P>Huang dismissed the DPP-proposed and TSU-proposed bills as
violating the principles of democracy and the rule of law for being
retroactive and based on a "presumption of guilt."</P>
      <P>Huang said his party will have the bills killed by dragging out
the inter-party consultations.</P>
      <P>According to law, any bills that are not passed at the end of a
legislative term will be scrapped. The final session of the current
legislature is set to run through Jan. 21.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, head of the KMT's Policy Committee, said the
KMT believes that assets of political parties should be regulated by
a political parties law.</P>
      <P>Tseng said his party supports the PFP-proposed bill and hopes the
bill could be considered together with the political parties bill put
forth by the KMT.</P>
      <P>In view of the KMT's plan to delay the party assets law, TSU
legislative caucus chief Chen Chien-ming demanded that inter-party
consultations on the three bills be started next Monday to ensure
that some form of legislation is passed within the current
legislative session.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsueh-chang, deputy convener of the PFP legislative caucus,
said whether or not a law will be passed this session depends on the
KMT's attitude on reforms.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FREE AIDS TESTS DURING PREGNANCY TO KICK OFF NATIONWIDE JAN. 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beginning Jan. 1, 2005, the government will
provide AIDS tests at no cost to pregnant women nationwide in an
effort to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission, the Department of
Health (DOH) reported Friday.</P>
      <P>All pregnant women living in the Republic of China, regardless of
whether they are covered by the national health insurance program,
are welcome to go to a hospital for a free AIDS test, officials from
the DOH's Center for Disease Control (CDC) said.</P>
      <P>According to CDC tallies, there have been 11 "AIDS babies" in
Taiwan as of Nov. 30. All mothers of these HIV-positive infants had
not received any AIDS tests.</P>
      <P>Of these babies, CDC officials said, one case was discovered only
after the mother and child were required to receive an AIDS test at
the time when the child's father was dying of AIDS. The man did not
tell his wife about his illness so the mother was totally in the dark
and had no idea that she and her baby were HIV-positive, too.</P>
      <P>CDC Director-General Kuo Hsu-sung noted that roughly 220,000 new
babies are born in Taiwan annually. If all pregnant women receive the
free AIDS test during their pregnancy, about 30 women should be
identified as being HIV-positive.</P>
      <P>If the HIV-positive women are in turn treated with antiretroviral
drugs during their pregnancy, particularly during the most critical
first three months of pregnancy, the chances of their babies
contracting the virus from their mothers will be significantly
lowered, Kuo added.</P>
      <P>In addition, Kuo said, the costs for examining all of the
country's pregnant women will be relatively much cheaper than
treating AIDS patients. It will cost about NT$40 million a year for
the nationwide free AIDS tests, while each AIDS patient needs about
NT$14 million throughout his or her life.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG SHOULD DEVELOP OWN FEATURES: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday that the
potential of Kaohsiung is immense and that it should develop its own
distinctive features rather than trying to copy those of Taipei.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks as he inspected a military barracks,
part of which will be converted to a park in the southern port
city.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are legislators who have suggested that some
central government agencies be moved to Kaohsiung, or even that the
Presidential Office be relocated there to help its development, the
premier said that government agencies such as the Council of Labor
Affairs and the Council of Agriculture could indeed be relocated to
Kaohsiung, but there are still a dozen other government agencies in
Taipei and Kaohsiung would still not be comparable to Taipei in that
respect.</P>
      <P>After the proposed park and other major construction projects are
completed, Kaohsiung will definitely be "ahead of Taipei, " he
claimed.</P>
      <P>"Kaohsiung has immense potential and can develop its own
distinctive features, " Yu said, adding that it will not have to
rely on the relocation of the Presidential Office, a task he said
could take more than a decade if it were ever to be implemented.</P>
      <P>Yu was accompanied to the Weiwu barracks by Minister of the
Interior Su Jia-chyuan, Council for Cultural Affairs (CCA) Chairman
Chen Chi-nan, Vice National Defense Minister Huo Shou-yeh,
and Vice Transportation and Communications Minister Tsai Tuei.</P>
      <P>The proposed park will be home to a southern Taiwan artistic and
cultural center with a national concert hall and a national theater,
which the premier said will be even better than those in Taipei and
will be on a par with international standards.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the budget for the center is about NT$8
billion (US$250 million) , which has been included into the nation's
five-year, NT$500 billion (US$15.625 billion), "10 Major Construction
Projects" program, although it has yet to be screened by the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Pre-construction work of an investigation of historic sites and
old trees will cost NT$200 million that will come from other
government agencies.</P>
      <P>The premier expressed hope that construction can start in 2006
and be completed in 2008 or 2009.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that President Chen Shui-bian attaches great
importance to the balanced development of northern and southern
Taiwan and said he hopes the CCA will work closely with Kaohsiung
county and city governments so that the center will be even better
than those in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The CCA is scheduled to finalize the sites of the concert and
theater halls next May.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT DECLARES WAR ON DRUGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec.  31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Friday his
administration will step up a crackdown on drug abuse and trafficking
in the coming three years for the sake of protecting citizens'
health.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement while attending a ceremony marking the
conclusion of a pre-job training program for new Ministry of Justice
Investigation Bureau (MJIB) staff.</P>
      <P>Noting that contraband drug seizures reached a 10-year high of
8,400 kg in 2004, Chen said the figure indicates the law enforcement
officers' achievements on the one hand but the seriousness of
Taiwan's drug problem on the other.</P>
      <P>In the face of the situation, Chen said, the government is
determined to designate 2005-2008 as a period for an intensified
campaign against drug abuse and trafficking.</P>
      <P>Chen said relevant government agencies have also drafted a joint
operation plan to fight against illegal narcotics and he expressed
hope that MJIB investigators can cooperate closely with other law
enforcement officers in all anti-drug operations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen outlined three other most important tasks for the
Investigation Bureau -- fighting against corruption to establish
clean politics; upgrading forensic investigation technology; and
abiding by due procedure in criminal investigations.</P>
      <P>Chen said Taiwan ranks 35th in the 2004 global clean politics
rating compiled by Transparency International -- a leading
non-governmental organization dedicated to combating corruption.</P>
      <P>"The rating indicates that there is still ample room for Taiwan
to improve its political transparency and accountability, " Chen
said, adding that he hopes the MJIB can further intensify
investigations into official corruption and vote-buying.</P>
      <P>With fast developments in forensic science, Chen said, Taiwan
must speed up the establishment of a world-class laboratory for
scientific tests to facilitate criminal investigations.</P>
      <P>He also stressed the importance of abiding by legal procedure in
criminal investigations in order to protect the human rights of those
subject to questioning and investigation. "Justice cannot be served
if we fail to follow due procedure," he added.</P>
      <P>The president also took advantage of the occasion to express his
doubts about the higher-than-average voter turnout in three counties
-- Changhua, Yunlin and Pingtung -- in the Dec. 11 legislative
elections.</P>
      <P>"Many people told me that vote-buying was very rampant in those
three counties, which also registered the nation's three highest
voter turnout rates in the just-concluded legislative elections. I
wonder whether there is a direct relationship between vote-buying and
the high voter turnout, " Chen said, adding that he hopes law
enforcement authorities can make further investigations into all
suspicious vote-buying cases and review their work strategies in
order to enhance operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>The average voter turnout in the Dec. 11 legislative elections
was a record low of about 59 percent, while Changhua's voter turnout
reached 68 percent, Yunlin's was 64 percent and Pingtung's was 62
percent.</P>
      <P>Chen originally expected the two "pan-green camp" parties -- the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union
-- to jointly win a majority in the elections. However, the two
parties failed to reach the target, leading Chen to step down as DPP
chairman to assume responsibility for the election flop.</P>

to take responsibility for the party's worse-than-expected
performance in the Dec. 11 legislative elections. The TSU garnered
only 12 legislative seats, one less than in the previous
elections.</P>
      <P>Acting TSU Chairman Huang Tzung-yuan, who has advocated that
there should be only one candidate for the by-election, said he has
done his best to communicate with the other hopefuls and expressed
regret that three people have insisted on running.</P>
      <P>The three hopefuls are Su Chin-chiang, secretary-general of the
National Cultural Association, TSU Legislator Lo Chih-ming and
at-large Legislator Kuo Lin-yung.</P>
      <P>Huang, who accompanied Su to solicit the support of the party's
central executive members, noted that Su is the favorite of former
President Lee Teng-hui, the party's so-called "spiritual leader."</P>
      <P>Huang said that after Lee returns from his sightseeing trip in
Japan, he will take care of the matter. "It doesn't matter if it ends
up with a popular vote," he said.</P>
      <P>For his part, Su said it is only normal in a democratic political
party to have competitors and that he will "play by the rules."</P>
      <P>Lo said in a press release that after the disappointing Dec. 11
legislative elections, the party is in low spirits and in dire need
to find its way.</P>
      <P>"Serving the party is the responsibility of every member, " Lo
said, adding that he has already written four articles on the
direction and development of the party after the legislative
elections and that his participation in the by-election will be best
way for him to realize his goals.</P>
      <P>Lo noted that Lee has never suggested who should be the next
chairman and that if clearly shows support to a particular candidate
after he returns from Japan, then he will withdraw from the
by-election.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Kuo said that a new legislative electoral
system will be established in the next Legislative Yuan and that the
next three years will be crucial to the development of the TSU.</P>
      <P>If the party wants to follow through its goals of "rectifying"
the name of the nation and writing a new constitution, it will have
to establish a democratic mechanism, which is why he wants to take
part in the race, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>According to the TSU party charter, if more than one person is
participating in an election, there must be a popular election, which
has been set for Jan. 22.</P>
      <P>The TSU estimates that it has around 8,000 members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>58% WANT REFERENDUM AS HEDGE AGAINST ANTI-SECESSION LAW: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of local people responding
to a recent opinion survey support a proposal to hold a defensive
referendum to protect Taiwan's sovereignty in the face of Beijing's
so-called anti-secession legislation, a private think tank said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Thinktank conducted a telephone poll of 1,070 randomly
chosen adult residents around the island from Dec. 28-29 to explore
their views about the mainland's plan to enact an anti-secession law
targeting Taiwan next year.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 52 percent of the respondents were
aware of Beijing's so-called anti-secession legislation plan,
compared to 47 percent who said they had not heard of such a plan.</P>
      <P>Nearly 80 percent said they think the anti-secession law will
give Beijing an excuse to invade Taiwan in the future and will
facilitate its attempt to drive a wedge into the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>To cope with Beijing's plan, 58 percent said Taiwan should hold a
defensive referendum to protect Taiwan's sovereign status, but 27
percent said they were opposed to such a proposal.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's referendum law, the president can call a national
referendum when the nation's sovereignty is threatened.</P>
      <P>While 53 percent said the United States should dissuade Beijing
from going ahead with its plan, 22 percent said they do not think the
United States should do so.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results, 53 percent said they believe
Beijing's anti-secession legislation will hinder a resumption of
cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue, 48 percent said the legislation will
affect Taiwan's democratic development, 70 percent said the
legislation could further suppress Taiwan's diplomatic space and 64
percent said the legislation will heighten cross-strait tension.</P>
      <P>Up to 88 percent said the major domestic political parties should
stop their bickering or war of attrition and work together to address
the mainland's ever-intensifying threat to Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER PRESIDENT MEETS WITH JAPANESE MENTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kyoto,  Japan,  Dec. 31 (CNA)
(By Amy Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Republic of China President
Lee Teng-hui met with his Japanese mentor Sukekata Kashiwa Friday,
one of the main purposes of his current seven-day sightseeing trip to
Japan.</P>
      <P>Kashiwas, 98, was Lee's professor when Lee studied at the
agroeconomics department of Kyoto University in the early 1940s, when
Taiwan was still a Japanese colony.</P>
      <P>It was their first reunion in nearly 60 years as they had lost
contact for decades and did not get in touch against until three years
ago with the assistance of Lee's Japanese friends.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, Lee has sent seasonal gifts to his
mentor and although he desired to meet his mentor in person, the
Japanese government previously would not grant him a visa for fear of
offending Beijing.</P>
      <P>Both Lee, 81, and Kashiwas said they were extremely happy to be
able to meet again. They drank tea and chatted at Kashiwa's home.
Kashiwa said he had also prepared 29 books to be presented to Lee as
gifts.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Lee was denied entry to Kyoto University. He
was turned away at the door on the grounds that his police escorts
were barred from entering the campus under a university law.</P>
      <P>Japanese medical community sources who helped arrange Lee's
current trip said the Beijing government has pressured the Japanese
authorities and Kyoto University not to allow Lee to visit his alma
mater.</P>
      <P>As a result, 10 Kyoto University professors and doctors had to
meet with Lee at a restaurant in downtown Kyoto, Japan's ancient
capital.</P>
      <P>Lee told Taiwan reporters that he did not feel regret over his
inability to enter the campus of his alma mater. "I only feel that my
alma mater became very strange to me, " he said calmly while visiting
Ginkakuji Temple that afternoon.</P>
      <P>Lee said his trip has helped him come to a better understanding
of the Japanese way of thinking. He said Japan is an advanced and
orderly country from which Taiwan can learn much.</P>
      <P>Lee, accompanied by his wife and other family members, arrived in
Nagoya Monday to start his trip.</P>
      <P>Even though his visit is private in nature, it still drew loud
protests from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lee riled Beijing during his 12 years in office from 1988-2000
when he campaigned to raise Taiwan's international profile. He
redefined the island's ties with the mainland in 1999 as a "special
state-to-state" relationship, causing Beijing to break off
fence-mending talks which remain suspended to this day.</P>
      <P>Japanese officials said Lee is visiting as a private citizen and
as such, had no basis for turning down his visa application.</P>
      <P>Lee last traveled to Japan in April 2001, when he had treatment
for a heart condition. He will conclude his current visit and return
to Taiwan Jan. 2.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Su Tseng-chang, secretary-general of the
Presidential Office, is almost certain to be elected chairman of the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) after becoming the only candidate
to register for the position by the time registration closed Friday.</P>
      <P>Although Su will run unopposed, the DPP headquarters is
nevertheless mulling whether to line up a forum in which Su will air
his vision for the party and field questions from a group of
scholars.</P>
      <P>While entering his name as a candidate, Su has already outlined
his goals of making DPP a platform where different political views
may be exchanged and a forum where public policies may be formed
through discussion, a cradle where future leaders of the country will
be groomed, and the ultimate leader of all social groups.</P>
      <P>A vote by all DPP members has been scheduled for Jan. 30. A DPP
official has estimated that it will cost the party about NT$7.5
million to send vote notices to DPP members, print ballots and open
at least 80 election stations around the island.</P>
      <P>The winner of the election, to be announced Feb. 1, will fill in
the vacancy left by Chen Shui-bian who resigned as DPP chairman to
take responsibility for the party's lackluster performance in the
Dec. 11 legislative elections.</P>
