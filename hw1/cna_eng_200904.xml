    <HEADLINE>Voucher donations high despite weak economy: animal rescue group</HEADLINE>

      <P>Despite the sluggish economy, the Kaohsiung-based Animal Rescue Team Taiwan has
raised NT$312,400 (US$9,200) in consumption vouchers since launching a voucher
donation drive at the end of January, a volunteer said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The donation campaign reached its peak in the first two weeks after the
government first distributed the vouchers on Jan. 18. Volunteer Chen Tsai-han
said the post office box used by the group to receive donated vouchers has been
filled to capacity several times.</P>
      <P>Most of the donors are families or groups of friends, while some are students,
and group volunteers are often moved by the messages donors enclose with the
vouchers, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"I'm a poor student but hope to contribute the maximum amount of money I can
afford, " and "I have read stories online about your canine rescue effort. It is
so good to have you around, " were just two examples cited by Chen.</P>
      <P>One donor who attached a photo of his mother with a dog wrote he was making the
donation on behalf of his mother because she died not long after receiving her
vouchers, Chen recalled.</P>
      <P>Since the group set up its Web site in 2004 to report animal rescue stories and
promote animal protection concepts, it has received increased financial support
from numerous sponsors but also sparked the jealousy of other similar groups,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Those groups frequently reported the Animal Rescue Team to the city, county and
central government and even accused Joseph Nee, founder and leader of the animal
rescue team, of fraud, nearly leading him to quit the volunteer job, Chen said.</P>
      <P>After registering with the Ministry of the Interior and being recognized as a
legal animal protection group in 2007, however, the team has operated without
any disruptions, she added.</P>
      <P>The team spends an average of NT$8 million a year on rescuing and rehabilitating
abused and injured stray animals and promoting awareness on protecting animals.
The vouchers received this year will also be spent on those functions, Chen
said.</P>

      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew touted Taiwan as a potential source of goods
Tuesday, saying the country provides a wide range of high-quality industrial
products at a reasonable price that offer considerable value to overseas buyers.</P>
      <P>Siew was speaking at the opening ceremony of Sourcing Taiwan 2009, organized by
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and Taiwan External Trade Development
Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Siew  described  Taiwan's  accession  to the  World  Trade Organization's
Government Procurement Agreement last December as symbolizing the country's
determination to open its market to the world, and he called on overseas buyers
to help Taiwan boost its exports by opting for its quality products.</P>
      <P>Under the principle of a liberal and open market, Taiwan looks forward to
forging a partnership with overseas buyers that not only is mutually beneficial
but also lasts forever, the vice president said.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said the Sourcing Taiwan show was
part of the government'sNew Zheng Heproject, launched to combat declining
exports by tapping into emerging markets, and he encouraged foreign buyers to
foster strong and lasting cooperation with Taiwanese suppliers.</P>
      <P>To promote export growth at the show, the MOEA and 10 overseas enterprises
signed a letter of intent to confirm the companies intentions to import or
expand purchases from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to TAITRA, some 548 companies from over 63 countries registered to
attend Sourcing Taiwan 2009, which is being held until April 2.</P>
      <P>The trade body estimates that the more than 10,000 discussions between 2,200
Taiwanese suppliers and 735 overseas buyers will generate an estimated NT$120
billion (US$3.5 billion) in business.</P>
      <P>Many of the foreign buyers are major players in global trade, including French
sporting goods retailer Oxylane, India's largest light engineering company
Amalgamations Group, German automobile parts supplier ZF Lemfoerder GMBH, and
U.S.-based Tyco Electronics, one of the worlds largest providers of engineered

      <P>A government-initiated campaign that urges young people to maintain a "dynamic
lifestyle" and keep active has seen some measure of success in its efforts to
encourage students to walk to and from school, according to Ministry of
Education (MOE) statistics.</P>
      <P>The MOE launched the campaign in 2005, then expanded it last year to 44 junior
high schools and elementary schools around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to MOE statistics, among the 48,000 students who have joined the
"walking to school" campaign, the percentage of junior high school students who
walk to school every day has risen since last November from 27.08 percent to
30.76 percent, while the percentage of elementary school students has increased
from 33.27 percent to 45.73 percent.</P>
      <P>Taipei Municipal Xinglong Elementary School is at the forefront of the effort,
with some 86.5 percent of its 1,000 students walking to school regularly,
according to the principal Cheng Chou-kuei Monday.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that the campaign has also led to weight loss among some teachers and
students. Some teachers have dropped the habit of driving to school and now
commute by bicycle or bus, she added.</P>
      <P>According to a report released by the MOE on the physical fitness of the more
than 2 million students in elementary and high schools in the 2007 academic
year, only 65.36 percent attained the lower limits of physical fitness
standards.</P>
      <P>The walk-to-school campaign was introduced in the hope that students will
develop the habit of exercising regularly, said Wang Chun-chuan, director of the
MOE Department of Physical Education.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, the MOE has also directed the schools to come up with various
other methods of encouraging students to exercise, Wang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Evergreen Group founder Chang Yung-fa denied Tuesday a Taiwanese report that his
group's container shipping unit would pull out of Kaohsiung Port in southern
Taiwan to save money at a time when cargo volumes are plummeting.</P>
      <P>"How could it be possible that Evergreen withdraws its operations from the fifth
container wharf of Kaohsiung Port, given that Kaohsiung is an irreplaceable
operating base in southern Taiwan, ? " Chang said in Singapore, where he arrived
Monday for a five-day visit.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan TV station reported recently that Evergreen might halt operations at
Kaohsiung Port and instead launch services at a container wharf at Taipei Port
in northern Taipei County jointly run by Evergreen, Wan Hai Lines Ltd. and Yang
Ming Marine Transport Corp.</P>
      <P>Pulling out of Kaohsiung would help Evergreen save as much as NT$3 billion
(NT$88.2 million) a year in rental fees, the report claimed.</P>
      <P>Chang is currently in Singapore to inspect Evergreen's operations and promote
his "Morals Monthly Digest" -- a magazine he launched in January 2008 and
distributed for free in a bid to restore traditional ethnic and moral values.</P>
      <P>Chang also announced the opening of Evergreen Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd. and
revealed his plan to have 13 ships presently flying the Panamanian flag to move
to Singapore and raise the Singaporean flag. One vessel already began flying
Singapore's flag earlier this month.</P>
      <P>In the future,  Evergreen's Singapore-based fleet would be increased to some 50
vessels, he added.</P>
      <P>Evergreen originally pulled out of Singapore in 2002 because of what it saw as
excessively high port fees and moved its fleet to nearby Malaysia.</P>
      <P>The company decided to head back to the city state last December, however, to
take advantage of Singapore's Approved International Shipping Enterprise scheme.</P>
      <P>Under the program, international shippers that establish their operations in
Singapore get 10-year tax holidays on qualifying shipping income.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Northern Taiwan should remain on guard against dengue: CDC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Residents in northern Taiwan should not let down their guard against dengue
fever, although the nation's first case of indigenous dengue fever this year was
confirmed in the southern county of Kaohsiung, the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The CDC issued the warning in light of the fact that indigenous dengue fever
cases were recorded last year in Taipei city and county, Keelung city and
Taoyuan county, which it said indicates that a dengue outbreak could occur not
just in the south of the island, but also in the northern regions.</P>
      <P>The first case this year was a 55-year-old farmer from Daliao, Kaohsiung County
who worked on a pineapple farm in the southernmost county of Pingtung. On March
22, he showed typical symptoms of the disease, including fever, joint soreness
and pains, and a skin rash, according to the CDC.</P>
      <P>The case was reported March 27 when the man was hospitalized, the CDC said.</P>
      <P>Subsequent blood tests ruled out the possibility that his family members were
also infected, it added.</P>
      <P>As of March 30 this year, Taiwan had recorded a total of 41 dengue fever cases
-- one indigenous case and 40 imported cases, according to statistics released
by the CDC.</P>
      <P>As outbreaks of dengue fever in neighboring countries have increased this year,
the number of imported cases has risen significantly to 40, compared with 23
recorded during the same period of last year, the CDC said.</P>
      <P>Of the imported cases, 23 were from Indonesia, 13 from Vietnam, two from
Thailand, and one each from Myanmar and India, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The CDC urged people to clean up their communities and empty water in indoor and
outdoor containers at least once a week as these could serve as breeding grounds
for dengue carrying mosquitoes.</P>
      <P>Mosquitoes also breed in drains, discarded tires, plant pots, uncovered buckets,
and canopies, the CDC warned.</P>
      <P>The center also urged that people seek immediate  medical treatment if they
develop early symptoms of dengue fever, such as fever, headache, nausea,
fatigue, pain behind the eyes, and muscle and joint pains.</P>
      <P>People who think that they may have been infected should have a screening test
and if they are confirmed as dengue cases, they would be given an NT$2,500
reward for reporting the disease, in accordance with a reward clause in the
Communicable Disease Control Act, the CDC added.</P>

"Vegetable and Fruit Rainbow 5-7-9 Campaign" Thursday to promote better
nutrition among Taiwan's children, the AIT said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>AIT Director Stephen M. Young and Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng will
attend a press conference that day to encourage elementary school children in
Taiwan to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables in order to stay healthy, the AIT
said in a press release.</P>
      <P>The campaign "highlights the importance of daily servings of fruit and
vegetables for overall health and cancer prevention, with five servings for
children, seven for adult women, and nine for adult men," the AIT said.</P>
      <P>This year's program will feature nutrition checkbooks  for children, which will
include homework reminders such as "today, I will eat two different colored
vegetables, " and "today before I leave for school, I will remind my family
about the '5-7-9' program," according to the AIT.</P>
      <P>In addition, the checkbooks contain coupons for discounts on selected fruits and
vegetables, which may be redeemed at 200 participating Wellcome stores
throughout the island, it added.</P>
      <P>Children and their parents will have access to an interactive Web site featuring
ongoing surveys regarding the consumption of fruits and vegetables among youth
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Prizes, including two tickets to the United States and a trip to the State of
Montana, are up for grabs in a lucky draw sponsored by the AIT and the FCF.</P>
      <P>The program, originally known as "5-a-day," was designed by the FCF in 2007 to
promote nutrition by increasing consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables.</P>
      <P>The AIT's Agricultural Trade Office in Taipei and the Washington Apple
Commission have provided funding support for the program ever since it was first
launched.</P>
      <P>In its first year, the program's in-school nutrition seminars reached over
78,000 students and their families, and by the following year, the number had
grown to 120,000.</P>

      <P>The Taipei Zoo has recently delivered a Formosan wild boar, the first of the
animal endemic to Taiwan bred under a preservation program the zoo has been
working on in cooperation with National Taiwan University to keep the pure
strain of the boar.</P>
      <P>Zoo Director Jason Yeh announced Tuesday that the male boar, born on Feb. 21, is
named "Tai An" because the breeders hope it will grow in a healthy and safe way,
reflecting the meaning of the Chinese name.</P>
      <P>It is also hoped that Tai An will be able to help reproduce its kind, Yeh said,
adding that it has become increasingly unusual to spot pure-blood Formosan wild
boars on Taiwan's mountainous areas where the animals once dominated.</P>
      <P>Some hog breeders living in the mountains have let their stock run around
without fencing them, raising the chance of mating between the domestic and wild
animals, Yeh explained.</P>
      <P>Citing research findings, Yeh said there has been a big amount of hybrid wild
boars spotted on mountains in recent years whose physical characters, such as
fur color and the shape of ears, are seen to be different from those of pure
Formosan wild boars.</P>
      <P>Although the wild animal is not categorized as endangered species in Taiwan, the
zoo still decided to launch efforts to preserve the strain, which lives in
groups in the hills and mountain areas around the island, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Zoo has a pair of pure-blood Formosan wild boars, and Tai An is their
first offspring born under the zoo's preservation program, according to the zoo.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed an amendment to the Employment Insurance Act Tuesday
to introduce a subsidy for workers on unpaid parental leave to take care of
children under three years old.</P>
      <P>All workers who have joined the insurance program for at least one year when
they take parental leave are eligible for a monthly subsidy equal to 60 percent
of their salary for up to six months, the amendment stipulated.</P>
      <P>In the event that two working parents rotate to take parental leave to take care
of the same child, both parents are eligible for the subsidy, meaning the total
subsidy received can reach up to 12 months, according to the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Gender Equality in Employment Law of 2002 allows either of the parents to
take unpaid parental leave for up to two years until their children reach three
years old.</P>
      <P>However, not many workers have taken the leave, either because most workers
could not afford to lose their salaries or because they are worried  their
positions  would be filled permanently  by replacements.</P>
      <P>Data from the Council of Labor Affairs show that only 3 percent of the more than
100,000 women covered by the Labor Insurance system who gave birth from 2005 to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has managed to maintain its retail electricity prices at low levels
despite drastic fluctuations in global fuel prices, according to a report
released Tuesday by the state-run Taiwan Power Company (Taipower).</P>
      <P>The report showed that the average retail price of electricity supplied to
industrial consumers in Taiwan stood at NT$1.8331 per kilowatt-hour (kwh) in
2007, which was the third lowest among 26 countries selected by the company for
comparison.</P>
      <P>The price was higher only than Norway's NT$1.5052 per kwh and France's NT$1.7560
per kwh, but significantly lower than neighboring South Korea's NT$2.1637 per
kwh, Indonesia's NT$2.1678 per kwh, Malaysia NT$2.2201 per kwh, Singapore's
NT$3.5121 per kwh, and Japan's NT$6.2404 per kwh, the report stated</P>
      <P>In terms of the average residential retail electricity price, the rate in Taiwan
was NT$2.5855 per kwh in 2007, also the third lowest, behind Indonesia's
NT$1.9901 per kwh and Malaysia's NT$2.3019 per kwh, according to the report</P>
      <P>The rate compared closely to South Korea's NT$3.1985 per kwh, Singapore's
NT$4.4842 per kwh and Japan's NT$5.7067 per kwh.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the average revenue per kwh of electricity sold by Taipower --
calculated by dividing total annual revenue by total annual retail sales --
amounted to NT$2.1484 in 2007, the report showed.</P>
      <P>The figure was lower than Indonesia's NT$2.1878, Malaysia's NT$2.4351,  South
Korea's  NT$2.8849,  Thailand's  2.8972,  the Philippines' NT$5.6177 and Japan's
NT$5.7711.</P>
      <P>The data was obtained from the International Energy Agency, the U.S.  Energy
Information Administration  and Malaysia's largest electricity utility company
Tenaga Nasional Berhad, Taipower said.</P>
      <P>The average revenue per kwh of electricity sold by Taipower in 2008 was
NT$2.3010. Data for other countries was not immediately available for
comparison, the company said.</P>
      <P>The report said that in 2008, Taipower produced a record 39.26 billion kwh of
electricity through nuclear power, with the average cost per kwh amounting to
just NT$0.62.</P>
      <P>According to Taipower, besides being a cost efficient form of energy, nuclear
power is also known to be environmentally friendly because no carbon dioxide is
released in the production of electricity.</P>
      <P>The use of the 39.26 billion kwh of nuclear-generated electricity in Taiwan was
equal to cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 25 million metric tons, the company
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the company's  efforts to promote an automatic generation control
system and governor-free operation also helped enhance  power quality,  with the
average  duration  of power interruption per household dropping significantly
from 165.4 minutes in 1992 to 20.81 minutes in 2008, according to the report.</P>

meet with Taiwanese expatriates in El Salvador before returning April 7, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Agence France-Presse recently reported that Funes, who led the leftist Farabundo
Marti Liberaction Nacional to power in a historic election two weeks ago,  has
said he is mulling establishing diplomatic links with China after he assumes the
presidency June 1.</P>
      <P>His comment instilled fear that Taiwan will lose the Central American ally, one
of the country's just 23 formal allies.</P>
      <P>The Foreign  Ministry,  however,  has repeatedly  expressed confidence that
relations between Taiwan and El Salvador will remain unchanged.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that it will invite a
Russian rescue team, which participated in the disaster relief work after the
Sept. 21, 1999 earthquake in Taiwan, to attend a series of events in Taiwan to
mark the 10th anniversary of the disaster.</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry has instructed its representative office in Russia to
invite the team, which provided enormous support to Taiwan after the Sept. 21
earthquake," said Antonio C.S. Chen, secretary-general of MOFA's Department of
West Asian Affairs, at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>He added that the team will join other international rescue missions in a series
of events to be held by the Cabinet-level National Disaster Prevention and
Protection Commission Sept. 17-22 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the
earthquake.</P>
      <P>When Taiwan's Nantou County was hit by the magnitude 7.3 earthquake in 1999,
Russian radio and television stations provided extensive coverage of the
disaster, and the Russian government immediately sent a rescue team to help in
the international relief effort.</P>
      <P>However,  the Russian rescue mission was delayed and made headlines when the
Russian press reported on Sept. 23 that China had refused to open an air
corridor for the plane carrying the 50 members of the rescue team. This meant
that the plane had to make two extra stops for refueling and the arrival of the
team in Taiwan was delayed by 12 hours.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has decided to draft a national nutrition act in
an effort to promote healthy diets and the nation's health, a DOH official said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The proposed act comes in the wake of a 2005-2008 national nutrition and health
study revealing that 11.7 percent of male adults had diabetes during the period,
approximately triple the 3.7 percent between 1993 and 1996, according to the
official.</P>
      <P>The study also shows that more than 50 percent of all male adults and more than
30 percent of all adult females were overweight.</P>
      <P>In addition, more than 25 percent of men and over 20 percent of women suffered
from metabolic problems linked to pre-chronic disease, the results show.</P>
      <P>If people continue their dietary habits of eating food with high fat, high sugar
and high calories but low fiber, the number of chronic patients and young people
with chronic diseases is expected to increase, which could create a heavy
financial burden on the national health insurance system, the official said.</P>
      <P>The draft act is being drawn up taking into consideration the World Health
Organization's Global Strategy on Diet,  Physical Activity and Health, as well
as related laws in the United States, Canada and Japan, according to DOH
official Hsieh Tien-hung.</P>
      <P>The act aims to regulate the implementation of monitoring activities,
nutritional research studies, the establishment of nutrition standards and a
database of the nutritional values of various food, as well as the promotion of
nutrition education.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan finally ratified two United Nations human rights treaties
Tuesday that had been shelved since the Republic of China lost its U.N.

      <P>The treaties are the International  Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that were
introduced by the United Nations in 1966 and came into force in 1976.</P>
      <P>The ratification finalized the legal procedure for implementing world-recognized

      <P>Those that fail to conform will have to be amended or abolished within two years

    <TEXT>
      <P>A food bank run by the Department of Social Affairs under the Taichung city
government was inaugurated Tuesday, with assistance from over 80 charitable
organizations based in the central Taiwan city and the first distribution of aid
materials set for May.</P>
      <P>Department director Chang Kuo-hui presided over the opening of the "Dadun Love
Food Bank" located in retail premises offered by a sympathetic citizen to the
department free of charge.</P>
      <P>The bank has already received a large amount of monetary and material donations
from private individuals or groups prior to the start of its first distribution
of food or aid materials to people in need at five spots around the city in May,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>The food bank serves as a warehouse and management center in which items donated
by people from all walks of life to the city government to help the impoverished
can be stored.</P>
      <P>Chang said he was really touched to see so many packs of food and so much money
flooding into the bank shortly after it opened earlier that same day.</P>
      <P>"The kindness of the Taiwanese people has not been hit by the economic crisis,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Contributions to the food bank included NT$1 million (US$29,400) from the
private Wenying Foundation and NT$125,000 worth of food for 500 people from
former Taichung Mayor Lin Poh-jung, who is now an adviser to President Ma Ying-
jeou.</P>
      <P>Among other items were 1,200 packs of rice worth some NT$100,000 donated by a
businessman surnamed as Tsai, who paid for the rice with money he would
originally have spent on his 50th birthday party.</P>
      <P>Apart from its first distribution in May, which will give out rice and other
cereal, as well as canned food and noodles, to people in need, city government
officials said the bank is projected to conduct two another rounds of
distribution in August and November.</P>
      <P>The food bank will target jobless people, single parents and people hit hard by
disaster in its initial stages, city government officials said.</P>
      <P>In mid-February, the city government teamed up with a mobile food bank run by
the non-profit Hsingshih Foundation to distribute food packages to low-income
families and homeless people at a local activity center.</P>
      <P>It was the first time the city and the foundation had teamed up to make use of
the mobile food bank service. Some 380 food packages were distributed to members
of 100 underprivileged households and 120 cooked meals were handed out to
homeless people.</P>
      <P>"The city government learned something very valuable from the aid operation in
February, despite playing only a support role, " a city government official
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH to reduce window for measles vaccinations</HEADLINE>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will suggest to parents that they reduce the
3-month window for getting their children vaccinated in the wake of a recent
unusually high number of measles cases, a DOH official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Doing this will help parents remember to get their children vaccinated, "
according to Chou Jih-haw, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease
Control.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that there were five imported measles cases reported between late
last year and early this year.</P>
      <P>Among them, two were children who had traveled to Vietnam with their mothers and
two who had visited China, who infected 22 others upon their return, mostly
children with whom they shared hospital wards, members of their families or
neighbors.</P>
      <P>The remaining case was also from Vietnam, but the child did not infect anyone
else. Three indigenous measles cases were also reported during the period.</P>
      <P>Chou noted that the inoculation rate for measles -- a highly infectious disease
-- is as high as 95 percent in Taiwan. In the last decade, except for a series
of cluster infections of 2002, the number of imported and indigenous cases has
not exceeded 10 on average per year.</P>
      <P>He noted that experts usually suggest that children should be vaccinated at
between 12 months and 15 months, but the DOH said quite a number of parents
forget to get shots for their children until the last minute.</P>

      <P>The Japanese government lifted a ban Tuesday on imports of live domestic fowl
and poultry products from Taiwan, according to a statement released by the
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine following an
announcement of the measure by the Japanese authorities.</P>
      <P>The move means that Taiwanese poultry products can be exported to Japan as long
as they meet that country's quarantine rules, the statement noted.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, Japan suspended imports of domestic poultry, eggs and
related products last Dec. 17 after a chicken farm in Kaohsiung County, southern
Taiwan, reported an outbreak of low pathogenicity avian influenza.</P>
      <P>The authorities took immediate action to control the outbreak, including
killing and incinerating  the affected chickens and quarantining 76 other
chicken farms near the affected one.</P>
      <P>After three months of efforts to eradicate the disease, the bureau recently
confirmed that the virus was no longer present, the statement said, leading to
Japan's re-opening of its doors to local poultry.</P>

      <P>A group of experts huddled Tuesday to thrash out how to reorganize the exhibits
at the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei to give a better impression of
the widely divergent views people have of the late president and to put his
legacy into perspective.</P>
      <P>At the request of the Ministry of Education (MOE) , which administers the
memorial hall dedicated to the commemoration of Chiang, the experts were asked
to come up with ideas of how best to present the various aspects of the former
leader.</P>
      <P>Chu Nan-hsien, chief of the Social Education Department under the MOE who
chaired Tuesday's meeting, said the experts suggested setting up a panel
comprising historians from Academia Sinica and Academia Historica, as well as
memorial hall officials, to work out a set of proposals.</P>
      <P>Elaborating on the MOE's idea of presenting a wider variety of aspects of
Chiang, Chu said the existing exhibition, which features the late leader's
military and political careers, fail to show his achievements in education and
culture, such as his decision to extend the country's compulsory education from
six years to nine years.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the new exhibition is intended to shed new light on the late
president's possible political responsibility for the 228 Incident and the
ensuing iron-fisted rule of the island under martial law, Chu said that "this
will be discussed. What we are trying to do is to show the leader in his true
image."</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to a Taiwanese uprising against the Kuomintang (KMT)
government in 1947 in which thousands of people were killed in a brutal
crackdown by Chiang's troops that was followed by a government-launched witch-
hunt to weed out political dissents.</P>
      <P>Thousands more, many of them Taiwan's intelligentsia elite, perished or
disappeared during that period, known as the White Terror.</P>
      <P>These events see Chiang now regarded as a controversial leader, and although
many consider him a national savior, some have branded him a dictator
responsible for decades of authoritarian rule.</P>
      <P>The controversy came to a head in 2007 when then-President Chen Shui-bian
renamed the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall the Taiwan Democracy Memorial Hall,
despite an outcry from the KMT -- at that time in the opposition.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou, who was elected 2008, reinstated the name of the
memorial  hall but acceded  that  Chiang  bears  some responsibility for the 228
Incident.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S.-based nongovernmental organization Freedom House warned Wednesday that
the rights of Internet and mobile phone users are increasingly at risk as
governments, both repressive and democratic, expand their ability to monitor and
control online activity.</P>
      <P>In a press release forwarded to local press through the Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy, the group identified wide disparities in Internet freedom among 15
countries it surveyed and raised concern over trends such as theoutsourcing of
censorship" to private companies and authoritarian governments' use of
undercover agents to manipulate online conversations.</P>
      <P>Cuba received the lowest score for Internet freedom while China and Cuba were
found to be the countries  imposing  the most restrictions on the use of the
Internet.</P>
      <P>More than a billion people look to the Internet and mobile phones to provide a
new freedom frontier where they can exercise their right to freedom of
expression without repercussion, Freedom House executive director Jennifer
Windsor said in the press release.</P>
      <P>As access grows, more governments are employing diverse and sophisticated
methods to monitor, censor and punish Internet users, she added.</P>
      <P>According to Freedom House, the pilot study is aimed at better understanding
emerging threats to Internet freedom by evaluating the 15 countries surveyed
based on barriers to access, limitations on content and violations of
usersrights.</P>
      <P>The countries surveyed were distributed across six regions: China, India, and
Malaysia in Asia; Cuba and Brazil in Latin America, Egypt, Tunisia, and Iran in
the Middle East and North Africa; Kenya and South Africa in sub-Saharan Africa;
Russia, Estonia, and Georgia in the former Soviet Union; and the United Kingdom
and Turkey in Europe.</P>
      <P>Findings from the study, which covers events from 2007-2008, will be formally
released later Wednesday local time to a conference of more than a thousand
bloggers in Berlin, Germany, Freedom House said, adding that it hopes to expand
the study to examine all countries of the world.</P>
      <P>Of the 15 countries surveyed, Cuba received the lowest score because of the
Castro regime's near total control over Internet access, while Estonia topped
the study as the country with the most Internet freedom.</P>
      <P>China, Iran and Tunisia were ranked "Not Free, " but the vast majority of the
countries studied received aPartly Freeranking, including Egypt, Georgia, India,
Kenya, Malaysia, Russia and Turkey. Brazil, South Africa and the United Kingdom
were rankedFree.</P>
      <P>The study said that while China is home to 300 million Internet users, the most
of any country in the world, its rulers employ the world's most sophisticated,
multi-layered, and wide-ranging apparatus for repressing Internet freedom.</P>
      <P>China was tied with Cuba as the country with the most curbs on users' rights,
including  prosecutions  for online activities, surveillance and extra-legal
harassment of bloggers.</P>
      <P>Freedom House is heartened by the fact that citizens, even in highly-repressive
countries like China, Cuba and Iran, are pushing back with creativity and
courage against these growing government controls over the Internet,Windsor said
in the press release.</P>
      <P>Democratic countries should not only support such voices, but also set an
example of best practice with their own digital media polices,she added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Guppies released into flooded basement for mosquito control</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Public health authorities released 100,000 guppies into a notoriously flooded
basement in a Kaohsiung building Tuesday, their latest attempt to control the
mosquito population through biological methods and prevent a dengue fever
outbreak.</P>
      <P>The basement, measuring over 3,000 square meters, is located in a building that
has been left uninhabited for more than 20 years in the southern city's Jhengren
borough, near the border with Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>The first indigenous dengue fever case this year was recently reported in the
southern county.</P>
      <P>The pool of water accumulated inside the building, which has become a haven for
mosquitos, has long been a headache for public health authorities.</P>
      <P>A property  ownership  dispute has delayed  the building's demolition, and the
large number of waste materials piled inside make draining the water impossible.</P>
      <P>Residents living in the neighborhood launched a large-scale campaign three years
ago to try to clean up the place, but the problem remains.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the city's health department, the most effective way
to control and prevent dengue fever outbreaks is to root out the infestation of
mosquitos, and achieving the goal through biological methods that take advantage
of the natural food chain is safer and more enduring and environmentally
friendly than other methods.</P>
      <P>Pesticide spraying, which is usually adopted as an emergency measure, can build
resistance to the drug among mosquitos if used excessively, the officials said.</P>
      <P>To promote biological methods to control mosquito infestation, the health
department has identified more than 130 locations in the city with long-term
water collection problems where it will release small fish such as mosquitofish
and guppies into the stagnant pools of water to consume mosquito larvae, they
said.</P>
      <P>Dengue is transmitted by the bites of mosquitoes infected with the dengue virus.</P>
      <P>Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and bleeding. The disease is
potentially deadly, and early diagnosis increases the survival of patients.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the Centers for Disease Control show that a total of 41 dengue
fever cases have been reported in Taiwan from the start of this year until March
30.</P>
      <P>All of these cases were imported except for one involving a pineapple farmer in
Daliao township, Kaohsiung County, which was confirmed last week as an
indigenous case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Japan's Elpida confirmed as partner of Taiwan Memory Co.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 1 (CNA)
04/01/09  14:35:50
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming confirmed Wednesday that Japanese chipmaker
Elpida Memory Inc. will join soon-to-be-established DRAM company Taiwan Memory
Co. (TMC) as a major strategic cooperation partner.</P>
      <P>"Cooperation between TMC and Elpida will be deep and wide, " Yiin said during a
break at a Legislative Yuan hearing.</P>
      <P>Yiin added, however, that Elpida's involvement does not preclude the
participation of another global DRAM giant, United States-based Micron Co.</P>
      <P>He characterized the possibility of Micron joining the venture as highly
promising, but said the timing would depend on how soon Micron completes
negotiations with its existing partners, including Nanya Technology Corporation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Memory Co. is being set up by the government to revitalize the local
dynamic  random access memory (DRAM)  industry  and consolidate selected
technology providers and domestic memory chip makers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's five publicly listed DRAM companies posted a combined net loss of
NT$94.76 billion (US$2.8 billion) in the first nine months of 2008, and the
government believed consolidation offered the best chance to the big five to
survive with the economic slump and depressed DRAM demand extending into 2009.</P>
      <P>John Hsuan, honorary vice chairman of United Microelectronics Corp. who is
overseeing TMC's launch,  said progress made in negotiations over the past month
on the content and terms of cooperation has been smooth.</P>
      <P>Hsuan  stressed  TMC's  determination  to  have  successful negotiations with
Elpida and Micron, both of which have been key technology providers for Taiwan's
DRAM manufacturers and are now expressing a keen interest in participating in
the new venture.</P>
      <P>Hsuan said Wednesday that TMC's operating plan is expected to be crafted by mid-
April and that the company will be established within the first half of 2009.</P>
      <P>The government, in principle, will not invest more than NT$30 billion (US$887.57
million) in the new venture, and the hope is that the private sector will inject
an equally large sum, Hsuan said.</P>
      <P>TMC will sign formal letters of intent on strategic partnerships with Elpida and
Micron after the company is formally established and start-up funds received,
Hsuan added.</P>
      <P>When Yiin projected the new company's role March 5, he suggested it would
develop its own core technologies to boost the local DRAM sector's
competitiveness and said it would also set up a research and development center,
develop a capacity consolidation platform and centralize sales functions.</P>
      <P>He also indicated that TMC would first form a strategic alliance with a foreign
partner before further negotiating the consolidation of Taiwan's existing DRAM
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Hsuan on Wednesday emphasized the new venture's initial focus on upgrading
technologies in conjunction with its foreign partners. He said the company will
initially hire 400 employees in the area of manufacturing process development
and another 400 in product design.</P>
      <P>"There could be two manufacturing teams -- one from Elpida and one from Micron
-- operating simultaneously in the company in order to avoid misgivings about
possible infringement of their respective intellectual property rights," Hsuan
suggested.</P>
      <P>Wednesday's confirmation of the TMC-Elpida tie-up was seen as a positive step
forward in consolidating the local DRAM chip industry, which has long taken a
back seat technologically to South Korea's DRAM sector.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan-based DRAMeXchange Technology Inc., Asia's biggest online
market for memory chips, local makers held a 23.2 percent share of the global
market in terms of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008.</P>
      <P>South Korea led the industry worldwide as Samsung Electronics Co. controlled
24.5 percent and Hynix Semiconductor Inc. 20.4 percent of the global market.</P>

      <P>The Legislative Yuan will be notified if a memorandum of understanding (MOU)  on
cooperation in financial supervision is signed by Taiwan and China, a financial
official confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the legislature's Finance Committee, Financial
Supervisory Commission Chairman Sean Chen said such a cross-strait financial
supervision agreement would be considered as a treaty under international law,
and the legislature would therefore have to be notified of the deal.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party legislator Huang Wei-cher questioned,
however, whether submitting an MOU for the legislature's reference was
sufficient, given the sensitive nature of Taiwan's ties with China.</P>
      <P>Huang suggested that any MOU on financial cooperation signed with China be
submitted for legislative review, which would require the lawmaking  body to
vote on the measure,  rather  than simple notification, which would not require
any further legislative action.</P>
      <P>Chen insisted, however, that under existing international law, the legislature
would only have to be notified of such a deal.</P>
      <P>The MOU, expected to be signed in May, is likely to cover cooperation in
supervising cross-strait banking, securities, futures and insurance services as
well as the establishment of a currency settlement mechanism.</P>
      <P>Two other agreements are also expected to be signed during a third meeting
between the top negotiators of the two countries, according to political
sources.</P>
      <P>One will cover cooperation in fighting cross-strait criminal activities, while
the other will deal with the launch of regularly scheduled flight services
between Taiwan and China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei city government launched a "Beautify Taipei" plan Wednesday, a large-
scale urban renewal project aimed at revamping the landscape and skyline of
Taiwan's capital and stimulating private investment and commercial
opportunities.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said at a news conference that the project will
encourage the public and private sectors to work together to give Taipei City a
facelift by creating more public spaces, landmark buildings, artistic
installations, and green areas.</P>
      <P>Taipei is a vibrant and convenient city. But in terms of its landscape, the city
is known for its lack of special characteristics compared to other international
cities,Hau said.</P>
      <P>I believe the project will change the urban look of Taipei substantially and
upgrade the city to one that can keep up with international standards, he said
of the initiative, which consists of eight plans and three major integrated
proposals.</P>
      <P>Hau said the urban renewal project comes at a crucial time for the city, which
is looking to raise its international profile when it hosts the 2009 Summer
Deaflympics in September and the Taipei Int'l Expo in 2010.</P>
      <P>The mayor pledged that the city government will offer its full support for the
urban renewal project by streamlining administrative procedures and providing a
range of incentives such as allowing higher "floor area ratios" -- the amount of
a building's floor area relative to the land area it sits on -- to encourage the
private sector to participate.</P>
      <P>The mayor estimated that the project,  to emphasize  city competitiveness, local
industries and sustainable development, will generate an estimated NT$600
billion (US$17.7 billion) in business opportunities, more than 10,000 jobs, and
31 hectares of open space and green land.</P>
      <P>Ding Yu-chyurn, head of the city government's Department of Urban Development,
said at the news conference that the city only plans to invest NT$130 million in
the project, but hopes to leverage that amount through incentives attracting
private sector investment.</P>

      <P>Buoyed by Wall Street's rise overnight, the local bourse opened higher at

A total of 5.23 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$102.08

      <P>All eight major stock categories gained ground, with construction issues moving
up the most at 5.9 percent. Paper and pulp issues rose 5.3 percent, cement

      <P>It turns out that reproductions of the National Palace Museum's famous Jadeite
Cabbage with Insects, which are sold as souvenirs, were made in China, a
legislator of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at a meeting  at the legislative  Transportation Committee, KMT
Legislator Chiang Lien-fu said it is ironic and pathetic that after Chinese
tourists went on a binge at the National Palace Museum to shop exclusively for
reproductions of the popular cabbage piece, they ended up with souvenirs that
were made in China.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the National Palace Museum's procurement policy was irresponsible,
and asked whether it was because the reproductions could not be made in Taiwan
or because it costs more to buy from local makers.</P>
      <P>Chiang contended that souvenirs on sale at tourism venues in Taiwan should be
fine products of high quality.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the issue, KMT Legislator Chu Feng-chih said it is shameful
that products sold at Taiwan's flagship museum are made in China.</P>
      <P>"Why should the NPM be so mercenary? " Chu asked. She suggested that all
souvenirs procured by public offices and agencies for public distribution should
be made in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to the lawmakers' criticisms, Oliver Yu, deputy minister of
transportation and communications, agreed that the practice does a disservice to
the nation's international image and said he will have relevant officials look
into the matter.</P>
      <P>Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry  of

      <P>The levels of financial well-being are low among women, most of whom spend less
than 30 minutes per week managing their personal finances, according to the
results of a survey released Wednesday by Citibank Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The results show that the financial well-being index among local women averaged
only 45.9 on a 100-point scale in 2008.</P>
      <P>The lowest level was seen among women in the 18-29 age group, at 43.3, followed
by those in the 30-39 age group, at 45.6.</P>
      <P>Those aged 40 and older were slightly better, at 47.7.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted online Oct. 15-20, 2008 among 200 women aged 18 and
older who held a bank account or credit card. It had a margin of error of 7.1
percentage points.</P>
      <P>The annual income of the respondents  averaged  NT$386,000 (US$11,386) among the
18-29 age group, NT$454,000 among the 30-39 age group and NT$704,000 among those
aged 40 and older.</P>
      <P>The survey found that on average, the respondents spent 36 minutes per week
managing their personal finances, with 62 percent of the respondents spending
less than 30 minutes per week.</P>
      <P>On average, 30 minutes per week were spent by those in the 18-29 age group and
38 minutes per week by those aged 30 and older.</P>
      <P>In the event of unemployment, the savings of the respondents could support them
for an average of 10.2 weeks.</P>
      <P>The results show that as the global financial crisis continued, many respondents
were feeling insecure about their jobs and were pessimistic about the economic
outlook.</P>
      <P>Approximately 35 percent of respondents put aside up to 10 percent of their
monthly income in the form of savings, while 27 percent put aside over 30
percent. Only 9 percent of the respondents said they did not save money.</P>
      <P>Asked to define the meaning of financial independence, many mentioned "being
able to buy things one desires at any time" and "no need to worry about life
after retirement."</P>

      <P>The government-planned DRAM company, Taiwan Memory Co. (TMC), will in the
initial stages focus on product design and optimizing the manufacturing process,
so as to build Taiwan's independent proficiency in developing DRAM production
technologies, said John Hsuan, the appointed chairman of the company, Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The company will take advantage of Taiwan's dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
productivity to develop design expertise, Hsuan said at a press conference in
Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, adding that the aim is to achieve these goals within
two years after the company's establishment.</P>
      <P>He noted that the profile of TMC is a company with unique expertise, dedicated
to product design and the development of the DRAM manufacturing process.</P>
      <P>Its top priority will be to find the best way to take advantage of the country's
productivity in the DRAM industry, he said. TMC's operations will not conflict
with the interests of local DRAM makers, but will serve as a platform for local
businesses  to forge cooperative links, he added.</P>
      <P>TMC will offer funds and resources in the areas of technology research and
development to affiliated companies, and will authorize or contract local DRAM
factories to carry out production, packing and testing, Hsuan said.</P>
      <P>Hsuan, honorary vice chairman of United Microelectronics Corp., was assigned by
the Ministry of Economic Affairs in early March to execute the establishment of
the DRAM company planned by the government to revitalize the local DRAM
industry.</P>
      <P>At the press conference Wednesday, he outlined the principles by which the
company will be guided. It will not compete in the area of production, will not
engage in price battles, sell sub-standard products, interfere in the market
order, or dump its products, he promised.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the outlook for the DRAM industry, Hsuan said its recovery will
not be as swift as Frank Huang, chairman of the Hsinchu-based Powerchip

days earlier compared with last year, when the 1 millionth visitor arrived April
5.</P>
      <P>They attributed this year's faster rate of visitor arrivals to the increasing
number of Chinese tourists visiting the country.</P>
      <P>The situation is especially encouraging,  since the global economic downturn has
hit the tourism industry hard, boosting Taiwan's confidence of achieving its
goal of receiving 4 million visitors for the whole year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Bureau statistics show that visitor arrivals totaled nearly 3.85 million in
2008, up 3.47 percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>Of these arrivals, approximately 1.78 million, or 46.17 percent, were for
pleasure, while 881,431, or 22.92 percent, were for business.</P>
      <P>The largest number of visitors from a single country -- nearly 1.09 million --
came from Japan, followed by Hong Kong and Macau, totaling 618,667.</P>
      <P>Visitors from the United States totaled 387,197, while those from China totaled
329,204.</P>

      <P>A vice chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) invited Hong Kong Chief Executive
Donald Yam-kuen Tsang Wednesday to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Eric Liluan Chu, who is also magistrate of northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County,
along with six other county officials, arrived in the former British colony
earlier that day for a brief visit aimed at promoting an aerotropolis
development project in the county built around the Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport.</P>
      <P>An aerotropolis is a new type of urban conurbation comprising aviation-intensive
businesses and related enterprises extending up to 25 km outward from major
airports.</P>
      <P>Chu expressed hope that Hong Kong investors will invest in the aviation city
project and that there will be closer cooperation between the Taiwanese airport
and the Hong Kong International Airport.</P>
      <P>Citing Chu's remarks, Chang Chi-chiang, a county government secretary, said Chu
hopes bilateral government exchanges in the fields of trade, culture and
education will also be boosted.</P>
      <P>Tsang for his part said that Taiwan and Hong Kong can work together to promote
airport cooperation in many ways.</P>
      <P>The head of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative  Region government noted that
he visited Taiwan in 1977 and expressed hope that he will be able to go there
again during his current tenure.</P>
      <P>He also invited Taoyuan County to co-host a Taiwan-Hong Kong city exchange forum
next year.</P>
      <P>Chu and his delegation later left Hong Kong for Singapore to continue  their

      <P>The Taichung city government in central Taiwan will sell a kind of high-end
chicken raised with organic feed made from kitchen scraps on a trial basis from
May, a city official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Li-teh,  head of the city's  Environmental  Protection Department, gave his
assurances that this pedigree of chicken will not contain any residue of
antibiotics or growth hormones and he encouraged the public to consume them.</P>
      <P>The chickens will be marketed and sold on the Internet next month after two
years of experiments with a local farm.</P>
      <P>Each chicken will be sold for NT$450 9(US$12.9) during the promotional sales
period in which a maximum of 50 chickens can be sold per month, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lee made the comments at a news conference with the Taichung City Farmers
Association Chief Chen Ching-chih to promote the new strain of free range
chickens.</P>
      <P>The kitchen scrap will be provided by the city's Environmental Protection
Department.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, this new pedigree of chickens must be reared for over six
months so as to have them develop tasty meat. Usually, ordinary chickens would
be raised at the farm for only four to five weeks before they are slaughtered
and sold in the market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yunlin County in south-central Taiwan is aiming to boost its tourism by opening
its local winery to public tours with effect from Friday, officials of the
central Taiwan office under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fu Lu Shou Winery in Gukeng township, which established Taiwan's first wine
museum in October 2007, will mark its 10th founding anniversary  on April 3 by
allowing visitors  to observe its wine-making process.</P>
      <P>The museum, which has fully preserved the country's traditional wine-making
process and equipment, is optimistic about attracting more tourists. It also
hopes that by integrating traditional culture and modern technology, it will
draw more business opportunities.</P>
      <P>The winery obtained an MOEA license last November to operate as a tourism
facility in Yunlin County, as did two other enterprises -- a soy sauce company
and a towel factory.</P>
      <P>Visitors to the winery will be able to gain a firsthand understanding of the
wine-making process and to sample a wide variety of liquors and wines from all
over the world.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA, the trend of promoting factories and workshops as tourist
attractions has been gaining popularity steadily since last year, despite the
economic downturn.</P>
      <P>This type of business drew more than 110,000 visitors across the country the
last year and recorded revenue of more than NT$400 million (US$11.5 million) for
the year, according to statistics compiled by the MOEA's central Taiwan office.</P>
      <P>The office forecast that the number of visitors to Gukeng township will increase
by 30 percent when the winery becomes part of the county's tourism expansion
efforts.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the MOEA, the Industrial Development Bureau made public
March 27 a list of 10 factories that qualify for MOEA assistance this year to
develop as tourism venues. They include factories that make rice noodles, shoes,
sausages and saxophones.</P>
      <P>A total of 33 factories had applied for government aid to tailor their business

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou paid tribute Wednesday to the individuals featured in the
Central News Agency's "Taiwan Heroes" series of reports, saying they are models
of the society who embody the country's core value of integrity and its spirit
of entrepreneurship.</P>
      <P>It is this spirit that will enable Taiwan to overcome adversity and to regain
prosperity, Ma said at a ceremony to celebrate the CNA's 85th founding
anniversary, at its Taipei headquarters.</P>
      <P>The CNA launched the "Taiwan Heroes" series on March 8, releasing one story a
day that featured local civilians who, through willpower and perseverance, have
overcome adversity and risen to success.</P>
      <P>The president praised the reporting, saying all the stories in the series have
touched his heart because the uncelebrated heroes have not only accomplished the
impossible, but have also remained humble and diligent.</P>
      <P>These laudable qualities can serve as social model for the country, he added.</P>
      <P>The anniversary celebrations were also attended by Lai Feng-wei, deputy

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to invest heavily in revitalization of baseball</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Sports Affairs Council (SAC) will inject NT$1.26 billion (US$37.28 million)
into various projects over the next four years to revitalize baseball in Taiwan,
Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Su made the announcement after a special meeting chaired by Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan and at which SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling gave a briefing on the Cabinet-
level SAC's baseball revitalization plan.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the top goals of the SAC's four-year plan include having
Taiwan's national baseball team enter the finals of Asian and world baseball
championships and capture at least a silver medal and compete in the semi-finals
of every World Baseball Classic tournament.</P>
      <P>To realize these goals, the SAC will spend NT$1.26 billion over the next four
years on various baseball development projects.</P>
      <P>Baseball has been known as Taiwan's national ball game because of its popularity
among local people. The urgency to resurrect the sport was highlighted by
Taiwan's disastrous performance in the just-concluded World Baseball Classic
2009, in which Taiwan was first crushed by South Korea 9-0 and then
embarrassingly eliminated from the tournament by China 4-1.</P>
      <P>Projects to be carried out under the four-year revival plan will include helping
Taiwan's top-tier professional baseball league -- the Chinese Professional
Baseball League -- to form a second-tier professional league and subsidizing any
organization or corporation that intends to establish adult amateur baseball
teams.</P>
      <P>The revival  plan also  calls  for the development  of a comprehensive mechanism
for the formation and training of national baseball teams at various levels.</P>
      <P>The SAC has worked out operational guidelines for the formation of more adult
teams, with the goal of establishing 10 amateur teams this year, SAC sources
said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources,  the council on Tuesday invited representatives of
city and county governments and companies that intend to start amateur teams to
discuss the technical details.</P>
      <P>The meeting was attended by representatives from Taipei City, Taipei County,
Taoyuan County, Taichung City, Kaohsiung City and Taitung County governments as
well as from Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Co., Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan Power Co.,
China Steel Corp., and Taiwan Cooperative Bank, the sources said.</P>
      <P>In order to organize high-caliber national teams, the SAC will divide
international competitions into three tiers, with the Olympic Games, Asian Games
and World Baseball Classic at the top.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei Baseball Association will also be responsible for organizing
an ad hoc committee to deal with the formation and training of national teams
for various international tournaments.</P>
      <P>Under the four-year plan, the SAC will sponsor a baseball revival conference
every year, invite world-famous coaches to help with the training of national
teams, and organize a winter baseball league tournament in which Japanese and
South Korean professional baseball teams will be invited to compete.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the SAC plans to build a baseball village to facilitate personnel
training and sports development.</P>

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) decided Wednesday to nominate
DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi to run for Tainan County magistrate in December, but
a veteran DPP member vowed that he will also join the race.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen, whose last post under the former DPP government was secretary-
general of the Presidential Office, claimed that he had become a victim of
factional fighting within the DPP. He vowed that he will go the distance in the
election in defiance of factional dominance within the party.</P>
      <P>Chen, 74, has served in a series of high-level postions in his political career,
including as Tainan County magistrate and minister of foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>He expressed confidence that he would emerge as the front runner among all the
DPP candidates in the Tainan County magistrate election, and suggested that the
party leadership should have chosen the nominee by means of an opinion poll that
would have gauged who had the strongest support among the DPP members and
voters.</P>
      <P>Chen disclosed that DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen had met with him a day earlier
in an attempt to persuade him to withdraw from the race but that he flatly
refused.</P>
      <P>Asked by reporters whether that means he will run in the election even if the
party resorts to disciplinary measures against him, Chen did not give a direct
answer, but said that he will leave that kind of issue to the DPP.</P>

      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei city government launched a "Beautify Taipei" plan Wednesday, a large-
scale urban renewal project aimed at revamping the landscape and skyline of
Taiwan's capital and stimulating private investment and commercial
opportunities.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said at a news conference that the project will
encourage the public and private sectors to work together to give Taipei City a
facelift by creating more public spaces, landmark buildings, artistic
installations, and green areas.</P>
      <P>Taipei is a vibrant and convenient city. But in terms of its landscape, the city
is known for its lack of special characteristics compared to other international
cities,Hau said.</P>
      <P>I believe the project will change the urban look of Taipei substantially and
upgrade the city to one that can keep up with international standards, he said
of the initiative, which consists of eight plans and three major integrated
proposals.</P>
      <P>Hau said the urban renewal project comes at a crucial time for the city, which
is looking to raise its international profile when it hosts the 2009 Summer
Deaflympics in September and the Taipei Int'l Expo in 2010.</P>
      <P>The mayor pledged that the city government will offer its full support for the
urban renewal project by streamlining administrative procedures and providing a
range of incentives such as allowing higher "floor area ratios" -- the amount of
a building's floor area relative to the land area it sits on -- to encourage the
private sector to participate.</P>
      <P>The mayor estimated that the project,  to emphasize  city competitiveness, local
industries and sustainable development, will generate an estimated NT$600
billion (US$17.7 billion) in business opportunities, more than 10,000 jobs, and
31 hectares of open space and green land.</P>
      <P>Ding Yu-chyurn, head of the city government's Department of Urban Development,
said at the news conference that the city only plans to invest NT$130 million in
the project, but hopes to leverage that amount through incentives attracting
private sector investment.</P>

key barometer, advancing 103.61 points, or 1.98 percent, to close at 5,314.45.</P>
      <P>Buoyed by Wall Street's rise overnight, the local bourse opened higher at
5,271.83 and stayed above that for the rest of the session, peaking at 5,341.31.
A total of 5.23 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$102.08

      <P>All eight major stock categories gained ground, with construction issues moving
up the most at 5.9 percent. Paper and pulp issues rose 5.3 percent, cement

      <P>It turns out that reproductions of the National Palace Museum's famous Jadeite
Cabbage with Insects, which are sold as souvenirs, were made in China, a
legislator of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at a meeting  at the legislative  Transportation Committee, KMT
Legislator Chiang Lien-fu said it is ironic and pathetic that after Chinese
tourists went on a binge at the National Palace Museum to shop exclusively for
reproductions of the popular cabbage piece, they ended up with souvenirs that
were made in China.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the National Palace Museum's procurement policy was irresponsible,
and asked whether it was because the reproductions could not be made in Taiwan
or because it costs more to buy from local makers.</P>
      <P>Chiang contended that souvenirs on sale at tourism venues in Taiwan should be
fine products of high quality.</P>
      <P>Also commenting on the issue, KMT Legislator Chu Feng-chih said it is shameful
that products sold at Taiwan's flagship museum are made in China.</P>
      <P>"Why should the NPM be so mercenary? " Chu asked. She suggested that all
souvenirs procured by public offices and agencies for public distribution should
be made in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Responding to the lawmakers' criticisms, Oliver Yu, deputy minister of
transportation and communications, agreed that the practice does a disservice to
the nation's international image and said he will have relevant officials look
into the matter.</P>
      <P>Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry  of
Transportation  and Communications,  accepted  the legislators' criticism,
saying that officials of her bureau have also found China-made woodcarvings on
sale in shops in Sanyi, Miaoli County -- a major tourism venue for the sale of

      <P>The levels of financial well-being are low among women, most of whom spend less
than 30 minutes per week managing their personal finances, according to the
results of a survey released Wednesday by Citibank Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The results show that the financial well-being index among local women averaged
only 45.9 on a 100-point scale in 2008.</P>
      <P>The lowest level was seen among women in the 18-29 age group, at 43.3, followed
by those in the 30-39 age group, at 45.6.</P>
      <P>Those aged 40 and older were slightly better, at 47.7.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted online Oct. 15-20, 2008 among 200 women aged 18 and
older who held a bank account or credit card. It had a margin of error of 7.1
percentage points.</P>
      <P>The annual income of the respondents  averaged  NT$386,000 (US$11,386) among the
18-29 age group, NT$454,000 among the 30-39 age group and NT$704,000 among those
aged 40 and older.</P>
      <P>The survey found that on average, the respondents spent 36 minutes per week
managing their personal finances, with 62 percent of the respondents spending
less than 30 minutes per week.</P>
      <P>On average, 30 minutes per week were spent by those in the 18-29 age group and
38 minutes per week by those aged 30 and older.</P>
      <P>In the event of unemployment, the savings of the respondents could support them
for an average of 10.2 weeks.</P>
      <P>The results show that as the global financial crisis continued, many respondents
were feeling insecure about their jobs and were pessimistic about the economic
outlook.</P>
      <P>Approximately 35 percent of respondents put aside up to 10 percent of their
monthly income in the form of savings, while 27 percent put aside over 30
percent. Only 9 percent of the respondents said they did not save money.</P>
      <P>Asked to define the meaning of financial independence, many mentioned "being
able to buy things one desires at any time" and "no need to worry about life
after retirement."</P>
      <P>However, many of the respondents said gender inequality remains in the
workplace, pointing out that female workers are generally paid less than their
male counterparts even if they hold the same position.</P>

      <P>Officials of Taiwan's leading shipbuilder, CSBC Corp., said Wednesday that
despite a contract failure with Israeli shipping company ZIM, CSBC's order books
are full until 2012.</P>
      <P>"More than 50 vessels are awaiting construction, in addition to ship repair
demands from the navy that need to be taken care of in time, " said CSBC Vice
President Wang Ko-hsuan.</P>
      <P>Confirming ZIM's cancellation of an order it had placed with CSBC for six 1,700
TEU (twenty-foot-equivalent) container ships, Wang said the cancellation  has
had no adverse impact on the company's operations.</P>
      <P>Wang disclosed that according to the contract, ZIM will pay about 10 percent of
the order -- worth roughly NT$8 billion (US$236.69 million) -- in compensation
for the cancellation.</P>
      <P>CSBC has enjoyed the most successful turnaround among all of Taiwan's state-
owned companies, with a pre-tax income of NT$2.5 billion in 2007, surpassing its
budget target by NT$31 million.</P>
      <P>CSBC's container ship orders and total container volume rank fourth in the
world.</P>
      <P>The company also unveiled a plan last December to expand its ship repair
services to meet a possible rise in repair demand following the opening of
direct shipping links with China Dec. 15, 2008.</P>

      <P>The government-planned DRAM company, Taiwan Memory Co. (TMC), will in the
initial stages focus on product design and optimizing the manufacturing process,
so as to build Taiwan's independent proficiency in developing DRAM production
technologies, said John Hsuan, the appointed chairman of the company, Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The company will take advantage of Taiwan's dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
productivity to develop design expertise, Hsuan said at a press conference in
Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, adding that the aim is to achieve these goals within
two years after the company's establishment.</P>
      <P>He noted that the profile of TMC is a company with unique expertise, dedicated
to product design and the development of the DRAM manufacturing process.</P>
      <P>Its top priority will be to find the best way to take advantage of the country's
productivity in the DRAM industry, he said. TMC's operations will not conflict
with the interests of local DRAM makers, but will serve as a platform for local
businesses  to forge cooperative links, he added.</P>
      <P>TMC will offer funds and resources in the areas of technology research and
development to affiliated companies, and will authorize or contract local DRAM
factories to carry out production, packing and testing, Hsuan said.</P>
      <P>Hsuan, honorary vice chairman of United Microelectronics Corp., was assigned by
the Ministry of Economic Affairs in early March to execute the establishment of
the DRAM company planned by the government to revitalize the local DRAM
industry.</P>
      <P>At the press conference Wednesday, he outlined the principles by which the
company will be guided. It will not compete in the area of production, will not
engage in price battles, sell sub-standard products, interfere in the market
order, or dump its products, he promised.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the outlook for the DRAM industry, Hsuan said its recovery will
not be as swift as Frank Huang, chairman of the Hsinchu-based Powerchip
Semiconductor Corp., forecast.</P>
      <P>Huang predicted a few days ago that the sector will clear all its stocks and
that demand will outstrip supply in the third quarter of the year.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is expected to receive its 1 millionth visitor for 2009 this week, with
the total visitor arrivals for the year likely to reach 4 million, Tourism
Bureau officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials predicted that the 1 millionth visitor will arrive April 3 -- two
days earlier compared with last year, when the 1 millionth visitor arrived April
5.</P>
      <P>They attributed this year's faster rate of visitor arrivals to the increasing
number of Chinese tourists visiting the country.</P>
      <P>The situation is especially encouraging,  since the global economic downturn has
hit the tourism industry hard, boosting Taiwan's confidence of achieving its
goal of receiving 4 million visitors for the whole year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Bureau statistics show that visitor arrivals totaled nearly 3.85 million in
2008, up 3.47 percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>Of these arrivals, approximately 1.78 million, or 46.17 percent, were for
pleasure, while 881,431, or 22.92 percent, were for business.</P>
      <P>The largest number of visitors from a single country -- nearly 1.09 million --
came from Japan, followed by Hong Kong and Macau, totaling 618,667.</P>
      <P>Visitors from the United States totaled 387,197, while those from China totaled

      <P>A vice chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) invited Hong Kong Chief Executive
Donald Yam-kuen Tsang Wednesday to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Eric Liluan Chu, who is also magistrate of northern Taiwan's Taoyuan County,
along with six other county officials, arrived in the former British colony
earlier that day for a brief visit aimed at promoting an aerotropolis
development project in the county built around the Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport.</P>
      <P>An aerotropolis is a new type of urban conurbation comprising aviation-intensive
businesses and related enterprises extending up to 25 km outward from major
airports.</P>
      <P>Chu expressed hope that Hong Kong investors will invest in the aviation city
project and that there will be closer cooperation between the Taiwanese airport
and the Hong Kong International Airport.</P>
      <P>Citing Chu's remarks, Chang Chi-chiang, a county government secretary, said Chu
hopes bilateral government exchanges in the fields of trade, culture and
education will also be boosted.</P>
      <P>Tsang for his part said that Taiwan and Hong Kong can work together to promote
airport cooperation in many ways.</P>
      <P>The head of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative  Region government noted that
he visited Taiwan in 1977 and expressed hope that he will be able to go there
again during his current tenure.</P>
      <P>He also invited Taoyuan County to co-host a Taiwan-Hong Kong city exchange forum

      <P>The Taichung city government in central Taiwan will sell a kind of high-end
chicken raised with organic feed made from kitchen scraps on a trial basis from
May, a city official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Li-teh,  head of the city's  Environmental  Protection Department, gave his
assurances that this pedigree of chicken will not contain any residue of
antibiotics or growth hormones and he encouraged the public to consume them.</P>
      <P>The chickens will be marketed and sold on the Internet next month after two
years of experiments with a local farm.</P>
      <P>Each chicken will be sold for NT$450 9(US$12.9) during the promotional sales
period in which a maximum of 50 chickens can be sold per month, he noted.</P>
      <P>Lee made the comments at a news conference with the Taichung City Farmers
Association Chief Chen Ching-chih to promote the new strain of free range
chickens.</P>
      <P>The kitchen scrap will be provided by the city's Environmental Protection
Department.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, this new pedigree of chickens must be reared for over six
months so as to have them develop tasty meat. Usually, ordinary chickens would
be raised at the farm for only four to five weeks before they are slaughtered
and sold in the market.</P>
      <P>The Taichung city government launched the chicken-raising project to take better

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yunlin County in south-central Taiwan is aiming to boost its tourism by opening
its local winery to public tours with effect from Friday, officials of the
central Taiwan office under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fu Lu Shou Winery in Gukeng township, which established Taiwan's first wine
museum in October 2007, will mark its 10th founding anniversary  on April 3 by
allowing visitors  to observe its wine-making process.</P>
      <P>The museum, which has fully preserved the country's traditional wine-making
process and equipment, is optimistic about attracting more tourists. It also
hopes that by integrating traditional culture and modern technology, it will
draw more business opportunities.</P>
      <P>The winery obtained an MOEA license last November to operate as a tourism
facility in Yunlin County, as did two other enterprises -- a soy sauce company
and a towel factory.</P>
      <P>Visitors to the winery will be able to gain a firsthand understanding of the
wine-making process and to sample a wide variety of liquors and wines from all
over the world.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA, the trend of promoting factories and workshops as tourist
attractions has been gaining popularity steadily since last year, despite the
economic downturn.</P>
      <P>This type of business drew more than 110,000 visitors across the country the
last year and recorded revenue of more than NT$400 million (US$11.5 million) for
the year, according to statistics compiled by the MOEA's central Taiwan office.</P>
      <P>The office forecast that the number of visitors to Gukeng township will increase
by 30 percent when the winery becomes part of the county's tourism expansion
efforts.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the MOEA, the Industrial Development Bureau made public
March 27 a list of 10 factories that qualify for MOEA assistance this year to
develop as tourism venues. They include factories that make rice noodles, shoes,
sausages and saxophones.</P>
      <P>A total of 33 factories had applied for government aid to tailor their business
to tourism.</P>

Central News Agency's "Taiwan Heroes" series of reports, saying they are models
of the society who embody the country's core value of integrity and its spirit
of entrepreneurship.</P>
      <P>It is this spirit that will enable Taiwan to overcome adversity and to regain
prosperity, Ma said at a ceremony to celebrate the CNA's 85th founding
anniversary, at its Taipei headquarters.</P>
      <P>The CNA launched the "Taiwan Heroes" series on March 8, releasing one story a
day that featured local civilians who, through willpower and perseverance, have
overcome adversity and risen to success.</P>
      <P>The president praised the reporting, saying all the stories in the series have
touched his heart because the uncelebrated heroes have not only accomplished the
impossible, but have also remained humble and diligent.</P>
      <P>These laudable qualities can serve as social model for the country, he added.</P>
      <P>The anniversary celebrations were also attended by Lai Feng-wei, deputy

      <P>The Sports Affairs Council (SAC) will inject NT$1.26 billion (US$37.28 million)
into various projects over the next four years to revitalize baseball in Taiwan,
Executive Yuan spokesman Su Jun-pin said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Su made the announcement after a special meeting chaired by Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan and at which SAC Minister Tai Hsia-ling gave a briefing on the Cabinet-
level SAC's baseball revitalization plan.</P>
      <P>According to Su, the top goals of the SAC's four-year plan include having
Taiwan's national baseball team enter the finals of Asian and world baseball
championships and capture at least a silver medal and compete in the semi-finals
of every World Baseball Classic tournament.</P>
      <P>To realize these goals, the SAC will spend NT$1.26 billion over the next four
years on various baseball development projects.</P>
      <P>Baseball has been known as Taiwan's national ball game because of its popularity
among local people. The urgency to resurrect the sport was highlighted by
Taiwan's disastrous performance in the just-concluded World Baseball Classic
2009, in which Taiwan was first crushed by South Korea 9-0 and then
embarrassingly eliminated from the tournament by China 4-1.</P>
      <P>Projects to be carried out under the four-year revival plan will include helping
Taiwan's top-tier professional baseball league -- the Chinese Professional
Baseball League -- to form a second-tier professional league and subsidizing any
organization or corporation that intends to establish adult amateur baseball
teams.</P>
      <P>The revival  plan also  calls  for the development  of a comprehensive mechanism
for the formation and training of national baseball teams at various levels.</P>
      <P>The SAC has worked out operational guidelines for the formation of more adult
teams, with the goal of establishing 10 amateur teams this year, SAC sources
said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources,  the council on Tuesday invited representatives of
city and county governments and companies that intend to start amateur teams to
discuss the technical details.</P>
      <P>The meeting was attended by representatives from Taipei City, Taipei County,
Taoyuan County, Taichung City, Kaohsiung City and Taitung County governments as
well as from Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Co., Chunghwa Telecom, Taiwan Power Co.,
China Steel Corp., and Taiwan Cooperative Bank, the sources said.</P>
      <P>In order to organize high-caliber national teams, the SAC will divide
international competitions into three tiers, with the Olympic Games, Asian Games
and World Baseball Classic at the top.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei Baseball Association will also be responsible for organizing
an ad hoc committee to deal with the formation and training of national teams
for various international tournaments.</P>
      <P>Under the four-year plan, the SAC will sponsor a baseball revival conference
every year, invite world-famous coaches to help with the training of national
teams, and organize a winter baseball league tournament in which Japanese and
South Korean professional baseball teams will be invited to compete.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the SAC plans to build a baseball village to facilitate personnel

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) decided Wednesday to nominate
DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi to run for Tainan County magistrate in December, but
a veteran DPP member vowed that he will also join the race.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen, whose last post under the former DPP government was secretary-
general of the Presidential Office, claimed that he had become a victim of
factional fighting within the DPP. He vowed that he will go the distance in the
election in defiance of factional dominance within the party.</P>
      <P>Chen, 74, has served in a series of high-level postions in his political career,
including as Tainan County magistrate and minister of foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>He expressed confidence that he would emerge as the front runner among all the
DPP candidates in the Tainan County magistrate election, and suggested that the
party leadership should have chosen the nominee by means of an opinion poll that
would have gauged who had the strongest support among the DPP members and
voters.</P>
      <P>Chen disclosed that DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen had met with him a day earlier
in an attempt to persuade him to withdraw from the race but that he flatly
refused.</P>
      <P>Asked by reporters whether that means he will run in the election even if the
party resorts to disciplinary measures against him, Chen did not give a direct
answer, but said that he will leave that kind of issue to the DPP.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) decided Wednesday to nominate
DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi to run for Tainan County magistrate in December, but
a veteran DPP member vowed that he will also join the race.</P>
      <P>Tan Sun Chen, whose last post under the former DPP government was secretary-
general of the Presidential Office, claimed that he had become a victim of
factional fighting within the DPP. He vowed that he will go the distance in the
election in defiance of factional dominance within the party.</P>
      <P>Chen, 74, has served in a series of high-level postions in his political career,
including as Tainan County magistrate and minister of foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>He expressed confidence that he would emerge as the front runner among all the
DPP candidates in the Tainan County magistrate election, and suggested that the
party leadership should have chosen the nominee by means of an opinion poll that
would have gauged who had the strongest support among the DPP members and
voters.</P>
      <P>Chen disclosed that DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen had met with him a day earlier
in an attempt to persuade him to withdraw from the race but that he flatly
refused.</P>
      <P>Asked by reporters whether that means he will run in the election even if the
party resorts to disciplinary measures against him, Chen did not give a direct
answer, but said that he will leave that kind of issue to the DPP.</P>

      <P>U.S. Deputy Assistant Trade Representative Eric Altbach is currently on a visit
in Taipei to discuss certain bilateral trade issues, a Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Altbach, who arrived in Taipei Monday, is concerned with what the U.S. calls
bilateral trade barriers, such as Taiwan's restrictions on U.S. beef imports and
its zero-residue requirements for the feed additive ractopamine, the official
said.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan only allows imports of U.S. boneless beef from cattle younger
than 30 months.</P>
      <P>In addition to explaining Taiwan's stances on those issues to Altbach, the
official said, the ministry will also convey to him Taiwan's hope that the long-

    <HEADLINE>Kinmen launches free milk program for students</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The offshore Kinmen County launched the country's first-ever free milk program
Thursday with the aim of helping parents to raise strong and healthy children.</P>
      <P>The county's education bureau chief Lee Chai-hang said the program will be
beneficial to some 7,500 students, from kindergarten to the junior high school
level.</P>
      <P>It is being implemented on an annual budget of NT$6 million (US$172,000) that
was recently approved by the Kinmen County Council, he said. The funding is
coming primarily from contributions by the county-run Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor
Inc., which is a long-term revenue earner for the outlying island, he added.</P>
      <P>Residents of Kinmen on average earn 60 percent of the income of people on Taiwan
proper, Lee noted.</P>
      <P>The 7,500 Kinmen students will initially be given free milk two days per week,
but the county hopes to expand the program to provide the children with milk
every school day, once milk production at the county's experimental  farm
increases to a certain level,  he explained.</P>
      <P>The county government has introduced similar programs in the past. In December
1999, it became the first local government in the country to launch a free lunch
program for elementary and high school students, an initiative that became a
model for other areas of Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Computex TAIPEI expecting good turnout despite economic downturn</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Computex TAIPEI 2009, one of the worlds leading information and communication
technology (ICT) procurement platforms and the largest computer show in Asia,
will remain strong in terms of scale despite the global economic downturn,
organizers said Thursday, adding that they expect to generate US$20 billion in
business, even as other major ICT fairs are shrinking.</P>
      <P>Walter Yeh, executive vice president of the non-profit trade promotion body
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) , said at a press conference
to reveal the details of this year's exhibition that Computex TAIPEI 2009
expects swarms of important buyers and exhibitors from domestic and overseas
companies, with all the booths fully booked and many others on the waiting list.</P>
      <P>TAITRA and the co-organizer Taipei Computer Association estimated that the show
will attract 35,000 international buyers and 1,700 exhibitors, which will take
up 4,600 booths to showcase their products.</P>
      <P>Noting that both the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in the United
States and CeBit in Germany have seen a drop in size and business by five
percent and 20 percent, respectively, Yeh predicted that this years Computex
TAIPEI will generate an estimated US$20 billion in business opportunities, the
same amount as last year and a satisfying one given the global economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>This figure is reasonable. But in a time like this, we better be more realistic
and conservative,Yeh said.</P>
      <P>As Computex TAIPEI is the annual ICT extravaganza that IT professionals simply
do not miss, Yeh noted that the fair is expecting participation from important
companies with annual sales exceeding US$1 billion, such as Ricoh from Japan and
Siemens from Germany.</P>
      <P>TAITRA has been working hard to invite international buyers, especially from
China and the emerging markets to participate in this years show, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>The show, scheduled for June 2-4 at the Taipei World Trade Center in Nangang and
Taipei World Trade Center in downtown Taipei, will for the first time have a
pavilion designated to some 100 Chinese companies, including big brands such as
Tsinghua Tongfang, MALATA.</P>
      <P>Yeh attributed the participation of Chinese companies to the warm cross-Taiwan
Strait relations and the launch of direct flights between Taiwan and China last
December.</P>
      <P>In addition to exhibiting the best and the latest in ICT products, 5,000
procurement match-making meetings will be arranged to connect buyers with
exhibitors, an event which Yeh said is unique in similar ICT fairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's purple crow butterfly conservation a story of progress</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/02/09  16:15:01</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA Staff Writer</P>
      <P>Bathed in spring sunshine, thousands of purple crow butterflies alight in the
woods near Pingding in south-central Taiwan to feed on nectar on a recent
Sunday, gathering strength before continuing on their long journey back to their
breeding grounds in the north.</P>
      <P>Guided  by their teachers,  young students  from the area concentrate on
recording the number of the insects passing by. At times, the teachers catch the
delicate creatures with nets and quickly tag their wings with an identifying
mark before setting them free.</P>
      <P>"The `capture and release' strategy is part of our long-term campaign to track
the species' migratory routes for educational and conservation purposes, " said
Huang Hsi-pei,  academic affairs director of Chengkung Elementary School in
Pingding village, Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>This grassroots educational drive is a welcome change from previous decades,
when the "butterfly kingdom" -- as Taiwan is known -- was a killing field for
the colorful winged creatures during their seasonal migrations.</P>
      <P>The lack of interest in conservation led to the extinction of two precious
species -- king crow and tailed cupid -- in the 1960s, but today, butterfly
preservation is a high enough priority that even Taiwan's freeway bureau has
blocked off freeway sections to prevent the purple crows from being squashed by
passing cars.</P>
      <P>Conservationists would like to see even more efforts by the government, but they
said efforts by the freeway bureau and programs such as those conducted by the
elementary school are a good start to along-term solution -- protecting the
butterflies' natural habitat and making butterfly conservation a widespread
public concern.</P>
      <P>The purple crow butterflies provide an example of how vulnerable fragile insects
are to human encroachment on their natural habitats and how a little effort by
government and society can make a big difference.</P>
      <P>"Butterflies are such delicate creatures that once you destroy the plants they
rely on, they have little chance of survival, " said Chan Chia-lung, an
entomologist-turned-conservationist who won an award in Japan in 2008 for his
long-term observation of the species.</P>
      <P>After years of extensive tracking by conservation experts and volunteers, it was
discovered that purple crow butterflies spend the winter in the island's warmer
southern region to escape the winter cold in the north.</P>
      <P>In October each year, instinct draws the butterflies to take refuge in low-lying
valleys on the two sides of the southern foothills of Taiwan's Central Mountain
Range, most notably Maolin in Kaohsiung County and Dawu in Taitung County, where
they winter until March.</P>
      <P>At the onset of spring, the butterflies begin a 400-km migration back to their
northern habitats, following a variety of routes from Maolin and Dawu until they
reach the hillside village of Pingding, where they converge in the thousands or
even millions before crossing the Chingshuei River.</P>
      <P>The butterflies then fly to different destinations in central, northern and
northeastern Taiwan, including Baguashan in Changhua County and Jhunan in Miaoli
County, where they fulfill their most important mission -- to mate and lay their
eggs.</P>
      <P>This "butterfly highway" is nearly unique in the world, with the monarch
butterfly in Mexico the only other butterfly species to migrate like birds and
winter in a particular valley, according to Chan.</P>
      <P>The migration in Taiwan offers an incredible spectacle.</P>
      <P>"The sight of hundreds of thousands of butterflies with purple wings that appear
to change color as they catch the sunlight at different angles is a thrill for
many people, " Chan said.</P>
      <P>Yet this rare migratory pattern has led to the deaths of thousands of
butterflies as motorists run into them on Taiwan's National Freeway No.3, which
lies along their migratory path.</P>
      <P>However, measures taken by the National Freeway Bureau (NFB) since three years
ago have resulted in a significant decline in the road-kill rate.</P>
      <P>According to a study by National Taiwan University entomology professor Yang
Ping-shih, butterflies killed by passing cars declined from 3 percent of the
flock in 2007 to 0.3 percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the progress, the bureau this year expanded the section of the
freeway to be closed during the migration peak period to 3 km from the previous
2 km and extended a security net to 660 meters from 460 meters to encourage the
butterflies to fly higher, avoiding the traffic.</P>
      <P>"The protective measures are very special. They can only be found in Taiwan. We
are proud to be spending a little money to offer some protection for the
butterflies and the environment, " said NFB Director-General Lee Thay-ming in a
recent interview.</P>
      <P>Butterfly populations in Taiwan, which has one of the world's highest butterfly
densities in the world,  were decimated by commercial collecting, particularly
in the 1960s, when they were sold by the kilogram to collectors.</P>
      <P>The practice of capturing large numbers of butterflies for commercial use is
rare today, because it is no longer profitable.</P>
      <P>Today, human encroachment in the form of land reclamation remains the greatest
threat to the insects.</P>
      <P>According to Chan, about 200,000 butterflies disappeared due to the construction
of a parking lot in Maolin to accommodate tourists in the 1990s. The project
destroyed part of the insects' winter home.</P>
      <P>To prevent similar problems, an area has now been marked off as a butterfly
sanctuary in the Maolin National Scenic Area. It is part of aconservation
program sponsored by the Council of Agriculture that includes the cultivation of
plants upon which the insects feed.</P>
      <P>"I hope the latest steps to provide the purple crows safer passage during their
migration, coupled with a greater public awareness of the problems they face,
can help increase butterfly populations," Chan said.</P>
      <P>Some conservation experts share his view, arguing that more must be done if
Taiwan is to keep its reputation as a "butterfly kingdom."</P>
      <P>Hsu Yu-feng, an entomology professor at National Taiwan Normal University, said
butterfly numbers provide an important indicator of the state of the
environment.</P>
      <P>Since a high of 11,500 butterflies per minute were recorded during the migration
period in 2005, the number of butterflies recorded have never been as high,
experts said.</P>
      <P>In recent years, it has ranged only around several hundreds or a few thousands
per minute, partly due to destruction of their habitats,  obstruction  in their
migration and climate change, according to the experts.</P>
      <P>"A decline  in the butterfly  population  could signal  a deterioration of our
environment, so we have to pay more attention to the environment and protection
of butterfly habitats," Hsu said.</P>

      <P>MV Xue Long (Snow Dragon), a Chinese icebreaker and polar research vessel that
arrived in southern Taiwan Wednesday, was opened Thursday to the Taiwan public
for visits.</P>
      <P>MV Xue Long, anchored at Kaohsiung Harbor's True Love Wharf, will remain open to
the Taiwan public, students and maritime researchers Thursday and Friday until
it departs for China Saturday.</P>
      <P>Up to 1,000 visitors per day will be permitted to go aboard the ship, said
officials from the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium in the
southern county of Pingtung, which is one of the organizations hosting the Xue
Long's first port call in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MV Xue Long has just concluded its latest expedition to the Antarctic, which
began last October. It is China's only polar research ship and is owned by the
Polar Research Institute of China, which operates three research stations in the
Antarctic and one in the Arctic.</P>
      <P>Wei Wenliang, a deputy director with the Polar Research Institute of China, said
the ship's call in Kaohsiung is purely academic in nature and sets the stage for
several Taiwanese scientists to join its next research expedition to the
Antarctic this October.</P>
      <P>Four Taiwanese scientists will join the expedition in what will be the first
joint cross-Taiwan Strait polar exploration.</P>
      <P>Wei said it is hoped that the expedition will serve as a starter for closer
cooperation across the Taiwan Strait in the field of polar research in the
future.</P>
      <P>Wei squashed speculations in a Taiwan media report the day before that the Xue
Long may take the opportunity while in port in Taiwan to "collect national
intelligence."</P>
      <P>He attributed this speculation to inadequate communication and understanding
between the people of the two sides, a situation that he said was the result of
decades of political impasse.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese team will focus on marine biological research and will be
comprised of experts from the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium,
National Dong Hwa University in the eastern county of Hualien and Cheng Shiu
University in the southern county of Kaohsiung, according to Wang Hsin-fa, a
spokesman for the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium.</P>
      <P>Although individual Taiwanese scientists, since the 1980s, have participated in
polar research projects organized by other countries, Taiwan's achievements in
this area remain sporadic and fragmented, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The latest cooperation venture with China is expected to be of great help to
Taiwan's polar research in light of China's rich experience and resources in
this area, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA completes ECFA evaluation: minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
04/02/09  17:53:27
(By Y. L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , which is responsible  for planning the
proposed signing of a comprehensive  trade pact with China has completed an
overall evaluation of the proposal and finalized consultations with various
local industries that were held to gain a better understanding of their needs,
according to Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming.</P>
      <P>Yiin was quoted as having made the remarks at an executive meeting of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to KMT spokesman Lee Chien-jung, Yiin outlined six stages that must be
completed  before an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China
could be put into effect -- separate assessments by each side, a joint
assessment, negotiations, the  signing  of  the  agreement,  legislative
approval  and implementation.</P>
      <P>Yiin also expressed hopes at the meeting that the first stage could be completed
in three months' time.</P>
      <P>The minister stressed that it would be best for Taiwan to sign the proposed ECFA
sooner rather than later, as China is about to enter into a free trade
arrangement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member
countries.</P>
      <P>When the ASEAN-China trade integration takes effect in 2010, tariffs on 93
percent of the products traded in the area will be removed, and Taiwan is under
pressure to avoid marginalization, Yiin was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan is excluded from the free trade region, over half of the country's
exports will be affected by high tariffs, which would lead to an exodus of local
industries, according to Yiin.</P>
      <P>For example, local petrochemical companies would be subject to tariffs of 6.5
percent on their products, while their competitors in the region would pay only
0.25 percent, he elaborated.</P>
      <P>Yiin also said that the government has come up with a "safeguard mechanism" to
protect certain local industries, such as leather, towel and footwear
manufacturers. In the initial period, Chinese goods from those sectors will not
be allowed into Taiwan, and anti-dumpling measures will also be instituted, he
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Wednesday that
the ECFA proposal is likely to be discussed in the preparatory meetings ahead of
the third round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks.</P>
      <P>The preparatory consultations for the third meeting between Taiwan's semi-
official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his
Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), are scheduled to be held in mid-
April in Taiwan, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>On the agenda of the next Chiang-Chen  meeting are joint anti-crime efforts,
regular scheduled cross-strait flights, financial cooperation, and Chinese
investment in Taiwan, Lai said.</P>
      <P>She said that the proposed ECFA will hopefully be raised during the preparatory
meeting and that if both sides are willing to negotiate on the issue, it would
be put on the agenda of the next round of Chiang-Chen talks.</P>
      <P>As internal consensus is needed before such an agreement with China could be
signed, it is still too early to negotiate with China on the proposed pact, Lai
said.</P>
      <P>The MAC chief said that as far as she knows, China is still studying the
proposal, but added that the ECFA issue will definitely be raised in the fourth
round of Chiang-Chen talks.</P>

      <P>A group of 15 Taiwanese over the age of 70 will fly from Beijing to Taiwan
Friday, the day before this year's Tomb-Sweeping Day, for a 10-day visit to
search for their roots.</P>
      <P>Lin Liyun, an adviser with the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan

      <P>All 15 people had moved to China after 1949 when Taiwan and China split into
separate rule, and most of them had been denied entry to Taiwan several times as

      <P>The future focus of the ministrys work in terms of promoting relations with
Taiwans four diplomatic allies in Africa will be on improving the lives of the
people in those nations, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Andrew Chang, director-general of MOFAs Department of African Affairs, said at a
regular press briefing that in order to raise the living standards  of the
people,  Taiwan will provide further assistance in increasing agricultural
production and upgrading the standards of medical care, and education.</P>
      <P>These areas are what Taiwan is most skilled in and by focusing on them, I
believe we will achieve a more effective result, Chang told the Central News
Agency.</P>
      <P>Despite that these areas have long been part of Taiwans foreign aid work, Chang
said the ministry decided to put emphasis on them because they are most linked
to the lives of the people.</P>
      <P>Four of Taiwans 23 diplomatic allies are located in Africa, including Burkina
Faso, Sao Tome and Principe, Swaziland and The Gambia.</P>
      <P>According  to Chang,  with  the assistance  of the Taiwan International
Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) , the foreign ministry hopes that
Taiwans agricultural technology missions in Africa will help the countrys
African allies increase agricultural production to reduce their foreign exchange
expenditures.</P>
      <P>As for medical services, instead of assembling medical missions through ICDF to
go to those countries, which is usually difficult to manage, Chang said the
ministry has decided to commission the task to big hospitals because they have
sufficient specialist doctors and more flexibility in personnel arrangement.</P>
      <P>At present, Taipei Medical University and Changhua Christian Hospital have been
designated to provide medical assistance in Swaziland and Sao Tome and Principe,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In terms of education, Chang noted that Taiwan has been active in promoting
education for girls and women in Gambia, helping the country achieve the highest
ratio of females in school compared to other African countries.</P>
      <P>Fruitful results have also been seen in the special classes provided by National
Taipei University of Technology in petroleum, civil engineering and technology,
as well as those of National Pingtung University of Science and Technology,
Chang added.</P>
      <P>He also announced at the press briefing that Taiwan and Burkina Faso will
jointly launch a seven-year cooperation project to help the African country
build up its vocational training system.</P>
      <P>Under the commission of the Burkina Faso government, Taiwans Central Training
Center will tender a bid on April 3 for the center's procurement of vocational
training machines and education facilities totaling NT$70 million (US$2.1
million), Chang said, adding that suppliers are encouraged to join the bid and
there will be 20 more bids by 2013.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Age-related hearing impairment linked to belly fat: study</HEADLINE>

04/02/09  19:22:56

    <TEXT>
      <P>Excess belly fat has for years been linked to health problems such as
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, but a recent study has found an association
with another  risk -- age-related hearing impairment (ARHI).</P>
      <P>The results  of the study released  Thursday  by a local otolaryngolosist show
that central obesity is more important than body mass index (BMI) as a risk
predictor for ARHI.</P>
      <P>The study by Hwang Juen-haur from the Buddhist Dalin Tzu Chi General Hospital in
the southern county of Chiayi was conducted in cooperation with National Taiwan
University Hospital between August 2007 and October 2008. The findings were
included in the March 2009 issue of Obesity, the official journal of the
U.S.-based Obesity Society.</P>
      <P>The study analyzed the audiometric test results, height, weight and waist
circumference of 690 patients with hearing loss within the range of -10 to 15
decibels (dB HL).</P>
      <P>The subjects included 432 women and 258 men with the same degree of permanent
hearing loss in both ears resulting from damage to the inner ear or to the nerve
pathways from the inner ear to the brain.</P>
      <P>The study found that the negative impact of visceral fat on hearing began to
emerge when the patients were around middle age, with the hearing impairment
suffered by men three times more severe than that by women, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>After adjusting for age, gender, systemic disease and other variables, it was
found the waist circumference showed a significant positive association with
hearing loss, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>When both waist circumference and BMI were taken into account, waist
circumference, but not BMI, showed a significant positive association with low-
frequency and high-frequency hearing impairment in males younger than 55, and
with high-frequency hearing impairment with borderline significance in women
older than 55, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>Hwang said women's vulnerability to hearing impairment after the age of 55 could
be related to a rapid increase in obesity and reduced estrogen levels after the
onset of menopause. Estrogen has been shown to play a protective role in the
function and plasticity of the auditory system in women, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the early development of central obesity in men may explain  the
association  of waist circumference  with hearing impairment in men younger than
55, he said.</P>
      <P>Hwang surmised that obesity may directly cause hearing loss via obesity-related
oxidative stress, which is usually caused by an imbalance between the production
of reactive oxygen and the body's ability to detoxify the reactive compounds or
easily repair the resulting damage.</P>
      <P>According to Hwang, in the interest of health, the waist circumference should
not be allowed to exceed 90 cm for men and 80 cm for women. Regular exercise is
also advisable to avoid obesity, he said.</P>
      <P>The advice applies also to tall people, who can have normal BMIs despite big
bellies, he said.</P>

      <P>Mandarin Airlines announced Thursday that it will resume daily flights between
Taipei and Kaohsiung from April 30, in response to strong demand from business
passengers.</P>
      <P>Mandarin currently operates only three two-way flights per week on Friday,
Sunday and Monday between the two largest cities in Taiwan --  a reduction which
the Taipei-based carrier implemented in September last year to trim its daily
service.</P>
      <P>Mandarin  launched  a discounted  ticket  package  on  the Taipei-Kaohsiung
route in March, offering one way tickets at NT$1,720 (US$49) each, compared to
the original price of NT$2,120. The price cut has helped Mandarin increase its
passenger load factor in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>The number of flights on the Taipei-Kaohsiung route exceeded 100 per month
during its peak years, when it was the most profitable domestic route.</P>
      <P>Air travel on Taiwan's western corridor has been hard-hit after the island's
high  speed train system went into service in January 2007.</P>
      <P>In the face of operating difficulties from the fierce competition from the
bullet train, airline companies have steadily chopped flights between Taipei and
Taichung in central Taiwan and between Taipei, Chiayi and Tainan in the south.</P>

      <P>The magistrate of the south-central county of Yunlin said Thursday that she is
seeking adoptive parents for 16 children who are awaiting adoption.</P>
      <P>Yunlin Magistrate Su Chih-fen called a news conference at County Hall to call
for help in efforts to seek adopters for the orphans, who at present are being
looked after by the county government.</P>
      <P>Su said she is glad that of the 18 children previously under the care of the
county government, two have already been adopted -- a 2-year-old boy adopted by
an American couple who left Taiwan for the United States last November and a 10
-year-old girl adopted by a couple living in Taipei City who has been living
with her adoptive parents since January.</P>
      <P>The adoptive parents of the girl, named Hsiao-yi, wrote to the county
government's Department of Social Affairs recently to say that their new
daughter is adorable, well-behaved and works particularly hard at her studies.</P>
      <P>"Hsiao-yi was ranked fifth in academic performance in her class this semester,"
the parents said in the letter.</P>
      <P>Hsiao-yi's story can serve as an example to explode an adoption myth that the

      <P>However, low vegetable and fruit consumption was reported by 63 percent of the

families seldom prepare fruit and vegetables for them.</P>
      <P>In addition, 60 percent of the respondents said their dietary patterns are

      <P>Asked to name their favorite food eaten outside the home, most children picked
instant noodles, followed by fried chicken, followed by braised food.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that a cooperation venture
involving Taiwan and Tuvalu -- one of the country's diplomatic allies in the
Pacific -- to build a fishing vessel, serves as a good example of how to create
a mutually beneficial situation among governments and the private sector.</P>
      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia told CNA that the MOFA acted as mediator for
Taiwan's Ching Fu Shipbuilding Company and the Tuvalu government when forging
the joint venture to construct the ship, which will be registered in Tuvalu but
managed by Ching Fu.</P>
      <P>He added that 49 percent of the ship's revenue will go to Ching Fu and 51
percent to Tuvalu.</P>

owned shipyard in Taiwan to build international standard cargo and multi-purpose
vessels.</P>
      <P>"Through the mediation of the Foreign Ministry, the venture not only provides
jobs in Tuvalu but also gives the fishery rights to a Taiwanese  company,

      <P>The announcement came after Ma received Arthur C. Brooks, president of the

since March despite rising demand in the runup to Tomb-Sweeping Day, which this

      <P>Fu Hsiao-wen, CAL's representative in Shanghai, made the comments to reporters
in response to questions about soaring air ticket prices on cross-strait routes
offered by Shanghai-based aviation companies with the approach of the
traditional holiday for Chinese people around the world.</P>
      <P>Fu said that CAL -- Taiwan's largest carrier -- has not increased prices on
routes between Taiwan and China because of Tomb-Sweeping Day.</P>
      <P>"We cannot imagine how Chinese airlines could charge such high prices for cross-
strait routes at this time of year, " Fu said.</P>
      <P>"CAL prices for round-trip cross-strait routes are about 2,700 renminbi

only around 3,800 renminbi."</P>
      <P>According  to Shanghai  media reports,  prices  of several Shanghai-based
Chinese aviation companies have increased sharply over the past week to over
5,800 renminbi for a round-trip cross-strait flight in early April -- more than
double the price quoted in March.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese businessmen who recently returned to Shanghai in March said
round-trip cross-strait fares on Chinese carriers were about 2,500 renminbi at
that time, but they added that they had doubled their prices for the tomb-

      <P>An offshore patrol cutter with a displacement of 628 tons was assigned Thursday
to patrol exclusively the waters around the Penghu Islands in a bid to beef up
marine resource protection and maritime law enforcement efforts in the area.</P>
      <P>Cabinet-level Coast Guard Administration (CGA) Minister Wang Ginn-wang presided
over a ceremony held at the port of Makung, the capital city of Penghu, located
about 41 km off the southwest coast of Taiwan proper, to inaugurate the
operations of patrol boat CG120 and to christen it the Penghu in a ceremony
witnessed by Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, the minister noted that due to the lack of deployment
of regular patrol boats in the Penghu area, Chinese fishing boats often intrude
into Penghu waters, particularly in waters surrounding Penghu's four major
uninhabited islets, to poach under the guise of seeking shelter from inclement
weather.</P>
      <P>The Chinese poaching has depleted fishery resources and triggered fishery
disputes in the Penghu area, he said, adding that in the past, the CGA has only
assigned patrol boats from the Southern Patrol Office based in Kaohsiung to
patrol the Penghu waters. Owing to the distances involved, interdiction efforts
have not been successful, causing the Chinese poachers to become increasingly
brazen.</P>
      <P>"The deployment of the Penghu to patrol the area will be a shot in the arm for
local fishermen," he said.</P>
      <P>The Penghu was built in 2001 and is 63.55 meters long. With a crew of 40, it can
travel at up to 30.96 knots, according to Captain Wu Chin-ho.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Wildlife reserve area to be set up at Aogu Wetlands</HEADLINE>

      <P>A 664-hectare area of the sprawling Aogu Wetlands in Dongshi township in
southern Taiwan's Chiayi County will be designated as a wildlife conservation
sancturary, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A COA advisory committee approved the proposal late last year and the Cabinet-
level  council is expected to soon make a formal announcement of the designation
of the country's 18th wildlife reserve area, the official said.</P>
      <P>The Aogu Wetlands, the largest of its kind in Taiwan, has long been known as an
ecological treasure of lagoons, sandbars, fish farms and beefwood forests.</P>
      <P>Birds in their thousands are attracted to the area, including egrets, black
drongos, Japanese whiteeyes, grey plovers, black-headed gulls, moorhens,
northern shovelers and night egrets.</P>
      <P>According to a COA survey, the Aogu Wetlands, covering a total area of more than
1,500 hectares, is home to 10 mammal species, 18 fish species, 22 crustacean
species, 17 amphibious species, 346 insect species and 221 bird species -- or
nearly half of the 450 bird species recorded in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that about 75 percent of the birds recorded in the Aogu
Wetlands are migratory species, many of which are endangered or protected, such
as black-faced spoonbills and Oriental white storks.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that the designation of the wildlife reserve sancturary will
contribute to the protection of the natural habitat of many precious wildlife
species and thus helps upgrade Taiwan's status in the world ecological
conservation community, " the COA official said.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of the sancturary, the region will become a major habitat
on Taiwan's west coast for East Asian migratory birds, the official added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said, the surrounding area of the wildlife reserve
sancturary at Aogu will be developed into a forested multi-purpose park for
education, pleasure and recreation.</P>
      <P>The COA's Forestry Bureau has planted 677 hectares of trees, including paper
bark trees at the site of the planned multi-purpose park that is scheduled to
open at the end of 2011, the official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Computex TAIPEI expecting good turnout despite economic downturn</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Computex TAIPEI 2009, one of the worlds leading information and communication
technology (ICT) procurement platforms and the largest computer show in Asia,
will remain strong in terms of scale despite the global economic downturn,
organizers said Thursday, adding that they expect to generate US$20 billion in
business, even as other major ICT fairs are shrinking.</P>
      <P>Walter Yeh, executive vice president of the non-profit trade promotion body
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) , said at a press conference
to reveal the details of this year's exhibition that Computex TAIPEI 2009
expects swarms of important buyers and exhibitors from domestic and overseas
companies, with all the booths fully booked and many others on the waiting list.</P>
      <P>TAITRA and the co-organizer Taipei Computer Association estimated that the show
will attract 35,000 international buyers and 1,700 exhibitors, which will take
up 4,600 booths to showcase their products.</P>
      <P>Noting that both the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in the United
States and CeBit in Germany have seen a drop in size and business by five
percent and 20 percent, respectively, Yeh predicted that this years Computex
TAIPEI will generate an estimated US$20 billion in business opportunities, the
same amount as last year and a satisfying one given the global economic
downturn.</P>
      <P>This figure is reasonable. But in a time like this, we better be more realistic
and conservative,Yeh said.</P>
      <P>As Computex TAIPEI is the annual ICT extravaganza that IT professionals simply
do not miss, Yeh noted that the fair is expecting participation from important
companies with annual sales exceeding US$1 billion, such as Ricoh from Japan and
Siemens from Germany.</P>
      <P>TAITRA has been working hard to invite international buyers, especially from
China and the emerging markets to participate in this years show, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>The show, scheduled for June 2-4 at the Taipei World Trade Center in Nangang and
Taipei World Trade Center in downtown Taipei, will for the first time have a
pavilion designated to some 100 Chinese companies, including big brands such as
Tsinghua Tongfang, MALATA.</P>
      <P>Yeh attributed the participation of Chinese companies to the warm cross-Taiwan
Strait relations and the launch of direct flights between Taiwan and China last
December.</P>
      <P>In addition to exhibiting the best and the latest in ICT products, 5,000
procurement match-making meetings will be arranged to connect buyers with
exhibitors, an event which Yeh said is unique in similar ICT fairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's purple crow butterfly conservation a story of progress</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/02/09  16:15:01</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA Staff Writer</P>
      <P>Bathed in spring sunshine, thousands of purple crow butterflies alight in the
woods near Pingding in south-central Taiwan to feed on nectar on a recent
Sunday, gathering strength before continuing on their long journey back to their
breeding grounds in the north.</P>
      <P>Guided  by their teachers,  young students  from the area concentrate on
recording the number of the insects passing by. At times, the teachers catch the
delicate creatures with nets and quickly tag their wings with an identifying
mark before setting them free.</P>
      <P>"The `capture and release' strategy is part of our long-term campaign to track
the species' migratory routes for educational and conservation purposes, " said
Huang Hsi-pei,  academic affairs director of Chengkung Elementary School in
Pingding village, Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>This grassroots educational drive is a welcome change from previous decades,
when the "butterfly kingdom" -- as Taiwan is known -- was a killing field for
the colorful winged creatures during their seasonal migrations.</P>
      <P>The lack of interest in conservation led to the extinction of two precious
species -- king crow and tailed cupid -- in the 1960s, but today, butterfly
preservation is a high enough priority that even Taiwan's freeway bureau has
blocked off freeway sections to prevent the purple crows from being squashed by
passing cars.</P>
      <P>Conservationists would like to see even more efforts by the government, but they
said efforts by the freeway bureau and programs such as those conducted by the
elementary school are a good start to along-term solution -- protecting the
butterflies' natural habitat and making butterfly conservation a widespread
public concern.</P>
      <P>The purple crow butterflies provide an example of how vulnerable fragile insects
are to human encroachment on their natural habitats and how a little effort by
government and society can make a big difference.</P>
      <P>"Butterflies are such delicate creatures that once you destroy the plants they
rely on, they have little chance of survival, " said Chan Chia-lung, an
entomologist-turned-conservationist who won an award in Japan in 2008 for his
long-term observation of the species.</P>
      <P>After years of extensive tracking by conservation experts and volunteers, it was
discovered that purple crow butterflies spend the winter in the island's warmer
southern region to escape the winter cold in the north.</P>
      <P>In October each year, instinct draws the butterflies to take refuge in low-lying
valleys on the two sides of the southern foothills of Taiwan's Central Mountain
Range, most notably Maolin in Kaohsiung County and Dawu in Taitung County, where
they winter until March.</P>
      <P>At the onset of spring, the butterflies begin a 400-km migration back to their
northern habitats, following a variety of routes from Maolin and Dawu until they
reach the hillside village of Pingding, where they converge in the thousands or
even millions before crossing the Chingshuei River.</P>
      <P>The butterflies then fly to different destinations in central, northern and
northeastern Taiwan, including Baguashan in Changhua County and Jhunan in Miaoli
County, where they fulfill their most important mission -- to mate and lay their
eggs.</P>
      <P>This "butterfly highway" is nearly unique in the world, with the monarch
butterfly in Mexico the only other butterfly species to migrate like birds and
winter in a particular valley, according to Chan.</P>
      <P>The migration in Taiwan offers an incredible spectacle.</P>
      <P>"The sight of hundreds of thousands of butterflies with purple wings that appear
to change color as they catch the sunlight at different angles is a thrill for
many people, " Chan said.</P>
      <P>Yet this rare migratory pattern has led to the deaths of thousands of
butterflies as motorists run into them on Taiwan's National Freeway No.3, which
lies along their migratory path.</P>
      <P>However, measures taken by the National Freeway Bureau (NFB) since three years
ago have resulted in a significant decline in the road-kill rate.</P>
      <P>According to a study by National Taiwan University entomology professor Yang
Ping-shih, butterflies killed by passing cars declined from 3 percent of the
flock in 2007 to 0.3 percent in 2008.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the progress, the bureau this year expanded the section of the
freeway to be closed during the migration peak period to 3 km from the previous
2 km and extended a security net to 660 meters from 460 meters to encourage the
butterflies to fly higher, avoiding the traffic.</P>
      <P>"The protective measures are very special. They can only be found in Taiwan. We
are proud to be spending a little money to offer some protection for the
butterflies and the environment, " said NFB Director-General Lee Thay-ming in a
recent interview.</P>
      <P>Butterfly populations in Taiwan, which has one of the world's highest butterfly
densities in the world,  were decimated by commercial collecting, particularly
in the 1960s, when they were sold by the kilogram to collectors.</P>
      <P>The practice of capturing large numbers of butterflies for commercial use is
rare today, because it is no longer profitable.</P>
      <P>Today, human encroachment in the form of land reclamation remains the greatest
threat to the insects.</P>
      <P>According to Chan, about 200,000 butterflies disappeared due to the construction
of a parking lot in Maolin to accommodate tourists in the 1990s. The project
destroyed part of the insects' winter home.</P>
      <P>To prevent similar problems, an area has now been marked off as a butterfly
sanctuary in the Maolin National Scenic Area. It is part of aconservation
program sponsored by the Council of Agriculture that includes the cultivation of
plants upon which the insects feed.</P>
      <P>"I hope the latest steps to provide the purple crows safer passage during their
migration, coupled with a greater public awareness of the problems they face,
can help increase butterfly populations," Chan said.</P>
      <P>Some conservation experts share his view, arguing that more must be done if
Taiwan is to keep its reputation as a "butterfly kingdom."</P>
      <P>Hsu Yu-feng, an entomology professor at National Taiwan Normal University, said
butterfly numbers provide an important indicator of the state of the
environment.</P>
      <P>Since a high of 11,500 butterflies per minute were recorded during the migration
period in 2005, the number of butterflies recorded have never been as high,
experts said.</P>
      <P>In recent years, it has ranged only around several hundreds or a few thousands
per minute, partly due to destruction of their habitats,  obstruction  in their
migration and climate change, according to the experts.</P>
      <P>"A decline  in the butterfly  population  could signal  a deterioration of our
environment, so we have to pay more attention to the environment and protection
of butterfly habitats," Hsu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese icebreaker research ship opens to Taiwan visitors</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>MV Xue Long (Snow Dragon), a Chinese icebreaker and polar research vessel that
arrived in southern Taiwan Wednesday, was opened Thursday to the Taiwan public
for visits.</P>
      <P>MV Xue Long, anchored at Kaohsiung Harbor's True Love Wharf, will remain open to
the Taiwan public, students and maritime researchers Thursday and Friday until
it departs for China Saturday.</P>
      <P>Up to 1,000 visitors per day will be permitted to go aboard the ship, said
officials from the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium in the
southern county of Pingtung, which is one of the organizations hosting the Xue
Long's first port call in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MV Xue Long has just concluded its latest expedition to the Antarctic, which
began last October. It is China's only polar research ship and is owned by the
Polar Research Institute of China, which operates three research stations in the
Antarctic and one in the Arctic.</P>
      <P>Wei Wenliang, a deputy director with the Polar Research Institute of China, said
the ship's call in Kaohsiung is purely academic in nature and sets the stage for
several Taiwanese scientists to join its next research expedition to the
Antarctic this October.</P>
      <P>Four Taiwanese scientists will join the expedition in what will be the first
joint cross-Taiwan Strait polar exploration.</P>
      <P>Wei said it is hoped that the expedition will serve as a starter for closer
cooperation across the Taiwan Strait in the field of polar research in the
future.</P>
      <P>Wei squashed speculations in a Taiwan media report the day before that the Xue
Long may take the opportunity while in port in Taiwan to "collect national
intelligence."</P>
      <P>He attributed this speculation to inadequate communication and understanding
between the people of the two sides, a situation that he said was the result of
decades of political impasse.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese team will focus on marine biological research and will be
comprised of experts from the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium,
National Dong Hwa University in the eastern county of Hualien and Cheng Shiu
University in the southern county of Kaohsiung, according to Wang Hsin-fa, a
spokesman for the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium.</P>
      <P>Although individual Taiwanese scientists, since the 1980s, have participated in
polar research projects organized by other countries, Taiwan's achievements in
this area remain sporadic and fragmented, Wang said.</P>
      <P>The latest cooperation venture with China is expected to be of great help to
Taiwan's polar research in light of China's rich experience and resources in
this area, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA completes ECFA evaluation: minister</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
04/02/09  17:53:27
(By Y. L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , which is responsible  for planning the
proposed signing of a comprehensive  trade pact with China has completed an
overall evaluation of the proposal and finalized consultations with various
local industries that were held to gain a better understanding of their needs,
according to Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming.</P>
      <P>Yiin was quoted as having made the remarks at an executive meeting of the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to KMT spokesman Lee Chien-jung, Yiin outlined six stages that must be
completed  before an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China
could be put into effect -- separate assessments by each side, a joint
assessment, negotiations, the  signing  of  the  agreement,  legislative
approval  and implementation.</P>
      <P>Yiin also expressed hopes at the meeting that the first stage could be completed
in three months' time.</P>
      <P>The minister stressed that it would be best for Taiwan to sign the proposed ECFA
sooner rather than later, as China is about to enter into a free trade
arrangement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member
countries.</P>
      <P>When the ASEAN-China trade integration takes effect in 2010, tariffs on 93
percent of the products traded in the area will be removed, and Taiwan is under
pressure to avoid marginalization, Yiin was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan is excluded from the free trade region, over half of the country's
exports will be affected by high tariffs, which would lead to an exodus of local
industries, according to Yiin.</P>
      <P>For example, local petrochemical companies would be subject to tariffs of 6.5
percent on their products, while their competitors in the region would pay only
0.25 percent, he elaborated.</P>
      <P>Yiin also said that the government has come up with a "safeguard mechanism" to
protect certain local industries, such as leather, towel and footwear
manufacturers. In the initial period, Chinese goods from those sectors will not
be allowed into Taiwan, and anti-dumpling measures will also be instituted, he
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Wednesday that
the ECFA proposal is likely to be discussed in the preparatory meetings ahead of
the third round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks.</P>
      <P>The preparatory consultations for the third meeting between Taiwan's semi-
official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his
Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), are scheduled to be held in mid-
April in Taiwan, according to Lai.</P>
      <P>On the agenda of the next Chiang-Chen  meeting are joint anti-crime efforts,
regular scheduled cross-strait flights, financial cooperation, and Chinese
investment in Taiwan, Lai said.</P>
      <P>She said that the proposed ECFA will hopefully be raised during the preparatory
meeting and that if both sides are willing to negotiate on the issue, it would
be put on the agenda of the next round of Chiang-Chen talks.</P>
      <P>As internal consensus is needed before such an agreement with China could be
signed, it is still too early to negotiate with China on the proposed pact, Lai
said.</P>
      <P>The MAC chief said that as far as she knows, China is still studying the
proposal, but added that the ECFA issue will definitely be raised in the fourth
round of Chiang-Chen talks.</P>

      <P>The future focus of the ministrys work in terms of promoting relations with
Taiwans four diplomatic allies in Africa will be on improving the lives of the
people in those nations, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Andrew Chang, director-general of MOFAs Department of African Affairs, said at a
regular press briefing that in order to raise the living standards  of the
people,  Taiwan will provide further assistance in increasing agricultural
production and upgrading the standards of medical care, and education.</P>
      <P>These areas are what Taiwan is most skilled in and by focusing on them, I
believe we will achieve a more effective result, Chang told the Central News
Agency.</P>
      <P>Despite that these areas have long been part of Taiwans foreign aid work, Chang
said the ministry decided to put emphasis on them because they are most linked
to the lives of the people.</P>
      <P>Four of Taiwans 23 diplomatic allies are located in Africa, including Burkina
Faso, Sao Tome and Principe, Swaziland and The Gambia.</P>
      <P>According  to Chang,  with  the assistance  of the Taiwan International
Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) , the foreign ministry hopes that
Taiwans agricultural technology missions in Africa will help the countrys
African allies increase agricultural production to reduce their foreign exchange
expenditures.</P>
      <P>As for medical services, instead of assembling medical missions through ICDF to
go to those countries, which is usually difficult to manage, Chang said the
ministry has decided to commission the task to big hospitals because they have
sufficient specialist doctors and more flexibility in personnel arrangement.</P>
      <P>At present, Taipei Medical University and Changhua Christian Hospital have been
designated to provide medical assistance in Swaziland and Sao Tome and Principe,
respectively.</P>
      <P>In terms of education, Chang noted that Taiwan has been active in promoting
education for girls and women in Gambia, helping the country achieve the highest
ratio of females in school compared to other African countries.</P>
      <P>Fruitful results have also been seen in the special classes provided by National
Taipei University of Technology in petroleum, civil engineering and technology,
as well as those of National Pingtung University of Science and Technology,
Chang added.</P>
      <P>He also announced at the press briefing that Taiwan and Burkina Faso will
jointly launch a seven-year cooperation project to help the African country
build up its vocational training system.</P>
      <P>Under the commission of the Burkina Faso government, Taiwans Central Training
Center will tender a bid on April 3 for the center's procurement of vocational
training machines and education facilities totaling NT$70 million (US$2.1
million), Chang said, adding that suppliers are encouraged to join the bid and
there will be 20 more bids by 2013.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Age-related hearing impairment linked to belly fat: study</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Excess belly fat has for years been linked to health problems such as
cardiovascular disease and diabetes, but a recent study has found an association
with another  risk -- age-related hearing impairment (ARHI).</P>
      <P>The results  of the study released  Thursday  by a local otolaryngolosist show
that central obesity is more important than body mass index (BMI) as a risk
predictor for ARHI.</P>
      <P>The study by Hwang Juen-haur from the Buddhist Dalin Tzu Chi General Hospital in
the southern county of Chiayi was conducted in cooperation with National Taiwan
University Hospital between August 2007 and October 2008. The findings were
included in the March 2009 issue of Obesity, the official journal of the
U.S.-based Obesity Society.</P>
      <P>The study analyzed the audiometric test results, height, weight and waist
circumference of 690 patients with hearing loss within the range of -10 to 15
decibels (dB HL).</P>
      <P>The subjects included 432 women and 258 men with the same degree of permanent
hearing loss in both ears resulting from damage to the inner ear or to the nerve
pathways from the inner ear to the brain.</P>
      <P>The study found that the negative impact of visceral fat on hearing began to
emerge when the patients were around middle age, with the hearing impairment
suffered by men three times more severe than that by women, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>After adjusting for age, gender, systemic disease and other variables, it was
found the waist circumference showed a significant positive association with
hearing loss, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>When both waist circumference and BMI were taken into account, waist
circumference, but not BMI, showed a significant positive association with low-
frequency and high-frequency hearing impairment in males younger than 55, and
with high-frequency hearing impairment with borderline significance in women
older than 55, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>Hwang said women's vulnerability to hearing impairment after the age of 55 could
be related to a rapid increase in obesity and reduced estrogen levels after the
onset of menopause. Estrogen has been shown to play a protective role in the
function and plasticity of the auditory system in women, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the early development of central obesity in men may explain  the
association  of waist circumference  with hearing impairment in men younger than
55, he said.</P>
      <P>Hwang surmised that obesity may directly cause hearing loss via obesity-related
oxidative stress, which is usually caused by an imbalance between the production
of reactive oxygen and the body's ability to detoxify the reactive compounds or
easily repair the resulting damage.</P>
      <P>According to Hwang, in the interest of health, the waist circumference should
not be allowed to exceed 90 cm for men and 80 cm for women. Regular exercise is
also advisable to avoid obesity, he said.</P>
      <P>The advice applies also to tall people, who can have normal BMIs despite big
bellies, he said.</P>

      <P>Mandarin Airlines announced Thursday that it will resume daily flights between
Taipei and Kaohsiung from April 30, in response to strong demand from business
passengers.</P>
      <P>Mandarin currently operates only three two-way flights per week on Friday,
Sunday and Monday between the two largest cities in Taiwan --  a reduction which
the Taipei-based carrier implemented in September last year to trim its daily
service.</P>
      <P>Mandarin  launched  a discounted  ticket  package  on  the Taipei-Kaohsiung
route in March, offering one way tickets at NT$1,720 (US$49) each, compared to
the original price of NT$2,120. The price cut has helped Mandarin increase its
passenger load factor in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>The number of flights on the Taipei-Kaohsiung route exceeded 100 per month
during its peak years, when it was the most profitable domestic route.</P>
      <P>Air travel on Taiwan's western corridor has been hard-hit after the island's
high  speed train system went into service in January 2007.</P>
      <P>In the face of operating difficulties from the fierce competition from the
bullet train, airline companies have steadily chopped flights between Taipei and
Taichung in central Taiwan and between Taipei, Chiayi and Tainan in the south.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The magistrate of the south-central county of Yunlin said Thursday that she is
seeking adoptive parents for 16 children who are awaiting adoption.</P>
      <P>Yunlin Magistrate Su Chih-fen called a news conference at County Hall to call
for help in efforts to seek adopters for the orphans, who at present are being
looked after by the county government.</P>
      <P>Su said she is glad that of the 18 children previously under the care of the
county government, two have already been adopted -- a 2-year-old boy adopted by
an American couple who left Taiwan for the United States last November and a 10
-year-old girl adopted by a couple living in Taipei City who has been living
with her adoptive parents since January.</P>
      <P>The adoptive parents of the girl, named Hsiao-yi, wrote to the county
government's Department of Social Affairs recently to say that their new
daughter is adorable, well-behaved and works particularly hard at her studies.</P>
      <P>"Hsiao-yi was ranked fifth in academic performance in her class this semester,"
the parents said in the letter.</P>
      <P>Hsiao-yi's story can serve as an example to explode an adoption myth that the
older the adopted children are, the more difficult the bonding process can be,
for both the adopters and the adopted, Su said.</P>

      <P>Parents play an important role in shaping their children's dietary habits and
should assume the greatest responsibility for the low vegetable and fruit
consumption among children, according to the results of a survey released
Thursday by the Formosa Cancer Foundation.</P>
      <P>The survey results reveal that 73 percent of the children who responded to the
survey like fruit and vegetables.</P>
      <P>However, low vegetable and fruit consumption was reported by 63 percent of the
respondents, either because they often eat outside the home or because their
families seldom prepare fruit and vegetables for them.</P>
      <P>In addition, 60 percent of the respondents said their dietary patterns are
related to those of their parents.</P>
      <P>Asked to name their favorite food eaten outside the home, most children picked
instant noodles, followed by fried chicken, followed by braised food.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 49 percent of the parents who responded to the survey said they often
cook grilled or fried food, with 25 percent saying they provide the same food to
their children.</P>
      <P>Forty-eight percent of the adult respondents said they do not like fruit and
vegetables, compared with 38 percent who said they enjoy them.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted online March 4-27 by the foundation in cooperation with

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that a cooperation venture
involving Taiwan and Tuvalu -- one of the country's diplomatic allies in the
Pacific -- to build a fishing vessel, serves as a good example of how to create
a mutually beneficial situation among governments and the private sector.</P>
      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia told CNA that the MOFA acted as mediator for
Taiwan's Ching Fu Shipbuilding Company and the Tuvalu government when forging
the joint venture to construct the ship, which will be registered in Tuvalu but
managed by Ching Fu.</P>
      <P>He added that 49 percent of the ship's revenue will go to Ching Fu and 51
percent to Tuvalu.</P>
      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew and Tuvalu Prime Minister Apisai Ielemia will attend
a launch ceremony for the ship April 3 in the southern port city of Kaohsiung,
according to Hsia.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung-based Ching Fu is not only the largest but also the first privately
owned shipyard in Taiwan to build international standard cargo and multi-purpose
vessels.</P>
      <P>"Through the mediation of the Foreign Ministry, the venture not only provides
jobs in Tuvalu but also gives the fishery rights to a Taiwanese  company,
creating a win-win-win  situation for the governments of both sides and the
private sector," Hsia said.</P>
      <P>He added that the MOFA would like to do more in terms of brokering similar
cooperation agreements between Taiwan and its 23 diplomatic allies.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will hold a video conference with U.S. think tanks in
late April at the Presidential Office to mark the 30th anniversary of the Taiwan
Relations Act (TRA), Presidential Office spokesman Wang Yu-chi said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The announcement came after Ma received Arthur C. Brooks, president of the
American Enterprise Institute (AEI) for Public Policy Research a few days ago
and expressed the hope that the AEI will hold activities to discuss issues
related to the act as it is a key element of U.S. policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This will be the first overseas video conference Ma will have held since he took
office on May 20, 2008. Scholars from various think tanks are expected to
participate in the conference, according to Wang.</P>
      <P>Refusing to confirm reports that Ma will officially respond to the six
principles and proposals outlined recently by Chinese President Hu Jintao
regarding engagements across the Taiwan Strait, Wang said that details of the
meeting have yet to be finalized.</P>
      <P>Wang noted the significance of holding such a forum as the TRA has been
instrumental in maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait and maintaining
regional peace.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Congress passed the TRA in 1979 after Washington established diplomatic
relations with Beijing and severed formal diplomatic ties with Taipei.</P>
      <P>The act requires the U.S. to guarantee defensive arms sales to Taiwan and to
maintain U.S. capacity to resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion
that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An executive  in Shanghai  with Taipei-based China Airlines (CAL) said Thursday
that the carrier's fares on cross-Taiwan Strait routes have remained stable
since March despite rising demand in the runup to Tomb-Sweeping Day, which this
year falls on April 4.</P>
      <P>Fu Hsiao-wen, CAL's representative in Shanghai, made the comments to reporters
in response to questions about soaring air ticket prices on cross-strait routes
offered by Shanghai-based aviation companies with the approach of the
traditional holiday for Chinese people around the world.</P>
      <P>Fu said that CAL -- Taiwan's largest carrier -- has not increased prices on
routes between Taiwan and China because of Tomb-Sweeping Day.</P>
      <P>"We cannot imagine how Chinese airlines could charge such high prices for cross-
strait routes at this time of year, " Fu said.</P>
      <P>"CAL prices for round-trip cross-strait routes are about 2,700 renminbi
(US$395), " Fu went on. "Even prices for tickets with a three-month validity are
only around 3,800 renminbi."</P>
      <P>According  to Shanghai  media reports,  prices  of several Shanghai-based
Chinese aviation companies have increased sharply over the past week to over
5,800 renminbi for a round-trip cross-strait flight in early April -- more than
double the price quoted in March.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwanese businessmen who recently returned to Shanghai in March said
round-trip cross-strait fares on Chinese carriers were about 2,500 renminbi at
that time, but they added that they had doubled their prices for the tomb-
sweeping festival.</P>

      <P>An offshore patrol cutter with a displacement of 628 tons was assigned Thursday
to patrol exclusively the waters around the Penghu Islands in a bid to beef up
marine resource protection and maritime law enforcement efforts in the area.</P>
      <P>Cabinet-level Coast Guard Administration (CGA) Minister Wang Ginn-wang presided
over a ceremony held at the port of Makung, the capital city of Penghu, located
about 41 km off the southwest coast of Taiwan proper, to inaugurate the
operations of patrol boat CG120 and to christen it the Penghu in a ceremony
witnessed by Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, the minister noted that due to the lack of deployment
of regular patrol boats in the Penghu area, Chinese fishing boats often intrude
into Penghu waters, particularly in waters surrounding Penghu's four major
uninhabited islets, to poach under the guise of seeking shelter from inclement
weather.</P>
      <P>The Chinese poaching has depleted fishery resources and triggered fishery
disputes in the Penghu area, he said, adding that in the past, the CGA has only
assigned patrol boats from the Southern Patrol Office based in Kaohsiung to
patrol the Penghu waters. Owing to the distances involved, interdiction efforts
have not been successful, causing the Chinese poachers to become increasingly
brazen.</P>
      <P>"The deployment of the Penghu to patrol the area will be a shot in the arm for
local fishermen," he said.</P>
      <P>The Penghu was built in 2001 and is 63.55 meters long. With a crew of 40, it can
travel at up to 30.96 knots, according to Captain Wu Chin-ho.</P>

      <P>A 664-hectare area of the sprawling Aogu Wetlands in Dongshi township in
southern Taiwan's Chiayi County will be designated as a wildlife conservation
sancturary, a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>A COA advisory committee approved the proposal late last year and the Cabinet-
level  council is expected to soon make a formal announcement of the designation
of the country's 18th wildlife reserve area, the official said.</P>
      <P>The Aogu Wetlands, the largest of its kind in Taiwan, has long been known as an
ecological treasure of lagoons, sandbars, fish farms and beefwood forests.</P>
      <P>Birds in their thousands are attracted to the area, including egrets, black
drongos, Japanese whiteeyes, grey plovers, black-headed gulls, moorhens,
northern shovelers and night egrets.</P>
      <P>According to a COA survey, the Aogu Wetlands, covering a total area of more than
1,500 hectares, is home to 10 mammal species, 18 fish species, 22 crustacean
species, 17 amphibious species, 346 insect species and 221 bird species -- or
nearly half of the 450 bird species recorded in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that about 75 percent of the birds recorded in the Aogu
Wetlands are migratory species, many of which are endangered or protected, such
as black-faced spoonbills and Oriental white storks.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that the designation of the wildlife reserve sancturary will
contribute to the protection of the natural habitat of many precious wildlife
species and thus helps upgrade Taiwan's status in the world ecological
conservation community, " the COA official said.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of the sancturary, the region will become a major habitat
on Taiwan's west coast for East Asian migratory birds, the official added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said, the surrounding area of the wildlife reserve
sancturary at Aogu will be developed into a forested multi-purpose park for
education, pleasure and recreation.</P>
      <P>The COA's Forestry Bureau has planted 677 hectares of trees, including paper
bark trees at the site of the planned multi-purpose park that is scheduled to
open at the end of 2011, the official said.</P>

      <P>According to a COA survey, the Aogu Wetlands, covering a total area of more than
1,500 hectares, is home to 10 mammal species, 18 fish species, 22 crustacean
species, 17 amphibious species, 346 insect species and 221 bird species -- or
nearly half of the 450 bird species recorded in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The survey also shows that about 75 percent of the birds recorded in the Aogu
Wetlands are migratory species, many of which are endangered or protected, such
as black-faced spoonbills and Oriental white storks.</P>
      <P>"We are hopeful that the designation of the wildlife reserve sancturary will
contribute to the protection of the natural habitat of many precious wildlife
species and thus helps upgrade Taiwan's status in the world ecological
conservation community, " the COA official said.</P>
      <P>With the establishment of the sancturary, the region will become a major habitat
on Taiwan's west coast for East Asian migratory birds, the official added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said, the surrounding area of the wildlife reserve
sancturary at Aogu will be developed into a forested multi-purpose park for
education, pleasure and recreation.</P>
      <P>The COA's Forestry Bureau has planted 677 hectares of trees, including paper
bark trees at the site of the planned multi-purpose park that is scheduled to
open at the end of 2011, the official said.</P>

      <P>The skipper of a Taiwanese sport fishing boat involving in a collision with a
Japanese Coast Guard (JCG) vessel near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands last year
expressed gratitude Friday to the Taipei county government for offering
assistance in seeking compensation from Japan, which has finally been
forthcoming.</P>
      <P>"There is such a mix of feelings after being through all the difficulties in
seeking compensation from the Japanese government. Because of the Taipei county
government and Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei, however, the incident has had a perfect
ending," said Ho Hung-yi, skipper of the Lienho, at a thank-you party held by
the Rueifang Fishermen's Association.</P>
      <P>"They have stood with us all this time, fighting for the dignity and rights we
deserve," he added.</P>
      <P>The boat, which was carrying three crew and 13 sport fishermen at the time, sank
some six nautical miles southwest of the Tiaoyutais June 10, 2008 after being
hit by a Japanese coast guard patrol vessel, spurring tension between Taiwan and
Japan over the long disputed uninhabited islands, over which both countries, as
well as China, claim sovereignty.</P>
      <P>After several months of intense negotiations, the JCG finally agreed to pay
NT$10.5 million (US$312,500) in compensation, and the money was remitted
recently to Ho, the crewmen and the fishermen involved in the incident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan invites Singapore's participation in aerotropolis project</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taoyuan Magistrate Eric Liluan Chu hosted an introductory conference in
Singapore Thursday as part of Taiwan's efforts to encourage international
participation in its Taoyuan aerotropolis project.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwanese officials, Singapore has shown great interest in the
project and is one of the bidders for the contract to produce a blueprint for
the project.</P>
      <P>Singapore has also expressed its intention to bid for the construction of
related facilities, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The plan to develop the area surrounding the Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport into an aerotropolis is one of the 12 i-Taiwan projects, a centerpiece
of the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Chu said during  the conference  that the Taiwan  Taoyuan International
Airport's pivotal position in East Asia makes it a perfect choice for an
aerotropolis, pointing out that it takes only an average of 2.5 hours to fly
from Taoyuan to Beijing, Shanghai, Seoul, Tokyo or Manila.</P>
      <P>In addition to government investment  worth NT$400 billion (US$11.99 billion) ,
Taiwan is seeking to draw foreign investment worth NT$1 trillion to pay for the
project, which is set to be completed in 2020, Chu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also working to ease investment restrictions for Chinese businesses so
as to facilitate their participation in the project, he went on.</P>
      <P>According to Chu, besides Singapore, businesses from the United States, Europe,
Australia and Hong Kong have also expressed interest in taking part in the
project.</P>
      <P>He predicted that after the completion of the aerotropolis project, passenger
and cargo traffic volume at the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport will at
least double.</P>
      <P>With the existence of important airports in surrounding areas, including
Singapore, Hong Kong and Shanghai, each of which have their respective
functions, the Taoyuan airport will complement, rather than replace, these
airports, he said.</P>
      <P>In planning the Taoyuan aerotropolis, Taiwan will refer to the successful
experience of other airports, such as the management system adopted by
Singapore's Changi Airport and the residential area surrounding the Hong Kong
International Airport in Chek Lap Kok, he continued.</P>
      <P>Equally valuable to Taiwan are the creative design of Amsterdam' Schiphol
Airport in the Netherlands, which includes a casino and shopping mall, as well
as the Incheon International Airport in South Korea, where there is a free trade
zone, Chu said.</P>
      <P>Singapore is the second leg of Chu's foreign tour to promote the aerotropolis
project, which has already taken him to Hong Kong. He is scheduled to return to
Taiwan Saturday.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the ever-increasing popularity of fresh-brewed coffee, now one of the most
popular drinks in Taiwan, chain coffee shops and convenience stores that sell
fresh-brewed coffee have been urged to provide labeling for their products to
denote caffeine content.</P>
      <P>The Consumer Production Commission (CPC) under the Executive Yuan has recently
renewed a call for convenience stores to follow a voluntary labeling system that
nationwide coffee stores have adopted since August 2006 after they agreed with
the CPC's proposal of use the colors red, yellow and green to denote different
levels of caffeine content.</P>
      <P>CPC official Liu Ching-fang explained Friday that the three-color system was
formed based on research by the EU Scientific Committee on Food, which suggests
that caffeine consumption of under 300 mg per day will not be harmful to the
health.</P>
      <P>Under the system, the green label marks a caffeine content of under 100 mg,
while yellow represents a content of between 100 mg and 200 mg, and red signals
more than 200 mg of caffeine, Liu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu, who is president of the World Games 2009 Kaohsiung
Organizing Committee (KOC) , called for the administration Friday to negotiate
with the International World Games Association (IWGA) to allow President Ma
Ying-jeou to preside over the July 16 opening of the games.</P>
      <P>Noting that she has already invited Ma to announce the opening of the Kaohsiung
World Games, Chen said it is the responsibility of every Taiwanese citizen to
defend the nation's dignity, regardless of his or her political persuasion. Chen
belongs to the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, while Ma is a ruling
Kuomintang member.</P>
      <P>Calling on the IWGA to respect the will of the host country, Chen stressed her
strong desire to have Ma preside over the opening of the games, the biggest
sports event ever to take place in Taiwan and probably her biggest challenge
since she took office two years ago.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government will write to the Sports Affairs Council to ask
the top agency in charge of sports affairs to consider how Ma should attend the
opening ceremony to benefit the nation to the greatest possible extent, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after the KOC received an e-mailed letter from the IWGA
Thursday urging the organizer to follow the IWGA "practice" of not having the
head of state announce the opening of the games.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ming-chun, director of the Kaohsiung City Department of Information,
confirmed that day that the KOC received a letter dated April 1 from IWGA
President Ron Froehlich saying that no head of state of any country has
announced the opening of the World Games over its last seven incarnations.</P>
      <P>The letter points out that all seven previous games were opened by the IWGA
president or his proxy, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>The letter also suggests that after announcing the opening of the 2009 Kaohsiung
World Games, the IWGA president or his proxy can present Ma as a special guest
to give the games his blessing, allowing the president to receive the greatest
possible welcome and respect, Hsu went on.</P>
      <P>According to the published rules of the World Games, the head of the state of
the host country may be invited by the president of the IWGA to declare the
games event open as a guest of honor.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung  city government  has had a new spectacular 45,000-capacity main
stadium with a solar-paneled roof built for the games slated for July 16-26.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1981, the IWGA is a non-government international organization
constituted under Swiss law. Made up of International Sports Federations, the
IWGA administers the World Games, which aspires to equal and exceed the
importance of world championships organized by each federation individually.</P>

      <P>Reproductions of the National Palace Museum's famous Jadeite Cabbage with
Insects, sold as souvenirs by the museum, have been put back on museum store
shelves after being relabeled to "better reflect the truth," an NPM official
said Friday.</P>
      <P>NPM Deputy Director Feng Ming-chu said four types of souvenirs featuring the
popular cabbage design have now been given a "Designed in Taiwan" label to go
along with the original "Made in China" marking on the product's packaging.</P>
      <P>The NPM removed the souvenirs from shelves to have them relabeled after
lawmakers protested that the "Made in China" label on the most prized souvenirs
among Chinese tourists was not only ironic but harmed Taiwan's image.</P>
      <P>"The new label better reflects the actual production process of the souvenir
items," Feng said.</P>
      <P>According to Feng, the museum sells more than 2,000 types of souvenirs or
reproductions of its collection, of which 81 are related to the famous jade
carving from the Qing Dynasty.</P>
      <P>All 81 souvenirs related to the cabbage carving were designed in Taiwan, but
four were manufactured in China and have been relabeled, she said.</P>
      <P>Feng said the museum appreciated the timely "reminder" from lawmakers and the
local media that it should review its procurement policy.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of the legislature's  Transportation Committee April 1,
ruling Kuomintang Legislator Chiang Lien-fu said it was ironic and pathetic that
the reproductions bought in such large volumes by Chinese tourists turned out to
be made in China.</P>
      <P>Fellow KMT lawmaker Chu Fong-chi characterized it as "shameful" that products
sold at Taiwan's flagship museum were made in China.</P>
      <P>Janice Lai, director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications, said at the time that the practice is not
uncommon, as bureau officials also found China-made woodcarvings on sale in
shops in Sanyi, Miaoli County -- Taiwan's center for wooden handicrafts and
artistic products.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan on Friday approved a new program of airfare subsidies for
residents of remote Taiwan-held islands that will reduce their cost of air
travel to Taiwan proper by up to 40 percent when they take effect Sunday.</P>
      <P>The new measure will benefit residents living on Green Island and Orchid Island
off Taiwan's southeastern coast, Nangan Island and Beigan Island in the Matsu
island group, and Chimei Island and Wanan Island in Penghu County, the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA) under the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications said.</P>
      <P>The individuals who will be helped by the updated subsidy plan will take an
estimated 51,500 flights between the islands and Taiwan proper annually.</P>
      <P>Under the program, residents of Kinmen and Penghu counties will have 20 percent
of the cost of air travel between Taiwan and their home islands subsidized, as
was the case previously.</P>
      <P>But residents living on Nangan and Beigan will receive subsidies of 30 percent
of their airfares and those living in Chimei, Wanan, Green and Orchid islands
will have 40 percent of their air travel costs to Taiwan covered by the program.</P>
      <P>Subsidies for the program are expected to total NT$292 million (US$8.71 million)
this year, NT$23.3 million higher than the 2008 level.</P>
      <P>The measure can be retroactively applied to the period between Jan. 25 and April
4 -- one day before it formally takes effect.</P>
      <P>CAA Director-General Lee Long-wen said March 19 that residents of smaller
islands will receive higher subsidies because the small airplanes used to fly
between their islands and Taiwan proper are more easily affected by weather
conditions, unlike the larger aircraft used to fly the Kinmen-Taiwan and Penghu-
Taiwan routes.</P>

      <P>A program to allow young people from Taiwan and Japan to work while traveling in
each other's country will be officially launched on June, 1, after the two
countries completed an agreement Friday, according the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA), adding that the program will foster closer ties between the two
sides.</P>
      <P>We hope that this program will further strengthen exchanges between young adults
of Taiwan and Japan, as well as bolster substantial bilateral relations,said
MOFA spokesman Henry Chen at a news conference.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has designated 2009 as the year to boost relations with Japan, the
working holiday agreement is part of efforts to foster closer cooperation and
exchanges between the two countries, Chen added.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Japan is the third country to sign a working holiday
agreement with Taiwan, which signed similar pacts with Australia and New Zealand
in 2004.</P>
      <P>Hsu Juei-hu, deputy secretary-general of the MOFAs Association for East Asian
Relations, said at the news conference that starting June 1, young Taiwanese and
Japanese nationals aged 18-30 can apply to the Taipei-based Interchange
Association for a working holiday visa to work on a short-term basis while
visiting the others country. The visas are valid for one year.</P>
      <P>Individuals can only join the program once in their life, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Japan at present has similar programs with 10 countries and is expected to sign
one with Hong Kong this year, Hsu said. He added that the agreement between
Taiwan and Japan is the same as the others.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan would each offer 2,000 openings in the first year of the
program and will increase the number in the coming years depending on the
popularity of the program, Hsu said. The slots of a similar program between
Japan and South Korea have been increased from 1,000 in 2000 to 7,200 in 2009,
and is expected to be raised to 10,000 by 2012, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsu expressed confidence in the program, saying that it will gain enormous
popularity among young adults, given that the Interchange Association has been
receiving 15-20 inquiries a day since the proposal was disclosed.</P>
      <P>Applicants would not be required to speak the other countrys language, Hsu said,
adding that details involving financial proof and job hunting will be hammered
out in upcoming negotiations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Japan have maintained close relations in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties. The Japanese government granted visa-free entry to Taiwanese
citizens in 2007, and the two sides that year also began recognizing each others
drivers licenses.</P>
      <P>Frequent exchanges between people from the two countries can also be seen, with
an average 2.5 million citizens traveling between the two countries each year.</P>

      <P>The number of Chinese visitors on group tours coming from Beijing to Taiwan
increased by 53 percent in March compared to February, according to a report by
the mainland-based semi-official China News Service.</P>
      <P>Judging from recent tallies, the report said, it is apparent that the daily
tourist departures from China for Taiwan in March had exceeded 1,000 on average,
while the number of Chinese tourists using the "mini links" has been on a steady
rise.</P>
      <P>The mini links refer to direct ferry service between Taiwan's outlying Kinmen
and Matsu islands and China's Xiamen, Mawei and Quanzhou ports in Fujian
Province.</P>
      <P>The report said the number of Chinese tourists to Taiwan is expected to increase
markedly because beginning in December last year, Chinese people from 25 cities
and provinces, compared to 13 cities and provinces previously, are allowed to
sight-see in Taiwan, while the number of travel agencies authorized to organize
tours to Taiwan also rose to 146, from 33.</P>
      <P>The newly added 113 travel agencies have already started arranging tours to
Taiwan from late March, it said.</P>
      <P>As travel costs to Taiwan have been brought down after a larger number of tour
agencies began operating in the market, it will further boost Chinese tourist
numbers to Taiwan, the report added.</P>
      <P>According to the report, over the past six month, no Chinese tourists have filed
complaints about their trips to Taiwan. It cited a survey made by Taiwanese
authorities as reporting that 86 percent of Chinese visitors were satisfied with
their tours to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China adopted measures to boost cross-Taiwan Strait tourism and
launched regular direct flights in July last year, with the transportation links
expanded in December.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's share prices rose for the fourth consecutive day Friday amid optimism
that the United States economy is stabilizing, sending the market's benchmark
index past the 5,500-point mark for the first time since early October.</P>
      <P>Led by financial shares, the Taiex advanced 55.85 points, or 1.02 percent, to
close at 5,529.63 on turnover of NT$161.96 billion (US$4.85 billion), the
highest turnover this year.</P>
      <P>The local bourse opened at 5,541.34 and fluctuated between 5,567.15 and
5,482.18, buoyed by a US$1.1 trillion deal to revive the global economy reached
at the G20 summit in London and the European Central Bank's decision to cut
interest rates.</P>
      <P>A total of 8.53 billion shares changed hands.</P>
      <P>Six of eight major stock categories gained ground, with banking and financial
shares surging the most at 4.1 percent, buoyed by the appreciation of the Taiwan
dollar against the U.S. greenback.</P>
      <P>Cement stocks rose 3.8 percent, foodstuff shares moved up 3.4 percent,
construction stocks advanced 3.3 percent, textile stocks increased 1.1 percent,
paper and pulp issues rose 1.0 percent, and machinery and electronics shares
moved up 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>Only paper and pulp issues, which fell 1.0 percent, and plastics and chemicals
shares, which shed 0.3 percent, lost ground.</P>
      <P>Gainers outnumbered losers 1,320 to 699,  with 159 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth NT$4.78 billion.</P>
      <P>Analysts said gains in financial shares may be sustained until a long-
anticipated financial supervision agreement is signed between Taiwan and China
before the middle of the year.</P>
      <P>They also believed that despite the possibility of selling pressure in the short
term, the Taiex could challenge the 6,000 threshold in the near future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A "sunshine bill" that makes it a crime for government officials to hold
unexplained wealth was passed into law Friday, a measure authorities hope will
curb corruption in the public sector and combat money laundering.</P>
      <P>The amendment to the Punishment of Corruption Act, passed by the Legislative
Yuan with bipartisan support, stipulates that public functionaries suspected of
corruption will face jail terms of up to three years if they cannot account for
assets in their possession.</P>
      <P>Under the revision, prosecutors can require suspected officials to explain the
sources of their wealth if the value of the assets held by them or their
families rises in any of the three years after prosecutors discover
irregularities by more than the income reported in their tax returns for the
most recent fiscal year.</P>
      <P>The law also stipulates that any sum that cannot be justified by a public
official under investigation will be confiscated by the government.</P>
      <P>Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng said the law will not be applied retroactively.</P>
      <P>The passage last year of an amendment to the Public Functionary Assets
Disclosure Law, which added 9,000 senior officials and public functionaries to
the list of the country's civil servants required to report their assets, means
that more public officials will be subject to the new unexplained wealth clause.</P>
      <P>Before the amendment was enacted, only 1,800 senior public functionaries were
subject to the reporting requirement, according to the Control Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan eighth largest recipient of Australian working holiday visas</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is now the eighth largest recipient of working holiday visas issued by
the Australian government, an indication that the holiday option is growing
increasingly popular among Taiwanese citizens.</P>
      <P>During the 2007-2008 fiscal year that ended June 30, Australia issued a total of
154,148 working holiday visas worldwide, 6,132 of which were issued to Taiwanese
applicants, according to statistics from the Australian Visa Services under the
Australian Commerce and Industry Office released Friday.</P>
      <P>With the number of working holiday visas granted to Taiwan so far this year 2.7
times more than the number issued in the previous year, Australia's
representative office in Taiwan predicted that the total number would exceed
10,000 for the 2008-2009 fiscal year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan joined Australia's working holiday program in 2004 and is now one of 18
participants in the program that also includes the United Kingdom, Canada, the
Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Italy, France, Japan,
Malta, South Korea, Hong Kong, Germany, Belgium and Estonia.</P>
      <P>Only those aged 18-30 are eligible to apply for the special visa that allows the
holders to stay up to 12 months in Australia, during which they can undertake
incidental employment.</P>
      <P>The best known Taiwanese holder of the Australian working holiday visa may be
Clare Wang, the Taiwanese woman who earned a wild card into the final round of
the competition for what is being advertised as "the best job in the world" --
caretaker of a group of islands on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The drive was
launched by Australia's Tourism Queensland, the tourism promotion authority of
the Queensland state government.</P>
      <P>Wang, who obtained the visa last year but did not travel to Australia
immediately, is scheduled to depart Saturday for Australia using the visa. She
will spend a month there preparing for the job's final selection process slated
for May 3-6.</P>
      <P>Wang will compete with 15 other finalists from 14 different countries for the
six-month A$150,000 (US$107,306) contract to work on Hamilton Island. The winner
will be granted a business visitor visa to undertake the job.</P>
      <P>Kimberly Chien, marketing manager of the Tourism Queensland's Taiwan office,
said the caretaker recruitment drive has successfully raised the interest and
curiosity of Taiwanese in the Great Barrier Reef, which is evident from the
influx of phone calls requesting information about ways to visit the world's
largest coral reef system.</P>
      <P>Chien said, however, that she does not expect any immediate increase in the
number of Taiwanese visitors to the area, because there is no direct flight from
Taiwan to the area and package tours remain the most popular travel options
among Taiwanese. ENITEM/ls</P>

      <P>The Chou Ta-Kuan Cultural and Educational Foundation announced Friday 12 winners
of this year's Fervent Global Love of Lives Award who will be honored at a
ceremony in June in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The 12 winners were selected from 1,929 candidates recommended by various
sectors around the world for their excellence in their fields, according to the
foundation.</P>
      <P>Cheng Mei-chu, a painter from Taiwan's outlying island of Penghu who was born
with Ichthyosis--a severe genetic skin disorder--was selected as a recipient for
her pursuit of the arts with passion and dedication, despite her physical
disability.</P>
      <P>Another recipient was Daniel Gottlieb, an American practicing psychologist and
family therapist, who has been paralyzed from the neck down since a nearly fatal
automobile accident in 1979. He was chosen for his devotion to family and his
career by overcoming paralysis.</P>
      <P>Also on the list was Wang Hung-yi, who founded a one-person band and performed
overseas by using recycled musical instruments.</P>
      <P>Among the recipients was Mark Inglis, a New Zealand mountaineer who lost both
legs after he was trapped in an ice cave for two weeks due to a storm in 1982.
Inglis was recognized for his dedication to helping physically disadvantaged
individuals. He also won a silver medal at the 2000 Paralympics in the 1,000
meter cycling individual time trial.</P>
      <P>Another winner was Wu Chung-yun,  a third grader from an elementary school in
Taichung who became completely blind as a result of a brain tumor, but has
completed 132 paintings.</P>
      <P>The awards will be presented at a ceremony on June 4.</P>
      <P>The foundation was founded in 1997 by the parents of Chou Ta-kuan in memory of
their son who died of cancer. Ta-kuan was a young poet who had great enthusiasm
for life.</P>
      <P>Aimed at promoting Ta-kuan's love for life, his parents have sponsored various
activities  and programs via the foundation, including organizing the award.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's economy will rebound quickly if the government can develop basic
measures that establish Taiwan as a global operations center, the head of the
Taipei Computer Association (TCA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>J.T. Wang, TCA chairman and chairman and CEO of Acer Inc., said the government
does not need to do much to turn the situation around but whatever it does must
be focused with a clear theme, which he believed should be to create
"complementary measures for Taiwan to become a global operations headquarters."</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting on China-based  Taiwanese businesses investing in Taiwan,
Wang also suggested that corporate income taxes for companies setting up their
global headquarters here be set at 15 percent rather than the current 25 percent
and that revenues or dividends remitted back to Taiwan from overseas branches
not be taxed.</P>
      <P>He also advocated that the highest marginal tax rate on the income of top
executives be lowered to 12 percent from the present 40 percent.</P>
      <P>Wang argued that with the improvement in cross-strait relations, if Taiwan can
tackle several cross-strait and major economic issues, then its economy will
rebound more quickly than any other countries in the world.</P>
      <P>"If a new wave of growth arrives, we will definitely be on the crest of the
wave, " the Acer CEO asserted. "I have always been relatively optimistic about
the new situation."</P>
      <P>Wang said that while the global economic slowdown has affected Taiwan, the
relaxation of strained ties between Taiwan and China since the inauguration of
President Ma Ying-jeou last May has been positive.</P>
      <P>The "positive side has outweighed the negative side, " Wang said. "We have a big
opportunity to take advantage of the 'positive, ' and there's no need to be
pessimistic."</P>

      <P>A group of 23 high-profile Chinese senior citizens flew into Taipei from Beijing
Friday, one day before Tomb-Sweeping Day, for a 10-day visit in the land where
they were born but have grown apart from over the past 60 years.</P>
      <P>The group composed of elite Taiwanese men and women in China, led by Lin Liyun,
an adviser to the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , arrived at Taipei Songshan Airport to a warm greeting from
friends and relatives.</P>
      <P>Lin, a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee for five terms and who
once served as Japanese secretary to late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, is China's
most prominent female politician from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin thanked "Taiwanese compatriots" for the hospitality she immediately felt
upon arriving in Taiwan and expressed hope for a continued turnabout in cross-
Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Since settling in Beijing in 1952, she had previously visited Taiwan only once,
in 1999. She still has relatives in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The group's visit to Taiwan, the first of its kind in 60 years, was possible as
a result of improved ties between the two countries over the past year.</P>
      <P>Hsu Wun-pin, an adviser to President Ma Ying-jeou, helped arrange the group's
visit.</P>
      <P>Most of the group's members moved to China after 1949, when the Nationalists
retreated to Taiwan after losing China's civil war, and had been denied entry to
Taiwan several times as a result of the delicate political situation across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Two members of the group had never returned to Taiwan since leaving their
hometowns in their youth.</P>
      <P>The eldest of the group members is 86 years old and the youngest, 73.</P>
      <P>During their 10-day visit in Taiwan, they will tour cultural and scenic
attractions, including Sun Moon Lake in central Nantou County, and Taroko
National Park and the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation in eastern

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Liao Liou-yi said Friday that the list of cities and
counties that will be merged will come out no later than early September.</P>
      <P>Liao noted that the Central Election Commission is scheduled to promulgate the
year-end, three-in-one elections, including local city and county chief
elections, Sept. 4, so that the list should be ready as early as possible and
"not be too close to that date."</P>
      <P>The heads of the administrative districts in line to be merged under the new
revision would have their terms extended for a year, meaning that any merger
plans would have to be submitted by the deadline laid out by the MOI to avoid
holding local elections on December 5 this year.</P>
      <P>Liao's remarks came after the Legislative Yuan passed an amendment of the Local
Government Law, which will provide a legal basis for cities or counties to be
upgraded to municipalities either individually or by merging with other cities
and counties.</P>
      <P>The political implications of the bill actually prompted the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party to block it during the previous legislative session
late last year, but opposition resistance was quelled in recent deliberations
over the amendment.</P>
      <P>Under the amended law passed Friday, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) can
propose upgrading administrative districts based on the reasonable planning of
national land or the nation's development needs.</P>
      <P>Local city or county governments can also take the initiative to draft upgrading
plans and after the city or county councils approve the plans, they will be
submitted for the approval of the Executive Yuan via the MOI.</P>
      <P>Liao said the passage of the amended law not only provides the legal basis for
city or county upgrading, but also marks the "beginning of a major task of
adjusting Taiwan's administrative districts and local government reforms."</P>
      <P>He suggested those cities and counties that have the intention to merge to
submit merger plans to his ministry by May 31.</P>
      <P>"The MOI will handle the plans based on the principles of fairness and
openness," he added.</P>
      <P>The passage of the amended law is a big step toward helping fulfill President Ma
Ying-jeou's campaign promise to merge Taichung city and county and upgrade it
into special municipal status.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu said Friday that he will begin related proceedings for
the merger with Taichung County, hoping that the city and county councils will
pass the plan in early May to submit their application early enough to the MOI.</P>
      <P>While Taichung city and county are expected to take advantage of the legal
revision, the Cabinet may also be tested by calls for upgrading from Tainan city
and county and Kaohsiung city and county.</P>
      <P>Koahsiung Mayor Chen Chu said that city was upgraded into a special municipality
more than a decade ago, and the merger of the Kaohsiung city and county should
be a natural development.</P>
      <P>"If the central government handles the application in a fair manner, then there
is no reason for the merger to come later than that of Taichung city and
county," Chen added.</P>
      <P>Kaohsung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing also said that city and county merger
plan should be handled in tandem with the Taichung city and county merger.</P>
      <P>Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-chih said that he had called Tainan Mayor Hsu
Tain-tsair, and hopes that the merger plan will be passed by the city and county
councils by the end of May.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei said Friday that his
county should be upgraded ahead of Taichung city and county.</P>
      <P>According to a previous amendment to the Local Government Law, any county with a
population exceeding 2 million could enjoy the same rights as a special
municipality in terms of personnel, government structure and finances before
receiving formal approval by the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Based on that previous revision, Taipei County was substantively upgraded into a
special municipality in 2007, but has yet to be formally recognized as one by
the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Chou stressed that Taipei County currently has a population of 3.84 million,
outnumbering the 2.6 million of Taichung city and county combined or any other
cities or counties.</P>
      <P>"If Taipei County is approved later than others by the Executive Yuan, then it
will seriously affect the interests of Taipei County residents," he stressed.</P>

      <P>A Malaysian woman turned out to be the 1 millionth visitor to Taiwan for 2009,
customs inspectors at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yap Ah Mooi, 51, arrived at the airport in northern Taiwan Friday evening via a
China Airlines flight along with 34 of her colleagues on a seven-day company
vacation, customs sources said.</P>
      <P>Yap appeared to be surprised and overjoyed after customs officers informed her
that she was the 1 millionth visitor to Taiwan this year and would receive an
NT$100,000 (about US$2,995.8) credit card balance to spend in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She was also presented with many other exquisite gifts, including Taipei and
Kaohsiung metro VIP cards and Hakka-style fabrics.</P>
      <P>According to tourist officials, this year's 1 millionth visitor arrived two days
ahead of last year's. They attributed this year's faster rate of visitor
arrivals to the increasing number of Chinese tourists visiting the country.</P>
      <P>They also predicted that the total visitor arrivals for 2009 is likely to reach
4 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Locally made human bird flu vaccine to be ready for clinical trial</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3 (CNA)
04/04/09  12:40:43
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A locally developed emergency vaccine against the virulent H5N1 bird flu strain
is expected to be ready for clinical trial in the second half of this year, a
senior Department of Health (DOH) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The emergency vaccine, developed by the National Health Research Institute, will
mainly be used for emergency use in the event of an H5N1 outbreak among humans,
said Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the DOH is scheduled to authorize clinical trials for the
locally developed bird flu vaccines in the second quarter of this year, and the
first phase of the trials are expected to get underway in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>As the research institute has a limited production capacity, Shih said, the
locally developed vaccine will only be enough for emergency use if Taiwan is
struck by an H5N1 outbreak in humans.</P>
      <P>A few years ago, the DOH launched a BOO (build-operate-own) project under which
a private contractor was picked to produce locally developed human bird flu
vaccines.</P>
      <P>The bid, however, was dropped because the winning contractor was later merged
into another entity in a corporate restructuring.</P>
      <P>Shih said the DOH is appraising the feasibility of renewing the BOO project to
draw the private sector into investing in human H5N1 vaccine production.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a research team headed by Academia Sinica President Chi-Huey Wong at
the institute's Genomics Research Center has developed DNA-based vaccines
against both human influenza and avian flu, academic sources said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the procedual platform developed by the team can
produce such DNA-based vaccines for emergency use within six months.</P>
      <P>The team's research findings have been published in the noted American science
journal "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of

    <HEADLINE>Authoritarian parenting keeps children away from parents: survey</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  4  (CNA)
04/04/09  15:28:57
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent  survey  has found that authoritarian parenting is what keeps children
distant from parents, prompting the local child welfare promotion organization
that released the survey Saturday to urge parents to spend more time with their
children.</P>
      <P>The nonprofit Child Welfare League Foundation (CWLF) suggested at a news
conference that parents follow the "Love Your Child 333 Guidelines" by hugging
their children for 30 seconds, listening to them for 3 minutes and spending at
least 30 minutes with them every day.</P>
      <P>First lady Chow Mei-ching said at the news conference that parents should
cherish the time they have with their children while they are still young, not
only because the children need such companionship but also because they grow up
so quickly.</P>
      <P>"Parents are the most important teachers, family, friends and companions that
children need when they are growing up -- a period of time that flies by so
quickly if parents do not cherish it, " Chow said.</P>
      <P>CWLF Chairwoman Joyce Feng said that regardless how busy they are, parents
should schedule time in their daily lives to spend time with their children.</P>
      <P>Parents' company cannot be replaced with pets or toys, though they might serve
as substitutes when parents are busy, she added.</P>
      <P>The survey found that while 92.2 percent of the children polled said they like
going home, the overall score of their "family life" is 74, lower than the 76
score for "school life" and 80 for "physical and mental status."</P>
      <P>The main reason for that is because of authoritarian parenting, the survey
found, noting that 47.2 percent of children are rarely praised by parents when
they are good, 29 percent are frequently asked to be quiet while adults are
talking, and 13.8 percent often receive verbal or physical punishment.</P>
      <P>As to school life, 61.7 percent of the children said they feel stress over
schoolwork and experience a lot of academic pressure, 23.3 percent said they
don't like going to school, and 9.6 percent said they are often bullied by
classmates.</P>
      <P>The survey,  however,  found that most children are still optimistic and hold a
positive attitude in dealing with problems they face in life.</P>
      <P>When asked to evaluate their physical and mental well-being, 88.6 percent said
they are both physically and mentally healthy, while 86.7 percent said they like
their lives the way they are at present.</P>
      <P>The survey, which distributed questionnaires to grade 4,5, and 6 elementary
school students, was conducted at the end of 2008. The poll, which has a margin
of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points at a confidence level of 99
percent, collected 4,487 valid samples.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei bids for right to host 2015 Universiade</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei is bidding for the right to host the World University Games in 2015, with
the city government seemingly confident of success.</P>
      <P>Emile C. J. Sheng, chairman of the city's Research Development and Evaluation
Commission, said Taipei's considerable experience in organizing international
sports events and its emphasis on sports development are factors favoring its
bid.</P>
      <P>Sheng made the remarks in an interview with the Central News Agency Friday after
talks with visiting members of the Federation Internationale du Sport
Universitaire (FISU) , the organizer of the biennial World University  Games,
also known formally as the Universiade.</P>
      <P>Sheng said the city is well prepared to host the event because 10 of the 16
events held in the Summer Universiade will be part of the 21st Summer
Deaflympics 2009, to be held in Taipei Sept. 5-15.</P>
      <P>For other Universiade events not included in the Deaflympics, such as baseball
and weightlifting, the city is well-equipped to handle those competitions, the
official said.</P>
      <P>Sheng said he believed the FISU would take the enthusiasm of Taiwan's government
for promoting  sports activities  and the hospitality and friendliness of
Taipei's residents into account in deciding the host of the 2015 event.</P>
      <P>Those factors, however, were non-factors in Kaohsiung's bid in 2007 to hold the
2011 Summer World University Games.</P>
      <P>The southern port city went into the vote expecting a positive outcome, but
ended up being the second of five cities eliminated during the voting process
because its bid package only committed US$8 million in rights fees and other
funding to the FISU.</P>
      <P>Shenzhen, China, which proposed a US$22 million package, won the right to host
the 2011 event, prompting Taiwan's FISU representative to observe that money
played the decisive role in the competition.</P>
      <P>Sheng said the FISU is scheduled to announce next month the winner of the
competition between Taipei, South Korea's Gwangju and Canada's Edmonton to host
the 2015 Universiade.</P>
      <P>Gwangju was a losing finalist for the 2013 Games awarded to Kazan, Russia last
year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, visiting FISU Vice President Stefan Bergh said he was impressed by
Taipei when he visited the city three years ago.</P>
      <P>Given that Chinese Taipei (as Taiwan is formally known in international
competition) has been one of the most active FISU members, Bergh said he was
delighted to see Taipei mounting a bid to host the Universiade.</P>
      <P>Sheng said that if Taiwan wins the bid, it will receive the support of the
central government to build another multi-functional stadium in addition to the
planned "Taipei Dome " and a national tennis center.</P>
      <P>The three construction projects will cost some 1.2 billion euros, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The recession may have cut into the incomes of most local households, but more
than half of Taiwan's families are still spending as much on their children as
before the economic downturn, a survey conducted by online 1111 Job Bank has
found.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the online survey released Saturday, 77.35 percent
of respondents said they have seen their incomes fall during the economic
downturn triggered by last September's global financial storm, with their
incomes declining by an average 28.79 percent compared to six months ago.</P>
      <P>The fall-off has been mainly caused by unemployment, work changes, cuts in pay
and unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>Among those respondents whose take-home pay had fallen, however, 56.71 percent
said they were spending as much on their children, including for their
education, as when they enjoyed higher incomes.</P>
      <P>These parents explained that they believe their children's future is more
important than money and that they would rather cut other family spending than
sums spent on their children.</P>
      <P>Of the 43.79 percent of respondents who said they had cut spending on their
children after their incomes fell, some noted that the savings mainly came from
dining out or traveling less or cutting back on entertainment, such as watching
movies, and toys, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>The online survey was conducted among white-collar workers with children from
March 18 to March 31. A total of 437 valid samples were collected.</P>

and hid it in the wall of a specially made 20-kilogram iron barrel to skirt its
detection by X-ray machines.</P>
      <P>Chen also tightly sealed the lid of the barrel with wax and covered it in butter
to prevent sniffing dogs from picking up the illicit drug's scent.</P>
      <P>He then mailed the barrel to Taiwan by air mail to a Kaohsiung County resident
surnamed Fu, declaring the shipment as motorbike parts and components.</P>
      <P>Acting on a tip, police raided Fu's residence in Kaohsiung County Friday and

    <DATELINE>New York,  April 4 (CNA)
04/04/09  18:27:22
(By Huang Jaw-pyng and Luke Sabatier)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Chien-Ming Wang opened the new US$1.5 billion Yankee Stadium with an
exhibition win over the Chicago Cubs  Friday  night,  another  milestone  in
the  29-year-old right-hander's career with the New York Yankees.</P>
      <P>Wang did not particularly distinguish himself, allowing four earned runs on six
hits in five innings of work, but still got the win in front of a near capacity
crowd of 48,402 with the help of home runs by Robinson Cano, Hideki Matsui, and
Cody Ransom.</P>
      <P>Wang's first pitch -- a trademark sinker -- was a strike, drawing thunderous
applause from the crowd as light bulbs flashed around the park to record the
historical moment.</P>
      <P>"It's a new stadium, and I wanted to throw the first strike, " said Wang. "When
I went out to the mound, I didn't have any special feeling and I wasn't nervous.
I just wanted to focus."</P>
      <P>Friday night's outing was Wang's final appearance  of the exhibition season,
which he finished with a 4.15 ERA. Wang admitted that he will need to be better
when he starts the Yankees second regular season game in Baltimore April 8.</P>
      <P>"I had trouble controlling the break on the sinker, " Wang said, admitting he
left some of his sinkers too high. "I have to quickly get back my velocity."</P>
      <P>Wang trailed early after yielding a run in the first and two runs in the second
on a two-out RBI double by Aaron Miles, but pitched a scoreless third inning by
relying on more change-ups and sliders, pitches he felt he controlled better
Friday night than his normally reliable sinker.</P>
      <P>Considered the No. 2 starter in the Yankees rotation behind newly acquired C.C.
Sabathia, Wang is hoping for greater success than in 2008, when his season was
curtailed in June after injuring his foot rounding third base in an interleague
game against the Houston Astros.</P>
      <P>Wang had won 19 games each of the previous two seasons, and the Yankees are
counting on him to repeat that success in 2009 to make their opening season in
their new stadium a memorable one.</P>
      <P>The Yankees are playing two exhibition games this weekend against the Cubs to
get acclimated to the new ballpark, but Wang said the new stadium was similar to
the old one and that he has already figured out what he needs to know.</P>
      <P>"I know how to get from the parking lot to the locker room," Wang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should take immediate action to preserve its biodiversity by educating
youth, setting aside natural reserves and developing alternative energy sources,
a renowned U.S. botanist said Saturday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>As an estimated 75,000 species on Taiwan are restricted to the island,  their
special  characteristics  will be important  in facilitating a healthy,
prosperous future for Taiwan, said Peter Raven, president of the Missouri
Botanical Garden and one of the world's leading advocates of conservation and
biodiversity.</P>
      <P>In a speech organized by the nongovernmental Lung Yingtai Cultural Foundation,
Raven noted that half or more of all species on earth may be lost by 2100, and
that the speed with which species are becoming extinct is accelerating because
of ever-worsening global warming.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan make it a national priority to study as closely as
possible scenarios that might come with climate change while at the same time
setting aside nature reserves and protecting them.</P>
      <P>He also urged the government to strengthen public education on the urgency and
importance of protecting biodiversity in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One of the most important things we can do is to educate the youth about nature
with the opportunity to understand its variety, " Raven said. "Only by doing

      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is drafting measures to enhance
corporate transparency that will require financial institutions to reveal under
certain circumstances salaries and perks given to their senior executives and
board directors, an official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Current laws will be revised to allow the public disclosure of listed
financial  institutions'  compensation  given to senior executives and board
members under certain conditions," explained the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>"This is part of our efforts to beef up information transparency and streamline
market order amid the current global financial turmoil, " the official said.</P>
      <P>Salaries  and dividends  paid to board members and senior executives of
financial institutions became a major concern worldwide after cash-strapped
American Insurance Group distributed over US$165 million in bonuses to top
executives after securing bailout funds from the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>Top leaders of the Group of 20 nations promised at their just-concluded
conference  in  London  to  restrict  financial compensation for senior

maintain fair market order.</P>
      <P>The official said the FSC is working on a draft package of amendments to

      <P>"We are hopeful  that the new requirements  will increase information

measure will trigger market mechanisms to help improve corporate governance.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the local bankers association has approved an
amendment to its membership regulations to require all member banks to set up a

    <HEADLINE>MOI to review municipality applications professionally: spokesman</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) will evaluate applications by local cities
and counties to upgrade to special municipalities in a professional manner,
government spokesman Su Jun-pin said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The evaluation process will stand up to public scrutiny, " he said, a day after
the legislature passed a revision to the Local Government Law that provides a
legal foundation for cities and counties to merge or apply individually to have
their statuses upgraded to that of a special municipality.</P>
      <P>Under the amended law, if the combined population of merging cities and counties
exceeds 1.25 million, they can apply to the MOI to become a special
municipality, although the Executive Yuan will have the final say.</P>
      <P>Su denied that the revision was passed because of political considerations,
after local daily the Liberty Times speculated the move could directly impact
three-in-one elections, including city and county chief elections, to be held
Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>The paper suggested the nation will be embroiled over the next few months in
discussions on the upgrading issue, election strategy, and even political
conspiracies due to the maneuvering of cities and counties as they seek to
upgrade their status.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOI said in a press release Saturday that although the population
of a city or county must exceed 1.25 million to become a special municipality,
population is not the only criteria.</P>
      <P>The ministry noted that the populations of Taipei County (3.84 million) ,
Taoyuan County (1.96 million) , Taichung County (1.56 million), and Changhua
County (1.31 million) all exceed 1.25 million, but none of them have been
upgraded into a special municipality.</P>
      <P>Even more important than population is the government's overall considerations
in the planning of national lands and administrative district development to
upgrade the nation's international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Taichung  city  and county  could  well become  the third municipality, after
Taipei and Kaohsiung cities, in Taiwan after the passage of the amended law,
reports said. The next special municipality elections should take place in late
2010.</P>
      <P>According to MOI guidelines, Taichung's city and county councils will have to
approve the merger plan and then have the application sent to the MOI by May 31.
After the MOI evaluates the application, it will send the plan to the Executive
Yuan, which will approve or deny the applications by Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>The Central Election Commission will promulgate the year-end elections Sept. 4,
and announce whether the planned Taichung city and county elections are to be
postponed.</P>
      <P>If Taichung city and county -- or any other administrative districts -- are
merged and upgraded, then the present city and county chiefs, councilors, and
township council members will have their terms extended to Dec. 24, 2010.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung city and county and Tainan city and county are other local governments
that have expressed an interest in seeing their status raised to benefit from
the greater funding and bigger staffs given to special municipalities.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has expressed worries that as
the Executive Yuan will have the final say on upgrading applications, the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) might let certain cities or counties upgrade to circumvent
local elections and cling to power.</P>
      <P>The DPP speculated that if the KMT feels it can't win specific cities and
counties, it will simply upgrade the district to skip local elections and hang
on to power for an extra year until special municipality elections are held.</P>
      <P>They cited as an example Taipei County, where surveys have shown incumbent KMT
Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei trailing far behind possible rivals from the DPP.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hualien City and Okinawa hope to build a "blue highway" on the Pacific Ocean
that connects the two popular tourist destinations, the heads of Hualien and
Okinawa said Saturday in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Following a meeting with Hualien City Mayor Tsai Chih-ta, Okinawa Deputy
Governor Katsuko Asato said Okinawa is promoting cruises to attract more foreign
tourists, and the planned blue highway is the key element of this tourism
promotion plan.</P>
      <P>Asato said she hopes the planned blue highway will help increase the volume of
tourist visits to the Japanese prefecture from the current 5 million to 10
million per year.</P>
      <P>Tsai pointed out that because the blue highway passes through the national
borders of two countries, its opening will involve different laws adopted by the
different governments  in various fields, including sailing rights and
quarantine guidelines.</P>
      <P>How to settle the legal problems will be the key to opening the blue highway,
said Tsai, who suggested that only if Okinawa's government was willing to assist
in resolving the problems could the marine road be created.</P>
      <P>Asato arrived at Hualien Harbor in eastern Taiwan earlier Saturday on the
Japanese luxury tour cruise liner, "Asuka II, " to study customs operations in
Hualien and exchange views on the blue highway plan. Asato met with Tsai soon
after her arrival.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An overwhelming majority of Chinese tourists were satisfied with their trips to
Taiwan, a visiting official of China's quai-official Cross-Strait Tourism
Exchange Association said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Up to 86.4 percent of respondents to a survey of mainland visitors to Taiwan
were happy with their sightseeing visits, " said Li Yaying, deputy secretary-
general of the association.</P>
      <P>Li made the remarks at a seminar in Taipei held at the end of a five-day tour of
Taiwan along with representatives of the 113 Chinese travel agencies  who
recently obtained  licenses  from Beijing authorities to organize tours to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Li, her association has so far not received any complaints  from
Chinese citizens  who have visited Taiwan on sightseeing trips since Taiwan and
China agreed to expand tourism exchanges in mid-2008.</P>
      <P>Li expressed concerns, however, about reports that Taiwan is accepting low-price
Chinese tour groups and that some Taiwanese travel agencies have handed over
such groups once they arrive in Taiwan to local travel companies that are not
authorized to handle Chinese nationals.</P>
      <P>Responding to Li's concerns, Hsieh Wei-chun, deputy director of Taiwan's Tourism
Bureau, said the bureau will never compromise on travel quality standards and
will make every possible effort to ensure that all Taiwan tour packages are
reasonably priced.</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-yen, the Tourism Bureau's chief secretary, said that if any Taiwan
travel agency is found to have transferred a Chinese tour group to an
unauthorized local travel agency, it will be barred from hosting any Chinese
tour group for one to six months.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh said the number of daily Chinese tourist arrivals is expected
to reach the 3,000 person-per-day cap in the near future. At the moment, he
said, the bureau is not considering raising the ceiling because of quality
concerns.</P>
      <P>For quality control, he suggested that mainland provinces follow the example of
Sichuan and Helongjiang provinces and set a minimum fee standard to ensure
quality.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting  Chinese  travel industry representatives said Saturday that the
interest is high among Chinese residents in making sightseeing trips to Taiwan,
but that the number of direct cross-Taiwan Strait flights is not enough to meet
the market demand.</P>
      <P>They also suggested that Taiwan publicize a list of hotels suitable for
providing lodging for Chinese tour groups at reasonable prices.</P>
      <P>The travel industry representatives expressed the views after concluding a five-
day market appraising tour of Taiwan. Most of them are senior executives of the
113 Chinese travel service agencies who recently obtained licenses from Beijing
authorities to organize tours to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to them, Chinese tour groups now mainly comprise elderly people aged
between 55 and 80.</P>
      <P>Many more Chinese citizens are also interested in visiting Taiwan for
sightseeing purposes, but travel agencies often have difficulties securing
sufficient flight tickets on direct cross-strait routes. As a result, they said,
many mainland tour groups have to travel to Taiwan via Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>Carriers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are currently allowed to operate 108
direct cross-strait charter flights per week. The two sides are expected to
discuss the launch of scheduled direct cross-strait flights later this year.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chinese travel professionals' call for presenting a hotel list, Wu
Chao-yen, chief secretary of Taiwan's Tourism Bureau, said that the first batch
of hotels that pass a new star-rating assessment will be unveiled in the second
half of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Wang opens new Yankee Stadium with exhibition win</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York,  April 4 (CNA)
04/04/09  18:27:22
(By Huang Jaw-pyng and Luke Sabatier)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Chien-Ming Wang opened the new US$1.5 billion Yankee Stadium with an
exhibition win over the Chicago Cubs  Friday  night,  another  milestone  in
the  29-year-old right-hander's career with the New York Yankees.</P>
      <P>Wang did not particularly distinguish himself, allowing four earned runs on six
hits in five innings of work, but still got the win in front of a near capacity
crowd of 48,402 with the help of home runs by Robinson Cano, Hideki Matsui, and
Cody Ransom.</P>
      <P>Wang's first pitch -- a trademark sinker -- was a strike, drawing thunderous
applause from the crowd as light bulbs flashed around the park to record the
historical moment.</P>
      <P>"It's a new stadium, and I wanted to throw the first strike, " said Wang. "When
I went out to the mound, I didn't have any special feeling and I wasn't nervous.
I just wanted to focus."</P>
      <P>Friday night's outing was Wang's final appearance  of the exhibition season,
which he finished with a 4.15 ERA. Wang admitted that he will need to be better
when he starts the Yankees second regular season game in Baltimore April 8.</P>
      <P>"I had trouble controlling the break on the sinker, " Wang said, admitting he
left some of his sinkers too high. "I have to quickly get back my velocity."</P>
      <P>Wang trailed early after yielding a run in the first and two runs in the second
on a two-out RBI double by Aaron Miles, but pitched a scoreless third inning by
relying on more change-ups and sliders, pitches he felt he controlled better
Friday night than his normally reliable sinker.</P>
      <P>Considered the No. 2 starter in the Yankees rotation behind newly acquired C.C.
Sabathia, Wang is hoping for greater success than in 2008, when his season was
curtailed in June after injuring his foot rounding third base in an interleague
game against the Houston Astros.</P>
      <P>Wang had won 19 games each of the previous two seasons, and the Yankees are
counting on him to repeat that success in 2009 to make their opening season in
their new stadium a memorable one.</P>
      <P>The Yankees are playing two exhibition games this weekend against the Cubs to
get acclimated to the new ballpark, but Wang said the new stadium was similar to
the old one and that he has already figured out what he needs to know.</P>
      <P>"I know how to get from the parking lot to the locker room," Wang said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan should take immediate action to preserve its biodiversity by educating
youth, setting aside natural reserves and developing alternative energy sources,
a renowned U.S. botanist said Saturday in Taipei.</P>
      <P>As an estimated 75,000 species on Taiwan are restricted to the island,  their
special  characteristics  will be important  in facilitating a healthy,
prosperous future for Taiwan, said Peter Raven, president of the Missouri
Botanical Garden and one of the world's leading advocates of conservation and
biodiversity.</P>
      <P>In a speech organized by the nongovernmental Lung Yingtai Cultural Foundation,
Raven noted that half or more of all species on earth may be lost by 2100, and
that the speed with which species are becoming extinct is accelerating because
of ever-worsening global warming.</P>
      <P>He suggested that Taiwan make it a national priority to study as closely as
possible scenarios that might come with climate change while at the same time
setting aside nature reserves and protecting them.</P>
      <P>He also urged the government to strengthen public education on the urgency and
importance of protecting biodiversity in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One of the most important things we can do is to educate the youth about nature
with the opportunity to understand its variety, " Raven said. "Only by doing
that at all levels, whether at home or in schools, will we have greater
sustainability in the future."</P>
      <P>One of biodiversity's most eloquent defenders, the former member of President
Bill Clinton's Committee of Advisers on Science and Technology said that only
1.6 million species of the world's 12 million have been identified and named.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) will evaluate applications by local cities
and counties to upgrade to special municipalities in a professional manner,
government spokesman Su Jun-pin said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The evaluation process will stand up to public scrutiny, " he said, a day after
the legislature passed a revision to the Local Government Law that provides a
legal foundation for cities and counties to merge or apply individually to have
their statuses upgraded to that of a special municipality.</P>
      <P>Under the amended law, if the combined population of merging cities and counties
exceeds 1.25 million, they can apply to the MOI to become a special
municipality, although the Executive Yuan will have the final say.</P>
      <P>Su denied that the revision was passed because of political considerations,
after local daily the Liberty Times speculated the move could directly impact
three-in-one elections, including city and county chief elections, to be held
Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>The paper suggested the nation will be embroiled over the next few months in
discussions on the upgrading issue, election strategy, and even political
conspiracies due to the maneuvering of cities and counties as they seek to
upgrade their status.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOI said in a press release Saturday that although the population
of a city or county must exceed 1.25 million to become a special municipality,
population is not the only criteria.</P>
      <P>The ministry noted that the populations of Taipei County (3.84 million) ,
Taoyuan County (1.96 million) , Taichung County (1.56 million), and Changhua
County (1.31 million) all exceed 1.25 million, but none of them have been
upgraded into a special municipality.</P>
      <P>Even more important than population is the government's overall considerations
in the planning of national lands and administrative district development to
upgrade the nation's international competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Taichung  city  and county  could  well become  the third municipality, after
Taipei and Kaohsiung cities, in Taiwan after the passage of the amended law,
reports said. The next special municipality elections should take place in late
2010.</P>
      <P>According to MOI guidelines, Taichung's city and county councils will have to
approve the merger plan and then have the application sent to the MOI by May 31.
After the MOI evaluates the application, it will send the plan to the Executive
Yuan, which will approve or deny the applications by Aug. 31.</P>
      <P>The Central Election Commission will promulgate the year-end elections Sept. 4,
and announce whether the planned Taichung city and county elections are to be
postponed.</P>
      <P>If Taichung city and county -- or any other administrative districts -- are
merged and upgraded, then the present city and county chiefs, councilors, and
township council members will have their terms extended to Dec. 24, 2010.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung city and county and Tainan city and county are other local governments
that have expressed an interest in seeing their status raised to benefit from
the greater funding and bigger staffs given to special municipalities.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has expressed worries that as
the Executive Yuan will have the final say on upgrading applications, the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) might let certain cities or counties upgrade to circumvent
local elections and cling to power.</P>
      <P>The DPP speculated that if the KMT feels it can't win specific cities and
counties, it will simply upgrade the district to skip local elections and hang
on to power for an extra year until special municipality elections are held.</P>
      <P>They cited as an example Taipei County, where surveys have shown incumbent KMT
Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei trailing far behind possible rivals from the DPP.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hualien, Okinawa hope to build 'blue highway'</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hualien City and Okinawa hope to build a "blue highway" on the Pacific Ocean
that connects the two popular tourist destinations, the heads of Hualien and
Okinawa said Saturday in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Following a meeting with Hualien City Mayor Tsai Chih-ta, Okinawa Deputy
Governor Katsuko Asato said Okinawa is promoting cruises to attract more foreign
tourists, and the planned blue highway is the key element of this tourism
promotion plan.</P>
      <P>Asato said she hopes the planned blue highway will help increase the volume of
tourist visits to the Japanese prefecture from the current 5 million to 10
million per year.</P>
      <P>Tsai pointed out that because the blue highway passes through the national
borders of two countries, its opening will involve different laws adopted by the
different governments  in various fields, including sailing rights and
quarantine guidelines.</P>
      <P>How to settle the legal problems will be the key to opening the blue highway,
said Tsai, who suggested that only if Okinawa's government was willing to assist
in resolving the problems could the marine road be created.</P>
      <P>Asato arrived at Hualien Harbor in eastern Taiwan earlier Saturday on the
Japanese luxury tour cruise liner, "Asuka II, " to study customs operations in
Hualien and exchange views on the blue highway plan. Asato met with Tsai soon
after her arrival.</P>

      <P>An overwhelming majority of Chinese tourists were satisfied with their trips to
Taiwan, a visiting official of China's quai-official Cross-Strait Tourism
Exchange Association said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"Up to 86.4 percent of respondents to a survey of mainland visitors to Taiwan
were happy with their sightseeing visits, " said Li Yaying, deputy secretary-
general of the association.</P>
      <P>Li made the remarks at a seminar in Taipei held at the end of a five-day tour of
Taiwan along with representatives of the 113 Chinese travel agencies  who
recently obtained  licenses  from Beijing authorities to organize tours to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Li, her association has so far not received any complaints  from
Chinese citizens  who have visited Taiwan on sightseeing trips since Taiwan and
China agreed to expand tourism exchanges in mid-2008.</P>
      <P>Li expressed concerns, however, about reports that Taiwan is accepting low-price
Chinese tour groups and that some Taiwanese travel agencies have handed over
such groups once they arrive in Taiwan to local travel companies that are not
authorized to handle Chinese nationals.</P>
      <P>Responding to Li's concerns, Hsieh Wei-chun, deputy director of Taiwan's Tourism
Bureau, said the bureau will never compromise on travel quality standards and
will make every possible effort to ensure that all Taiwan tour packages are
reasonably priced.</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-yen, the Tourism Bureau's chief secretary, said that if any Taiwan
travel agency is found to have transferred a Chinese tour group to an
unauthorized local travel agency, it will be barred from hosting any Chinese
tour group for one to six months.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hsieh said the number of daily Chinese tourist arrivals is expected
to reach the 3,000 person-per-day cap in the near future. At the moment, he
said, the bureau is not considering raising the ceiling because of quality
concerns.</P>
      <P>For quality control, he suggested that mainland provinces follow the example of
Sichuan and Helongjiang provinces and set a minimum fee standard to ensure
quality.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese travel agents call for more cross-strait flights</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting  Chinese  travel industry representatives said Saturday that the
interest is high among Chinese residents in making sightseeing trips to Taiwan,
but that the number of direct cross-Taiwan Strait flights is not enough to meet
the market demand.</P>
      <P>They also suggested that Taiwan publicize a list of hotels suitable for
providing lodging for Chinese tour groups at reasonable prices.</P>
      <P>The travel industry representatives expressed the views after concluding a five-
day market appraising tour of Taiwan. Most of them are senior executives of the
113 Chinese travel service agencies who recently obtained licenses from Beijing
authorities to organize tours to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to them, Chinese tour groups now mainly comprise elderly people aged
between 55 and 80.</P>
      <P>Many more Chinese citizens are also interested in visiting Taiwan for
sightseeing purposes, but travel agencies often have difficulties securing
sufficient flight tickets on direct cross-strait routes. As a result, they said,
many mainland tour groups have to travel to Taiwan via Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>Carriers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are currently allowed to operate 108
direct cross-strait charter flights per week. The two sides are expected to
discuss the launch of scheduled direct cross-strait flights later this year.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chinese travel professionals' call for presenting a hotel list, Wu
Chao-yen, chief secretary of Taiwan's Tourism Bureau, said that the first batch
of hotels that pass a new star-rating assessment will be unveiled in the second
half of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Salvadoran president-elect recognizes cooperation with Taiwan: Ou</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama City,  Panama,  April 3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said Friday that El Salvador president-elect
Mauricio Funes positively recognized the results of cooperation between Taiwan
and his country during their meeting Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ou flew to El Salvador on short notice on March 31 to visit the newly elected
president, who hinted during his campaign that he would consider cutting ties
with Taiwan and recognize Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Foreign Ministry insisted, however, that Ou's trip was simply to
solidify ties with a long-time diplomatic ally following the election of a new
government March 15.</P>
      <P>Ou said in a telephone interview that Funes attached considerable importance to
the meeting, as seen by the number of important political figures close to
Funes, including heavyweights from his Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
(FMLN), who were invited in the meeting.</P>
      <P>During the encounter, Funes expressed his gratitude for Taiwan's long-standing
assistance to his country and asserted that he would not rule his country based
on political ideology but rather in consideration of national interests,
according to Ou.</P>
      <P>Funes cited the example of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, who had broken
ties with Taiwan during his first term in office but has maintained relations
with Taiwan during his second term.</P>
      <P>Ou suggested that because of the long-term friendship between the FMLN and
China's Communist Party, Funes might face pressure from inside his party to
forge ties with China after taking over as president.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, Taiwan needs to communicate with Funes and help him
appreciate Taiwan's contribution to the well-being of El Salvador's people, Ou
said.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister noted that during his meeting with Funes, he briefed  the
president-elect  on the latest  developments  in Taiwan-China relations and
reiterated Taiwan's commitments on several cooperation programs and bilateral
relations with El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Noting that El Salvador is one of Taiwan's staunchest supporters and closest
partners and that bilateral ties remain solid, Ou said he hopes the incoming
Salvadoran government will facilitate bilateral cooperation with Taiwan soon
after it takes office.</P>
      <P>As to whether President Ma Ying-jeou will personally attend Funes' inauguration
on June 1, Ou said the matter is still under discussion and a final decision has
yet to be made.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Alishan's cherry blossom season to close in 10 days</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiayi County,  April 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual cherry blossom season on Alishan in southern Taiwan will end on April
15, and flower lovers who have not yet visited the national scenic area this
year should do so before the opportunity  disappears,  the Alishan  Community
Development Association said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liao Ching-tai, general secretary of the association, told reporters that the
flowers on most of the 1,900 Yoshino cherry trees faded by the end of March, and
that at present double cherry blossoms known as prunus lannesiana, a sub-variety
of the Yaebenishidare family, are in full bloom.</P>
      <P>The Alishan National Scenic Area is well-known for its large numbers of cherry
trees of various varieties, including indigenous ones and varieties from Japan.</P>
      <P>In addition to the white and pink cherry blossoms of some 1,900 Yoshino cherry
trees -- a Japanese variety -- there are 4,600 trees of other varieties,
including Yaebenishidare, Kurile, peony, and Taiwan cherries.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, while the cherry blossom season will soon end, many other
kinds of flowers have begun to bloom all over the scenic area, including
azaleas, magnolias, the genus Pleione orchids, calla lilies, Hall crabapple, and
paradise apples.</P>
      <P>In Alishan's Plum Garden and Chaoping Park, Hall Crabapple flowers in full bloom
have become the main attraction to visitors. Although the flowers look like
cherry blossoms, they actually belong to the rose family, Liao said.</P>
      <P>According to the Forestry Bureau's Alishan office, more than 200,000 people have
visited the Alishan scenic area since the cherry blossom season began on March
15.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Humanitarian activist determined to bring values to medical sector</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/05/09  17:54:02</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>Lien Chia-en is now a member of the medical establishment, a physician in charge
of epidemic prevention in Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control.</P>
      <P>But the idealism and activism he showed in serving patients in Burkina Faso
while performing his alternative military service continues to burn brightly,
undimmed by the complex issues his agency faces on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Lien, who received his professional license last September after passing the
national medical doctors exam, is on a new crusade informed by his experiences
earlier this decade in the impoverished western African country -- bringing a
humanistic touch to health care and to people's daily lives.</P>
      <P>And Lien believes that with the world mired in an economic slump, now is the
perfect time to overhaul  the medical community's utilitarian climate.</P>
      <P>"It's high time to inject medical ethics and the values of humanitarian service
into the medical sector now that the economic slump is causing wrenching changes
to Taiwan's society and the world, " said Lien recently in an interview with the
Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Lien, a devout Christian who gained prominence serving as a health care worker
in Burkina Faso from 2001-2003, said "ethics and values" have already begun to
appear in certain corners of Taiwan's medical sector.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Medical University, for example, has sent doctors from its affiliated
hospital and its students to work in Africa as volunteers and Taipei Medical
University has dispatched students to join medical corps in northern Thailand.</P>
      <P>"Working in difficult places gives these students opportunities to get a glimpse
of international medical aspects and allows them to nurture empathy toward the
needy or disadvantaged," he said.</P>
      <P>A graduate of National Yang Ming University's medical school who in addition to
helping heal patients in Burkina Faso also led a movement to clean up its
countryside, drill wells and set up orphanages, Lien has been an "icon" of male
college graduates who still have to perform their compulsory military service.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, he has been invited by many social groups to give speeches
to young men, particularly male medical students, to share his experiences in
Africa, which reinforced his humanitarian values.</P>
      <P>Lien said his speaking engagements have convinced him that most medical students
have the hearts to help people unconditionally, and he tells them that even if
they are young and powerless, they can change the world.</P>
      <P>"Try to find your own values to realize your dreams as soon as possible and
don't give too much consideration to fame and personal interests, " is how Lien
describes the message he tries to convey to them.</P>
      <P>That message is the one he lived in Burkina Faso and one that was depicted in
Under 45 Degree Skies, a television series about Lien's experiences, including
how he became an Internet legend at the age of 27 when his activism and idealism
converged  into an online clothes-for garbage campaign.</P>
      <P>In a country where precious cattle and other animals were choking to death after
eating the garbage that blanketed the countryside, Lien asked people in Taiwan
to donate clothes that would be given to Burkina Faso residents in exchange for
garbage they collected.</P>
      <P>The campaign was so successful that at one point, Burkina Faso's post office was
brought to a temporary halt after being swamped with donations of about 75,000
pieces of clothing.</P>
      <P>Lien, who was raised in Taiwan and had never having left home for longer than
three months prior to being posted in Burkina Faso, one of Taiwan's 23
diplomatic allies, was so committed to realizing his ideals that he extended his
stay for a year when his compulsory service ended in 2002.</P>
      <P>He said he learned much more than he expected while serving in Africa. "I've
learned that life is priceless and even if one is penniless, one can pursue a
priceless life."</P>
      <P>In Burkina Faso, Lien said, the temperature is 40 to 50 degrees Celsius, and the
land is dry and barren. Food is scarce, education is insufficient, sanitation
and health levels are inadequate, and the risk of AIDS and malaria is high.</P>
      <P>The people of Burkina Faso, however, are decent and filled with integrity, he
said. Despite their poverty, "the people do not rob or steal, " and Lien
describes them as simple, gentle, kindhearted and sincere.</P>
      <P>Lien believes that Taiwan has plenty to learn from the kind nature of his
African friends despite their impoverished state.</P>
      <P>He contends that Taiwan's youth have a service spirit, but it is dampened by the
society's mainstream values and the emphasis of parents on academic performance
and advancement.</P>
      <P>With this rigid mentality and distorted value system that Lien is fighting
against, many unemployed young people prefer living at home to taking a job
because of long work hours or low pay.</P>
      <P>But he hopes that his experience working in a hospice will help Taiwan's youth
change their value systems and mind-sets.</P>
      <P>Lien recalls that he saw many important businessmen and high ranking officials
lying on their death beds murmuring not about how much money they had earned or
how glorious their careers had been, but asking "why isn't my son here to see
me?"</P>
      <P>Success, Lien says, means that when one's days are numbered, one can look back
at children who have their own happy families and at things one has done to
positively influence others.</P>
      <P>It is a message he still hopes Taiwan's medical community and the country's
youth will embrace.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taoyuan County to apply to become special municipality</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taoyuan County government will apply to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
to have its status upgraded to that of a special municipality by the end of this
year, County Magistrate Eric Liluan Chu said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chu stated his county's intentions just two days after the Legislative Yuan
passed an amendment to the Local Government Law that allows cities or counties
to be upgraded to special municipalities either individually or by merging with
other cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Chu stressed that passage of the revision was aimed at adjusting Taiwan's
administrative districts and reforming local governments, and not based on
election considerations.</P>
      <P>Opposition politicians have suggested that the amendment might be used as an
instrument to manipulate elections in favor of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expressed concerns that the MOI might
approve plans to merge cities and counties where the KMT could lose to the DPP
in year-end city and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>The heads of cities and counties that have their statuses upgraded will have

      <P>For his part, Chu said he will serve out his term due to end Dec. 20, adding

" an indirect denial that he will run for Taipei County magistrate.</P>

      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung has pledged full support to
Penghu County to develop the island county into an outlying forest park and an
international standard tourism and leisure area, a COA official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the promise during a visit to the county Friday after learning of its
plan to plant 10 million trees to increase its forest coverage rate to 30
percent, according to the official.</P>
      <P>So far, a total of 1,933.5 hectares of forest have been planted in the county,
representing a forest coverage rate of 15 percent, the official said.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that the county harness the scenic beauty of forests by
incorporating aesthetic landscaping concepts in their design to transform the
county into a forest park.</P>
      <P>Chen also pledged that the COA would help bring leisure and tourism features to
the county's fishing ports and help revamp farming and fishing villages  there
after the Farming Village Revitalization Act clears the legislature's floor, the
official said.</P>
      <P>The COA chief believed that thanks to its clean environment free of industrial
pollution  and contamination,  Penghu  also has considerable potential in
pesticide-free and organic farming.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-speed ferry owned by Excalibur International Marine Corp. may have to
postpone its debut run between Taichung Port in central Taiwan and Xiamen in
China's Fujian province on April 10, as Chinese authorities have not yet
approved the service.</P>
      <P>Ocean Lala, a 2,292-ton ferry, is a five-year-old vessel built in Singapore. It
can carry 360 passengers and run at a top speed of 35 knots.  Its  owner  has
been  planning  to  operate  the Taichung-Penghu-Xiamen route since late October
after the vessel was officially launched in Taichung Harbor that month.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's expanded "mini three links" formula, the ferry is allowed to use
Penghu -- about 41 kilometers off the southwest coast of Taiwan proper -- as a
transit stop to sail to a Chinese port.</P>
      <P>Although Excalibur has obtained permission from local authorities to make four
charter trips between Taichung and Xiamen, China has yet to give the company the
green light.</P>
      <P>Wang Chun-yu, director-general of the Taichung Harbor Bureau, said that because
there has never been high-speed ferry service between Taiwan and China before,
Chinese authorities want Excalibur to make a trial run to Xiamen without any
passengers on board and allow their inspectors to board the vessel to verify
that it is safe.</P>
      <P>Excalibur has already sold more than 100 tickets to mostly travel agency workers
for the April 10 voyage. Ocean Lala is scheduled to set out to sea from Taichung
Port at 7 a.m. and arrive in Xiamen Port at 11: 35 a.m. The vessel would then
carry 350 tourists from China to Taichung for a sightseeing tour.</P>
      <P>Some travel agencies are also putting on hold a NT$12,000 seven-day package tour
in Xiamen that would take Taiwanese tourists to the coastal Chinese city by the
high-speed ferry.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City government announced Sunday that it will offer 5,000 owners of
two-stroke engine scooters and motorcycles a subsidy of NT$1,500 each to phase
out their highly polluting vehicles, with the application process to begin April
6.</P>
      <P>Scooter owners are eligible to apply for the subsidy if their bikes were
manufactured before January 2001, registered in the city, had their exhaust
emissions inspected during the year or in the year before they were recycled or
discarded,  and are recycled by authorized vehicle dismantling and recycling
operators by the end of this year, according to a city government official.</P>
      <P>Some 1.07 million scooters  and motorcycles  are currently registered in the
city, including 190,000 with two-stroke engines, the official said.</P>
      <P>Two-stroke bikes emit two to five times more pollution than those with four-
stroke engines, the official said, and the pollution they create often leads to
complaints from local residents, prompting the city government to come up with
the subsidy program.</P>
      <P>Owners can determine whether their scooter uses a two-stroke or four-stroke
engine by how their motor oil is changed.</P>
      <P>Scooters with two-stroke engines have an indicator light on the control panel to
show when the motor oil level is low, while the oil in bikes with four-stroke
engines is changed after traveling certain distances, and the used oil must be
drained before new oil is added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should consider "dual axis" policy in face of G2: scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
04/05/09  20:40:15
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Confronted with the emergence of a "G2, " composed of the United States and
China, Taiwan should change its U.S.-oriented trade policy mentality into a
"dual axis" strategy that gives equal weight to America and China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should even consider a "three-pronged"  strategy -- attaching equal
importance to the U.S., China and Europe -- in order to survive the ongoing
global economic crunch, the experts said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an academic seminar on the "G2" and Taiwan's economic prospects,
Dar-yeh Hwang, director of National Taiwan University's Center of Banking and
Finance, said China may play the role of the world's economic locomotive as the
G2 takes shape.</P>
      <P>The U.S. once dominated that role, but with its huge trade and budget deficits,
Washington will now be heavily indebted to other countries, limiting its
maneuverability and ability to spur global economic growth, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Washington has had no other option but to take a
conciliatory attitude toward China in recent months because of Beijing's
holding  of  more  than  US$1  trillion  in  U.S. dollar-denominated assets,
including treasury bills.</P>
      <P>In comparison, he said, China has enjoyed a huge trade surplus, a high domestic
savings rate and soaring foreign exchange reserves together with a large but
relatively stable banking system.</P>
      <P>Hwang argued that although China and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were
the two direct beneficiaries of the just-concluded G20 summit in London, Taiwan
might also benefit even if it was not a participant because its products and
services have relatively easy access to China's market.</P>
      <P>At the G20 summit in London last week, member countries decided to inject US$1
trillion into major multilateral institutions such as the IMF to help battle the
mounting global recession.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can benefit from China's economic expansion and avert the impact of the
U.S. slump if it adjusts its external trade structure from a one-track approach
targeted solely at the U.S. to a dual-track strategy emphasizing bilateral trade
with both the U.S. and China, " he suggested.</P>
      <P>Bert Lim, president of the World Economics Society, an economic policy think-
tank, said it observed that the international status of the BRICs (Brazil,
Russia,  India  and China)  had risen to unprecedented heights during the G20
summit.</P>
      <P>That means that in the future, the U.S., the European Union and the BRICs could
be the three key players in the global economy, Lim said.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan cannot alter its trade strategy to focus solely on China as a
substitute for its U.S.-oriented approach because of political considerations,
it is therefore critically important for the country to find a balance between
the U.S., EU and China, Lim contended.</P>
      <P>The economist believed, however, that slumping foreign direct investment could
derail all Asian economies.</P>
      <P>Lim estimated that oreign investment in Asia excluding China has fallen 90
percent to a mere US$16 billion since last September, while in China it has
plummeted from previous levels of between US$45-60 billion to less than US$20.</P>
      <P>"Asia must pay attention to whether or not this fall in investment will lead to
a loss in development momentum," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Tsai Cheng-yuan said that before the G20 summit, China at
best could be seen as a regional superpower, but after it pledged US$40 billion
to the IMF at the summit, its status as a global leader was confirmed.</P>
      <P>Tsai warned that the rise of China was an issue Taiwan needs to carefully
considered.</P>
      <P>He said the proposed signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) between China and Taiwan and a memorandum of understanding on cross-
strait cooperation in financial supervision will help Taiwan's private sector
explore markets in China more efficiently but will also consolidate a "one-China
market" framework.</P>
      <P>The seminar was co-sponsored by the NTU Center of Banking and Finance and
government-funded Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan dollar with little room to appreciate this week: analysts</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5 (CNA)
04/05/09  20:45:25
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar has little room for further appreciation this coming week
after leading all Asian currencies with a 1.2 percent rise against the United
States dollar last week, according to analysts.</P>
      <P>After giving up NT$0.236 to the U.S. greenback last Monday, the Taiwan dollar
rose the next four days by a combined NT$0.635 to finish the week at NT$33.38 to
the greenback.</P>
      <P>The 1.2 percent gain against the U.S. dollar for the week was higher than the
Malaysian  ringgit's  0.85 percent rise,  the Singaporean dollar's 0.76 percent
rise, the Korean won's 0.54 percent gain, the Thai baht's 0.28 percent rise and
the Indonesian rupiah's 0.14 percent gain.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen each lost ground to the U.S. dollar
last week.</P>
      <P>Analysts attributed the appreciation of Taiwan's currency to the inflow of "hot"
money, much of it to be invested in the local stock exchange, although the
Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) is monitoring foreign exchange
inflows and outflows closely.</P>
      <P>K.Y. Liang, chief of the Polaris Research Institute, said that at 33.38 to the
U.S. dollar, Taiwan's currency is "little bit too high" for the long term.</P>
      <P>Given that Taiwan's exports will post negative growth this year, Liang predicted
the mean value of Taiwan's currency for 2009 will be around NT$34.6 to the
greenback.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Cheng-yi, a financial analyst with UBS Taipei, predicted a continuous
slide for the greenback's  value this year due to Washington's budget and trade
deficits.</P>
      <P>Hsiao also believe that China's efforts to diversify its holdings of nearly US$2
trillion in foreign exchange reserves to currencies other than the U.S. dollar
will also likely send the greenback lower in the future.</P>
      <P>But whether the Taiwan dollar will rise to 32 against the greenback as some fear
depends on the local stock market, which generally moves in tandem with Wall
Street, and how the central bank would react to a further surge, Liang said.</P>
      <P>Another analyst cautioned, however, that there was little room for the Taiwan
dollar to rise further and put the country's exporters at an even bigger
disadvantage against their Asian competitors.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can hardly afford further appreciation of its dollar without further
undermining its already weak exports." the analyst said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kinmen residents to get NT$10,800 gift vouchers for fiery liquor</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen, April 5 (CNA)
04/05/09  22:41:14
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen residents may be the happiest lot in Taiwan and the outlying islands
under its control, as the Kinmen County government has decided to present each
resident with NT$10,800 (US$326) worth of gift vouchers this year for purchasing
the island chain's most famous product -- sorghum liquor known as kaoliang.</P>
      <P>The first batch of gift vouchers were distributed to the county's 85,143
residents at 45 locations in six townships Sunday -- a day after Tomb Sweeping
Day -- with each resident receiving NT$3,600 worth of vouchers. The residents
have until June 5 to spend the vouchers in exchange for kaoliang liquor products
from a local distillery.</P>
      <P>The county government said it will do the same two more times to coincide with
Dragon Boat Festival on May 28 and Mid-Autumn Festival on Oct. 3.</P>
      <P>The county government made the decision to commemorate the 60th anniversary of
the Battle of Kuningtou in Kinmen -- an island group off China's Fujian province
-- in late October 1949.</P>
      <P>During that battle, the Republic of China's garrison troops in Kinmen defeated
the 19,000 invading Communist Chinese troops by killing 3,873 of them and
capturing 5,175 others. The Kinmen garrison troops sustained 1,267 deaths and
1,982 injured.</P>
      <P>Three years later, Kinmen's defense commander Gen. Hu Lian and his troops built
a makeshift distillery, with soldiers familiar with wine-making skills serving
as technicians, to produce sorghum liquor.</P>
      <P>The high-proof liquor produced by the distillery under the brand-name "Kinmen
Kaoliang" became so famous that the factory later became a fully county-owned
enterprise.</P>
      <P>Kaoliang is the Chinese word for sorghum. The fiery liquor is so well-liked by
consumers in both Kinmen and Taiwan proper that it has become synonymous with
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Last year, Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. bucked the global economic downturn by
earning the highest revenue in its 56-year history.</P>
      <P>Sales of the liquor have become a major source of funding for local construction
and welfare programs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Salvadoran president-elect recognizes cooperation with Taiwan: Ou</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Panama City,  Panama,  April 3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said Friday that El Salvador president-elect
Mauricio Funes positively recognized the results of cooperation between Taiwan
and his country during their meeting Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ou flew to El Salvador on short notice on March 31 to visit the newly elected
president, who hinted during his campaign that he would consider cutting ties
with Taiwan and recognize Beijing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Foreign Ministry insisted, however, that Ou's trip was simply to
solidify ties with a long-time diplomatic ally following the election of a new
government March 15.</P>
      <P>Ou said in a telephone interview that Funes attached considerable importance to
the meeting, as seen by the number of important political figures close to
Funes, including heavyweights from his Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
(FMLN), who were invited in the meeting.</P>
      <P>During the encounter, Funes expressed his gratitude for Taiwan's long-standing
assistance to his country and asserted that he would not rule his country based
on political ideology but rather in consideration of national interests,
according to Ou.</P>
      <P>Funes cited the example of Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, who had broken
ties with Taiwan during his first term in office but has maintained relations
with Taiwan during his second term.</P>
      <P>Ou suggested that because of the long-term friendship between the FMLN and
China's Communist Party, Funes might face pressure from inside his party to
forge ties with China after taking over as president.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, Taiwan needs to communicate with Funes and help him
appreciate Taiwan's contribution to the well-being of El Salvador's people, Ou
said.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister noted that during his meeting with Funes, he briefed  the
president-elect  on the latest  developments  in Taiwan-China relations and
reiterated Taiwan's commitments on several cooperation programs and bilateral
relations with El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Noting that El Salvador is one of Taiwan's staunchest supporters and closest
partners and that bilateral ties remain solid, Ou said he hopes the incoming
Salvadoran government will facilitate bilateral cooperation with Taiwan soon
after it takes office.</P>
      <P>As to whether President Ma Ying-jeou will personally attend Funes' inauguration
on June 1, Ou said the matter is still under discussion and a final decision has
yet to be made.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Alishan's cherry blossom season to close in 10 days</HEADLINE>

      <P>The annual cherry blossom season on Alishan in southern Taiwan will end on April
15, and flower lovers who have not yet visited the national scenic area this
year should do so before the opportunity  disappears,  the Alishan  Community
Development Association said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liao Ching-tai, general secretary of the association, told reporters that the
flowers on most of the 1,900 Yoshino cherry trees faded by the end of March, and
that at present double cherry blossoms known as prunus lannesiana, a sub-variety
of the Yaebenishidare family, are in full bloom.</P>
      <P>The Alishan National Scenic Area is well-known for its large numbers of cherry
trees of various varieties, including indigenous ones and varieties from Japan.</P>
      <P>In addition to the white and pink cherry blossoms of some 1,900 Yoshino cherry
trees -- a Japanese variety -- there are 4,600 trees of other varieties,
including Yaebenishidare, Kurile, peony, and Taiwan cherries.</P>
      <P>According to Liao, while the cherry blossom season will soon end, many other
kinds of flowers have begun to bloom all over the scenic area, including
azaleas, magnolias, the genus Pleione orchids, calla lilies, Hall crabapple, and
paradise apples.</P>
      <P>In Alishan's Plum Garden and Chaoping Park, Hall Crabapple flowers in full bloom
have become the main attraction to visitors. Although the flowers look like
cherry blossoms, they actually belong to the rose family, Liao said.</P>
      <P>According to the Forestry Bureau's Alishan office, more than 200,000 people have
visited the Alishan scenic area since the cherry blossom season began on March
15.</P>

      <P>But the idealism and activism he showed in serving patients in Burkina Faso
while performing his alternative military service continues to burn brightly,
undimmed by the complex issues his agency faces on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Lien, who received his professional license last September after passing the
national medical doctors exam, is on a new crusade informed by his experiences
earlier this decade in the impoverished western African country -- bringing a
humanistic touch to health care and to people's daily lives.</P>
      <P>And Lien believes that with the world mired in an economic slump, now is the
perfect time to overhaul  the medical community's utilitarian climate.</P>
      <P>"It's high time to inject medical ethics and the values of humanitarian service
into the medical sector now that the economic slump is causing wrenching changes
to Taiwan's society and the world, " said Lien recently in an interview with the
Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Lien, a devout Christian who gained prominence serving as a health care worker
in Burkina Faso from 2001-2003, said "ethics and values" have already begun to
appear in certain corners of Taiwan's medical sector.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Medical University, for example, has sent doctors from its affiliated
hospital and its students to work in Africa as volunteers and Taipei Medical
University has dispatched students to join medical corps in northern Thailand.</P>
      <P>"Working in difficult places gives these students opportunities to get a glimpse
of international medical aspects and allows them to nurture empathy toward the
needy or disadvantaged," he said.</P>
      <P>A graduate of National Yang Ming University's medical school who in addition to
helping heal patients in Burkina Faso also led a movement to clean up its
countryside, drill wells and set up orphanages, Lien has been an "icon" of male
college graduates who still have to perform their compulsory military service.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, he has been invited by many social groups to give speeches
to young men, particularly male medical students, to share his experiences in
Africa, which reinforced his humanitarian values.</P>
      <P>Lien said his speaking engagements have convinced him that most medical students
have the hearts to help people unconditionally, and he tells them that even if
they are young and powerless, they can change the world.</P>
      <P>"Try to find your own values to realize your dreams as soon as possible and
don't give too much consideration to fame and personal interests, " is how Lien
describes the message he tries to convey to them.</P>
      <P>That message is the one he lived in Burkina Faso and one that was depicted in
Under 45 Degree Skies, a television series about Lien's experiences, including
how he became an Internet legend at the age of 27 when his activism and idealism
converged  into an online clothes-for garbage campaign.</P>
      <P>In a country where precious cattle and other animals were choking to death after
eating the garbage that blanketed the countryside, Lien asked people in Taiwan
to donate clothes that would be given to Burkina Faso residents in exchange for
garbage they collected.</P>
      <P>The campaign was so successful that at one point, Burkina Faso's post office was
brought to a temporary halt after being swamped with donations of about 75,000
pieces of clothing.</P>
      <P>Lien, who was raised in Taiwan and had never having left home for longer than
three months prior to being posted in Burkina Faso, one of Taiwan's 23
diplomatic allies, was so committed to realizing his ideals that he extended his
stay for a year when his compulsory service ended in 2002.</P>
      <P>He said he learned much more than he expected while serving in Africa. "I've
learned that life is priceless and even if one is penniless, one can pursue a
priceless life."</P>
      <P>In Burkina Faso, Lien said, the temperature is 40 to 50 degrees Celsius, and the
land is dry and barren. Food is scarce, education is insufficient, sanitation
and health levels are inadequate, and the risk of AIDS and malaria is high.</P>
      <P>The people of Burkina Faso, however, are decent and filled with integrity, he
said. Despite their poverty, "the people do not rob or steal, " and Lien
describes them as simple, gentle, kindhearted and sincere.</P>
      <P>Lien believes that Taiwan has plenty to learn from the kind nature of his
African friends despite their impoverished state.</P>
      <P>He contends that Taiwan's youth have a service spirit, but it is dampened by the
society's mainstream values and the emphasis of parents on academic performance
and advancement.</P>
      <P>With this rigid mentality and distorted value system that Lien is fighting
against, many unemployed young people prefer living at home to taking a job
because of long work hours or low pay.</P>
      <P>But he hopes that his experience working in a hospice will help Taiwan's youth
change their value systems and mind-sets.</P>
      <P>Lien recalls that he saw many important businessmen and high ranking officials
lying on their death beds murmuring not about how much money they had earned or
how glorious their careers had been, but asking "why isn't my son here to see
me?"</P>
      <P>Success, Lien says, means that when one's days are numbered, one can look back
at children who have their own happy families and at things one has done to
positively influence others.</P>
      <P>It is a message he still hopes Taiwan's medical community and the country's
youth will embrace.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taoyuan County government will apply to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI)
to have its status upgraded to that of a special municipality by the end of this
year, County Magistrate Eric Liluan Chu said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chu stated his county's intentions just two days after the Legislative Yuan
passed an amendment to the Local Government Law that allows cities or counties
to be upgraded to special municipalities either individually or by merging with
other cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Chu stressed that passage of the revision was aimed at adjusting Taiwan's
administrative districts and reforming local governments, and not based on
election considerations.</P>
      <P>Opposition politicians have suggested that the amendment might be used as an
instrument to manipulate elections in favor of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) expressed concerns that the MOI might
approve plans to merge cities and counties where the KMT could lose to the DPP
in year-end city and county chief elections.</P>
      <P>The heads of cities and counties that have their statuses upgraded will have
their terms extended for one year, thus avoiding elections in December 2009.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chu said he will serve out his term due to end Dec. 20, adding
that he "loves Taoyuan County residents even more than Taipei County residents,
" an indirect denial that he will run for Taipei County magistrate.</P>
      <P>Taipei County is seen as one of the places in which the KMT is fighting an
uphill battle, with incumbent Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei faring poorly against
potential opposition candidates in polls.</P>

      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Minister Chen Wu-hsiung has pledged full support to
Penghu County to develop the island county into an outlying forest park and an
international standard tourism and leisure area, a COA official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the promise during a visit to the county Friday after learning of its
plan to plant 10 million trees to increase its forest coverage rate to 30
percent, according to the official.</P>
      <P>So far, a total of 1,933.5 hectares of forest have been planted in the county,
representing a forest coverage rate of 15 percent, the official said.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that the county harness the scenic beauty of forests by
incorporating aesthetic landscaping concepts in their design to transform the
county into a forest park.</P>
      <P>Chen also pledged that the COA would help bring leisure and tourism features to
the county's fishing ports and help revamp farming and fishing villages  there
after the Farming Village Revitalization Act clears the legislature's floor, the

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-speed ferry owned by Excalibur International Marine Corp. may have to
postpone its debut run between Taichung Port in central Taiwan and Xiamen in
China's Fujian province on April 10, as Chinese authorities have not yet
approved the service.</P>
      <P>Ocean Lala, a 2,292-ton ferry, is a five-year-old vessel built in Singapore. It
can carry 360 passengers and run at a top speed of 35 knots.  Its  owner  has
been  planning  to  operate  the Taichung-Penghu-Xiamen route since late October
after the vessel was officially launched in Taichung Harbor that month.</P>
      <P>Under Taiwan's expanded "mini three links" formula, the ferry is allowed to use
Penghu -- about 41 kilometers off the southwest coast of Taiwan proper -- as a
transit stop to sail to a Chinese port.</P>
      <P>Although Excalibur has obtained permission from local authorities to make four
charter trips between Taichung and Xiamen, China has yet to give the company the
green light.</P>
      <P>Wang Chun-yu, director-general of the Taichung Harbor Bureau, said that because
there has never been high-speed ferry service between Taiwan and China before,
Chinese authorities want Excalibur to make a trial run to Xiamen without any
passengers on board and allow their inspectors to board the vessel to verify
that it is safe.</P>
      <P>Excalibur has already sold more than 100 tickets to mostly travel agency workers
for the April 10 voyage. Ocean Lala is scheduled to set out to sea from Taichung
Port at 7 a.m. and arrive in Xiamen Port at 11: 35 a.m. The vessel would then
carry 350 tourists from China to Taichung for a sightseeing tour.</P>
      <P>Some travel agencies are also putting on hold a NT$12,000 seven-day package tour
in Xiamen that would take Taiwanese tourists to the coastal Chinese city by the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City government announced Sunday that it will offer 5,000 owners of
two-stroke engine scooters and motorcycles a subsidy of NT$1,500 each to phase
out their highly polluting vehicles, with the application process to begin April
6.</P>
      <P>Scooter owners are eligible to apply for the subsidy if their bikes were
manufactured before January 2001, registered in the city, had their exhaust
emissions inspected during the year or in the year before they were recycled or
discarded,  and are recycled by authorized vehicle dismantling and recycling
operators by the end of this year, according to a city government official.</P>
      <P>Some 1.07 million scooters  and motorcycles  are currently registered in the
city, including 190,000 with two-stroke engines, the official said.</P>
      <P>Two-stroke bikes emit two to five times more pollution than those with four-
stroke engines, the official said, and the pollution they create often leads to
complaints from local residents, prompting the city government to come up with
the subsidy program.</P>
      <P>Owners can determine whether their scooter uses a two-stroke or four-stroke
engine by how their motor oil is changed.</P>
      <P>Scooters with two-stroke engines have an indicator light on the control panel to
show when the motor oil level is low, while the oil in bikes with four-stroke
engines is changed after traveling certain distances, and the used oil must be
drained before new oil is added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan should consider "dual axis" policy in face of G2: scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
04/05/09  20:40:15
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Confronted with the emergence of a "G2, " composed of the United States and
China, Taiwan should change its U.S.-oriented trade policy mentality into a
"dual axis" strategy that gives equal weight to America and China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should even consider a "three-pronged"  strategy -- attaching equal
importance to the U.S., China and Europe -- in order to survive the ongoing
global economic crunch, the experts said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an academic seminar on the "G2" and Taiwan's economic prospects,
Dar-yeh Hwang, director of National Taiwan University's Center of Banking and
Finance, said China may play the role of the world's economic locomotive as the
G2 takes shape.</P>
      <P>The U.S. once dominated that role, but with its huge trade and budget deficits,
Washington will now be heavily indebted to other countries, limiting its
maneuverability and ability to spur global economic growth, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, Washington has had no other option but to take a
conciliatory attitude toward China in recent months because of Beijing's
holding  of  more  than  US$1  trillion  in  U.S. dollar-denominated assets,
including treasury bills.</P>
      <P>In comparison, he said, China has enjoyed a huge trade surplus, a high domestic
savings rate and soaring foreign exchange reserves together with a large but
relatively stable banking system.</P>
      <P>Hwang argued that although China and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were
the two direct beneficiaries of the just-concluded G20 summit in London, Taiwan
might also benefit even if it was not a participant because its products and
services have relatively easy access to China's market.</P>
      <P>At the G20 summit in London last week, member countries decided to inject US$1
trillion into major multilateral institutions such as the IMF to help battle the
mounting global recession.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can benefit from China's economic expansion and avert the impact of the
U.S. slump if it adjusts its external trade structure from a one-track approach
targeted solely at the U.S. to a dual-track strategy emphasizing bilateral trade
with both the U.S. and China, " he suggested.</P>
      <P>Bert Lim, president of the World Economics Society, an economic policy think-
tank, said it observed that the international status of the BRICs (Brazil,
Russia,  India  and China)  had risen to unprecedented heights during the G20
summit.</P>
      <P>That means that in the future, the U.S., the European Union and the BRICs could
be the three key players in the global economy, Lim said.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan cannot alter its trade strategy to focus solely on China as a
substitute for its U.S.-oriented approach because of political considerations,
it is therefore critically important for the country to find a balance between
the U.S., EU and China, Lim contended.</P>
      <P>The economist believed, however, that slumping foreign direct investment could
derail all Asian economies.</P>
      <P>Lim estimated that oreign investment in Asia excluding China has fallen 90
percent to a mere US$16 billion since last September, while in China it has
plummeted from previous levels of between US$45-60 billion to less than US$20.</P>
      <P>"Asia must pay attention to whether or not this fall in investment will lead to
a loss in development momentum," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Tsai Cheng-yuan said that before the G20 summit, China at
best could be seen as a regional superpower, but after it pledged US$40 billion
to the IMF at the summit, its status as a global leader was confirmed.</P>
      <P>Tsai warned that the rise of China was an issue Taiwan needs to carefully
considered.</P>
      <P>He said the proposed signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) between China and Taiwan and a memorandum of understanding on cross-
strait cooperation in financial supervision will help Taiwan's private sector
explore markets in China more efficiently but will also consolidate a "one-China
market" framework.</P>
      <P>The seminar was co-sponsored by the NTU Center of Banking and Finance and
government-funded Taiwan Foundation for Democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan dollar with little room to appreciate this week: analysts</HEADLINE>

04/05/09  20:45:25
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar has little room for further appreciation this coming week
after leading all Asian currencies with a 1.2 percent rise against the United
States dollar last week, according to analysts.</P>
      <P>After giving up NT$0.236 to the U.S. greenback last Monday, the Taiwan dollar
rose the next four days by a combined NT$0.635 to finish the week at NT$33.38 to
the greenback.</P>
      <P>The 1.2 percent gain against the U.S. dollar for the week was higher than the
Malaysian  ringgit's  0.85 percent rise,  the Singaporean dollar's 0.76 percent
rise, the Korean won's 0.54 percent gain, the Thai baht's 0.28 percent rise and
the Indonesian rupiah's 0.14 percent gain.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the Chinese yuan and Japanese yen each lost ground to the U.S. dollar
last week.</P>
      <P>Analysts attributed the appreciation of Taiwan's currency to the inflow of "hot"
money, much of it to be invested in the local stock exchange, although the
Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) is monitoring foreign exchange
inflows and outflows closely.</P>
      <P>K.Y. Liang, chief of the Polaris Research Institute, said that at 33.38 to the
U.S. dollar, Taiwan's currency is "little bit too high" for the long term.</P>
      <P>Given that Taiwan's exports will post negative growth this year, Liang predicted
the mean value of Taiwan's currency for 2009 will be around NT$34.6 to the
greenback.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Cheng-yi, a financial analyst with UBS Taipei, predicted a continuous
slide for the greenback's  value this year due to Washington's budget and trade
deficits.</P>
      <P>Hsiao also believe that China's efforts to diversify its holdings of nearly US$2
trillion in foreign exchange reserves to currencies other than the U.S. dollar
will also likely send the greenback lower in the future.</P>
      <P>But whether the Taiwan dollar will rise to 32 against the greenback as some fear
depends on the local stock market, which generally moves in tandem with Wall
Street, and how the central bank would react to a further surge, Liang said.</P>
      <P>Another analyst cautioned, however, that there was little room for the Taiwan
dollar to rise further and put the country's exporters at an even bigger
disadvantage against their Asian competitors.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can hardly afford further appreciation of its dollar without further
undermining its already weak exports." the analyst said.</P>

      <P>The first batch of gift vouchers were distributed to the county's 85,143
residents at 45 locations in six townships Sunday -- a day after Tomb Sweeping

      <P>The county government said it will do the same two more times to coincide with

      <P>The county government made the decision to commemorate the 60th anniversary of
the Battle of Kuningtou in Kinmen -- an island group off China's Fujian province
-- in late October 1949.</P>
      <P>During that battle, the Republic of China's garrison troops in Kinmen defeated
the 19,000 invading Communist Chinese troops by killing 3,873 of them and
capturing 5,175 others. The Kinmen garrison troops sustained 1,267 deaths and
1,982 injured.</P>
      <P>Three years later, Kinmen's defense commander Gen. Hu Lian and his troops built
a makeshift distillery, with soldiers familiar with wine-making skills serving

      <P>The high-proof liquor produced by the distillery under the brand-name "Kinmen
Kaoliang" became so famous that the factory later became a fully county-owned

      <P>Kaoliang is the Chinese word for sorghum. The fiery liquor is so well-liked by
consumers in both Kinmen and Taiwan proper that it has become synonymous with
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Last year, Kinmen Kaoliang Liquor Inc. bucked the global economic downturn by
earning the highest revenue in its 56-year history.</P>
      <P>Sales of the liquor have become a major source of funding for local construction

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that the recent improvement in Taiwan's
economic situation has helped to boost public confidence, although the hard
economic times are likely to continue throughout the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that the situation in March appeared better than in February, which was
evident from the influx of unanticipated orders and the decrease in the number
of furloughed  staff in some businesses.</P>
      <P>"The hard times are not expected to be over in the first half of this year, but
we can see that public confidence has grown, " Ma said while receiving a group
of representatives of the Junior Chamber International Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that in a bid to stimulate the economy, the government
is promoting a series of measures to try to expand public construction and it
hopes that a special NT$500 billion (US$15.1 billion) four-year budget plan for
this purpose could be finalized this week.</P>
      <P>More than NT$150 billion of the special budget would be earmarked for 2009,
which would bring to NT$600 billion the total funding for public construction
for the year, including items covered by the annual budget, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He promised  that  the government  will plan each  public construction project
very carefully and make sure there is no waste of resources.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, he said, the government is fully confident in Taiwan's future and
looks forward to seeing Taiwan playing a more important role in the global
economic landscape after the financial crisis is over.</P>
      <P>He again called attention to the fact that Taiwan has the world's fourth largest
foreign exchange reserves,  amounting to US$300 billion, and one of the world's
highest personal savings rate, at 30 percent, which he said is an indication of
the strong purchasing power and investment potential of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Ma also expressed confidence in the country's small-  and medium-sized
businesses, many of which have seized a significant share of the world markets
despite their size.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Jiaming Lake, a highland lake nestled deep in the mountains of eastern Taiwan,
has shrunk to about half its size since winter due to low rainfall.</P>
      <P>The lake was about 120 meters long, 80 meters wide and 35 meters deep early last
year, but has since shrunk to the size of a round pool about 75 meters in
diameter. Its volume is estimated at about half the normal level.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Forestry Bureau's Taitung branch has advised that mountain climbers
carry their own drinking water when scaling peaks leading to the lake.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials have further suggested that visitors refrain from drinking the
lake water, saying that might be impure as wild animals frequently drink there.</P>
      <P>The lake, known as one of the highest in Taiwan, is located at an altitude of

    <HEADLINE>Sale of travel packages to Shanghai Expo launched in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With 390 days to go in the countdown to the start of the 2010 Shanghai World
Expo, ticket sales in Taiwan for the fair were officially launched Monday, with
the commissioned travel agency expressing confidence that a large number of
Taiwanese tourists will attend the extravaganza.</P>
      <P>"Ever sine it was established in 1851, World Expo has attracted global
attention, as it is a display of the world's civilization, " said Chou Ching-
shyong, chairman of China Travel Services Taiwan, at a news conference in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>"I believe the 2010 Shanghai World Expo will attract more Taiwanese tourists
than any other fair because of the proximity of Shanghai and common Chinese
language used on both sides," Chou said.</P>
      <P>He forecast that the number of Taiwanese tourists to the Shanghai fair will
exceed the 70,000 that attended the 2003 Aichi World Expo in Japan. However, it
is hard to predict the exact figure at the moment because of variants such as
the availability of cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight seats, he added.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Chinese government's estimate of 400,000 Taiwanese tourists to
Shanghai during the expo, Chou said that projection is a bit optimistic and
bold.</P>
      <P>With regard to the travel packages designed for the expo, Chou said the cost of
a five-day group package, excluding airfare and including four nights at a five
star hotel and a one-day pass to the expo, will start from NT$6,000 (US$181),</P>
      <P>Individual travelers will pay a similar amount, except that the airfare will be
slightly higher, he said. At present, group fare tickets to Shanghai are
NT$13,000 each, while for individuals the price is NT$14,000-NT$20,000, he said,
adding that the exact prices for travel to the expo will be confirmed closer to
its opening date.</P>
      <P>The Shanghai Expo will be held in Shanghai from May 1 to Oct. 31 2010 under the
theme "Better City, Better Life." It is expected to draw participants from 232
countries and international organizations, in addition to an an estimated 70
million local and overseas visitors, which would give it the distinction of
being the largest World Expo in the fair's 159-year history.</P>
      <P>Chen Xianjin, deputy director of the Bureau of Shanghai World Expo Coordination,
said at the news conference that the Shanghai Expo will be a gathering of the
world's civilizations in communication, understanding, and joy.</P>
      <P>"The expo will also serve as a platform of friendship and cooperation between
Taiwan and China, " he said. Taiwanese tourists are welcome to visit the
Shanghai Expo, along with the Taiwanese companies that will set up in the
business pavilion to tap into global business opportunities, he added.</P>
      <P>Taipei City will take part in the expo, displaying its success in creating a
wireless city and managing recycling. It will participate under the fair's
subtheme of "Urban Best Practices Area, " which will provide a platform for
cities to share their experiences in urban development and construction.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An aide of President Ma Ying-jeou during the president's tenure as mayor of
Taipei City who was convicted of embezzlement was released on parole Monday
after being incarcerated for nine months.</P>
      <P>Yu Wen was given a one-year jail sentence early last year on charges of forgery
for using other peoples' invoices to help Ma claim reimbursements from the
special allowance fund set aside for the mayor's discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Yu, who said he deserved to be punished for neglecting his duties, was jailed in
June 2008 and granted early parole by the Ministry of Justice recently for good
behavior.</P>
      <P>Ma was also indicted, on charges of embezzling NT$11 million (US$332,684) from
the special allowance fund he received as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006, but
was acquitted by both the Taipei District Court Aug. 14, 2007 and by the Taiwan
High Court Dec. 28, 2007.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors filed an appeal with the Supreme Court in January 2008 against the
not-guilty verdict handed down by the Taiwan High Court, but the Supreme Court
rejected the appeal in April of that year and upheld the previous district and
high court rulings for Ma.</P>
      <P>Talking to the press upon his departure from jail, Yu said he had not illegally
lined his pockets with a single cent during his time in public service.  Noting
that he merely wrote off the mayor's expenditures using alternative means, Yu
said he believes the law will eventually clear his name.</P>
      <P>He declined to answer a reporter's question on whether Ma had corresponded with
him while he was doing time.</P>
      <P>In related news, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Monday that if Yu files an
application with the Taipei city government to resume his post as a secretary,
it will be considered in full accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>According to the law, Yu, whose wrongdoing involved no major crimes such as
sedition, treason or serious corruption, can apply to return to the city
government after his sentence term expires.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Interviews help reduce mixed marriages of convenience: officials</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 6 (CNA)
04/06/09  16:44:30
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An interview system to screen transnational marriages has succeeded in reducing
the number of marriages of convenience by an average of 25 percent annually over
the past three years, government officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lo Yu-chung, director-general of the Bureau of Consular Affairs under the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), and officials from the National Immigration
Agency (NIA) under the Ministry of the Interior made the remarks while fielding
questions from lawmakers at a legislative committee meeting about related
mechanisms.</P>
      <P>Since the MOFA implemented the interview scheme in May 2005 to step up the
screening process for transnational marriages involving Taiwanese citizens, Lo
said, Taiwanese officials posted overseas have turned down an annual average of
25 percent of such applications following face-to-face interviews during the
2006-2008 period.</P>
      <P>In 2008, Taiwan's representative office in Vietnam rejected 35 percent of the
total marriage applications between Taiwanese and Vietnamese people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative  offices in Indonesia  and Thailand recorded  rejection
ratios of 36.2 percent and 33.8 percent, respectively, last year, while the
representative office in the Philippines reported an 18.3 percent rejection
rate, he went on.</P>
      <P>Conducting interviews has proven very effective in preventing immigrants from
entering Taiwan under the guise of foreign spouses through marriages of
convenience with Taiwanese men and women, Lo said.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, the U.S. State Department in its annual global human
trafficking report has also praised the effectiveness of the interview method in
helping crack down on cross-border  human trafficking.</P>
      <P>As of the end of February this year, the number of foreign husbands and wives of
Taiwanese citizens living in Taiwan had hit around 140,000, according to
statistics.</P>
      <P>As high as 58 percent of the foreign wives in Taiwan are from Vietnam, he noted.</P>
      <P>As a large number of Vietnamese women get married to men from Taiwan, France,
the United States and South Korea every year, the authorities here, as well as
those in the other three countries, all require their outposts or embassies in
Vietnam to conduct interviews with would-be Vietnamese spouses seeking to marry
citizens from their respective countries, Lo pointed out.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese government also interviews its own nationals, as well as their
would-be foreign wives or husbands, before issuing marriage certificates, also
in a bid to crack down on marriages of convenience, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, NIA Director-General Hsieh Li-kung said NIA
agents have detained 302 foreigners suspected of having entered marriages of
convenience with Taiwanese people since the agency's establishment Jan. 2, 2007.</P>
      <P>Hsieh echoed Lo's view that the interview mechanism has been very helpful in
cracking down on the practice.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Feeding fish with food blended with ground bamboo charcoal can be a natural way
to boost their growth and greatly enhance the efficiency of aquaculture,
according to the results of a study released over the weekend by the Fisheries
Research Institute (FRI) under the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The results were achieved through experiments in which fish food containing
ground bamboo charcoal was used to feed Taiwan tilapia, a species farmed mainly
for its meat.</P>
      <P>It was found that the fish fed with ground bamboo charcoal showed significantly
better results in terms of weight gain, growth and length-weight factor than
those fed with normal food.</P>
      <P>The experiments also showed that using ground bamboo charcoal and bamboo vinegar
simultaneously produced better results than using ground bamboo charcoal alone.</P>
      <P>According the FRI, previous experiments had indicated that wood charcoal and
wood vinegar can yield similar outcome.</P>
      <P>For example, feeding eels with food that incorporates ground wood charcoal and
wood vinegar improves  fish growth and the feed conversion rate and boosts the
fish's immunity against diseases, the FRI said.</P>
      <P>Also, giving ground wood charcoal and wood vinegar to scads decreases fat
accumulation in the abdomen of the fish and reduces the relative ratios of body
weight to liver weight, thus raising their meat content, the FRI stated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, using the ingredients to raise carp helps ease the negative impact of
nitrogen and phosphorus on the environment, the study found.</P>
      <P>The FRI noted that the strong absorptive properties of charcoal have been proven
effective in deodorizing and decomposing harmful chemical substances, and that
bamboo charcoal works better than wood charcoal in this respect because of its
uniform and compact texture.</P>
      <P>The application of bamboo charcoal in animal husbandry has also produced
impressive results, according to the FRI.</P>
      <P>For instance, feeding hogs with ground bamboo charcoal can relieve gas and
diarrhea and boost the animals' appetite, the FRI said. When used in chicken
farming, it can make the meat more tender, increase egg-laying rates and greatly
reduce the stench of the chickens' droppings, it said.</P>
      <P>Also, feeding bamboo charcoal to lambs can enhance their growth and increase
their protein digestion and nitrogen deposition, the FRI said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Several labor unions are preparing to hold a protest march in Taipei on May 1 --
Labor Day -- to demand that the government create long-term stable work for the
jobless.</P>
      <P>Representatives  of the groups,  which include  the Taiwan Confederation of
Trade Unions (TCTU), the National Federation of Bank Employees Unions (NFBEU)
and the Youth Labor Union 95, held a press conference Monday in Taipei to
announce the protest.</P>
      <P>TCTU Secretary-General  Hsieh  Chuang-chih  said it is the government's
obligation to create work and curb the increasing unemployment in the face of
the global economic crisis.</P>
      <P>NFBEU Secretary-General Han Shih-hsien said for his part that the massive
layoffs over the past few months by financial services operators and electronics
manufacturing companies reflects the fact that workers' rights and benefits are
not protected by the law at all.</P>
      <P>Han suggested that the government amend the law to prohibit employers from using
contract workers in an "inappropriate manner, " as well to ban the business of
short-term labor dispatch operators, as this does not provide workers with long-
term and stable jobs.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Youth Labor Union 95 Convener Chen Puo-chien suggested
that the government should appropriate NT$80 billion (US$2.4 billion) from its
special budgets each year to funnel into plans to further expand its middle- and
long-term public services in fields such as nature conservation and long-term
health care for senior citizens.</P>
      <P>With that money, the government could hire as many as 160,000 people to work in
public services, offering salaries of up to NT$500,000 per annum, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, the unemployment rate increased to 5.75 percent in
February, up by 1.81 percentage points from the level of the same month of the
previous year.</P>
      <P>In the same month, Hong Kong registered an unemployment rate of 5 percent, with
4.1 percent recorded in Japan, 3.5 percent in South Korea and 2.6 percent in
Singapore, the tallies show.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) in March dropped by 0.15 percent from the
same month of last year, the second consecutive month deflation had been
recorded, according to a report released Monday by the Directorate  General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>For the first quarter of this year, the CPI contracted by 0.01 percent year-on-
year, indicating continued moderation of inflation, the report states.</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-ming, a DGBAS section chief, said the mild deflation in March reflected
the combined influences of a drop in fuel prices and a rise in the price of food
and electricity.</P>
      <P>While transport and communication costs declined 6.49 percent year-on-year in
March, food prices went up 2.64 percent, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>However,  the core CPI,  which excludes  prices of fruit, vegetables,  fish,
shellfish and energy, rose by 0.81 percent year-on-year in March, the DGBAS
report shows.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the wholesale price index (WPI) dropped by 9.2 percent year-on-year
in March, marking the fifth consecutive month in which a year-on-year decline
was recorded, mainly due to a continued plunge in international agricultural and
industrial commodities, the report continues.</P>
      <P>Import and export prices calculated in U.S. dollars plummeted by 21.05 percent
and 14.98 percent year-on-year, respectively, both figures marking the largest
decline on record, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Calculated in new Taiwan dollars, import and export prices were down 11.41
percent and 4.57 percent, respectively, the report states, adding that the
difference in percentages mainly results from fluctuations in the respective
currency exchange rates.</P>
      <P>For the first quarter of the year, the WPI lost 9.77 percent year-on-year,
according to the DGBAS.</P>

      <P>Business turnover at the Central Taiwan Science Park in February reached NT$10.3
billion (US$309 million), up about by 20 percent over the January figure of
NT$8.6 billion, the park administration reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Thanks to gradually rebounding business sentiment across the world, the park's
revenue has grown month-to-month during the first two months of this year after
its operations plunged in the fourth quarter  of last  year due to the global
financial  crisis, administration officials said.</P>
      <P>Although the combined two-month revenue of the park remains lower compared to
the level posted in the same period last year, the officials said that the
park's revenue is expected to continue increasing each month from its present
relatively low level due to an improved business climate.</P>
      <P>Outperforming other sectors, the precision machinery industry recorded  an
outstanding  growth  rate of 37 percent  in the January-February period, the
officials noted.</P>
      <P>Facilities in the Central Taiwan Science Park are located in Taichung City,
Taichung County and nearby Changhua and Yunlin counties, housing more than 150
high-tech companies.</P>
      <P>The park was established in 2002 by the Executive Yuan. It is one of three major

      <P>Eight Taiwanese artists participating in the renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theaters
2008Wandererprogram on Monday shared their experiences and inspirations gained
from their travels in seven Asian countries, revealing how the trips changed
their lives and brought Taiwan closer to different cultures.</P>
      <P>The eight artists were winners of the 2008 Wanderer program, which provides
subsidies for artists to travel abroad or take time off to gain artistic
inspiration.</P>
      <P>Sharing stories about their trips to different countries through dance, music
and documentary films, the group, including four up-and-coming artists Pan Jung-
sheng, Wang Shih-wei, Tzeng Ching-wen and Yang Huei-tsi, and four professional
artists -- Hsue Chang-huei, Laka Wumao, Chang Yung-chieh,  and Lu Shih-ming
explained how cross-cultural exchanges have increased their sense of self-worth
and beliefs.</P>
      <P>For many of them, their trips were not over after coming back to Taiwan because
they initiated various projects to increase cultural understanding between
Taiwan and these countries, as well as to provide assistance to those in need in
the impoverished areas they visited.</P>
      <P>Documentary filmmaker Hsue Chang-huei, who spent three months in Iran, used her
camera to unveil the mysteries of the Middle East country.  During  her visit to
the Iranian  Documentary  Film Association, she managed to gain the rights to
broadcast 14 Iranian documentary films in Taiwan, and is now looking for
sponsorship to hold a Taiwan-Iran documentary film festival.</P>
      <P>I hope the cultural distance between Taiwan and Iran will be shortened through
the exchanges of these films,Hsue said.</P>
      <P>Having traveled to Malawi, Cambodia, and Vanuatu in the Pacific prior to joining
the program, Yang Huei-tsi is a well-experienced overseas volunteer. In her trip
to Chinas Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi provinces as part of the Wanderer program
to learn wax printing from the minority groups there, she decided to build a new
school for a dozen orphans of the Yao tribe.</P>
      <P>After 10 months of fund raising in Taiwan, Yang is scheduled to go back to
Guangxi later this month to start the construction. She called on the public to
make continuous efforts to help her see the project through to completion.</P>
      <P>The Wanderer program was initiated in 2004 by Cloud Gate Theater founder Lin
Hwai-min and has been sponsored by Stan Shih, founder of the laptop maker, the
Acer group, since 2006.</P>
      <P>Since then, the program has provided financial assistance to a total of 41
Taiwanese artists.</P>
      <P>Lin said at the news conference Monday that he was deeply touched by the courage
and passion demonstrated by the eight artists, who pursued their dreams with an
open heart while at the same time tried their best to make contributions to
society.</P>
      <P>Shih, founder of the program's sponsor Stans Foundation, agreed.</P>
      <P>These trips have not only enriched the artists, but also society,Shih said.</P>
      <P>The Cloud Gate Theater on Monday also announced that the 2010 Wander program is
now accepting applications from budding artists, professional artists or people
in social service under the age of 45, who have an enthusiasm for literature,
music, performance art, or image art.</P>
      <P>Artists interested in the program can obtain more information at
www.cloudgate.org.tw or contact the dance company at 02-2712-2102.</P>
      <P>The deadline for applying is July 15.</P>

      <P>The "Discover Gulliver" exhibition in the central city of Taichung will be
extended from April 6 to April 12 to allow more members of the public,
especially children, to see the structure of the human body from within a
specially built giant human model, the sponsor of the event announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The Paper Windmill Foundation, which built the 60-meter-long, seven-meter-high
model at a cost of NT$10 million (US$302,970), said the exhibition has attracted
more than 45,000 visitors since it opened at Taichung's Wenhsin Forest Park
April 3, and the foundation decided to extend the show at the request of
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu.</P>
      <P>According  to Paper Windmill  Theater  Chief Director  Jen Chien-cheng, the
giant human figure has a face modeled on that of the Seediq warrior Mona Rudao,
who led the aboriginal people of his tribe in an armed rebellion against their
Japanese occupiers in central Taiwan's Nantou County in 1930.</P>
      <P>Jen said the mobile exhibition is a gift to Taiwan's children for 2009
Children's Day, which fell on April 4.</P>
      <P>The structure is actually an inflated tent supported by a steel frame, with
bones, muscles, internal organs and teeth made from polyvinyl chloride and
polyresin.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is named "Discover Gulliver" after Gulliver, a renowned fictional
Englishman who travels to Lilliput, an imaginary land of tiny people, in the
classic satirical novel by Jonathan Swift first published in 1726.</P>
      <P>Visitors enter the body of Gulliver from his foot and travel along a route that
passes his shinbone, muscles, large intestine, small intestine, lungs, beating
heart, mouth, teeth -- some of which even have cavities -- and nasal chamber
before exiting through an ear.</P>
      <P>Explanations are provided by accompanying guides and the whole journey takes
between 10 and 15 minutes.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) toughened its rhetoric Monday over North
Koreas firing of a rocket over Japan a day earlier, condemning the Communist

      <P>Following Vice Foreign Minister Javier C.S. Hous expression of grave concern

statement later on Monday to condemn Pyongyangs rocket launch.</P>
      <P>As a member of East Asia, the Republic of China (ROC) deeply regrets North
Koreas action of sabotaging the stability of East Asia and therefore voices
condemnation of such behavior,said MOFA spokesman Henry Chen.</P>
      <P>Pyongyangs rocket launch not only violated the United Nations Security Council
Resolution 1718, but also created tension and impacted the security and
stability of the Asia Pacific region, the MOFA said in a press release.</P>
      <P>It also called for the relevant parties in the world to act according to U.N.
regulations regarding the matter, and to exercise self-restraint and be rational

      <P>A local dance troupe will premiere a new show titled "The Song of the Seediq --
Dana Sakura" April 8 in central Taiwan's Nantou County, which tells the story of
how the indigenous Seediq tribe fought against their Japanese colonialists in
1930 in an uprising known as the Wushe Incident.</P>
      <P>The show marks the first modern dance in Taiwan's history to be created based on
the historic tragedy that ended in a massacre of the tribesmen by the Japanese,
said Hung Chu-ling, arts director of the Taiwan Youth dance company, affiliated
with the Department of Dance at the Taichung County-based private Youth Senior
High School.</P>
      <P>The play focuses on the same subject matter as that being examined in a film
currently in production and titled "Seediq Bale, " directed by local filmmaker
Wei Te-sheng who burst into the spotlight with his 2008 low-budget film "Cape
No. 7, " which has smashed box office records in Taiwan, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Many local artists, including a composer and Teng Hsiang-yang -- who wrote "Dana
Sakura" -- created the score for the dance that tells a story barely addressed
in local society, she said, adding her hope that through the dance, audiences
will gain a better knowledge of the Seediq people, their life and their culture.</P>
      <P>After the premiere, the youth troupe will perform the dance drama again in
Nantou May 2 and then in Taichung City May 8 and Taipei City May 16, according
to the organizer.</P>
      <P>The Seediq are a Taiwanese aboriginal tribe living primarily in Nantou County
and Hualien County. They were officially recognized as Taiwan's 14th indigenous
group April 23, 2008. Previously, the tribe, along with the closely related
Truku people, were classified as Atayal, a different tribe altogether.</P>

      <P>Two communist parties, established in July and December last year, have formally
registered themselves with the Ministry  of the Interior and become legally
protected  civic organizations in Taiwan, the Interior Ministry confirmed
Monday.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials pointed out that the Taiwan Communist Party was founded after
the justices of the Constitutional Court under the Judicial Yuan ruled on June
20 last year that provisions in the Civil Associations Act banning citizens of
the Republic of China from advocating communism or separatism were
unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the court's constitutional interpretation 644, those
provisions were nullified with immediate effect because they were inconsistent
with the people's right to freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom
of expression.</P>
      <P>The founder of the Taiwan Communist Party had tried several times since 1994 to
apply to the Interior Ministry to form the communist party but had been rejected
every time because preaching communism in Taiwan was illegal until the June 20
ruling.</P>
      <P>The party was founded on July 20 and registered with the Interior Ministry
within 30 days to become Taiwan's 141st political party.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 27 last year, the second communist party -- the Republic of China
Communist Party -- was formed in Taipei, and its application to register the
party with the Interior Ministry was filed early this year.</P>
      <P>The party was formally approved on March 31, becoming Taiwan's 147th political
party.</P>
      <P>Neither of the communist parties are subordinate to the Communist Party of China
although one of them has explicitly called for Taiwan's eventual reunification
with China through peaceful means.</P>

      <P>Sniffer dogs have become more important in detecting illegal narcotics at
customs checkpoints, detecting some 20 percent of the illegal drugs brought in
by travelers at Taiwan's biggest airport in the first quarter, customs
authorities reported Monday.</P>
      <P>More than 90 kilograms  of unlawful drugs smuggled in by passengers were
confiscated at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in the first three months of
this year, with about 20 percent of the drugs discovered by dogs serving at the
airport, said the Taipei Customs Office under the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>In other neighboring Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea, sniffer dogs
can detect more than 30 percent of the drugs smuggled into their airports.</P>
      <P>The nation's squad of 26 drug sniffer dogs was established in 2002 to help
customs agents crack down on an increased smuggling of illegal substances.
Currently, six or seven sniffer dogs are serving at the Taoyuan airport near
Taipei.</P>
      <P>It is a growing trend across the globe to use sniffer dogs at air and sea ports
to detect the smuggling of narcotics, the agents said.</P>
      <P>Most drug traffickers concealed smuggled drugs in their luggage, while some of
them were body packers who attempted to transport illicit drugs by concealing
them in their cavities, the agents said.</P>
      <P>Besides the work of the dogs, a majority -- 67 percent -- of banned drugs seized
were discovered by customs agents with the help of X-ray machines, while the
remaining 13 percent were tracked down through tip-offs, according to an

    <HEADLINE>Sewage blamed for deterioration of coral reefs off Kenting</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 6 (CNA)
04/06/09  21:42:45
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The continued discharge of untreated sewage into waters off Kenting National
Park in southern Taiwan is responsible for the deterioration of coral reefs in
the area, an academic said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsing-juh, a professor in National Chung Hsing University's Department of
Life Sciences, came to the conclusion after monitoring and studying coral reef
ecosystems off Taiwan's southernmost tip for over a decade.</P>
      <P>His findings were published recently in the prestigious journal Limnology and
Oceanography.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, for coral reefs to thrive, they must grow in clean shallow
water, with a low density of anthropogenic nutrients, a stable density of salt,
moderate temperatures and bright sunshine.</P>
      <P>Human encroachment in the form of excessive development and the arrival of 4
million tourists a year in the Kenting area has led to an influx of sewage into
Kenting's coastal regions, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin found that Kenting's Nanwan and Wanlitung, which boast the largest
concentration of tourists, have suffered the most serious entrophication.</P>
      <P>To facilitate his study, Lin established a mesocosm -- a controlled ecosystem
approximating natural conditions -- to conduct extensive observations and
experiments and verify his findings.</P>
      <P>"Outdoor field surveys can only observe the results of coral reef deterioration
while providing no clues to the processes and causes of the degeneration," Lin
explained.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium in
southern Taiwan's Pingtung County, Lin managed to build a mesocosm -- the first
of its kind built in the world -- that replicated the coral reef ecosystem in
Nanwan 20 years ago when there was less human activity.</P>
      <P>After 10 years of observation, simulations and experiments, Lin reached his
conclusion that untreated sewage is to blame for the deterioration of the
Kenting coral reef ecosystem.</P>
      <P>To replicate the process of polluting the waters in the area, Lin introduced
sewage or anthropogenic (human-made) nutrients into the mesocosm at a rate of
5.5 mmol per square meter.</P>
      <P>Mmol, or millimoles, is a unit measuring the amount of a substance.</P>
      <P>"It turned out that algae grew rapidly and completely covered corals, resulting
in the death of the corals, " Lin said. He also observed that normally passive
sea anemones also began to attack the coral following the introduction of the
sewage.</P>
      <P>Overfishing, particularly of fish species that can stem the growth of algae and
sea anemones, has led to a further imbalance in Kenting's ecosystem, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Noting that coral reefs are natural habitats for more than 25 percent of marine
life and fish output from coral reefs accounts for 12 percent of the global fish
catch, Lin said conservation of natural coral reef ecosystem was essential.</P>
      <P>Coral reefs are also important because they can help protect the coastline,
minimize beach erosion from big waves and tsunamis, and nurture coastal fishery
resources, he added.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the most urgent task at present is to prevent the excessive flow
of sewage or anthropogenic contaminants into coastal waters and step up the
conservation of coral reefs and fish species.</P>

      <P>The government is doing everything it can to rescue a Taiwanese deep-sea fishing
vessel hijacked by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean early Monday, a Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said later in the day.</P>
      <P>The 700-ton long-line fishing ship "Win Far 161, " with 30 crew members on
board, was hijacked near an island in the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean, said
Chang Yun-ping, director-general of the MOFA's Department of African Affairs.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, only the ship's skipper and first engineer are Taiwanese
nationals, while all other crew members originate from China, the Philippines
and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ministry has sought the assistance of the U.K. Maritime Trade
Organization, the maritime liaison office of America's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet,
the Seychelles fishery bureau and the Somali harbor bureau in rescuing the
hijacked Kaohsiung-based long-liner.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  Chang said, the ministry is endeavoring to get information about the
hijacked ship's latest situation through the country's representative office in
South Africa and other channels.</P>
      <P>"We have gained knowledge of the Win Far's current location. It is more than
1,000 kilometers away from land, " Chang said. He added, however, that the
ministry has yet to receive any information related to the pirates' ransom
request.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the ministry will seek China's help in rescuing the ship, Chang
said that as China's military fleet is currently patrolling the Gulf of Aden and
the estuary of the Red Sea, far north of where the Win Far was hijacked, the
ministry has no plan to approach China for assistance at the moment.</P>
      <P>According to a foreign wire service report, the Taiwanese ship was the second
attack by Somali pirates in the Seychelles within a week. A small Yemeni boat
was also hijacked near the Seychelles Sunday.</P>
      <P>Analysts say the pirates have moved many of their operations out of the Gulf of
Aden, which is heavily patrolled by naval warships from a number of countries,
including China, the United States, France and India.</P>
      <P>Instead, they are targeting ships coming out of the Mozambique Channel, an area
of the Indian Ocean farther south between the southeastern Africa coast and

      <P>Songkran, the most important festival of Thailand, falls on April 13 every year

performances by singers and dancers from Thailand.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Taiwanese people are also welcome to join the Thai
workers in their celebrations.</P>
      <P>Songkran is a Thai word meaning "move" or "change place" as it is the day when
the sun changes its position in the zodiac.</P>
      <P>During the festival, Thai people gather in the streets to sing and dance,
knowing they will be splashed with water and get soaked to improve their luck.</P>
      <P>@There are about 90,000 Thai laborers working in Taiwan and most of them are
concentrated in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan County government and the Thailand Trade and Economic Office in

    <HEADLINE>President's former aide released on parole</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An aide of President Ma Ying-jeou during the president's tenure as mayor of
Taipei City who was convicted of embezzlement was released on parole Monday
after being incarcerated for nine months.</P>
      <P>Yu Wen was given a one-year jail sentence early last year on charges of forgery
for using other peoples' invoices to help Ma claim reimbursements from the
special allowance fund set aside for the mayor's discretionary use.</P>
      <P>Yu, who said he deserved to be punished for neglecting his duties, was jailed in
June 2008 and granted early parole by the Ministry of Justice recently for good
behavior.</P>
      <P>Ma was also indicted, on charges of embezzling NT$11 million (US$332,684) from
the special allowance fund he received as Taipei mayor from 1998 to 2006, but
was acquitted by both the Taipei District Court Aug. 14, 2007 and by the Taiwan
High Court Dec. 28, 2007.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors filed an appeal with the Supreme Court in January 2008 against the
not-guilty verdict handed down by the Taiwan High Court, but the Supreme Court
rejected the appeal in April of that year and upheld the previous district and
high court rulings for Ma.</P>
      <P>Talking to the press upon his departure from jail, Yu said he had not illegally
lined his pockets with a single cent during his time in public service.  Noting
that he merely wrote off the mayor's expenditures using alternative means, Yu
said he believes the law will eventually clear his name.</P>
      <P>He declined to answer a reporter's question on whether Ma had corresponded with
him while he was doing time.</P>
      <P>In related news, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Monday that if Yu files an
application with the Taipei city government to resume his post as a secretary,
it will be considered in full accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>According to the law, Yu, whose wrongdoing involved no major crimes such as
sedition, treason or serious corruption, can apply to return to the city
government after his sentence term expires.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Interviews help reduce mixed marriages of convenience: officials</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 6 (CNA)

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An interview system to screen transnational marriages has succeeded in reducing
the number of marriages of convenience by an average of 25 percent annually over
the past three years, government officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lo Yu-chung, director-general of the Bureau of Consular Affairs under the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), and officials from the National Immigration
Agency (NIA) under the Ministry of the Interior made the remarks while fielding
questions from lawmakers at a legislative committee meeting about related
mechanisms.</P>
      <P>Since the MOFA implemented the interview scheme in May 2005 to step up the
screening process for transnational marriages involving Taiwanese citizens, Lo
said, Taiwanese officials posted overseas have turned down an annual average of
25 percent of such applications following face-to-face interviews during the
2006-2008 period.</P>
      <P>In 2008, Taiwan's representative office in Vietnam rejected 35 percent of the
total marriage applications between Taiwanese and Vietnamese people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's representative  offices in Indonesia  and Thailand recorded  rejection
ratios of 36.2 percent and 33.8 percent, respectively, last year, while the
representative office in the Philippines reported an 18.3 percent rejection
rate, he went on.</P>
      <P>Conducting interviews has proven very effective in preventing immigrants from
entering Taiwan under the guise of foreign spouses through marriages of
convenience with Taiwanese men and women, Lo said.</P>
      <P>According to Lo, the U.S. State Department in its annual global human
trafficking report has also praised the effectiveness of the interview method in
helping crack down on cross-border  human trafficking.</P>
      <P>As of the end of February this year, the number of foreign husbands and wives of
Taiwanese citizens living in Taiwan had hit around 140,000, according to
statistics.</P>
      <P>As high as 58 percent of the foreign wives in Taiwan are from Vietnam, he noted.</P>
      <P>As a large number of Vietnamese women get married to men from Taiwan, France,
the United States and South Korea every year, the authorities here, as well as
those in the other three countries, all require their outposts or embassies in
Vietnam to conduct interviews with would-be Vietnamese spouses seeking to marry
citizens from their respective countries, Lo pointed out.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese government also interviews its own nationals, as well as their
would-be foreign wives or husbands, before issuing marriage certificates, also
in a bid to crack down on marriages of convenience, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, NIA Director-General Hsieh Li-kung said NIA
agents have detained 302 foreigners suspected of having entered marriages of
convenience with Taiwanese people since the agency's establishment Jan. 2, 2007.</P>
      <P>Hsieh echoed Lo's view that the interview mechanism has been very helpful in
cracking down on the practice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Bamboo charcoal can boost fish growth: study</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
04/06/09  16:59:25
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Feeding fish with food blended with ground bamboo charcoal can be a natural way
to boost their growth and greatly enhance the efficiency of aquaculture,
according to the results of a study released over the weekend by the Fisheries
Research Institute (FRI) under the Council of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>The results were achieved through experiments in which fish food containing
ground bamboo charcoal was used to feed Taiwan tilapia, a species farmed mainly
for its meat.</P>
      <P>It was found that the fish fed with ground bamboo charcoal showed significantly
better results in terms of weight gain, growth and length-weight factor than
those fed with normal food.</P>
      <P>The experiments also showed that using ground bamboo charcoal and bamboo vinegar
simultaneously produced better results than using ground bamboo charcoal alone.</P>
      <P>According the FRI, previous experiments had indicated that wood charcoal and
wood vinegar can yield similar outcome.</P>
      <P>For example, feeding eels with food that incorporates ground wood charcoal and
wood vinegar improves  fish growth and the feed conversion rate and boosts the
fish's immunity against diseases, the FRI said.</P>
      <P>Also, giving ground wood charcoal and wood vinegar to scads decreases fat
accumulation in the abdomen of the fish and reduces the relative ratios of body
weight to liver weight, thus raising their meat content, the FRI stated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, using the ingredients to raise carp helps ease the negative impact of
nitrogen and phosphorus on the environment, the study found.</P>
      <P>The FRI noted that the strong absorptive properties of charcoal have been proven
effective in deodorizing and decomposing harmful chemical substances, and that
bamboo charcoal works better than wood charcoal in this respect because of its
uniform and compact texture.</P>
      <P>The application of bamboo charcoal in animal husbandry has also produced
impressive results, according to the FRI.</P>
      <P>For instance, feeding hogs with ground bamboo charcoal can relieve gas and
diarrhea and boost the animals' appetite, the FRI said. When used in chicken
farming, it can make the meat more tender, increase egg-laying rates and greatly
reduce the stench of the chickens' droppings, it said.</P>
      <P>Also, feeding bamboo charcoal to lambs can enhance their growth and increase
their protein digestion and nitrogen deposition, the FRI said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Labor unions to hold protest march against unemployment</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
04/06/09  16:59:51
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several labor unions are preparing to hold a protest march in Taipei on May 1 --
Labor Day -- to demand that the government create long-term stable work for the
jobless.</P>
      <P>Representatives  of the groups,  which include  the Taiwan Confederation of
Trade Unions (TCTU), the National Federation of Bank Employees Unions (NFBEU)
and the Youth Labor Union 95, held a press conference Monday in Taipei to
announce the protest.</P>
      <P>TCTU Secretary-General  Hsieh  Chuang-chih  said it is the government's
obligation to create work and curb the increasing unemployment in the face of
the global economic crisis.</P>
      <P>NFBEU Secretary-General Han Shih-hsien said for his part that the massive
layoffs over the past few months by financial services operators and electronics
manufacturing companies reflects the fact that workers' rights and benefits are
not protected by the law at all.</P>
      <P>Han suggested that the government amend the law to prohibit employers from using
contract workers in an "inappropriate manner, " as well to ban the business of
short-term labor dispatch operators, as this does not provide workers with long-
term and stable jobs.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Youth Labor Union 95 Convener Chen Puo-chien suggested
that the government should appropriate NT$80 billion (US$2.4 billion) from its
special budgets each year to funnel into plans to further expand its middle- and
long-term public services in fields such as nature conservation and long-term
health care for senior citizens.</P>
      <P>With that money, the government could hire as many as 160,000 people to work in
public services, offering salaries of up to NT$500,000 per annum, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, the unemployment rate increased to 5.75 percent in
February, up by 1.81 percentage points from the level of the same month of the
previous year.</P>
      <P>In the same month, Hong Kong registered an unemployment rate of 5 percent, with
4.1 percent recorded in Japan, 3.5 percent in South Korea and 2.6 percent in
Singapore, the tallies show.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) in March dropped by 0.15 percent from the
same month of last year, the second consecutive month deflation had been
recorded, according to a report released Monday by the Directorate  General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>For the first quarter of this year, the CPI contracted by 0.01 percent year-on-
year, indicating continued moderation of inflation, the report states.</P>
      <P>Wu Chao-ming, a DGBAS section chief, said the mild deflation in March reflected
the combined influences of a drop in fuel prices and a rise in the price of food
and electricity.</P>
      <P>While transport and communication costs declined 6.49 percent year-on-year in
March, food prices went up 2.64 percent, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>However,  the core CPI,  which excludes  prices of fruit, vegetables,  fish,
shellfish and energy, rose by 0.81 percent year-on-year in March, the DGBAS
report shows.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the wholesale price index (WPI) dropped by 9.2 percent year-on-year
in March, marking the fifth consecutive month in which a year-on-year decline
was recorded, mainly due to a continued plunge in international agricultural and
industrial commodities, the report continues.</P>
      <P>Import and export prices calculated in U.S. dollars plummeted by 21.05 percent
and 14.98 percent year-on-year, respectively, both figures marking the largest
decline on record, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Calculated in new Taiwan dollars, import and export prices were down 11.41
percent and 4.57 percent, respectively, the report states, adding that the
difference in percentages mainly results from fluctuations in the respective
currency exchange rates.</P>
      <P>For the first quarter of the year, the WPI lost 9.77 percent year-on-year,
according to the DGBAS.</P>

      <P>Business turnover at the Central Taiwan Science Park in February reached NT$10.3
billion (US$309 million), up about by 20 percent over the January figure of
NT$8.6 billion, the park administration reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Thanks to gradually rebounding business sentiment across the world, the park's
revenue has grown month-to-month during the first two months of this year after
its operations plunged in the fourth quarter  of last  year due to the global
financial  crisis, administration officials said.</P>
      <P>Although the combined two-month revenue of the park remains lower compared to
the level posted in the same period last year, the officials said that the
park's revenue is expected to continue increasing each month from its present
relatively low level due to an improved business climate.</P>
      <P>Outperforming other sectors, the precision machinery industry recorded  an
outstanding  growth  rate of 37 percent  in the January-February period, the
officials noted.</P>
      <P>Facilities in the Central Taiwan Science Park are located in Taichung City,
Taichung County and nearby Changhua and Yunlin counties, housing more than 150
high-tech companies.</P>
      <P>The park was established in 2002 by the Executive Yuan. It is one of three major

      <P>Eight Taiwanese artists participating in the renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theaters
2008Wandererprogram on Monday shared their experiences and inspirations gained
from their travels in seven Asian countries, revealing how the trips changed
their lives and brought Taiwan closer to different cultures.</P>
      <P>The eight artists were winners of the 2008 Wanderer program, which provides
subsidies for artists to travel abroad or take time off to gain artistic
inspiration.</P>
      <P>Sharing stories about their trips to different countries through dance, music
and documentary films, the group, including four up-and-coming artists Pan Jung-
sheng, Wang Shih-wei, Tzeng Ching-wen and Yang Huei-tsi, and four professional
artists -- Hsue Chang-huei, Laka Wumao, Chang Yung-chieh,  and Lu Shih-ming
explained how cross-cultural exchanges have increased their sense of self-worth
and beliefs.</P>
      <P>For many of them, their trips were not over after coming back to Taiwan because
they initiated various projects to increase cultural understanding between
Taiwan and these countries, as well as to provide assistance to those in need in
the impoverished areas they visited.</P>
      <P>Documentary filmmaker Hsue Chang-huei, who spent three months in Iran, used her
camera to unveil the mysteries of the Middle East country.  During  her visit to
the Iranian  Documentary  Film Association, she managed to gain the rights to
broadcast 14 Iranian documentary films in Taiwan, and is now looking for
sponsorship to hold a Taiwan-Iran documentary film festival.</P>
      <P>I hope the cultural distance between Taiwan and Iran will be shortened through
the exchanges of these films,Hsue said.</P>
      <P>Having traveled to Malawi, Cambodia, and Vanuatu in the Pacific prior to joining
the program, Yang Huei-tsi is a well-experienced overseas volunteer. In her trip
to Chinas Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi provinces as part of the Wanderer program
to learn wax printing from the minority groups there, she decided to build a new
school for a dozen orphans of the Yao tribe.</P>
      <P>After 10 months of fund raising in Taiwan, Yang is scheduled to go back to
Guangxi later this month to start the construction. She called on the public to
make continuous efforts to help her see the project through to completion.</P>
      <P>The Wanderer program was initiated in 2004 by Cloud Gate Theater founder Lin
Hwai-min and has been sponsored by Stan Shih, founder of the laptop maker, the
Acer group, since 2006.</P>
      <P>Since then, the program has provided financial assistance to a total of 41
Taiwanese artists.</P>
      <P>Lin said at the news conference Monday that he was deeply touched by the courage
and passion demonstrated by the eight artists, who pursued their dreams with an
open heart while at the same time tried their best to make contributions to
society.</P>
      <P>Shih, founder of the program's sponsor Stans Foundation, agreed.</P>
      <P>These trips have not only enriched the artists, but also society,Shih said.</P>
      <P>The Cloud Gate Theater on Monday also announced that the 2010 Wander program is
now accepting applications from budding artists, professional artists or people
in social service under the age of 45, who have an enthusiasm for literature,
music, performance art, or image art.</P>
      <P>Artists interested in the program can obtain more information at
www.cloudgate.org.tw or contact the dance company at 02-2712-2102.</P>
      <P>The deadline for applying is July 15.</P>

      <P>The "Discover Gulliver" exhibition in the central city of Taichung will be
extended from April 6 to April 12 to allow more members of the public,
especially children, to see the structure of the human body from within a
specially built giant human model, the sponsor of the event announced Monday.</P>
      <P>The Paper Windmill Foundation, which built the 60-meter-long, seven-meter-high
model at a cost of NT$10 million (US$302,970), said the exhibition has attracted
more than 45,000 visitors since it opened at Taichung's Wenhsin Forest Park
April 3, and the foundation decided to extend the show at the request of
Taichung Mayor Jason Hu.</P>
      <P>According  to Paper Windmill  Theater  Chief Director  Jen Chien-cheng, the
giant human figure has a face modeled on that of the Seediq warrior Mona Rudao,
who led the aboriginal people of his tribe in an armed rebellion against their
Japanese occupiers in central Taiwan's Nantou County in 1930.</P>
      <P>Jen said the mobile exhibition is a gift to Taiwan's children for 2009
Children's Day, which fell on April 4.</P>
      <P>The structure is actually an inflated tent supported by a steel frame, with
bones, muscles, internal organs and teeth made from polyvinyl chloride and
polyresin.</P>
      <P>The exhibition is named "Discover Gulliver" after Gulliver, a renowned fictional
Englishman who travels to Lilliput, an imaginary land of tiny people, in the
classic satirical novel by Jonathan Swift first published in 1726.</P>
      <P>Visitors enter the body of Gulliver from his foot and travel along a route that
passes his shinbone, muscles, large intestine, small intestine, lungs, beating
heart, mouth, teeth -- some of which even have cavities -- and nasal chamber
before exiting through an ear.</P>
      <P>Explanations are provided by accompanying guides and the whole journey takes

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local dance troupe will premiere a new show titled "The Song of the Seediq --
Dana Sakura" April 8 in central Taiwan's Nantou County, which tells the story of
how the indigenous Seediq tribe fought against their Japanese colonialists in
1930 in an uprising known as the Wushe Incident.</P>
      <P>The show marks the first modern dance in Taiwan's history to be created based on
the historic tragedy that ended in a massacre of the tribesmen by the Japanese,
said Hung Chu-ling, arts director of the Taiwan Youth dance company, affiliated
with the Department of Dance at the Taichung County-based private Youth Senior
High School.</P>
      <P>The play focuses on the same subject matter as that being examined in a film
currently in production and titled "Seediq Bale, " directed by local filmmaker
Wei Te-sheng who burst into the spotlight with his 2008 low-budget film "Cape
No. 7, " which has smashed box office records in Taiwan, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Many local artists, including a composer and Teng Hsiang-yang -- who wrote "Dana
Sakura" -- created the score for the dance that tells a story barely addressed
in local society, she said, adding her hope that through the dance, audiences
will gain a better knowledge of the Seediq people, their life and their culture.</P>
      <P>After the premiere, the youth troupe will perform the dance drama again in
Nantou May 2 and then in Taichung City May 8 and Taipei City May 16, according
to the organizer.</P>
      <P>The Seediq are a Taiwanese aboriginal tribe living primarily in Nantou County
and Hualien County. They were officially recognized as Taiwan's 14th indigenous
group April 23, 2008. Previously, the tribe, along with the closely related
Truku people, were classified as Atayal, a different tribe altogether.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two communist parties, established in July and December last year, have formally
registered themselves with the Ministry  of the Interior and become legally
protected  civic organizations in Taiwan, the Interior Ministry confirmed
Monday.</P>
      <P>Ministry officials pointed out that the Taiwan Communist Party was founded after
the justices of the Constitutional Court under the Judicial Yuan ruled on June
20 last year that provisions in the Civil Associations Act banning citizens of
the Republic of China from advocating communism or separatism were
unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the court's constitutional interpretation 644, those
provisions were nullified with immediate effect because they were inconsistent
with the people's right to freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and freedom
of expression.</P>
      <P>The founder of the Taiwan Communist Party had tried several times since 1994 to
apply to the Interior Ministry to form the communist party but had been rejected
every time because preaching communism in Taiwan was illegal until the June 20
ruling.</P>
      <P>The party was founded on July 20 and registered with the Interior Ministry
within 30 days to become Taiwan's 141st political party.</P>
      <P>On Dec. 27 last year, the second communist party -- the Republic of China
Communist Party -- was formed in Taipei, and its application to register the
party with the Interior Ministry was filed early this year.</P>
      <P>The party was formally approved on March 31, becoming Taiwan's 147th political
party.</P>
      <P>Neither of the communist parties are subordinate to the Communist Party of China
although one of them has explicitly called for Taiwan's eventual reunification
with China through peaceful means.</P>

      <P>Sniffer dogs have become more important in detecting illegal narcotics at
customs checkpoints, detecting some 20 percent of the illegal drugs brought in
by travelers at Taiwan's biggest airport in the first quarter, customs
authorities reported Monday.</P>
      <P>More than 90 kilograms  of unlawful drugs smuggled in by passengers were
confiscated at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in the first three months of
this year, with about 20 percent of the drugs discovered by dogs serving at the
airport, said the Taipei Customs Office under the Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>In other neighboring Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea, sniffer dogs
can detect more than 30 percent of the drugs smuggled into their airports.</P>
      <P>The nation's squad of 26 drug sniffer dogs was established in 2002 to help
customs agents crack down on an increased smuggling of illegal substances.
Currently, six or seven sniffer dogs are serving at the Taoyuan airport near
Taipei.</P>
      <P>It is a growing trend across the globe to use sniffer dogs at air and sea ports
to detect the smuggling of narcotics, the agents said.</P>
      <P>Most drug traffickers concealed smuggled drugs in their luggage, while some of
them were body packers who attempted to transport illicit drugs by concealing
them in their cavities, the agents said.</P>
      <P>Besides the work of the dogs, a majority -- 67 percent -- of banned drugs seized
were discovered by customs agents with the help of X-ray machines, while the
remaining 13 percent were tracked down through tip-offs, according to an
analysis provided by the Taipei Custom Office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Sewage blamed for deterioration of coral reefs off Kenting</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 6 (CNA)
04/06/09  21:42:45
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The continued discharge of untreated sewage into waters off Kenting National
Park in southern Taiwan is responsible for the deterioration of coral reefs in
the area, an academic said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsing-juh, a professor in National Chung Hsing University's Department of
Life Sciences, came to the conclusion after monitoring and studying coral reef
ecosystems off Taiwan's southernmost tip for over a decade.</P>
      <P>His findings were published recently in the prestigious journal Limnology and
Oceanography.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, for coral reefs to thrive, they must grow in clean shallow
water, with a low density of anthropogenic nutrients, a stable density of salt,
moderate temperatures and bright sunshine.</P>
      <P>Human encroachment in the form of excessive development and the arrival of 4
million tourists a year in the Kenting area has led to an influx of sewage into
Kenting's coastal regions, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin found that Kenting's Nanwan and Wanlitung, which boast the largest
concentration of tourists, have suffered the most serious entrophication.</P>
      <P>To facilitate his study, Lin established a mesocosm -- a controlled ecosystem
approximating natural conditions -- to conduct extensive observations and
experiments and verify his findings.</P>
      <P>"Outdoor field surveys can only observe the results of coral reef deterioration
while providing no clues to the processes and causes of the degeneration," Lin
explained.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium in
southern Taiwan's Pingtung County, Lin managed to build a mesocosm -- the first
of its kind built in the world -- that replicated the coral reef ecosystem in
Nanwan 20 years ago when there was less human activity.</P>
      <P>After 10 years of observation, simulations and experiments, Lin reached his
conclusion that untreated sewage is to blame for the deterioration of the
Kenting coral reef ecosystem.</P>
      <P>To replicate the process of polluting the waters in the area, Lin introduced
sewage or anthropogenic (human-made) nutrients into the mesocosm at a rate of
5.5 mmol per square meter.</P>
      <P>Mmol, or millimoles, is a unit measuring the amount of a substance.</P>
      <P>"It turned out that algae grew rapidly and completely covered corals, resulting
in the death of the corals, " Lin said. He also observed that normally passive
sea anemones also began to attack the coral following the introduction of the
sewage.</P>
      <P>Overfishing, particularly of fish species that can stem the growth of algae and
sea anemones, has led to a further imbalance in Kenting's ecosystem, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Noting that coral reefs are natural habitats for more than 25 percent of marine
life and fish output from coral reefs accounts for 12 percent of the global fish
catch, Lin said conservation of natural coral reef ecosystem was essential.</P>
      <P>Coral reefs are also important because they can help protect the coastline,
minimize beach erosion from big waves and tsunamis, and nurture coastal fishery
resources, he added.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the most urgent task at present is to prevent the excessive flow
of sewage or anthropogenic contaminants into coastal waters and step up the
conservation of coral reefs and fish species.</P>

      <P>The government is doing everything it can to rescue a Taiwanese deep-sea fishing
vessel hijacked by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean early Monday, a Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said later in the day.</P>
      <P>The 700-ton long-line fishing ship "Win Far 161, " with 30 crew members on
board, was hijacked near an island in the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean, said
Chang Yun-ping, director-general of the MOFA's Department of African Affairs.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, only the ship's skipper and first engineer are Taiwanese
nationals, while all other crew members originate from China, the Philippines
and Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Chang said the ministry has sought the assistance of the U.K. Maritime Trade
Organization, the maritime liaison office of America's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet,
the Seychelles fishery bureau and the Somali harbor bureau in rescuing the
hijacked Kaohsiung-based long-liner.</P>
      <P>Moreover,  Chang said, the ministry is endeavoring to get information about the
hijacked ship's latest situation through the country's representative office in
South Africa and other channels.</P>
      <P>"We have gained knowledge of the Win Far's current location. It is more than
1,000 kilometers away from land, " Chang said. He added, however, that the
ministry has yet to receive any information related to the pirates' ransom
request.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the ministry will seek China's help in rescuing the ship, Chang
said that as China's military fleet is currently patrolling the Gulf of Aden and
the estuary of the Red Sea, far north of where the Win Far was hijacked, the
ministry has no plan to approach China for assistance at the moment.</P>
      <P>According to a foreign wire service report, the Taiwanese ship was the second
attack by Somali pirates in the Seychelles within a week. A small Yemeni boat
was also hijacked near the Seychelles Sunday.</P>
      <P>Analysts say the pirates have moved many of their operations out of the Gulf of
Aden, which is heavily patrolled by naval warships from a number of countries,
including China, the United States, France and India.</P>
      <P>Instead, they are targeting ships coming out of the Mozambique Channel, an area
of the Indian Ocean farther south between the southeastern Africa coast and
Madagascar.</P>

      <P>The Thailand Trade and Economic Office in Taipei and the Taoyuan County
government are inviting Thai workers in Taiwan to a gathering in a county
stadium on April 12 to celebrate the Songkran Festival and usher in the Thai New
Year.</P>
      <P>Songkran, the most important festival of Thailand, falls on April 13 every year
and lasts three days. It is also known as the "Water Festival" as people believe
that throwing water at one another will wash away bad luck.</P>
      <P>According to Taoyuan County government officials, there will also be
performances by singers and dancers from Thailand.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Taiwanese people are also welcome to join the Thai
workers in their celebrations.</P>
      <P>Songkran is a Thai word meaning "move" or "change place" as it is the day when
the sun changes its position in the zodiac.</P>
      <P>During the festival, Thai people gather in the streets to sing and dance,
knowing they will be splashed with water and get soaked to improve their luck.</P>
      <P>@There are about 90,000 Thai laborers working in Taiwan and most of them are
concentrated in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan County government and the Thailand Trade and Economic Office in
Taiwan have jointly held Songkran celebrations every year since 1999 to ease the
homesickness of Thai workers who cannot return home for the festival, which is
traditionally a time to pay respects to elders and meet old friends.</P>

was also hijacked near the Seychelles Sunday.</P>
      <P>Analysts say the pirates have moved many of their operations out of the Gulf of
Aden, which is heavily patrolled by naval warships from a number of countries,
including China, the United States, France and India.</P>
      <P>Instead, they are targeting ships coming out of the Mozambique Channel, an area
of the Indian Ocean farther south between the southeastern Africa coast and
Madagascar.</P>

      <P>The Thailand Trade and Economic Office in Taipei and the Taoyuan County
government are inviting Thai workers in Taiwan to a gathering in a county
stadium on April 12 to celebrate the Songkran Festival and usher in the Thai New
Year.</P>
      <P>Songkran, the most important festival of Thailand, falls on April 13 every year
and lasts three days. It is also known as the "Water Festival" as people believe
that throwing water at one another will wash away bad luck.</P>
      <P>According to Taoyuan County government officials, there will also be
performances by singers and dancers from Thailand.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Taiwanese people are also welcome to join the Thai
workers in their celebrations.</P>
      <P>Songkran is a Thai word meaning "move" or "change place" as it is the day when
the sun changes its position in the zodiac.</P>
      <P>During the festival, Thai people gather in the streets to sing and dance,
knowing they will be splashed with water and get soaked to improve their luck.</P>
      <P>@There are about 90,000 Thai laborers working in Taiwan and most of them are
concentrated in Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan County government and the Thailand Trade and Economic Office in
Taiwan have jointly held Songkran celebrations every year since 1999 to ease the
homesickness of Thai workers who cannot return home for the festival, which is
traditionally a time to pay respects to elders and meet old friends.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Immigration officials will now be required to report domestic violence cases
after the Legislative Yuan on Tuesday amended the Domestic Violence Prevention
Act,  a step lawmakers hope will improve the protection of foreign spouses.</P>
      <P>The amended law requires immigration  officials  to inform concerned authorities
within 24 hours after discovering such cases, just as social workers are
currently required to do.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang Legislator Shyu Jong-shyong, the initiator of the amendment,
noted that the step is necessary to protect foreign spouses because immigration
officials are the civil servants who maintain the most contact with them.</P>
      <P>As of the end of August 2008, there were approximately 400,000 foreign and
Chinese spouses in Taiwan, Shyu noted, adding that many of them are not aware of
ways to file complaints about domestic violence because of language barriers.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) , 6,539 cases of
domestic violence were reported in January 2009, an increase of 8.9 percent from
the same month of last year when 6,006 cases were reported.</P>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of the cases involved violence between spouses, former spouses
or cohabitants. More than 17 percent concerned abuse of children or teenagers,
and another 3 percent involved assaults on the elderly.</P>
      <P>In 2008, 79,874 domestic violence cases were reported, up 10 percent from 2007
when 72,606 cases were reported, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Concerned that the current economic recession might lead to a spike in the
incidence of this type of abuse, the legislature adopted a rider along with the
passage of the amendment Tuesday that will require the MOI to increase its
budget for domestic violence prevention for 2009.</P>

      <P>No Taiwanese expatriates or tourists were among those killed in a deadly
earthquake that hit central Italy Monday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
confirmed Tuesday while also pledging disaster relief assistance if the Italian
government requests it.</P>
      <P>Anne Hung, director-general of the MOFA's Department of European Affairs, said
at a regular press briefing that according to the Foreign Ministry's
representative office in Rome, no Taiwanese expatriates were among the
casualties in Monday's earthquake in central Italy's Abruzzo.</P>
      <P>She added that three Taiwanese tourist groups that include 58 people traveling
in Italy are also safe and will continue their trips in the country.</P>
      <P>On behalf of Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou and Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, the
foreign ministry has expressed its condolences to the Italian government and the
willingness to offer necessary help if it requests it," Hung said.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen denied speculation that there was any delay in
disclosing the condition of Taiwanese in Italy after the earthquake occurred,
saying that after receiving a call from its representative office in Rome at
9:40 a.m. Taipei time, the ministry took immediate action to try to confirm the
safety of Taiwanese nationals in Italy.</P>
      <P>Protecting our expatriates is the responsibility to which the ministry devotes
absolutely every effort,Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, at least 150 were killed in the 6.3-magnitude quake
-- Italy's deadliest earthquake in three decades -- which also left 1,500
injured and 70,000 homeless.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday that it is closely
monitoring the movement of a Taiwanese deep sea fishing vessel hijacked by
Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean early Monday but still does not have any news
regarding the safety of its crew members.</P>
      <P>The ministry cannot confirm at the moment casualties, if any, among crew members
because we have lost contact with the vessel since yesterday, said MOFA
spokesman Henry Chen at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>But based on past experience, their safety should not be a problem if the
pirates are simply looking to collect a ransom, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the foreign ministry has gained knowledge of the location of
the hijacked vessel and is following its course. But he said the hijackers have
yet to demand a ransom.</P>
      <P>The 700-ton long-line fishing shipWin Far 161was hijacked near an island in the
Seychelles in the Indian Ocean on Monday, according to the MOFA, and it is
currently some 1,500 kilometers away from land.</P>
      <P>Among its 30 crew members, the ship's skipper and first engineer are Taiwanese
nationals, while five other are Chinese, 17 are Filipinos and six are
Indonesian.</P>
      <P>In addition to trying to get the latest information about the ship through its
representative office in South Africa, the foreign ministry has sought the
assistance of the U.K. Maritime Trade Organization, the maritime liaison office
of America's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet, the Seychelles fishery bureau and the
Somali harbor bureau in rescuing the hijacked Kaohsiung-based long-liner.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the ship has sent out a distress signal, Chen said the incident
was reported back to the ship's owner in Taiwan by three other fishing vessels
of the same company working in the area. They all returned to the Seychelles
immediately after the incident occurred.</P>
      <P>As to whether the Chinese government has offered to assist, Chen said so far no
such offer has been made but the ministry is actively seeking help from all
types of channels.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire services reported that pirates are now avoiding the Gulf of Aden
because it is heavily patrolled by warships from countries such as the United
States, Japan and China and choosing to attack merchant vessels far off
Somalia's coast.</P>

      <P>The group represents some 21 percent of the 210,000 graduates who posted their
resumes on the job bank site, the company said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a survey conducted March 9-12 among 1,135 of the graduates found that
14.8 percent of them had been searching for jobs for over eight months.</P>
      <P>Asked about the reasons behind their failure to land jobs, 48.5 percent of the
job seekers mentioned their lack of work experience and 38.6 percent said there
are too many people looking for jobs.</P>
      <P>Also, 31.1 percent of job seekers complained about the few employment
opportunities available, and 29.8 percent attributed their failure to their lack

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's first all-male dance troupe -- the Horse Dance Theater -- was praised
by The New York Times for its unique style and innovation after performing in
New York recently.</P>
      <P>Invited by the Ballet Tech Foundation for the second time, the troupe performed
the premiere of "Bones" at the Joyce Theater in New York as part of the Mandance
Project's 2009 Spring Season.</P>
      <P>Following the premiere, a dance review published April 5 in the New York Times
praised the rapport among the dancers and their impressive body language and
vivid movement, as well as the style presented on stage.</P>
      <P>The  Horse  Dance  Theater's  productions  are collectively choreographed and
performed by the troupe's five dancers Su Wei-gia, Chen Wu-kang, Chou Shu-yi,
Yang Yu-min, and Cheng Tsung-lung.</P>
      <P>Yang, a student at Taipei National University of the Arts' Graduate Institute of
Dance Choreography, said that the troupe is a rare ensemble made up of a group
of longtime friends who know each other well.</P>
      <P>As a co-founder who has been involved in the group's collective choreography
since the theater was founded in 2005, Yang said that one of the troupe's
strengths is partnership among its members.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng, who performed with the group in New York for the first time
and whose choreography has been recognized in recent years, said their
motivation in creating and dancing in Bones was to do something that made them
happy rather than preparing a production to be performed.</P>
      <P>Cheng is also a contracted choreographer of Cloud Gate 2, an offshoot of the
world renowned Cloud Gate Dance Theater composed of Cloud Gate's younger
dancers.</P>
      <P>He has been invited as an artist-in-residence to work at the Watermill Center in
New York and created a new production for the Transition Dance Company of the
Laban Center in London in 2008.</P>
      <P>The up-and-coming choreographer is currently in Taipei preparing to stage his
new work The Wall during Cloud Gate 2's spring season programs slated to open
April 10.</P>
      <P>After appearing in New York, the five dancers will not perform together in the
next few months.</P>
      <P>Chou will join an artists-in-residence project in North Carolina in May. In the
past two years, he has performed in works staged by Hsu Fang-yi's LA/FA Dance
Theater and joined in a performance of Asian dancers in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, a soundscrape created by French sound artist Yannick  Dauby
for Bones has won recognition  from New York choreographer Eliot Feld, who is
also the project organizer.</P>
      <P>Chou said Dauby has been a partner of the Horse Dance Theater since  he  made
the  acquaintance  of Dauby  during  a 2007 artists-in-residence project in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>After their New York performance, the troupe's five members will be busy
preparing for the opening ceremony of the 2009 Taipei Deaflympics slated for
September, Yang added.</P>

      <P>A European Union Center (EU Center) will be formally opened in Taiwan May 22 in
a collaborative effort by seven Taiwan universities to facilitate exchanges and
mutual understanding between Taiwan and the European economic bloc, an official
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the EU Center, the eighth in the Asia-Pacific region, will
serve to enhance the Taiwan people's knowledge of the EU, according to the
Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office (EETO), the EU's de facto
embassy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MOFA Director-General of European Affairs Anne Hung said at a press conference
that the center will be housed in the College of Social Science of National
Taiwan University (NTU) and that NTU Vice President Bau Tzong-ho will serve as
its director.</P>
      <P>Su Hung-dah, an assistant professor at the NTU Department of Political Science,
and Kan Yi-hua, an associate research fellow at the Institute of International
Relations at National Chengchi University (NCCU) will be the chief operating
officers at the EU Center, Huang added.</P>
      <P>In addition to NTU and NCCU, she said, National Chung Hsing University, National
Sun Yat-sen University, National Dong Hwa University, Tamkang University and Fu
Jen Catholic University will also be part of the four-year operation.</P>
      <P>The seven universities will contribute a total of 450,000 euros to the 1.55
million-euro project, while the EU will cover the rest, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The EU began working with American universities in the late 1990s to open EU
Centers in the United States to promote a better understanding of the EU among
students.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are EU Centers at 10 U.S. universities and these centers are
serving the purpose for which they were established, according to the EETO.</P>
      <P>The EU Center network was later expanded to the Asia-Pacific region, and now
spans Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, with Taiwan becoming the
third East Asian country to be included.</P>
      <P>The EU Center program will help to create a foothold for EU studies in Taiwan's
higher education circles and serve as an information resource for a broad Taiwan
audience, the EETO said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's No. 1 tennis player Lu Yen-hsun has risen to the highest singles
ranking of his career after picking up 25 ranking points for reaching the second
round of last week's Sony Ericsson Open.</P>
      <P>Lu moved up six places to be ranked 55th in the world in the most recent
rankings released by the ATP Tour, two places higher than his previous high of
57 attained in mid-February.</P>
      <P>He remained the top-ranked Asian player ahead of Australia's Lleyton Hewitt
(88), Japan's Kei Nishikori (93), Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin (99), Kazakhstan's
Russian transplant Andrey Golubev (104) , Japan's Go Soeda (116), and South
Korea's Lee Hyung-Taik (128).</P>
      <P>Lu's ranking could fall in the next two months, however, especially if he plays
top ATP clay court events leading up to the French Open, which begins May 25.</P>
      <P>The 25-year-old, who has never been an accomplished clay court player, has to
defend 368 of his 1,166 ranking points by May 25, points that he won mostly in
lower tier Challenger Tour events last year.</P>
      <P>Those points will be lost if he does not earn a similar number of points in
upcoming tournaments, an unlikely scenario on clay.</P>
      <P>After taking a break, Lu will participate in the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters if he
gets a direct entry into the main draw and then will play in the Barcelona Open,
which starts April 20. Both are clay court events.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's hard-serving Yi Chu-huan, who has been saddled with injuries over the
past two years and focused mostly on doubles, also made a big move in the
rankings this week, climbing to 584th in the world from his previous ranking of

      <P>The Agriculture and Food Agency will use personal digital assistant (PAD)
technology to collect data on four domestically grown crops considered
"sensitive" because of their vulnerability to supply and demand imbalances, a
COA official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The COA plans to use Pads, or handheld computers, to collect field data in view
of the importance of establishing an accurate information database on sensitive
crops to maintain a balance between supply and demand, according to agency
official Huang Pei-hsun.</P>
      <P>If it is implemented successfully, the measure is expected to reach a data
collection rate of more than 90 percent, compared to less than 50 percent at
present, Huang said.</P>
      <P>This year, the agency will utilize 194 PDAs to collect data point locations and
associated information on onion, orange, Chinese date and garlic production,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the agency, in collaboration with Taichung-based Feng Chia
University, will provide a PDA and a global positioning system (GPS) device to
all townships with sizable acreages devoted to these sensitive crops to
accurately determine the actual amount of land under cultivation, Huang
explained.</P>
      <P>In the past, the agency relied on a farmer reporting mechanism to acquire
acreage and yield information related to sensitive crops, but the reporting rate
was less than 50 percent on average, Huang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export volume in March amounted to US$15.59 billion, the highest value
recorded over the past four months, due mainly to rush orders and inventory
refill from clients, according to a report released Tuesday by the Ministry of
Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>However, the amount was US$8.65 billion, or 35.7 percent, less than the same
month of last year. The decline, nonetheless, was narrower compared with the
plunge of 41.9 percent in December and 37.2 percent for the January-February
period, MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>Further observation is needed in the next two to three months to judge whether
the economic downturn has hit bottom, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In March, the largest decrease in terms of value was seen in semiconductor
exports, which lost US$1.98 billion, or 33.6 percent, year-on-year, the report
showed.</P>
      <P>Coming in second were TFT-LCD products and their parts and components, which
were down US$1.27 billion, or 58.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Base metals and their products dropped US$1.05 billion, or 39.6 percent, and
chemicals fell US$830 million, or 46.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, import volume in March was valued at US$12.17 billion, down US$11.94
billion, or 49.5 percent, year-on-year -- the largest decline on record -- owing
to sluggish domestic demand, MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>A trade surplus amounting to US$3.41 billion was recorded in March, up 25.4
times year-on-year and hitting the highest level for a single month since
December 2007.</P>
      <P>For the first quarter of this year, the export volume amounted to US$40.55
billion, a decrease of 36.6 percent year-on-year, and the import volume was down
47.2 percent to stand at US$32.06 billion, both marking the largest contraction
for a single quarter.</P>
      <P>The trade surplus of US$8.49 billion for the first quarter, however, marked an
increase of 155.3 percent compared with the same time last year.</P>

      <P>Kaohsiung, the southern Taiwanese city where the Taiwanese  fishing  vessel
seized by Somali pirates originated, is the world's second largest tuna
producer.</P>
      <P>Fishing vessels based in the city can catch nearly 200,000 tons of tuna fish
each year, with the annual production value of the local tuna fishing industry
hitting around NT$20 billion (US$599 million) , according to officials at the
Kaohsiung City Marine Bureau.</P>
      <P>"Kaohsiung City's tuna fish catch is the world's largest or second-largest,"
bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, local deep-sea fishing boats, like the one seized
Monday, catch mostly tuna, squid and saury pike.</P>
      <P>The "Win Far 161, " a 700-ton fishing ship which was hijacked by Somali pirates
early Monday in the Indian Ocean, is a long-line tuna fishing boat from
Kaohsiung City, bureau officials said, confirming what Taiwan's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung City Tuna Association said 360 fishing ships registered with the
southern Taiwanese city operate in various oceans in the world, including the
Indian Ocean, the Pacific and the Atlantic.</P>
      <P>Most of them are large long-line ships weighing over 100 tons, and their catch
are mainly exported to Japan, Europe and the United States, association
officials said.</P>
      <P>As of Tuesday evening, there was still no word about the whereabouts of the
vessel and its 30-member crew, which include two Taiwanese citizens. No ransom
demand has surfaced.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Loving home', not wealth, key to children's happiness: survey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey conducted this year has found that more children said they feel happy
than those in a similar poll last year, and that having a loving home and living
well are the two leading factors that make kids feel happy.</P>
      <P>The annual survey on children's happiness was conducted by the "Better Life"
monthly magazine on students between the third grade and sixth grade from 42
elementary schools in Taiwan from late 2008 to early 2009.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based magazine held a press conference Tuesday to publicize the
results, after collecting 2,002 valid questionnaires.</P>
      <P>The results show that 83.4 percent of the surveyed students said they feel
happy, up 4.6 percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>The level of happiness found in the latest survey marks the second highest level
recorded since the poll was first launched in 2001, when 84.2 percent kids said
they were happy, according to Tsai Wen-che, a pediatrician at the psychiatry
department of Taiwan University Hospital's Children Mental Health Center.</P>
      <P>More than half of the happy children, or 51.8 percent, said they feel happy
because they have a sweet home with parents and they spend happy hours with
their parents.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the family does not have to be wealthy for kids to feel happy, as
survey results showed that most children attributed being happy to their parents
spending time with them, while only 16.2 percent of the respondents said they
feel happy because they live well.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the leading factors that make school boys and girls
unhappy were "academic performance problems" and "quarrels with family members,
" followed by "no money at home" and "being dressed down."</P>
      <P>Given that the number of children feeling happy has gone up compared to previous
years, Tsai said it seems that the economic downturn has not yet had a big
impact on children.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai said the growth in the percentage of happy kids could have
resulted from the fact that parents now have more time to spend with their
children since many of them have been forced to take unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>Despite this, Tsai said, there has been a surge in the number of children who
appeared worried about the family's financial state and more children who are
not happy attributed their unhappiness to financial problems.</P>
      <P>Notably, the percentage of students expressing they are not happy because of "no
money at home" increased from the 5.2 percent in 2008 to 13.6 percent this year,
according to the survey, while that of the kids attributing their unhappiness to
"divorce of parents" rose from 4.5 percent to 12 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A two-year-old boy in southern Taiwan's Yunlin County has died after being
infected with enterovirus, the first victim of the disease this year, Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director Shih Wen-yi said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Citing an April 5 notice to the CDC from National Cheng Kung University Hospital
in Tainan City where the boy was treated, Shih said the patient fell sick March
31, with symptoms of fever, vomiting and hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome.</P>
      <P>He received initial treatment at a hospital in Singang rural township in Chiayi
County before being referred to a clinic in Chiayi City April 2 after he
continued to suffer cramps and persistent fever, and was finally admitted to the
National Cheng Kung University Hospital in Tainan City April 4, by which time he
was suffering drowsiness, increased heart rate and cold extremities.</P>
      <P>Suspecting that he was suffering from enterovirus infection, the hospital
alerted the CDC and admitted him to the intensive care unit, where the boy died
April 5.</P>
      <P>CDC experts later determined that the boy was a victim of enterovirus type
71(EV71).</P>
      <P>Shih noted that 11 severe enterovirus infections have been recorded in Taiwan
this year, most of them in southern parts of the country.</P>
      <P>A Yunlin County health official said the victim's five-year old brother, who
attended a kindergarten in Chiayi, had developed hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome
March 28 but recovered after treatment.</P>
      <P>The local health authorities disinfected the kindergarten and checked the
children's temperatures every day. However, none of the other children had
developed symptoms.</P>
      <P>Enteroviruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can be deadly,
especially in young children. EV71 -- the deadliest type of enterovirus -- is
one of the major causative agents of hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome and is
sometimes associated with severe central nervous system diseases.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan experienced a serious outbreak of EV71, with 405 severe
infections recorded, 78 of which were fatal. Another EV71 outbreak in 2005
resulted in 145 severe infections, 15 of which were fatal.</P>

      <P>Despite the dark cloud of global recession that has engulfed Taiwan for several
months, manufacturers and traders in 3C products still regard the upcoming
Softex Taipei show as a good opportunity to promote sales and have applied to
set up more booths at the venue than ever before.</P>
      <P>The 2009 Softex Taipei will take place at the Taipei World Trade Center April

      <P>This year, 120 businesses have applied to have a presence at the show, the same
amount of participants as last year, although the number of exhibition booths

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei City government has decided to extend the deposit-free trial period
for its public bicycle rental program until the end of April and will open five
more rental stations, as the service has been growing in popularity since it was
launched last month, the Taipei City Department of Transportation announced
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In the trial phase of the city's YouBike program, from March 11 to April 10,
users were allowed to register for a one-day or five-day membership card that
would be valid for a month, without having to pay the NT$3,000 (US$89) deposit.
They were also not required to pay the rental fees of NT$40 per day or NT$1,500
per year.</P>
      <P>As of April 5, some 9,500 people had used the service, according to an official
of the citys Department of Transportation. Due to the popularity of the service,
the city government decided to extend the concessionary period to the end of
April and to install another five self-service meters with effect from April 11
for rental of the bikes, the official said.</P>
      <P>This will bring to 10 the number of YouBike Bicycle Parking Meters in downtown
Taipei. The five already in service are located at the Xinyi Square, City Hall
Square, Taipei City Hall, MRT Taipei City Hall Station and Taipei World Trade
Center (TWTC) Hall 3. The five new ones will be at MRT Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall
Station, Taipei Municipal Xingya Junior High School, Taipei Disaster Prevention
and Response Center, New York New York Shopping Mall and exit C of TWTC Hall 1.</P>
      <P>The public bicycle rental service go into full operation on May 1. Users will
then be required to apply for short-term or long-term membership cards, which
will give them the first 30 minutes of each rental session free of cost, the
official said. After the first half an hour, the fee will be NT$10 for every 15
minutes.</P>
      <P>During the extended trial period, customers can use IC credit cards or the
city's EasyCard to register free of cost at the 10 YouBike stations.</P>
      <P>"In order to safeguard the personal information of credit card users and ensure
the safety of the transactions, only IC credit cards will be permitted for use
at the kiosks," the official said.</P>
      <P>However, from April 11, magnetic strip credit cards will be accepted at the
YouBike Service Center located at exit 3 of MRT Taipei City Hall Station, he

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen operating in China's Jiangsu Province called Tuesday for
the opening of non-stop flights between Taiwan and the province's Wuxi airport
to help them save on travel time.</P>
      <P>Sun Chia-chun, chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Wuxi, said
the heads of Taiwanese businessmen's organizations in 13 cities in central and
southern Jiangsu Province, including Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Yangzhou, Wujiang
and Nantong, have signed a petition expressing their desire for better air
links.</P>
      <P>Sun said they will raise the proposal in the upcoming third round of talks
between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation and the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits scheduled to take place in
China.</P>
      <P>According to Sun, about 1,800 Taiwanese enterprises and some 300,000 Taiwanese
students, businessmen and their families are presently based in central and
southern regions of Jiangsu Province, but there are no direct flights linking
Wuxi and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Instead of landing at the Wuxi airport, he went on, they usually have to fly to
and from Taiwan through Shanghai's Pudong Airport in neighboring Zhejiang
Province or via Nanjing's Lukou International Airport.</P>
      <P>"The Wuxi airport already serves non-stop flights to Macau and Hong Kong," he
noted.</P>
      <P>If non-stop flights can be put in place between Taiwan and Wuxi, it will be a
great boon to Taiwanese businessmen operating in central and southern regions of
Jiangsu, Sun said.</P>
      <P>Chi Chih, chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Wujiang, said that
neither Pudong Airport nor the Nanjing airport serve them adequately, as
traveling to and from each of them entails a round-trip drive of some five
hours.</P>
      <P>Wang I-lung, a vice chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Suzhou,
echoed the viewpoint, adding that many Taiwanese businessmen based in the Suzhou
area have complained about the waste of time involved traveling between Suzhou
and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>A flight between Taiwan and Shanghai takes only about 80 minutes, but it takes
at least two hours to make a one-way trip from Pudong Airport to Suzhou, he
noted, adding that the drive from Suzhou to Wuxi takes only 30 minutes.</P>
      <P>Wang Wen-chao, also a vice chairman of the Suzhou Taiwan businessmen's
association, said having to use Pudong Airport or Lukou International Airport to
travel between Suzhou and Taiwan is a serious headache as road traffic between
Suzhou and either of the two airports is usually terrible.</P>

      <P>A European Union Center (EU Center) will be formally opened in Taiwan May 22 in
a collaborative effort by seven Taiwan universities to facilitate exchanges and
mutual understanding between Taiwan and the European economic bloc, an official
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the EU Center, the eighth in the Asia-Pacific region, will
serve to enhance the Taiwan people's knowledge of the EU, according to the
Taipei-based European Economic and Trade Office (EETO), the EU's de facto
embassy in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MOFA Director-General of European Affairs Anne Hung said at a press conference
that the center will be housed in the College of Social Science of National
Taiwan University (NTU) and that NTU Vice President Bau Tzong-ho will serve as
its director.</P>
      <P>Su Hung-dah, an assistant professor at the NTU Department of Political Science,
and Kan Yi-hua, an associate research fellow at the Institute of International
Relations at National Chengchi University (NCCU) will be the chief operating
officers at the EU Center, Huang added.</P>
      <P>In addition to NTU and NCCU, she said, National Chung Hsing University, National
Sun Yat-sen University, National Dong Hwa University, Tamkang University and Fu
Jen Catholic University will also be part of the four-year operation.</P>
      <P>The seven universities will contribute a total of 450,000 euros to the 1.55
million-euro project, while the EU will cover the rest, Hung said.</P>
      <P>The EU began working with American universities in the late 1990s to open EU
Centers in the United States to promote a better understanding of the EU among
students.</P>
      <P>Currently, there are EU Centers at 10 U.S. universities and these centers are
serving the purpose for which they were established, according to the EETO.</P>
      <P>The EU Center network was later expanded to the Asia-Pacific region, and now
spans Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand, with Taiwan becoming the
third East Asian country to be included.</P>
      <P>The EU Center program will help to create a foothold for EU studies in Taiwan's
higher education circles and serve as an information resource for a broad Taiwan
audience, the EETO said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's No. 1 tennis player Lu Yen-hsun has risen to the highest singles
ranking of his career after picking up 25 ranking points for reaching the second
round of last week's Sony Ericsson Open.</P>
      <P>Lu moved up six places to be ranked 55th in the world in the most recent
rankings released by the ATP Tour, two places higher than his previous high of
57 attained in mid-February.</P>
      <P>He remained the top-ranked Asian player ahead of Australia's Lleyton Hewitt
(88), Japan's Kei Nishikori (93), Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin (99), Kazakhstan's
Russian transplant Andrey Golubev (104) , Japan's Go Soeda (116), and South
Korea's Lee Hyung-Taik (128).</P>
      <P>Lu's ranking could fall in the next two months, however, especially if he plays
top ATP clay court events leading up to the French Open, which begins May 25.</P>
      <P>The 25-year-old, who has never been an accomplished clay court player, has to
defend 368 of his 1,166 ranking points by May 25, points that he won mostly in
lower tier Challenger Tour events last year.</P>
      <P>Those points will be lost if he does not earn a similar number of points in
upcoming tournaments, an unlikely scenario on clay.</P>
      <P>After taking a break, Lu will participate in the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters if he
gets a direct entry into the main draw and then will play in the Barcelona Open,
which starts April 20. Both are clay court events.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's hard-serving Yi Chu-huan, who has been saddled with injuries over the
past two years and focused mostly on doubles, also made a big move in the
rankings this week, climbing to 584th in the world from his previous ranking of
690 after reaching the finals of a Futures event in Japan at the end of March.</P>

      <P>The Agriculture and Food Agency will use personal digital assistant (PAD)
technology to collect data on four domestically grown crops considered
"sensitive" because of their vulnerability to supply and demand imbalances, a
COA official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The COA plans to use Pads, or handheld computers, to collect field data in view
of the importance of establishing an accurate information database on sensitive
crops to maintain a balance between supply and demand, according to agency
official Huang Pei-hsun.</P>
      <P>If it is implemented successfully, the measure is expected to reach a data
collection rate of more than 90 percent, compared to less than 50 percent at
present, Huang said.</P>
      <P>This year, the agency will utilize 194 PDAs to collect data point locations and
associated information on onion, orange, Chinese date and garlic production,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Under the plan, the agency, in collaboration with Taichung-based Feng Chia
University, will provide a PDA and a global positioning system (GPS) device to
all townships with sizable acreages devoted to these sensitive crops to
accurately determine the actual amount of land under cultivation, Huang
explained.</P>
      <P>In the past, the agency relied on a farmer reporting mechanism to acquire
acreage and yield information related to sensitive crops, but the reporting rate
was less than 50 percent on average, Huang said.</P>

percent who wish to gain professional respect and 55 percent who are seeking
opportunities for promotion.</P>
      <P>While 74 percent of the Taiwanese respondents listed savings and preparation for

      <P>Sixty-percent of Taiwanese high income earners have not used the personal
investment, priority or private banking services provided by banks, compared
with 37 percent among those from China and 32 percent among those from Hong
Kong, the poll found.</P>
      <P>Sixty percent of the wealthy respondents in China hold personal investment or
priority services accounts, while 14 percent hold private banking accounts,
according to the survey.</P>

      <P>A pistol belonging to a Brazilian government security guard is being returned to
its owner by local airport authorities after it was mistakenly transported to
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport near Taipei, airport police said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Brazilian security guard reported his pistol was missing after returning
home from an international conference in Indonesia, where he was accompanying a
Brazilian official.</P>
      <P>He asked the airlines he took to help track the weapon down, and it was
eventually discovered that the suitcase containing the gun had been
inadvertently flown to Taiwan, rather than back to Brazil.</P>
      <P>Workers at the Taoyuan airport found the suitcase under a mountain of luggage,
which had not left the airport, airport police said.</P>
      <P>According to airport police, the gun is being sent back to its owner in Brazil
after an investigation ruled out the possibility that it may have been linked to
any crime or intended to be used for any criminal act.</P>
      <P>The pistol, divided into several parts, was kept in a box along with three
cartridges, and there was a clear imprint showing "police" on its barrel,

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's export volume in March amounted to US$15.59 billion, the highest value
recorded over the past four months, due mainly to rush orders and inventory
refill from clients, according to a report released Tuesday by the Ministry of
Finance (MOF).</P>
      <P>However, the amount was US$8.65 billion, or 35.7 percent, less than the same
month of last year. The decline, nonetheless, was narrower compared with the
plunge of 41.9 percent in December and 37.2 percent for the January-February
period, MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>Further observation is needed in the next two to three months to judge whether
the economic downturn has hit bottom, the officials said.</P>
      <P>In March, the largest decrease in terms of value was seen in semiconductor
exports, which lost US$1.98 billion, or 33.6 percent, year-on-year, the report
showed.</P>
      <P>Coming in second were TFT-LCD products and their parts and components, which
were down US$1.27 billion, or 58.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Base metals and their products dropped US$1.05 billion, or 39.6 percent, and
chemicals fell US$830 million, or 46.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, import volume in March was valued at US$12.17 billion, down US$11.94
billion, or 49.5 percent, year-on-year -- the largest decline on record -- owing
to sluggish domestic demand, MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>A trade surplus amounting to US$3.41 billion was recorded in March, up 25.4
times year-on-year and hitting the highest level for a single month since
December 2007.</P>
      <P>For the first quarter of this year, the export volume amounted to US$40.55
billion, a decrease of 36.6 percent year-on-year, and the import volume was down
47.2 percent to stand at US$32.06 billion, both marking the largest contraction
for a single quarter.</P>
      <P>The trade surplus of US$8.49 billion for the first quarter, however, marked an

      <P>Kaohsiung, the southern Taiwanese city where the Taiwanese  fishing  vessel
seized by Somali pirates originated, is the world's second largest tuna
producer.</P>
      <P>Fishing vessels based in the city can catch nearly 200,000 tons of tuna fish
each year, with the annual production value of the local tuna fishing industry
hitting around NT$20 billion (US$599 million) , according to officials at the
Kaohsiung City Marine Bureau.</P>
      <P>"Kaohsiung City's tuna fish catch is the world's largest or second-largest,"
bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, local deep-sea fishing boats, like the one seized
Monday, catch mostly tuna, squid and saury pike.</P>
      <P>The "Win Far 161, " a 700-ton fishing ship which was hijacked by Somali pirates

    <TEXT>
      <P>A survey conducted this year has found that more children said they feel happy
than those in a similar poll last year, and that having a loving home and living
well are the two leading factors that make kids feel happy.</P>
      <P>The annual survey on children's happiness was conducted by the "Better Life"
monthly magazine on students between the third grade and sixth grade from 42
elementary schools in Taiwan from late 2008 to early 2009.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based magazine held a press conference Tuesday to publicize the
results, after collecting 2,002 valid questionnaires.</P>
      <P>The results show that 83.4 percent of the surveyed students said they feel
happy, up 4.6 percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>The level of happiness found in the latest survey marks the second highest level
recorded since the poll was first launched in 2001, when 84.2 percent kids said
they were happy, according to Tsai Wen-che, a pediatrician at the psychiatry
department of Taiwan University Hospital's Children Mental Health Center.</P>
      <P>More than half of the happy children, or 51.8 percent, said they feel happy
because they have a sweet home with parents and they spend happy hours with
their parents.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the family does not have to be wealthy for kids to feel happy, as
survey results showed that most children attributed being happy to their parents
spending time with them, while only 16.2 percent of the respondents said they
feel happy because they live well.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the leading factors that make school boys and girls
unhappy were "academic performance problems" and "quarrels with family members,
" followed by "no money at home" and "being dressed down."</P>
      <P>Given that the number of children feeling happy has gone up compared to previous
years, Tsai said it seems that the economic downturn has not yet had a big
impact on children.</P>
      <P>However, Tsai said the growth in the percentage of happy kids could have
resulted from the fact that parents now have more time to spend with their
children since many of them have been forced to take unpaid leave.</P>
      <P>Despite this, Tsai said, there has been a surge in the number of children who
appeared worried about the family's financial state and more children who are
not happy attributed their unhappiness to financial problems.</P>
      <P>Notably, the percentage of students expressing they are not happy because of "no
money at home" increased from the 5.2 percent in 2008 to 13.6 percent this year,
according to the survey, while that of the kids attributing their unhappiness to
"divorce of parents" rose from 4.5 percent to 12 percent.</P>

      <P>A two-year-old boy in southern Taiwan's Yunlin County has died after being
infected with enterovirus, the first victim of the disease this year, Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director Shih Wen-yi said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Citing an April 5 notice to the CDC from National Cheng Kung University Hospital
in Tainan City where the boy was treated, Shih said the patient fell sick March
31, with symptoms of fever, vomiting and hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome.</P>
      <P>He received initial treatment at a hospital in Singang rural township in Chiayi
County before being referred to a clinic in Chiayi City April 2 after he
continued to suffer cramps and persistent fever, and was finally admitted to the
National Cheng Kung University Hospital in Tainan City April 4, by which time he
was suffering drowsiness, increased heart rate and cold extremities.</P>
      <P>Suspecting that he was suffering from enterovirus infection, the hospital
alerted the CDC and admitted him to the intensive care unit, where the boy died
April 5.</P>
      <P>CDC experts later determined that the boy was a victim of enterovirus type
71(EV71).</P>
      <P>Shih noted that 11 severe enterovirus infections have been recorded in Taiwan
this year, most of them in southern parts of the country.</P>
      <P>A Yunlin County health official said the victim's five-year old brother, who
attended a kindergarten in Chiayi, had developed hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome
March 28 but recovered after treatment.</P>
      <P>The local health authorities disinfected the kindergarten and checked the
children's temperatures every day. However, none of the other children had
developed symptoms.</P>
      <P>Enteroviruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can be deadly,
especially in young children. EV71 -- the deadliest type of enterovirus -- is
one of the major causative agents of hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome and is
sometimes associated with severe central nervous system diseases.</P>
      <P>In 1998, Taiwan experienced a serious outbreak of EV71, with 405 severe
infections recorded, 78 of which were fatal. Another EV71 outbreak in 2005
resulted in 145 severe infections, 15 of which were fatal.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City government has decided to extend the deposit-free trial period
for its public bicycle rental program until the end of April and will open five
more rental stations, as the service has been growing in popularity since it was
launched last month, the Taipei City Department of Transportation announced
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In the trial phase of the city's YouBike program, from March 11 to April 10,
users were allowed to register for a one-day or five-day membership card that
would be valid for a month, without having to pay the NT$3,000 (US$89) deposit.
They were also not required to pay the rental fees of NT$40 per day or NT$1,500
per year.</P>
      <P>As of April 5, some 9,500 people had used the service, according to an official
of the citys Department of Transportation. Due to the popularity of the service,
the city government decided to extend the concessionary period to the end of
April and to install another five self-service meters with effect from April 11
for rental of the bikes, the official said.</P>
      <P>This will bring to 10 the number of YouBike Bicycle Parking Meters in downtown
Taipei. The five already in service are located at the Xinyi Square, City Hall
Square, Taipei City Hall, MRT Taipei City Hall Station and Taipei World Trade
Center (TWTC) Hall 3. The five new ones will be at MRT Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall
Station, Taipei Municipal Xingya Junior High School, Taipei Disaster Prevention
and Response Center, New York New York Shopping Mall and exit C of TWTC Hall 1.</P>
      <P>The public bicycle rental service go into full operation on May 1. Users will
then be required to apply for short-term or long-term membership cards, which
will give them the first 30 minutes of each rental session free of cost, the
official said. After the first half an hour, the fee will be NT$10 for every 15
minutes.</P>
      <P>During the extended trial period, customers can use IC credit cards or the
city's EasyCard to register free of cost at the 10 YouBike stations.</P>
      <P>"In order to safeguard the personal information of credit card users and ensure
the safety of the transactions, only IC credit cards will be permitted for use
at the kiosks," the official said.</P>
      <P>However, from April 11, magnetic strip credit cards will be accepted at the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen operating in China's Jiangsu Province called Tuesday for
the opening of non-stop flights between Taiwan and the province's Wuxi airport
to help them save on travel time.</P>
      <P>Sun Chia-chun, chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Wuxi, said
the heads of Taiwanese businessmen's organizations in 13 cities in central and
southern Jiangsu Province, including Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Yangzhou, Wujiang
and Nantong, have signed a petition expressing their desire for better air
links.</P>
      <P>Sun said they will raise the proposal in the upcoming third round of talks
between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation and the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits scheduled to take place in
China.</P>
      <P>According to Sun, about 1,800 Taiwanese enterprises and some 300,000 Taiwanese
students, businessmen and their families are presently based in central and
southern regions of Jiangsu Province, but there are no direct flights linking
Wuxi and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Instead of landing at the Wuxi airport, he went on, they usually have to fly to
and from Taiwan through Shanghai's Pudong Airport in neighboring Zhejiang
Province or via Nanjing's Lukou International Airport.</P>
      <P>"The Wuxi airport already serves non-stop flights to Macau and Hong Kong," he
noted.</P>
      <P>If non-stop flights can be put in place between Taiwan and Wuxi, it will be a
great boon to Taiwanese businessmen operating in central and southern regions of
Jiangsu, Sun said.</P>
      <P>Chi Chih, chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Wujiang, said that
neither Pudong Airport nor the Nanjing airport serve them adequately, as
traveling to and from each of them entails a round-trip drive of some five

      <P>Wang I-lung, a vice chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Suzhou,
echoed the viewpoint, adding that many Taiwanese businessmen based in the Suzhou
area have complained about the waste of time involved traveling between Suzhou
and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>A flight between Taiwan and Shanghai takes only about 80 minutes, but it takes
at least two hours to make a one-way trip from Pudong Airport to Suzhou, he
noted, adding that the drive from Suzhou to Wuxi takes only 30 minutes.</P>
      <P>Wang Wen-chao, also a vice chairman of the Suzhou Taiwan businessmen's
association, said having to use Pudong Airport or Lukou International Airport to
travel between Suzhou and Taiwan is a serious headache as road traffic between
Suzhou and either of the two airports is usually terrible.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese businessmen operating in China's Jiangsu Province called Tuesday for
the opening of non-stop flights between Taiwan and the province's Wuxi airport
to help them save on travel time.</P>
      <P>Sun Chia-chun, chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Wuxi, said
the heads of Taiwanese businessmen's organizations in 13 cities in central and
southern Jiangsu Province, including Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Yangzhou, Wujiang
and Nantong, have signed a petition expressing their desire for better air
links.</P>
      <P>Sun said they will raise the proposal in the upcoming third round of talks
between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation and the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits scheduled to take place in
China.</P>
      <P>According to Sun, about 1,800 Taiwanese enterprises and some 300,000 Taiwanese
students, businessmen and their families are presently based in central and
southern regions of Jiangsu Province, but there are no direct flights linking
Wuxi and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Instead of landing at the Wuxi airport, he went on, they usually have to fly to
and from Taiwan through Shanghai's Pudong Airport in neighboring Zhejiang
Province or via Nanjing's Lukou International Airport.</P>
      <P>"The Wuxi airport already serves non-stop flights to Macau and Hong Kong," he
noted.</P>
      <P>If non-stop flights can be put in place between Taiwan and Wuxi, it will be a
great boon to Taiwanese businessmen operating in central and southern regions of
Jiangsu, Sun said.</P>
      <P>Chi Chih, chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Wujiang, said that
neither Pudong Airport nor the Nanjing airport serve them adequately, as
traveling to and from each of them entails a round-trip drive of some five
hours.</P>
      <P>Wang I-lung, a vice chairman of the Taiwan Businessmen's Association in Suzhou,
echoed the viewpoint, adding that many Taiwanese businessmen based in the Suzhou
area have complained about the waste of time involved traveling between Suzhou

    <HEADLINE>U.S. government looks into hijacking of Taiwanese fishing vessel</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei Office expressed its concern
Wednesday over the hijacking of a Taiwanese deep sea vessel in the Indian Ocean
early Monday and said the U.S. government is taking a closer look at the matter.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about the recent capture of the Taiwan fishing vessel in the
Indian Ocean. The Department of Defense is looking into the incident, said AIT
press officer Lawrence Walker in response to a Central News Agency inquiry.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Navy has a responsibility to render assistance if feasible to any
vessel anywhere in the world that is in distress and requests assistance,he
added.</P>
      <P>The AIT is the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The AIT issued a statement in January saying it had discussed with Taiwan the
problem of piracy in the Gulf of Aden, at a time when attacks by Somali pirates
on commercial  vessels were growing increasingly serious.</P>
      <P>When asked about it, Walker declined to comment on the discussion between the
two countries, saying only that it is an ongoing subject.</P>
      <P>The 700-ton long-line fishing shipWin Far 161was hijacked near an island in the
Seychelles in the Indian Ocean on Monday. Among its 30 crew members, the ship's
skipper and first engineer are Taiwanese nationals, while five other are
Chinese, 17 are Filipinos and six are Indonesian.</P>
      <P>Henry Chen, spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), told the CNA
that while it is closely monitoring the movement of the vessel, it has not
received news regarding the conditions on board, and the hijackers have yet to
demand a ransom.</P>
      <P>The MOFA is actively pursuing every every channel as it attempts to resolve the
problem, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also said the Foreign Ministry appreciates the concern shown by the U.S.
government over the hijacking.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan completes entry into IHR framework</HEADLINE>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan recently received the password to get into the International Health
Regulations (IHR) information portal, formally completing the country's
accession into the global health management framework, a local health official
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The head of the National  Public  Health Command,  Chuang Jen-hsiang, was
authorized to use the password to get into the IHR Event Information Site at the
end of March, said Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Deputy Director-General
Shih Wen-yi.</P>
      <P>Immediately  after Chuang received the password and posted information on a
communicable disease in Taiwan imported from China, World Health Organization
(WHO) officials responded right away asking for further clarification, according
to Shih.</P>
      <P>Through its accession to the IHR, a framework under the WHO devised to control
the spread of infectious diseases around the globe, Taiwan will be able for the
first time to directly contact the world health body and get first-hand
information about avian flu prevention and control, food security, and the
spread and control of other epidemic diseases.</P>
      <P>Because of China's opposition,  Taiwan had previously been excluded from the
IHR, even though a "universal application" phrase was introduced in the
regulations in 2005 with the firm support of the United  States and Taiwan's
diplomatic  allies,  and the encouragement of the EU and Japan.</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan was only able to obtain information on outbreaks of
communicable diseases or emergencies in the region, including in China and Hong
Kong, on a secondhand basis.</P>
      <P>The WHO notified the Department of Health in a letter in January that Taiwan
would be included in the IHR framework.</P>
      <P>The WHO letter confirmed that the CDC is the communication liaison between
Taiwan and the WHO and that the CDC and WHO can communicate directly.</P>
      <P>It also said the WHO will dispatch specialists to Taiwan or invite Taiwan
representatives to meetings called by the WHO in the event of any public health
emergencies in Taiwan of international concern.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also allowed to recommend candidates to be included in the IHR group
of specialists, the letter said.</P>
      <P>The CDC has since recommended a list of candidates, including Ho Mei-shang, a
research fellow in Academia Sinica's Institute of Biomedical Sciences, but it
has yet to receive confirmation of the list by the WHO, Shih said.</P>
      <P>The IHR was adopted in May 2005 by the WHA and took effect in June 2007. It
requires all member states to report and address any public health emergencies
of international concern.</P>
      <P>Officials in charge of health and foreign affairs have all welcomed Taiwan's
inclusion in the IHR framework,  which some attributed to improved ties with
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Child abuse growing as economic pressure increases: organization</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local children welfare promotion organization expressed concern Wednesday over
the growing number of cases of child abuse as economic pressures rise, and it
urged parents not to take their frustrations out on their children.</P>
      <P>The nonprofit Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (TFCF) said that as of
March, 46 cases of domestic violence involving 73 children, including eight who
died, have been reported this year in the local media, and it urged parents who
were on edge to seek professional help or take some time away from their
children.</P>
      <P>The TFCF said that as the economy has worsened, it has observed a growing rate
of domestic violence against children,  triggered primarily by a lack of
parenting skills, unemployment, and poverty.</P>
      <P>Of the 1,206 child abuse cases that the organization dealt with in 2007, parents
were the abusers in 85.5 percent of the cases, while 64.3 percent of the cases
occurred because parents did not know how to appropriately discipline their
children.</P>
      <P>Wang Ming-ren, executive director of the TFCF, said at Tuesday's news conference
that parents can learn to ease up while dealing with job and parenting pressures
simply by taking five steps -- taking 10 deep breaths, closing their eyes for 10
minutes, hugging their children for 10 seconds, laughing with their children 10
times or calling the TFCF at 0800-078585 for assistance.</P>
      <P>Parents should face up to the issue of emotion management, as it is the key to a
better parent-child relationship, said Chang Hsin-yo, a consultant and assistant
professor at Taipei Medical University's Center for General Education.</P>
      <P>Chang suggested that parents get into the habit of consistent positive
reinforcement, such as giving positive messages to encourage children,
recognizing and acknowledging their wishes, or restricting their behavior in a
calm manner, according to Chang.</P>
      <P>Sharing his own parenting experience at the news conference, news broadcaster
Sam Tsen said that while taking atime-outfrom children is a good way to avoid
losing one's temper, it is better to foster a closer relation with children
through intimate actions such as hugs and kisses.</P>
      <P>The parent-child relationship is like a bank book -- you have to keep depositing
happy moments you share with your children so that there is something for you to
withdraw when things get tough, he said.</P>

      <P>Several hospitals in Taiwan have perfected advanced techniques in organ
transplants, with the Taipei-based National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH)
regarded as excellent in the field of kidney transplants, a Bureau of National
Health Insurance (BNHI) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks upon the release that same day of statistics on
organ transplants conducted by Taiwanese medical institutes between 1997 and
2007.</P>
      <P>Tzeng Wen-fu, responsible for medical service reviewing affairs at the BNHI,
said the bureau reimbursed 3,875 cases involving organ transplants during the
10-year period.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that the average five-year survival rate for heart
transplants was 69 percent during the period, while the figure for kidney
transplants reached 93 percent, with 80 percent recorded for liver transplants
and 24 percent for lung transplants.</P>
      <P>Tzeng said that no matter whether the organs come from living or deceased
donors, there are no differences in the survival rates, as the surgical
techniques and quality of health care are what matter.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Cheng Hsin Hospital was found to have performed the best in
heart transplants, with a 79 percent three-year survival rate, according to the
BNHI statistics.</P>
      <P>The figures also show that NTUH recorded the highest five-year survival rate of
96 percent for kidney transplants among the country's medical institutes, while
the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital registered the highest survival rate
of 91 percent for liver transplants.</P>
      <P>NTUH has also ranked in the top five in terms of survival rates for heart, liver

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reaffirmed Wednesday his administration's tough stand on
corruption, in the wake of the publication of a report ranking Taiwan's
corruption level as even more serious than that of China.</P>
      <P>Ma demanded that the authorities get to the bottom of any alleged corruption
cases regardless of the rank or political affiliation of the suspects.</P>
      <P>He also instructed the authorities to produce a review report on major
corruption cases and work out a plan to improve the situation within three
months.</P>
      <P>"We cannot allow corruption to disgrace Taiwan's democratic achievements, which
are the pride of the ethnic Chinese community, " Ma said in a news conference in

matter.</P>
      <P>According to the Asian Risk Prospect -- 2009 report released recently by the
Hong Kong-based  Political  and Economic Risk Consultancy, Taiwan ranks eighth
in terms of corruption levels among the 17 Asian countries rated, placing ahead
of China on the list that is topped by Indonesia, Thailand and Cambodia.</P>
      <P>Ma said that although all the corruption cases that have come to light so far
took place during the former Democratic Progressive Party  administration,  the
new government  has an ineluctable responsibility to crack down on corruption.</P>
      <P>He instructed the authorities to speed up their investigations and trials of the
cases based on the principle of impartiality.</P>
      <P>"Clean politics is not a slogan, but an action," Ma said.</P>
      <P>According to the president, an amendment the previous week of Punishment of
Corruption Act making it a crime for government officials to hold unexplained
wealth marked an important milestone in Taiwan's pursuit of clean politics.</P>

      <P>Exports are steadily regaining momentum as the country's outbound shipments to
China and the United States are showing signs of initial recovery, Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairman Chen Tain-jy said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while answering questions from ruling Kuomintang
Legislator Wu Ching-chih during a legislative meeting.</P>
      <P>He based his optimism on the grounds that Taiwan's outbound shipments to the two
major overseas markets have gradually increased during the first three months of
this year thanks to more orders placed with local companies.</P>
      <P>But he added that it is still too early to term the situation a turnaround
before the country's single-month export value rebounds to more than US$20
billion (US$598 million).</P>
      <P>"It will be a genuine economic recovery if Taiwan's monthly export value returns
to above that level," he explained.</P>
      <P>Export volume, local consumption and private-sector investment are three major
indicators of an economic rebound, according to the CEPD chief, who said local
consumption seems to have stopped decreasing in March.</P>
      <P>According to a report released a day earlier by the Ministry of Finance (MOF),
export volume in March totaled US$15.59 billion, the highest level posted over
the past four months, mainly due to rush orders and inventory refills.</P>
      <P>However, the March figure was down US$8.65 billion -- a drop of 35.7 percent --
compared with the same month of a year ago. The decline, nonetheless, was
narrower than the plunge of 41.9 percent in December and 37.2 percent for the
January-February period, MOF officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a trade surplus of US$8.49 billion for the first quarter of this year
represented an increase of 155.3 percent compared with the same period of last
year, although the officials added that further observation will be needed in
the next two to three months to judge whether the economic downturn has come to
an end.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Students of Chaoyang University of Technology  in the central county of Taichung
have posted a professional license acquisition rate of 108 percent, one of the
highest among all academic institutions in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As of March 31 this year, the 14,635 students of Chaoyang University had passed
exams or tests to obtain 15,813 professional licenses from national agencies,
said Chung Jen-chin, president of the university.</P>
      <P>"Each student has at least one professional license now, " Chung said proudly.</P>
      <P>Chung attributed  the students' performance  mainly to the university's active
response to an incentive project launched by the Ministry of Education (MOE)
nearly three years ago to encourage outstanding teaching.</P>
      <P>He said that over the past two years, Chaoyang University has received NT$177
million (US$5.24 million) from the MOE in incentive grants for outstanding
teaching performances.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, students admitted in 2008 and after will be required to pass the
Level One National English Test Proficiency for All before they could graduate,
he said.</P>
      <P>"This is one of Chaoyang's policies in its goal to produce graduates who will be
highly sought after by private companies and enterprises  in need of
professionals  with  foreign  language proficiency," Chung noted.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's share prices fell sharply Wednesday, with the weighted index, the
market's key barometer, dropping 133.29 points, or 2.39 percent, to close at
5,443.56.</P>
      <P>The local bourse opened lower at 5,534.58 but rose to a high of 5,608.96 early
in the session before falling as low as 5,435.04, under pressure from plunging
financial shares after legislators reached a consensus to cap interest rates on
credit card debt at 12.5 percent,</P>
      <P>A total of 7.47 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$150.27
billion (US$4.44 billion).</P>
      <P>Seven of the eight major stock categories lost ground, with banking and
financial shares falling the most at 5.5 percent. Construction issues dropped
5.3 percent, paper and pulp issues decreased 3.5 percent, textile stocks fell
3.4 percent, cement stocks were down 3.1 percent, foodstuff issues lost 2.4
percent, and machinery and electronics shares dropped 2.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Plastics and chemicals shares increased, gaining 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 1,414 to 681, with 118 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors were net sellers of shares worth NT$10.23 billion.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the fall in financial  shares hurt investor confidence and dragged
down prices in other sectors.</P>
      <P>Investors feared earnings at financial institutions will suffer after ruling and
opposition legislators reached a consensus on an amendment that would lower the
ceiling on credit and debit card balances to 12.5 percent, from the existing 20
percent.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust Financial Holding Co. and Mega Financial Holding Co. shares both fell
by the maximum 7 percent. Chinatrust shares lost NT$1.05 to close at NT$14.15,

      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) remained at an impasse
Wednesday over which of two competing candidates should run for Tainan
magistrate in year-end elections, a DPP lawmaker acknowledged.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi, who was nominated by the party a week earlier to run
for the position in December, told reporters that he had a friendly half-hour
meeting on the issue a day earlier with another self-proclaimed DPP candidate,
Tan Sun Chen, but to no avail.</P>
      <P>"So far we have not found a way for Chen to withdraw his candidacy, but we are
still making more efforts," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed worry that he is now in a situation that will not allow him to
back out of the race, because if he does so, it will not only ruin his political
career but also destroy the credibility of the DPP.</P>
      <P>He said the only hope for a solution to the issue now lies in whether DPP
heavyweights can persuade Chen to withdraw his candidacy.</P>
      <P>Chen, a 74-year-old party veteran, announced last week that he will run for the
Tainan magistrate post.</P>
      <P>He has served in a series of high-level positions during his political career,
including Tainan magistrate, minister of foreign affairs and secretary-general
of the Presidential Office under the former DPP administration.</P>
      <P>He claimed he has become a victim of factional fighting within the party and
vowed that he will go the distance in the election in defiance of factional
dominance within the party.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed confidence that he will emerge as the front-runner in the
election and suggested that the party leadership should have chosen the nominee
by means of an opinion poll that would have gauged who had the strongest support
among the DPP members and voters.</P>

      <P>Eighteen replicas of sculptures from the world renowned Louvre Museum's
"touching exhibition" were unveiled at Taipei's  National Museum of History
Wednesday,  with visitors encouraged to feel the works with their hands.</P>
      <P>Huang Yung-chuan, director of the National Museum of History, said at a news
conference to unveil the sculptures that Taipei is very fortunate to be the
first stop on the exhibition's first overseas tour.</P>
      <P>He added that it is a result of more than two years of planning and cooperation
among the National Museum of History, the Louvre, the French Institute in
Taipei, the Taiwan Foundation for the Blind and the Ravenel Art Group.</P>
      <P>Introduced  in 1995,  the exhibition aims at bringing the experience of art to
visually challenged people, as rather than being warned to keep their hands off
the works, visitors are asked to indulge themselves by feeling and touching the
reproductions of famous sculptures.</P>
      <P>Alice Rambert,  project manager of the Louvre's  Education Department, said at
the news conference that the exhibition will strengthen not only the cooperation
between the two museums, but also cultural exchanges between Taiwan and France.</P>
      <P>"This exhibition will serve as a bridge between the visually impaired and
sighted people and will give them a whole new feeling of art appreciation,"
Rambert said.</P>
      <P>Daisy Xu, vice president of Ravenel Art Group, said that by sponsoring the
event, she hopes a message will be sent that more people and enterprises should
support such art exhibitions and show more care for underprivileged groups.</P>
      <P>The 18 sculptures, including reproductions of the Venus de Milo, the Borghese
Gladiator and the Rebel Slave, are resin or plaster reproductions of the marble
originals, according to the organizers, who added that because the Louvre used
3D laser readings of each piece, the replicas are exact copies.</P>
      <P>From April 10 to May 24, the exhibition, titled "Sculptures in Movement, " will
be held at the National Museum of History, moving to Kaohsiung Museum of Fine
Arts from June 20 to August 23 before traveling on to Beijing, Hangzhou and
Wuhan in China.</P>
      <P>Blindfolds will be available at the exhibition to enhance the sense of touch for
the non-vision-impaired.</P>

      <P>Children suffering from attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) will be
given access to special education if an amendment to the Special Education Act
clears the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The bill,  which completed  a preliminary  review  by the legislature's
Education and Culture Committee Wednesday, would expand the eligibility for
special education to include children with behavioral disorders, also covering
hyperactive children.</P>
      <P>The legislation must still pass two more votes by the full lawmaking body before
the amendment can be implemented.</P>
      <P>In light  of the fact  that some children  with learning disabilities do not
necessarily have any easily identifiable physical or mental disabilities, the
bill stipulates that any child who has been "professionally  evaluated and
assessed as having special learning needs" would qualify for special education.</P>
      <P>In addition, to promote early intervention programs for disabled children, the
bill states that special education should begin as soon as the child reaches the
age of 3.</P>
      <P>ADHD is one of the most common childhood disorders and can continue through
adolescence and adulthood. Local studies show that ADHD affects 7.5 percent to
9.9 percent of children in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Symptoms of ADHD include difficulty staying focused and paying attention,
difficulty controlling behavior and hyperactivity.</P>
      <P>Without treatment, ADHD can cause problems at home, school, work, and with
relationships.</P>

      <P>A pair of coatis, also known as hog-nosed coons, which are endemic to tropical
zones of South America, were introduced to the public at the Taipei Zoo for the
first time last July.</P>
      <P>The pair gave birth to six cubs in January, but five of them died the following
day, probably because of their mother's inability to rear them, said Jason Yeh,

      <P>A special department for the display and sale of Taiwan food will be opened
April 10 at City Shop, an upscale supermarket in Shanghai, organizers said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Victor Chu, representative of the semi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) in Shanghai, said the special department  was  set
up through  the joint  efforts  of the TAITRA-affiliated Taipei World Trade
Center and City Shop executives.</P>
      <P>TAITRA  Chairman  Wang  Chih-kang  and  Huang  Chih-peng, director-general of
the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , will
preside over the opening ceremony in Shanghai Friday, Chu said.</P>
      <P>According to Chu, the increase in two-way exchanges brought about by the wider
opening of cross-Taiwan Strait tourism last year has helped to stir Chinese
consumers' interest in Taiwan-made foodstuff.</P>
      <P>In a bid to help Chinese consumers learn more about a wide range of Taiwan-

a special department for Taiwan food products in Shanghai, he said.</P>
      <P>City Shop owns 12 stores in the city and one in Beijing. The Shanghai-based food
importer also operates farms, tourism resort parks, coffee factories, bakeries

      <P>The number of workers on unpaid leave in the country's export processing zones
has decreased by half over the past month thanks to an influx of rush orders,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the Export Processing Zone Administration (EPZA) under the MOEA
show that only 11,000 workers in the zones were still on furlough as of
Wednesday, down from 22,000 people March 10 and 26,000 people Feb. 10.</P>
      <P>There are more than 200 businesses operating in the seven processing zones
around Taiwan, with a combined workforce amounting to approximately 56,000
people, according to EPZA tallies.</P>
      <P>Affected by the global economic downturn, 4,186 workers in the zones were laid
off between September and December 2008, and 1,912 during the first three months
of this year, the statistics indicate.</P>
      <P>However, rush orders have been coming in since the end of the Chinese New Year
holiday in early February and according to EPZA deputy chief Tai Jui-ching, many
of them that were originally only good for one month have now been extended to
short-term orders for two to three months, which has rapidly restored capacity
utilization in the processing zones.</P>
      <P>Tai said many electronics manufacturers in the processing zones have abolished
unpaid leave for their workers for the last two weeks, adding that further
observation will be required in the coming two months to see if the rush order
effect continues.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  in what will be the first large-scale  worker recruitment drive

      <P>Taiwan is home to a wide variety of crafts, from stone and wood carving to glass
work, but talented local craftsmen have difficulties marketing their products,
which led the National Taiwan Craft Research Institute  (NTCRI)  to announce
Wednesday  that  it will  step  up efforts  to help  promote locally-created
handicraft works.</P>
      <P>Institute Director Lin Cheng-yi told a press conference that despite the talents
in many different fields, most local artists are unable to build their own brand
names and increase sales of their creative works.</P>
      <P>To help the craftsmen, the institute began a few years ago to assist  individual
artists  in selling  to the domestic  and international markets, by promoting
local arts and crafts creations through  various marketing  channels,  including
online shops, department stores and hotels, as well as 117 NTCRI-certified
crafts workshops around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It has also contracted retail stores and resort hotels to display native craft
work, Lin said at the press conference held to present the NTCRI's efforts to
promote local handicraft works.</P>
      <P>Four noted hotels have been selected to serve as model sites to showcase and
market local handicraft works, which include the Shangrila Boutique Hotel in
Ilan County, northeastern Taiwan; the Young Lake Hotel in Miaoli County,
northern Taiwan; the Freshfields hotel in Taichung County, central Taiwan; and
the Hotel Holiday Garden in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin said the NTCRI has also opened an exhibition hall for Taiwanese
handicraft products in the Park Lane by CMP department store in Taichung City to
display and sell works from the NTCRI-certified crafts workshops.</P>
      <P>Overseas and domestic tourists can get a sense of the wide array of Taiwanese
handicrafts by visiting the concept hall and the hotel's gift shops.</P>
      <P>Lin further said the NTCRI will continue to invite more hotels to help market

English conversation courses for business operators, he said.</P>
      <P>Currently, more than 300 store and street stand owners in the city are taking

      <P>Taiwanese golfer Lin Wen-tang will be extremely focused when he faces top
players from around the world at the 52nd U.S. Masters beginning Thursday, but
he vowed to keep a smile on his face as he plays in golf's first major of the
year.</P>
      <P>Even if the 35-year-old doesn't challenge Tiger Woods or some of the other
favorites for the title, or fails to make the cut, he will still be the first
Taiwanese golfer to play in the prestigious event at the revered Augusta
National Golf Club since T.C. Chen in 1989.</P>
      <P>Lin, the son of a golf coach, began to play golf at the age of 5. He had
captured amateur golf titles in Taiwan and Hong Kong before turning pro in 1996.</P>
      <P>He has won four Asian PGA Tour victories, all coming since 2006, but his
breakout year came in 2008, when he finished second on the Tour's Order of Merit
with US$844,734 in prize money after capturing the Asian Tour International,
Thailand and the 2008 UBS Hong Kong Open.</P>
      <P>Lin also had two seconds and finished in the top-10 nine other times in 20
tournaments. Lin's world ranking rose significantly after he became the first
Asian golfer to win the UBS Hong Kong Open in 10 years, and improved to No. 49
in the world after tying for sixth place in the 2008 Asian Masters.</P>
      <P>His ranking inside the top 50 secured him a spot at the Masters, which he
admitted in an interview with the Asian Tour was athrill but also a real test of
his ability as a golfer.</P>
      <P>(I've) always wanted to be a part of it. But I'm also aware of the pressure, he
said.To  excel at the highest  level in professional golf, your mental strength
has to be very strong. I'll do my best and as long as I do it, I believe my

    <HEADLINE>Q1 tax revenue posts largest annual decrease</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
04/08/09  22:58:04
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's tax revenue for the first quarter of this year was NT$245.3 billion
(US$7.34 billion), down by NT$58.6 billion year-on-year, or 19.3 percent -- the
biggest drop in the country's history, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Q1 tax revenue amounted to only 13.7 percent of the annual target set by the
government, which was also a new low since 2001, according to statistics
released by the MOF's Department  of Statistics.</P>
      <P>However, for the month of March, tax offices nationwide collected NT$7.5 billion
in stock transaction taxes, which represented a new single-month high since
August last year, the statistics showed. MOF officials attributed this growth to
a rising stock market, which to date has recorded the world's second-biggest
rebound of more than 20 percent since late last year, after the Chinese bourse.</P>
      <P>Stock transaction taxes for Q1 totaled NT$14.7 billion, an increase of NT$1.5
billion compared to the figure posted in last Q4. However, this was a NT$12.4
billion drop, or 45.9 percent reduction, year-on-year.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, a total of NT$8.9 billion in land value
increment taxes was collected, marking a drop of NT$5.6 billion, or 38.6
percent, compared to the same period in 2008.</P>
      <P>This was a result of a sluggish real-estate and property market, which has been
hit hard by the global financial crisis since last September, MOF officials
said.</P>
      <P>In March, the national coffers received NT$3.7 billion in land value increment
taxes, down by NT$1.5 billion from the year-earlier level, the MOF statistics
showed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Q1 business taxes totaled NT$65.9 billion, dropping by NT$13.5
billion from the same period last year and representing a negative growth of 17
percent year-on-year due to a large decline in imports.</P>
      <P>March business taxes amounted to NT$38 billion, a decrease of NT$6.4 billion, or
a reduction of 14.4 percent, compared to the previous March's level, according
to the tallies.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's No.2 negotiator with China left for Shanghai Wednesday on a visit
reportedly aimed at arranging for a third round of high-level cross-strait talks
on matters of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Kao, vice chairman and secretary-general of the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) , kept a low profile and refrained from answering any questions
from the press about the purpose of his Shanghai visit. He was accompanied by
SEF Deputy Secretary-General Kao Wen-cheng.</P>
      <P>Four other SEF staff members also traveled to China Wednesday on a different
flight, sources said.</P>
      <P>Lai Shin-yuan, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council that
oversees SEF operations, said a day earlier that in view of the continued
improvement in cross-strait relations, the third round of high-level cross-
strait talks will be held in May ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lai said the exact dates and venue for the third meeting between
SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung  and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin,
president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), have yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>Political sources said it is believed that Kao will hold preparatory talks with
ARATS officials during his current visit to set the stage for the upcoming
Chiang-Chen meeting. The agenda for the meeting will include cooperation in
financial fields and crime-fighting and launch of regular scheduled flights.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen met twice last year to sign six critical agreements on the
launch of direct charter flights and shipping and postal links as well as the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) remained at an impasse
Wednesday over which of two competing candidates should run for Tainan
magistrate in year-end elections, a DPP lawmaker acknowledged.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Lee Chun-yi, who was nominated by the party a week earlier to run
for the position in December, told reporters that he had a friendly half-hour
meeting on the issue a day earlier with another self-proclaimed DPP candidate,
Tan Sun Chen, but to no avail.</P>
      <P>"So far we have not found a way for Chen to withdraw his candidacy, but we are
still making more efforts," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed worry that he is now in a situation that will not allow him to
back out of the race, because if he does so, it will not only ruin his political
career but also destroy the credibility of the DPP.</P>
      <P>He said the only hope for a solution to the issue now lies in whether DPP
heavyweights can persuade Chen to withdraw his candidacy.</P>
      <P>Chen, a 74-year-old party veteran, announced last week that he will run for the
Tainan magistrate post.</P>
      <P>He has served in a series of high-level positions during his political career,
including Tainan magistrate, minister of foreign affairs and secretary-general
of the Presidential Office under the former DPP administration.</P>
      <P>He claimed he has become a victim of factional fighting within the party and
vowed that he will go the distance in the election in defiance of factional
dominance within the party.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed confidence that he will emerge as the front-runner in the
election and suggested that the party leadership should have chosen the nominee
by means of an opinion poll that would have gauged who had the strongest support
among the DPP members and voters.</P>

      <P>Eighteen replicas of sculptures from the world renowned Louvre Museum's
"touching exhibition" were unveiled at Taipei's  National Museum of History
Wednesday,  with visitors encouraged to feel the works with their hands.</P>
      <P>Huang Yung-chuan, director of the National Museum of History, said at a news
conference to unveil the sculptures that Taipei is very fortunate to be the
first stop on the exhibition's first overseas tour.</P>
      <P>He added that it is a result of more than two years of planning and cooperation
among the National Museum of History, the Louvre, the French Institute in
Taipei, the Taiwan Foundation for the Blind and the Ravenel Art Group.</P>
      <P>Introduced  in 1995,  the exhibition aims at bringing the experience of art to
visually challenged people, as rather than being warned to keep their hands off
the works, visitors are asked to indulge themselves by feeling and touching the
reproductions of famous sculptures.</P>
      <P>Alice Rambert,  project manager of the Louvre's  Education Department, said at
the news conference that the exhibition will strengthen not only the cooperation
between the two museums, but also cultural exchanges between Taiwan and France.</P>
      <P>"This exhibition will serve as a bridge between the visually impaired and
sighted people and will give them a whole new feeling of art appreciation,"
Rambert said.</P>
      <P>Daisy Xu, vice president of Ravenel Art Group, said that by sponsoring the
event, she hopes a message will be sent that more people and enterprises should
support such art exhibitions and show more care for underprivileged groups.</P>
      <P>The 18 sculptures, including reproductions of the Venus de Milo, the Borghese
Gladiator and the Rebel Slave, are resin or plaster reproductions of the marble
originals, according to the organizers, who added that because the Louvre used
3D laser readings of each piece, the replicas are exact copies.</P>
      <P>From April 10 to May 24, the exhibition, titled "Sculptures in Movement, " will
be held at the National Museum of History, moving to Kaohsiung Museum of Fine
Arts from June 20 to August 23 before traveling on to Beijing, Hangzhou and
Wuhan in China.</P>
      <P>Blindfolds will be available at the exhibition to enhance the sense of touch for
the non-vision-impaired.</P>

      <P>Children suffering from attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) will be
given access to special education if an amendment to the Special Education Act
clears the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The bill,  which completed  a preliminary  review  by the legislature's
Education and Culture Committee Wednesday, would expand the eligibility for
special education to include children with behavioral disorders, also covering
hyperactive children.</P>
      <P>The legislation must still pass two more votes by the full lawmaking body before
the amendment can be implemented.</P>
      <P>In light  of the fact  that some children  with learning disabilities do not
necessarily have any easily identifiable physical or mental disabilities, the
bill stipulates that any child who has been "professionally  evaluated and
assessed as having special learning needs" would qualify for special education.</P>
      <P>In addition, to promote early intervention programs for disabled children, the
bill states that special education should begin as soon as the child reaches the
age of 3.</P>
      <P>ADHD is one of the most common childhood disorders and can continue through
adolescence and adulthood. Local studies show that ADHD affects 7.5 percent to
9.9 percent of children in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Symptoms of ADHD include difficulty staying focused and paying attention,
difficulty controlling behavior and hyperactivity.</P>
      <P>Without treatment, ADHD can cause problems at home, school, work, and with

zones of South America, were introduced to the public at the Taipei Zoo for the

      <P>A special department for the display and sale of Taiwan food will be opened
April 10 at City Shop, an upscale supermarket in Shanghai, organizers said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Victor Chu, representative of the semi-official Taiwan External Trade

      <P>The number of workers on unpaid leave in the country's export processing zones
has decreased by half over the past month thanks to an influx of rush orders,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the Export Processing Zone Administration (EPZA) under the MOEA
show that only 11,000 workers in the zones were still on furlough as of
Wednesday, down from 22,000 people March 10 and 26,000 people Feb. 10.</P>
      <P>There are more than 200 businesses operating in the seven processing zones
around Taiwan, with a combined workforce amounting to approximately 56,000
people, according to EPZA tallies.</P>
      <P>Affected by the global economic downturn, 4,186 workers in the zones were laid
off between September and December 2008, and 1,912 during the first three months
of this year, the statistics indicate.</P>
      <P>However, rush orders have been coming in since the end of the Chinese New Year
holiday in early February and according to EPZA deputy chief Tai Jui-ching, many
of them that were originally only good for one month have now been extended to
short-term orders for two to three months, which has rapidly restored capacity
utilization in the processing zones.</P>
      <P>Tai said many electronics manufacturers in the processing zones have abolished
unpaid leave for their workers for the last two weeks, adding that further
observation will be required in the coming two months to see if the rush order
effect continues.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is home to a wide variety of crafts, from stone and wood carving to glass
work, but talented local craftsmen have difficulties marketing their products,
which led the National Taiwan Craft Research Institute  (NTCRI)  to announce
Wednesday  that  it will  step  up efforts  to help  promote locally-created
handicraft works.</P>
      <P>Institute Director Lin Cheng-yi told a press conference that despite the talents
in many different fields, most local artists are unable to build their own brand
names and increase sales of their creative works.</P>
      <P>To help the craftsmen, the institute began a few years ago to assist  individual
artists  in selling  to the domestic  and international markets, by promoting
local arts and crafts creations through  various marketing  channels,  including
online shops, department stores and hotels, as well as 117 NTCRI-certified
crafts workshops around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It has also contracted retail stores and resort hotels to display native craft
work, Lin said at the press conference held to present the NTCRI's efforts to
promote local handicraft works.</P>
      <P>Four noted hotels have been selected to serve as model sites to showcase and
market local handicraft works, which include the Shangrila Boutique Hotel in
Ilan County, northeastern Taiwan; the Young Lake Hotel in Miaoli County,
northern Taiwan; the Freshfields hotel in Taichung County, central Taiwan; and
the Hotel Holiday Garden in Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lin said the NTCRI has also opened an exhibition hall for Taiwanese
handicraft products in the Park Lane by CMP department store in Taichung City to
display and sell works from the NTCRI-certified crafts workshops.</P>
      <P>Overseas and domestic tourists can get a sense of the wide array of Taiwanese
handicrafts by visiting the concept hall and the hotel's gift shops.</P>
      <P>Lin further said the NTCRI will continue to invite more hotels to help market

cameras on streets all over the city to fight crime and monitor traffic
conditions, Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After hearing a briefing at the Taipei City Police Department on a plan for the
new video surveillance system, Hau told reporters that the 13,000 latest model
CCTV video cameras, including 1,500 megapixel ones, will be mounted at strategic
locations on the city's public roads to make Taipei a safer metropolis.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the new equipment would mean a further erosion of residents'
privacy, Hau said that no one will be given access to the recorded tapes without
a justifiable reason.</P>
      <P>He added that all the video footage will be recordings of activities on public
roads and will not infringe on people's privacy in their homes.</P>
      <P>According to police executives, the new cameras, linked to a computer terminal,
will be able to home in on suspected targets and will have the ability to detect
cars thefts by reading the number plates of vehicles and sounding alarms.</P>

campaign to encourage residents and their foreign friends to visit a local night
market, a city official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>For the price of one dollar, visitors will have an opportunity on April 11 to
sample the traditional dishes on offer at the Chung Hsiao night market located
between the Ching Nien Road and the Ling Ya Road, said Ho Yi-lun, head of the

provide English content on their Web sites, The money is also being used to fund
English conversation courses for business operators, he said.</P>
      <P>Currently, more than 300 store and street stand owners in the city are taking
the courses, Ho added.</P>
      <P>Some 20 street stand operators at the Ching Hsiao night market have already
completed the training and have been certified as English service providers, Ho
said.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese golfer Lin Wen-tang will be extremely focused when he faces top
players from around the world at the 52nd U.S. Masters beginning Thursday, but
he vowed to keep a smile on his face as he plays in golf's first major of the
year.</P>
      <P>Even if the 35-year-old doesn't challenge Tiger Woods or some of the other
favorites for the title, or fails to make the cut, he will still be the first
Taiwanese golfer to play in the prestigious event at the revered Augusta
National Golf Club since T.C. Chen in 1989.</P>
      <P>Lin, the son of a golf coach, began to play golf at the age of 5. He had
captured amateur golf titles in Taiwan and Hong Kong before turning pro in 1996.</P>
      <P>He has won four Asian PGA Tour victories, all coming since 2006, but his
breakout year came in 2008, when he finished second on the Tour's Order of Merit
with US$844,734 in prize money after capturing the Asian Tour International,
Thailand and the 2008 UBS Hong Kong Open.</P>
      <P>Lin also had two seconds and finished in the top-10 nine other times in 20
tournaments. Lin's world ranking rose significantly after he became the first
Asian golfer to win the UBS Hong Kong Open in 10 years, and improved to No. 49
in the world after tying for sixth place in the 2008 Asian Masters.</P>
      <P>His ranking inside the top 50 secured him a spot at the Masters, which he
admitted in an interview with the Asian Tour was athrill but also a real test of
his ability as a golfer.</P>
      <P>(I've) always wanted to be a part of it. But I'm also aware of the pressure, he
said.To  excel at the highest  level in professional golf, your mental strength
has to be very strong. I'll do my best and as long as I do it, I believe my
results will come.</P>
      <P>Lin has spent the last few weeks in the United States preparing for the big
tournament, but he already has a strategy for coping with pressure, as he
revealed after winning the UBS Hong Kong Open last year.</P>
      <P>"Psychological strength is the key to stand out in a high-profile golf game. I
have always reminded myself to smile, to take it easy, to be composed and
concentrate and never to be distracted by anything else no matter whether I play
well or less than ideal, " he told reporters at a post-tournament news
conference.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's tax revenue for the first quarter of this year was NT$245.3 billion
(US$7.34 billion), down by NT$58.6 billion year-on-year, or 19.3 percent -- the
biggest drop in the country's history, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) reported
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Q1 tax revenue amounted to only 13.7 percent of the annual target set by the
government, which was also a new low since 2001, according to statistics
released by the MOF's Department  of Statistics.</P>
      <P>However, for the month of March, tax offices nationwide collected NT$7.5 billion
in stock transaction taxes, which represented a new single-month high since
August last year, the statistics showed. MOF officials attributed this growth to
a rising stock market, which to date has recorded the world's second-biggest
rebound of more than 20 percent since late last year, after the Chinese bourse.</P>
      <P>Stock transaction taxes for Q1 totaled NT$14.7 billion, an increase of NT$1.5
billion compared to the figure posted in last Q4. However, this was a NT$12.4
billion drop, or 45.9 percent reduction, year-on-year.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of this year, a total of NT$8.9 billion in land value
increment taxes was collected, marking a drop of NT$5.6 billion, or 38.6
percent, compared to the same period in 2008.</P>
      <P>This was a result of a sluggish real-estate and property market, which has been
hit hard by the global financial crisis since last September, MOF officials
said.</P>
      <P>In March, the national coffers received NT$3.7 billion in land value increment
taxes, down by NT$1.5 billion from the year-earlier level, the MOF statistics
showed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Q1 business taxes totaled NT$65.9 billion, dropping by NT$13.5
billion from the same period last year and representing a negative growth of 17
percent year-on-year due to a large decline in imports.</P>
      <P>March business taxes amounted to NT$38 billion, a decrease of NT$6.4 billion, or
a reduction of 14.4 percent, compared to the previous March's level, according
to the tallies.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's No.2 negotiator with China left for Shanghai Wednesday on a visit
reportedly aimed at arranging for a third round of high-level cross-strait talks
on matters of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Kao, vice chairman and secretary-general of the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) , kept a low profile and refrained from answering any questions
from the press about the purpose of his Shanghai visit. He was accompanied by
SEF Deputy Secretary-General Kao Wen-cheng.</P>
      <P>Four other SEF staff members also traveled to China Wednesday on a different
flight, sources said.</P>
      <P>Lai Shin-yuan, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council that
oversees SEF operations, said a day earlier that in view of the continued
improvement in cross-strait relations, the third round of high-level cross-
strait talks will be held in May ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lai said the exact dates and venue for the third meeting between
SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung  and his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin,
president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS), have yet to be decided.</P>
      <P>Political sources said it is believed that Kao will hold preparatory talks with
ARATS officials during his current visit to set the stage for the upcoming
Chiang-Chen meeting. The agenda for the meeting will include cooperation in
financial fields and crime-fighting and launch of regular scheduled flights.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen met twice last year to sign six critical agreements on the
launch of direct charter flights and shipping and postal links as well as the
expansion of tourism exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Owner of hijacked Taiwan boat wants to avoid publicity: MOFA</HEADLINE>

      <P>The owner of a Taiwanese deep sea fishing vessel hijacked by Somali pirates in
the Indian Ocean early Monday wishes to maintain a low-profile so that he could
be better positioned to negotiate with the hijackers when they make a ransom
demand, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry is in close contact with the owner of the hijacked vessel
and he has expressed the hope that he could keep a low profile, which will be to
his advantage in any negotiations on the matter," said MOFA spokesman Henry Chen
at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry respects the owner's wishes and is calling on the media to
play this down as much as possible," Chen added.</P>
      <P>The 700-ton long-line fishing ship "Win Far 161" with 30 crew members on board
was hijacked near an island in the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean on Monday. The
ship's skipper and first engineer are Taiwan nationals, five of crew members are
Chinese, 17 are Filipinos and six are Indonesian.</P>
      <P>The MOFA has been trying to obtain updates about the situation from its
representative office in South Africa, and has sought the assistance of the U.K.
Maritime Trade Organization, the maritime liaison office of the U.S' Bahrain-
based 5th fleet, the Seychelles fishery bureau and the Somali harbor bureau to
rescue the Kaohsiung-based vessel.</P>
      <P>While the MOFA is closely monitoring the movement of the ship, which is heading
northwest, it still does not have any news regarding the safety of the crew
members, Chen said at a press briefing Thursday. However, based on past
experience, the crew should not be in danger if the pirates are looking only to
collect a ransom, he added.</P>
      <P>When it obtains further news of the vessel, the ministry will decide what to do
next, he said.</P>
      <P>With the attacks by Somali pirates on commercial  vessels escalating, the
American Institute in Taiwan Taipei Office expressed concern Wednesday over the
incident, saying that the U.S. Department of Defense is taking a closer look at
the matter.</P>
      <P>When asked about the U.S. response, Harry Tseng, director-general of the MOFA's
Department of North American Affairs, said at the press briefing that the U.S.
government is aware of Taiwan's request for assistance to resolve the problem.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. government is still looking into the matter to see if it can provide
any assistance," Tseng said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Huge clan symbolizes Hakka people's preservation of family values</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/09/09  14:19:46</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA staff writer</P>
      <P>For most Taiwanese families, Tomb-Sweeping Day involves gathering a few
relatives and heading out to a cemetery to pay homage to deceased ancestors at
their graves.</P>
      <P>For offspring of the Hakka Chang Liu Ho clan in northern Taiwan's Hsinchu
County, however, the festival takes on the trappings of a major international
conference -- and provides a glimpse into the tightknit family bonds linking
most Hakka people.</P>
      <P>Every year in late March, some 1,500 members of the Chang Liu Ho return to their
ancestral home from all parts of the island and around the world to take part in
the annual ritual that has been a fixture since the late 18th century.</P>
      <P>Tourist buses are arranged, hotel rooms reserved and restaurant tables booked
long beforehand to facilitate the annual reunion, said Chang  Fu-pu,  head  of
the Chang  Liu Ho clan in Hsinchu's Hakka-dominated  Hukou  Township  and  the
town's  incumbent secretary-general.</P>
      <P>The large-scale reunion reflects the essence of the Hakka culture -- they stick
together no matter how distantly related -- which has helped them survive and
thrive throughout history.</P>
      <P>The "Hakka, " literally meaning "guest families" in Cantonese, comprise a unique
ethnic group of Han Chinese, who fled famine and wars in central China in past
centuries and eventually settled in southern and eastern China, predominantly in
the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi and Fujian.</P>
      <P>Hakka people comprise the second largest ethnic group in Taiwan behind the
Hoklo, early immigrants from southern China's Fujian province.</P>
      <P>Unlike the Hoklos, ancestors of Taiwan's Hakkas immigrated mostly from China's
Guangdong province.</P>
      <P>A 2008 survey conducted by the Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs found
that Taiwan's Hakka population -- using a broad definition of the term --
accounts for 25.6 percent of the country's total population.</P>
      <P>They are concentrated in the northern counties of Hsinchu, Miaoli and Taoyuan
and in Pingtung County in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Worldwide, there are an estimated 80 million Hakkas spread out around Southeast
Asia, East Africa, Europe and North and South America, although the number of
Hakka speakers is considerably lower. Former Thailand Prime Minister Thaksin
Shinawatra is just one of the notable Hakkas dispersed around the globe.</P>
      <P>When Chang Yi-piao headed across the Taiwan Strait in a ferry from Guangdong
province in 1740, he became just one of the millions of Hakkas who have since
left China in search of a better life.</P>
      <P>His ferry landed in Hsinchu, where he settled down, raised a small family and
eventually died, Chang Fu-pu says.</P>
      <P>Chang Yi-piao arrived at a time when most of Taiwan was covered with wild
vegetation or forests, but he survived hardships in his new land and married an
aboriginal woman at the age of 42. It was not until 13 years later that she
successfully bore him a son -- named Chang Ying-shih -- after the deaths of two
infants.</P>
      <P>Although he survived, the young Ying-shih was physically frail as he grew up,
and his parents were worried that he would not live long and carry on the family
name.</P>
      <P>Panicking and feeling helpless in a strange country, Chang Yi-piao sought help
from the spirits of Wu Ju-chih and Wu Ju-liang, brothers who crossed the Taiwan
Strait with him on the same boat before vanishing soon after, to look after the
child.</P>
      <P>Magically, Ying-shih overcame the health problems of his youth and lived to the
age of 88, longevity that was almost unheard of at the time.</P>
      <P>Ying-shih had six sons and from that generation, a Chang family tree began to
thrive. It expanded into a big Hakka clan in the Hsinchu area that only later
became known as the Chang Liu Ho clan, meaning six branches of Changs living
harmoniously under one clan banner.</P>
      <P>Strictly observing Chang Yi-piao's will, the Chang Liu Ho clan requires that all
male offspring must remain as part of the family. In practice, that means no
Chang son can split from the clan after getting married or maintain his own
ancestor-worshipping altar.</P>
      <P>The clan operates an ancestral hall, where a diagram of the big Chang family
tree is maintained and constantly updated as the clan continues to mushroom. It
is now a gigantic diagram of over 2,000 sons and 6,000 people -- if all the
sons' spouses and children are included -- covering 20 generations.</P>
      <P>While Chang family members have shown great loyalty to their forefathers' clan
and the Hakka are among the most patriarchal groups among all Han Chinese,  they
have also shown  a surprisingly progressive edge.</P>
      <P>Defying a traditional Chinese taboo on worshipping people not related to the
family, the clan resolved during an earlier generation that the Wu brothers be
ushered into the Chang ancestral hall and be commemorated by the Chang offspring
annually because of their role as saviors of Chang Ying-shih.</P>
      <P>Also, showing unprecedented respect for gender equity, Chang Fu-pu proposed at a
clan convention in 2007 that women belonging to the clan who were unmarried or
divorced be allowed to be enshrined in the clan's ancestral hall after their
deaths.</P>
      <P>This sign of respect to female members of the clan was later emulated by many
other clans in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lo Lie-shih, an assistant professor in National Chiao Tung University's College
of Hakka Studies, traces the close bonds of Hakka clans seen in the Chang Liu Ho
family to the fears of early Hakka settlers of becoming lost souls, without
anyone to depend on in a hostile and strange country.</P>
      <P>Those fears prompted them to orchestrate a series of rituals to help prevent
them from falling into an eternal panic over being alone and forgotten after
their deaths.</P>
      <P>"Those rituals, stressed over and over again, create an important solidifying
force, " says Lo. Wedding and funeral customs and even election-time maneuvering
also reinforce the clan's bonds, he notes.</P>
      <P>Unlike non-Hakka weddings, where friends comprise the majority of the guests at
the reception, most of those invited to a Hakka wedding are relatives of the
bride and groom, Lo observes.</P>
      <P>For funerals, Lo adds, Hakka people traditionally offer their help and financial
support to the family whose relative died to facilitate the holding of the
funeral service and get them through the mourning period -- making it a family
affair involving the entire community rather than simply the nuclear family.</P>
      <P>Even during elections, the influence of clan power can eclipse political party
loyalties, often swaying election results, Lo says.</P>
      <P>These many traditions  reinforcing  clan bonds allow Hakka offspring to feel a
stronger sense of stability over their futures, and in a modern society where
interpersonal relations can be distant and cold, the Hakka clan's wisdom and
values are worth respecting and even emulating, Lo contended.</P>
      <P>Chang Fu-pu, for one, is proud to have upheld the culture's values and
successfully stewarded the big Hakka family, one of the largest in Taiwan's
genealogical history, through the challenging modern age.</P>
      <P>Though he is uncertain the tight family relationship will survive the test of
time, he feels he has fulfilled his duty.</P>
      <P>"At least I've lived up to my ancestors' expectations and preserved the clan's
legacy," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved Thursday a government restructuring plan that would
downsize the number of ministries and Cabinet agencies from 37 to 29.</P>
      <P>Chiang Yi-hua,  chairman of the Research,  Development and Evaluation
Commission, said after a weekly Cabinet meeting that under the restructuring
plan, there will be 13 ministries, nine councils and commissions, two
directorate-generals, and three independent agencies and two other
organizations.</P>
      <P>The new structure will be adopted in 2011, pending amendment of the Executive
Yuan's organic law by the legislature, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The 13 ministries would cover interior affairs, foreign affairs, national
defense, finance, education, justice, economic affairs, transportation and
construction, health and social welfare, culture, labor affairs, agriculture,
and environmental resources, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The nine councils and commissions would deal with overseas compatriot affairs,
veterans affairs, science, national development, China affairs,  indigenous
affairs,  Hakka affairs,  financial supervision and maritime affairs, he added.</P>
      <P>The two directorate-generals would be in charge of personnel management and
budget, accounting and statistics, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The three independent agencies would be the Central Election Commission, the
Fair Trade Commission and the National Communications Commission, he stated.</P>
      <P>The remaining two organizations would be the Central Bank and the National
Palace Museum, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the government had originally intended to merge the existing
Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
form a new "Ministry of Foreign and Overseas Compatriot Affairs, " but later
decided to drop the plan after some Taiwanese expatriates expressed opposition
to it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's role in global economic arena depends on China: economists</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of whether or not Taiwan will be able to play a role in the
international economic arena remains in the hands of China, despite the fact
that the island has foreign reserves that far exceed those of many major
economies in the world, two noted U.S. economists said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"I've always thought that Beijing is taking a very tough line on Taiwan's
participation in international organizations, and I don't see we have much
leverage to change that, " said Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the U.S.
non-governmental Peterson Institute for International Economics.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to a question at a video conference held by the
Office of Trade Negotiations of Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on
the topic "the Global, Regional and Local Significance of the Outcome of the G20
Summit in London."</P>
      <P>"I don't see that external actors -- the United States or anybody else -- have
any leverage to change that," Lardy said. "Until the Chinese on the mainland
have a change of view, it seems unlikely to happen."</P>
      <P>Michael Mussa, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute and a former economic
counselor and director of the Department of Research at the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), expressed a similar view.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's GDP might be bigger than the bottom two or three economies that
participated in the G20 summit, the possibility for it to play a role in the
summit or in similar international economic meetings is very slim due to China's
obstruction, Mussa said.</P>
      <P>He noted that from Taiwan's perspective, its accession to the World Trade
Organization and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum under the
designation Chinese Taipei was arguably its most important achievement in this
area. However, Mussa said he doubted Taiwan would be able to go further than
that, and certainly not to the G20 summit.</P>
      <P>"That is not one that the Beijing government will go along with it at all," he
said.</P>
      <P>The noted economist added that while he would not rule out the possibility that
at some point Taiwan would be able to join the World Bank, the IMF, or some
other institution of that kind if the relations between Taipei and Beijing
continue to improve, fundamentally it all depends on the attitude of the Beijing
government.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has finalized a feasibility study for an anti-
corruption agency and has drafted a national integrity action plan that will be
submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before being implemented, MOJ
Minister Wang Ching-feng said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang unveiled the plan at a legislative session in reaction to President Ma
Ying-jeou's call Wednesday for government and judiciary reviews of major
corruption cases and for the introduction of concrete proposals within three
months to address the corruption situation in the country.</P>
      <P>The president made the call in light of a report by a Hong Kong consultancy that
stated corruption was worse in Taiwan than in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Saying that she has always known of Ma's resolve to fight corruption, Wang added
that the ministry is well prepared to set up the agency as proposed.</P>
      <P>But she turned down a suggestion by Kuomintang Legislator Chiu Yi that a special
Cabinet-level anti-corruption committee should be established to vertically and
horizontally integrate the operations of all Cabinet agencies, saying there is
no need to do so.</P>
      <P>In an effort to clean up corruption in Taiwan, the MOJ has launched various
reform measures over the past year to promote integrity among public officials,
according to a ministry official.</P>
      <P>The measures include encouraging the central government as well as cities and
counties to set up anti-corruption commissions and publish anti-corruption
reports, the official said. They also include formulating a code of ethics and
revising anti-corruption regulations for public employees,  enacting an anti-
corruption law against unexplained wealth, and helping companies launch measures
to promote business ethics, the official added.</P>
      <P>To keep abreast of anti-corruption trends around the world, the ministry has
come up with a draft national integrity action plan that combines the existing
well-formed government ethics program, the program for getting rid of organized
crime and corruption, and the anti-corruption program, the official said.</P>
      <P>The action plan aims to combat and prevent corruption, strengthen public servant
ethics,  promote honesty in business,  step up anti-corruption education, make
the government more open, make the government  procurement  process more
transparent,  ensure fair political participation,  and enhance international
cooperation, according to the official.</P>

      <P>Only about one third of the workers employed by companies at a major science
park in central Taiwan are still being asked to take unpaid leave days, the
management said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yang Wen-ker, director-general of the Central Taiwan Science Park
Administration, said only 6,000 employees working for companies at the park
remain on unpaid leave, and he predicted that the number will further decline
after June in view of the rash of orders that the park has been receiving.</P>
      <P>The number of furloughed workers at the park peaked at around 14,000 in December
last year after the global financial crisis broke in September, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, business turnover at the park in February totaled NT$10.3 billion
(US$308 million) , up by about 20 percent over the January figure of NT$8.6
billion, the park administration reported early this week.</P>
      <P>The Central Taiwan Science Park, with facilities in Taichung City, Taichung
County and the nearby Changhua and Yunlin counties, houses more than 150 high-
tech companies.</P>
      <P>The park was established in 2002 by the Executive Yuan. It is one of three major

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors from the southern city of Tainan will begin to monitor professional
baseball games from Friday in a bid to prevent a reoccurrence of game rigging.</P>
      <P>Starting Friday, a group of 17 prosecutors from the Tainan District Prosecutors
Office, who are also lovers of the baseball game, will take turns to lead local
police to monitor the games and collect evidence if they think there are signs
of rigging, said Lin Chih-feng, a chief prosecutor.</P>
      <P>It would be the first time ever that prosecutors would be openly monitoring
professional baseball games in a bid to stem crime.</P>
      <P>However, only games at the baseball stadiums in Tainan will be monitored, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Professional  baseball game rigging and related underground gambling have been
rampant over the past two decades since Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball
League (CPBL) was launched in 1990.</P>
      <P>Over the years, some coaches and players have been detained and indicted for
game rigging. In some cases, the coach instructed the pitcher and the other
players on the team how to play in order to produce game results in line with
the team owner's plan. This allowed underground gambling rings to net huge
winnings from their bets.</P>
      <P>The accused were usually indicted on charges of fraud, breach of trust and
organized crime, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>In the past, some prosecutors and police units sporadically monitored
professional baseball games, but did so using undercover methods, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was the sixth nation in the world to establish a professional baseball
league, following the United States, Japan, South Korea, Australia and Mexico,
in that order.</P>

      <P>Officials of the SEF and its Chinese counterpart, Association for Relations

      <P>In the latest twist to an ongoing campaign to get Taiwan's Jade Mountain or
Yushan listed as one of the world's seven natural wonders, 24 cyclists from
around the country are biking on the tallest mountain on the island.</P>
      <P>According to the Yushan National Park Headquarters, the cyclists launched the
tour Wednesday, and are expected to complete the 185-kilometer route by Friday,
after going up one of Taiwan's most challenging mountain trails.</P>
      <P>The park headquarters organized the cycling activity in an effort to boost the
international image of the tallest peak in northeast Asia, which reaches 3,952
meters.</P>
      <P>Park rangers said that the cyclists, including Cheng Huai, the Taiwanese athlete
who will participate in the cycling events in the 21st Deaflympics Taipei 2009
slated for Sept. 5-16, set off from the national park's Nan-an tourist center in
Hualien County, eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They will ride on the challenging South Cross-Island Highway -- one of the major
roads that bridges the southern and eastern parts of Taiwan -- and the new
Cross-Island Highway, before arriving at the national park headquarters in
Shueili Township of Nantou County, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Park Headquarters Deputy Director Wu Hsiang-chien said Wednesday that the riders
entered the South Cross-Island Highway from Chihshang and Haiduan townships in
Taitung County, southeastern Taiwan, earlier in the day. They will then climb to
the highway's highest point of Yakou, at 2,722 meters, before descending to the
national park's Meishan tourist center.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to bike all the way up to Yushan's 3,952-meter peak due to
the lack of bike trails.</P>
      <P>On Thursday and Friday, the group will ride on the Alishan highway in Chiayi
County and the new Cross-Island Highway to complete the cycling activity in
Nantou, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The cycling challenge is also part of the celebrations for the national park's
24th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Park officials said they hope the cyclists' enthusiasm, energy and spirit of
embracing challenges will be demonstrated to the public, and they hope the
activity will help unite Taiwanese people around the goal of bringing Yushan
onto the world's stage.</P>
      <P>Each of the cyclists are wearing a vest printed with the slogan "Vote for
Yushan."</P>
      <P>Organizers urged all Taiwanese people to give their support for Yushan, and for
Taiwan, by voting online in the global competition.</P>
      <P>According to the organizer, the riders come from different social sectors, with
some working as either the chairman or general manager of businesses, restaurant
chef, or editor-in-chief of a publication. Others work as a professor,
photographer, or engineer.</P>
      <P>Yushan is currently in first place in the "mountains, volcanoes" category in the
contest for the world's new seven natural wonders organized by the Swiss-based
New7Wonders Foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation initiated the campaign after organizing the selection of the
seven manmade wonders of the world.</P>
      <P>In the ongoing second round of the worldwide online voting, 261 natural sites in
222 countries, including Loch Ness in Scotland, the Grand Canyon in Arizona,
Mount Fuji in Japan, the Yangtze River in China and Jeju Island in South Korea,
are competing in seven categories for the title of the "New Seven Wonders of the
Natural World."</P>
      <P>Yushan is the only natural attraction from Taiwan to make the list of contenders
in any category, and is up against Mount Everest, Mount Fuji, Mount Olympus and
K2 Mountain in the mountains and volcanoes category.</P>
      <P>The top 11 sites chosen in each of the seven categories by July 7 will then be
reviewed by a panel of experts headed by Federico Mayor Zaragoza, former
director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), who will select three nominees in each category.</P>
      <P>The 21 nominees will be put to the final round of the worldwide online vote in
2010 and 2011 to select the top seven wonders in the landscape,  island,
mountain, cave, forest, lake and seascape categories.</P>
      <P>Yushan, located along the boundaries of Chiayi, Nantou and Kaohsiung counties,
is known for its diverse wildlife and ecology.</P>
      <P>To boost Yushan's chances of being selected, the national park headquarters
urged the public to cast their vote for the mountain by visiting the Web site

    <HEADLINE>Investable assets shrink for 73% of working investors: survey</HEADLINE>

      <P>The majority of Taiwan office workers with financial investments have suffered
losses as a result of the global financial crisis, according to the results of a
survey released Thursday by the online employment broker 1111 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted among 1,413 office workers between March 27 and April 7,
found that 36.16 percent of the respondents have invested in financial products
over the past six months.</P>
      <P>Some 73.1 percent of these investors complained about shrinkage of their
investable assets, saying that their wealth has contracted by 42.46 percent on
average.</P>
      <P>Only 7.03 percent of the investors have made profits, while 14.48 percent have
broken even on their investments, and 5.48 percent are unaware of their
investment outcomes, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>The poor investment performance, however, has not dampened the workers' interest
in financial investment, as nearly 77 percent of respondents indicated their
intention to continue investment in the next six months.</P>
      <P>Some 20.24 percent said they would take an aggressive approach, as opposed to
30.29 percent who planned to be more conservative.</P>
      <P>In addition, the survey revealed that 55.27 percent of workers have developed an
interest in acquiring investment know-how, in light of the financial crisis.
Those with full-time jobs and those who have not been affected by the furlough
policy are showing greater interest than others, the results indicated.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that workers are taking a more proactive attitude toward
continuing studies, amid the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Nearly 66 percent of the respondents are engaged in continuing studies, up 19.13
percent from October 2008 when a similar survey was conducted.</P>
      <P>Regarding the objectives that the respondents are trying to achieve, the poll
showed that 62.83 percent wish to enhance their professional skills, 58.32
percent hope to improve their employment opportunities, and 49.08 percent want
to develop a second area of expertise.</P>
      <P>More than 43 percent of the respondents are focusing on studies on information
literacy and computer know-how, and approximately 37 percent are concentrating
on technical skills and personal talent.</P>
      <P>However, nearly 60 percent of the workers engaged in continuing studies have
reduced their spending in this regard because of the weak economy, with their
spending for this purpose averaging NT$5,159 per month.</P>
      <P>Self-study -- the option that costs the least money -- has become the most
popular choice, favored by 46.61 percent of the workers, according to the
survey. The second-most popular choice is enrolling in programs provided by
private educational institutions or cram schools -- an option that is favored by
35.11 percent of workers.</P>
      <P>Attending speeches or lectures was the next most popular choice, with 31.21
percent of workers opting for this route.</P>
      <P>Registering in university continuing studies programs, which was the top choice
in October, has now dropped to fifth place due to high costs, with 23.2 percent
of the workers choosing this option.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung to cut foreign workers as unemployment rises to 6%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April 9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government pledged Thursday to cut back on the number of
foreign laborers working in the city and save those jobs for locals, as the
city's unemployment rate is estimated to have climbed past the national 5.75
percent average to break the 6 percent mark.</P>
      <P>City Director of Labor Affairs Chung Kung-chao made the statement after a city
councilor, Lin Kuo-cheng, expressed concern over rising unemployment in the
southern Taiwan port city.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics from the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs and the
city's Bureau of Labor Affairs, Lin said that the average national effective
employment rate among people seeking jobs was 38 percent in 2008, while in
Kaohsiung the figure was only 27 percent.</P>
      <P>In February, the effective employment rate among job seekers in Kaohsiung fell
to 10 percent, also much lower than the national average of 22 percent for that
month, he said.</P>
      <P>The figures show that there are fewer work opportunities in Kaohsiung than in
the northern part of the island, Lin said, urging the city bureau to take
measures to protect the employment rights of local citizens.</P>
      <P>At the City Council, Chung pointed out that the city's jobless population was
33,000 at the end of last year, and that as of February this year the number had
risen by 9,000. This means that the unemployment rate may have exceeded 6
percent, he added.</P>
      <P>There are currently some 706,000 working people in the port city, Chung said.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan tourism delegation is taking part in the World Travel Fair 2009 in
Shanghai, which is being held April 9-11 at the Shanghai New International Expo
Center.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation, led by hotelier Stanley Yen, honorary chairman of the
Taiwan Visitors Association, is composed of several government officials, chiefs
of local governments and executives of 37 Taiwanese travel agencies and hotels.</P>
      <P>Shanghai Deputy Mayor Zhao Wen paid a visit to the Taiwan pavilion soon after
the opening of the Shanghai World Travel Fair, at which she officiated.</P>
      <P>During talks with Zhao, Yen said that a majority of mainland Chinese people
still have an outdated impression that Taiwan's only attractions are Sun Moon
Lake and Alishan.</P>
      <P>In fact, he said, Taiwan has other rich tourism resources, such as quality
hotspring resorts, gourmet food, cycling tours and related facilities, its
aboriginal cultures and an exquisite tea culture.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chinese sightseers are just beginning to visit Taiwan in large
numbers, Yen said Taiwan's target of attracting one million Chinese tourists per
year could be exceeded. The number could reach 3 million or even 5 million a
year if Taiwan's tourism industry operators continue to improve the quality of
their products, said Yen, who is known as the godfather of Taiwan's hotel
service industry and is president of the Landis Hotels and Resorts group.</P>
      <P>Also speaking on the same occasion, Hualien County Magistrate Hsieh Shen-shan
suggested that mainland Chinese tourists should stay for at least one night in
Hualien if they visit the Pacific coast of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Only by making overnight visits can the tourists savor the quality and
attractions of Hualien," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that the Taiwan Visitors Association is leading a Taiwan
delegation to the Shanghai World Travel Fair, which has been a major indicator
of the development of China's outbound travel industry.</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan travel industry operators have participated in the Shanghai
fair on their own.</P>
      <P>Kuo Su Tsan-yang, deputy director-general of the Tourism Bureau under the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications, is also attending the fair in his
capacity as an adviser to the Taiwan Visitors Association.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved an ambitious tourism expansion project Thursday in
its regular weekly meeting, with the aim of turning Taiwan into a tourism hub in
East Asia that could generate NT$550 billion (US$16.5 billion) in tourism
revenue in four years on a planned budget of NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan  instructed government  agencies to cooperate fully in
the program, which the government estimates will help create 400,000 jobs by
2012.</P>
      <P>Speaking after the meeting, Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said the
program will capitalize on upgrading travel quality in Taiwan to lure more
foreign tourists from around the world.</P>
      <P>Through a NT$30 billion fund dedicated to promoting local tourism, Lai said, the
government hopes to rack up NT$550 billion in tourism revenue by 2012, with some
NT$300 billion contributed by foreign tourists and the remaining NT$250 billion
generated from domestic travelers.</P>
      <P>In addition to U.S. and European tourists, Lai said, visitors from countries
such as China and India, as well as countries in the Middle East and Southeast
Asia, will be targeted in the program.</P>
      <P>The government hopes to achieve 4.1 million foreign tourist arrivals for 2009,
4.5 million in 2010, 5 million in 2011 and 5.5 million in 2012, she elaborated.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's marketing program, the Tourism Bureau will divide
the country into four major regions featuring different themes in an effort to
cater to the different tastes of the tourists from around the world, according
to Lai.</P>
      <P>To promote northern Taiwan, the bureau will feature lifestyle aspects such as
the arts, pop music and fashion, she said.</P>
      <P>Tea and flower gardens will be main focus of the bureau when it introduces
central Taiwan regions, while historic monuments will be the major attraction in
its efforts to promote southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The slow pace of life in eastern Taiwan will be capitalized on with an emphasis
on cycle tours and the cultures of indigenous tribes in the area, Lai continued,
adding that the offshore counties of Penghu and Kinmen will be promoted as
international resort islands and as the location of Cold War military relics,
respectively.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There are no safety concerns resulting from the leakage of radioactive material
at a northern Taiwan university described by the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) as
minimal, an AEC official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The amount of the released radiation is far below the allowable level, " the
official said, although he conceded that the level is higher than it has been in
the past.</P>
      <P>"The AEC has demanded that National Tsing Hua University makes a complete report
on the situation within two weeks and also that it makes improvements so that
the same thing does not happen again, " the official said.</P>
      <P>He noted that during a regular check of the Hsinchu City university in February
for radioactivity levels in the fourth quarter of 2008, the council noticed that
the iodine-131 levels in the grass and trees sampled around the production
facility for the radioactive isotope were slightly higher than previously
recorded figures.</P>
      <P>The council therefore alerted the university and told it to conduct checks and
find out the reasons for the changes.</P>
      <P>The council sent officials to the university in late March to learn more about
the situation and found that in order to increase its iodine-131 production, the
facility had modified its production process so that minimal levels of
iodine-131 were not absorbed by the activated carbon used in the manufacturing
process but were instead released into the atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Iodine-131, also called radio iodine, is an iodine radioisotope that has various
medical and pharmaceutical uses.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The global uptake of thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD)
panels is expected to regain near full capacity in the second half of this year
owing to increasing demand, a display market research and consulting firm
forecast Thursday.</P>
      <P>With uptake having dropped to around 70 percent since the start of the global
economic downturn in the final quarter of 2008, it is likely that it will rise
to 80 percent in the second quarter of 2009 and further to 90 percent in the
second half of the year, said David Hsieh, vice president of the Greater China
Market at DisplaySearch, during the 2009 Taiwan FPD International Conference in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>DisplaySearch statistics show that global shipments of large-area TFT-LCD panels
totaled 29.5 million units in February, up 23 percent from  the previous  month,
with  revenue  rising  14 percent month-on-month to reach US$2.96 billion.</P>
      <P>Both figures represent the first positive monthly growth since September 2008,
due mainly to increasing rush orders and inventory refills from clients,
according to DisplaySearch.</P>
      <P>The growth could be an indication that the TFT-LCD industry is at, or near, the
bottom of a cycle, the company said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which shipped 44 percent of the world's large-area panels in 2008, plans
to increase shipments by 12 percent in 2009, DisplaySearch data shows.</P>
      <P>Hsieh predicted that China will become an important market for Taiwan's TFT-LCD
panel sector this year, thanks to that country's latest economic stimulus
measures to encourage  home appliance purchases by rural consumers.</P>
      <P>The phase-out of traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) television sets -- which
presently number 150 million units worldwide -- also bodes well for a promising
market for the TFT-LCD sector in the coming years, Hsieh said.</P>

      <P>Dozens of medical institutions and professionals in southern Taiwan were found
of defrauding more than NT$70 million (US$2.09 million) from the National Health
Insurance program in over 100,000 cases in an investigation conducted during the
first three months of this year, a spokesman for the Tainan Public Prosecutors
Office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Although almost all the cases occurred in Tainan and Kaohsiung cities, the
spokesman said, they represent only "the tip of the iceberg" in the widespread
problem of fraud against the insurance system by medical institutions in the
country.</P>
      <P>Those accused of being involved in the insurance fraud cases include the
Department of Health (DOH) -governed Tainan Hospital Hsinhua Branch, 10 private
clinics, five pharmaceutical stores and about 70 nursing homes, as well as two
clinic owners, 19 medical doctors,  seven pharmacists, and four medical service
brokers, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The Tainan District Court granted a prosecutors' request to detain 12 suspects.
Fourteen others have been released on bail, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>During raids of the medical institutions, investigators removed a batch of
patient records and questioned 22 people, including nine physicians at the DOH
Tainan Hospital, the first time a public hospital was suspected to have been
involved in fraud, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The nine medical professionals, including three active executives and six former
physicians at the hospital, were suspected of colluding with scores of local
nursing homes to defraud the national health care program of NT$30 million
between 2006 and 2008 by issuing a large number of chronic illness prescription
refill slips, according to spokesman.</P>
      <P>The nine doctors have been released on NT$800,000-NT$1 million bail after
admitting to committing fraud, the spokesman said. They had claimed they were
under pressure to reach their business targets set by the hospital to avoid
being fired, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>However, the hospital issued a statement Thursday denying that it had pressed
doctors to meet revenue objectives, adding that some of the accused were
contracted doctors and were unlikely to be under work performance pressure.</P>
      <P>Using fake prescriptions is a common fraud practice against the national health
insurance system, the spokesman added.</P>

      <P>U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc., a leading DRAM technology provider, will not
cooperate with Taiwan Memory Co. (TMC) , but looks forward to more support from
Taiwan's government, corporate executives said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Micron authorized the company's representative, Fred Fishburn, and Charles Kao,
president of Inotera Memories Inc. -- a cooperative partner of both Micron and
Nanya Technology Corp. -- to make the announcement.</P>
      <P>Kao told a news conference that after a comprehensive assessment, Micron has
decided not to cooperate with TMC, a company Taiwan's government is planning to
set up in collaboration with local and foreign business groups to revamp the
country's struggling dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip industry.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, Micron has decided instead to further reinforce its long-term
cooperation with Nanya Technology and Inotera Memories in research and
development of advanced DRAM technology.</P>
      <P>Micron has long been a key technology provider for Nanya and Inotera, both of
which are affiliates of the giant Formosa Plastics Group.</P>
      <P>Kao  said  Micron  hopes  the government  will  give  the Micron-Nanya-Inotera
alliance the same level of support as it would have given to a Micron-TMC
venture.</P>
      <P>Responding to Micron's announcement, TMC's appointed Convener John Hsuan said he
respects the company's decision.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming also said the ministry respects Micron's
decision and that if the Micron-Nanya-Inotera alliance needs the government's
assistance, it can present a concrete plan to the Ministry of Economic Affairs
for evaluation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Nanya Technology Chairman Wu Chia-chau said the Micron -Nanya-Inotera
alliance fully complies with TMC's goal of helping local DRAM manufacturers
acquire core technologies.</P>
      <P>"So we are hopeful that the government will make the best use of our resources
to consolidate the domestic DRAM industry and that in the process, will offer
the same treatment to our alliance as it gives to TMC," Wu added.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Nanya Technology began to invest in the development of DRAM
production technologies eight years ago in cooperation with IBM.</P>
      <P>"Over the past eight years, we have injected NT$40 billion in R&amp;D funds and
built up a certain level of technological proficiency, " Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Moverover, he went on, Nanya Technology has signed a 10-year technological
cooperation pact with Micron on an equal footing and will use Inotera as a joint
research platform.</P>
      <P>Reaffirming the company's commitment to the continued development of
sophisticated DRAM technologies, Wu said both Nanya Technology and Inotera will
increase their capital in the near future to improve their financial status.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the alliance is not seeking a government bailout. "What we need
is the government's assistance in the development of DRAM core technologies," he
added.</P>
      <P>According to Fishburn, Micron decided against an alliance with TMC mainly
because it feared that such a partnership could erode its technological
superiority by exposing its secrets to Elpida, a Japanese company which has
agreed to cooperate with TMC.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's six DRAM makers have suffered from a supply glut as the global economic
slump has sapped demand for electronics and machinery run with semiconductors.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs proposed the establishment of TMC in the hope
that it will focus on technological development to help local chipmakers compete
with their South Korean counterparts, aided by technology from American and
Japanese makers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan will continue to bar Chinese garlic imports: food agency</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Denying allegations that some 30 percent of the garlic sold in Taiwan originates
from China, the Agriculture and Food Agency (AFA) said Thursday that there have
been no legal imports of garlic from there.</P>
      <P>In fact, said AFA Secretary-General Hsu Han-ching, most of the foreign garlic
sold here is imported from Argentina.</P>
      <P>Hsu added that even if Taiwan signs an economic cooperation framework agreement
with China in the near future, the country will still not open its doors to
Chinese garlic.</P>
      <P>"Our policy of restricting  imports of Chinese garlic and protecting the rights
of local farmers will remain unchanged, " Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He told garlic farmers not to be fooled by lies by traders alleging that some 30
percent of Taiwan's garlic is imported from China, which he described as being
aimed at driving down prices.</P>
      <P>He noted that nationwide, the amount of land given over to garlic totaled 5,477
hectares this year, 429 hectares less than last year, with total annual
production expected to top 48,800 tons -- a 10 percent decrease year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Despite the decrease, local garlic can almost meet annual demand -- which
averages about 50,000 tons per year -- he went on, adding that the agency allows
the import of a small amount of garlic, mainly from Argentina, to ensure that
supply fully meets demand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Justice ministry unveils anti-corruption plan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has finalized a feasibility study for an anti-
corruption agency and has drafted a national integrity action plan that will be
submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before being implemented, MOJ
Minister Wang Ching-feng said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang unveiled the plan at a legislative session in reaction to President Ma
Ying-jeou's call Wednesday for government and judiciary reviews of major
corruption cases and for the introduction of concrete proposals within three
months to address the corruption situation in the country.</P>
      <P>The president made the call in light of a report by a Hong Kong consultancy that
stated corruption was worse in Taiwan than in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Saying that she has always known of Ma's resolve to fight corruption, Wang added
that the ministry is well prepared to set up the agency as proposed.</P>
      <P>But she turned down a suggestion by Kuomintang Legislator Chiu Yi that a special
Cabinet-level anti-corruption committee should be established to vertically and
horizontally integrate the operations of all Cabinet agencies, saying there is
no need to do so.</P>
      <P>In an effort to clean up corruption in Taiwan, the MOJ has launched various
reform measures over the past year to promote integrity among public officials,
according to a ministry official.</P>
      <P>The measures include encouraging the central government as well as cities and
counties to set up anti-corruption commissions and publish anti-corruption
reports, the official said. They also include formulating a code of ethics and
revising anti-corruption regulations for public employees,  enacting an anti-
corruption law against unexplained wealth, and helping companies launch measures
to promote business ethics, the official added.</P>
      <P>To keep abreast of anti-corruption trends around the world, the ministry has
come up with a draft national integrity action plan that combines the existing
well-formed government ethics program, the program for getting rid of organized
crime and corruption, and the anti-corruption program, the official said.</P>
      <P>The action plan aims to combat and prevent corruption, strengthen public servant
ethics,  promote honesty in business,  step up anti-corruption education, make
the government more open, make the government  procurement  process more
transparent,  ensure fair political participation,  and enhance international
cooperation, according to the official.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Only about one third of the workers employed by companies at a major science
park in central Taiwan are still being asked to take unpaid leave days, the
management said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yang Wen-ker, director-general of the Central Taiwan Science Park
Administration, said only 6,000 employees working for companies at the park
remain on unpaid leave, and he predicted that the number will further decline
after June in view of the rash of orders that the park has been receiving.</P>
      <P>The number of furloughed workers at the park peaked at around 14,000 in December
last year after the global financial crisis broke in September, Yang noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, business turnover at the park in February totaled NT$10.3 billion
(US$308 million) , up by about 20 percent over the January figure of NT$8.6
billion, the park administration reported early this week.</P>
      <P>The Central Taiwan Science Park, with facilities in Taichung City, Taichung
County and the nearby Changhua and Yunlin counties, houses more than 150 high-
tech companies.</P>
      <P>The park was established in 2002 by the Executive Yuan. It is one of three major
science parks in Taiwan, with the other two being in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan,

    <HEADLINE>Tainan prosecutors to monitor baseball games for rigging</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Prosecutors from the southern city of Tainan will begin to monitor professional
baseball games from Friday in a bid to prevent a reoccurrence of game rigging.</P>
      <P>Starting Friday, a group of 17 prosecutors from the Tainan District Prosecutors
Office, who are also lovers of the baseball game, will take turns to lead local
police to monitor the games and collect evidence if they think there are signs
of rigging, said Lin Chih-feng, a chief prosecutor.</P>
      <P>It would be the first time ever that prosecutors would be openly monitoring
professional baseball games in a bid to stem crime.</P>
      <P>However, only games at the baseball stadiums in Tainan will be monitored, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>Professional  baseball game rigging and related underground gambling have been
rampant over the past two decades since Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball
League (CPBL) was launched in 1990.</P>
      <P>Over the years, some coaches and players have been detained and indicted for
game rigging. In some cases, the coach instructed the pitcher and the other
players on the team how to play in order to produce game results in line with
the team owner's plan. This allowed underground gambling rings to net huge
winnings from their bets.</P>
      <P>The accused were usually indicted on charges of fraud, breach of trust and
organized crime, the prosecutors said.</P>
      <P>In the past, some prosecutors and police units sporadically monitored
professional baseball games, but did so using undercover methods, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was the sixth nation in the world to establish a professional baseball
league, following the United States, Japan, South Korea, Australia and Mexico,
in that order.</P>

      <P>Taiwan and China will discuss plans to increase the current number of charter
flights and open new routes to accommodate the increased tourism exchanges
between the two sides, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Officials of the SEF and its Chinese counterpart, Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , will address the two issues in their
upcoming third round of talks scheduled for later this month  or early May in
China.  The SEF and ARATS  are quasi-official intermediary bodies that handle
exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks at a ceremony that he co-chaired with Shandong Tourism
Bureau Director Yu Chong to mark the start of "2009 Taiwan-Shandong Tourism
Exchange Year."</P>
      <P>Under the exchange plan, 23,000 people from Shandong Province in northern China
will visit Taiwan in the coming year, while 10,000 Taiwanese tourists will
travel to Shandong, Yu said.</P>
      <P>In May, a group of more than 400 Shandong tourists will visit Taiwan via the
mini links -- direct ferry services between Xiamen Port in China's Fujian
Province and the Taiwan-held Kinmen Island, he said. The group of Shandong
tourists will travel to Xiamen by train, he added.</P>
      <P>In an effort to further promote tourism exchanges between Taiwan and Shandong
Province, representatives from the Taipei-based Travel Quality Assurance
Association, along with 10 city and county tourism associations and six tour
agencies, signed a cooperation accord with Shandong tourism representatives from
10 cities and six travel agencies in Shandong.</P>

      <P>In the latest twist to an ongoing campaign to get Taiwan's Jade Mountain or
Yushan listed as one of the world's seven natural wonders, 24 cyclists from
around the country are biking on the tallest mountain on the island.</P>
      <P>According to the Yushan National Park Headquarters, the cyclists launched the
tour Wednesday, and are expected to complete the 185-kilometer route by Friday,
after going up one of Taiwan's most challenging mountain trails.</P>
      <P>The park headquarters organized the cycling activity in an effort to boost the
international image of the tallest peak in northeast Asia, which reaches 3,952
meters.</P>
      <P>Park rangers said that the cyclists, including Cheng Huai, the Taiwanese athlete
who will participate in the cycling events in the 21st Deaflympics Taipei 2009
slated for Sept. 5-16, set off from the national park's Nan-an tourist center in
Hualien County, eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They will ride on the challenging South Cross-Island Highway -- one of the major
roads that bridges the southern and eastern parts of Taiwan -- and the new
Cross-Island Highway, before arriving at the national park headquarters in
Shueili Township of Nantou County, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Park Headquarters Deputy Director Wu Hsiang-chien said Wednesday that the riders
entered the South Cross-Island Highway from Chihshang and Haiduan townships in
Taitung County, southeastern Taiwan, earlier in the day. They will then climb to
the highway's highest point of Yakou, at 2,722 meters, before descending to the
national park's Meishan tourist center.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to bike all the way up to Yushan's 3,952-meter peak due to
the lack of bike trails.</P>
      <P>On Thursday and Friday, the group will ride on the Alishan highway in Chiayi
County and the new Cross-Island Highway to complete the cycling activity in
Nantou, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The cycling challenge is also part of the celebrations for the national park's
24th founding anniversary.</P>
      <P>Park officials said they hope the cyclists' enthusiasm, energy and spirit of
embracing challenges will be demonstrated to the public, and they hope the
activity will help unite Taiwanese people around the goal of bringing Yushan
onto the world's stage.</P>
      <P>Each of the cyclists are wearing a vest printed with the slogan "Vote for
Yushan."</P>
      <P>Organizers urged all Taiwanese people to give their support for Yushan, and for
Taiwan, by voting online in the global competition.</P>
      <P>According to the organizer, the riders come from different social sectors, with
some working as either the chairman or general manager of businesses, restaurant
chef, or editor-in-chief of a publication. Others work as a professor,
photographer, or engineer.</P>
      <P>Yushan is currently in first place in the "mountains, volcanoes" category in the
contest for the world's new seven natural wonders organized by the Swiss-based
New7Wonders Foundation.</P>
      <P>The foundation initiated the campaign after organizing the selection of the
seven manmade wonders of the world.</P>
      <P>In the ongoing second round of the worldwide online voting, 261 natural sites in
222 countries, including Loch Ness in Scotland, the Grand Canyon in Arizona,
Mount Fuji in Japan, the Yangtze River in China and Jeju Island in South Korea,
are competing in seven categories for the title of the "New Seven Wonders of the
Natural World."</P>
      <P>Yushan is the only natural attraction from Taiwan to make the list of contenders
in any category, and is up against Mount Everest, Mount Fuji, Mount Olympus and
K2 Mountain in the mountains and volcanoes category.</P>
      <P>The top 11 sites chosen in each of the seven categories by July 7 will then be
reviewed by a panel of experts headed by Federico Mayor Zaragoza, former
director-general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), who will select three nominees in each category.</P>
      <P>The 21 nominees will be put to the final round of the worldwide online vote in
2010 and 2011 to select the top seven wonders in the landscape,  island,
mountain, cave, forest, lake and seascape categories.</P>
      <P>Yushan, located along the boundaries of Chiayi, Nantou and Kaohsiung counties,
is known for its diverse wildlife and ecology.</P>
      <P>To boost Yushan's chances of being selected, the national park headquarters
urged the public to cast their vote for the mountain by visiting the Web site

      <P>The majority of Taiwan office workers with financial investments have suffered
losses as a result of the global financial crisis, according to the results of a
survey released Thursday by the online employment broker 1111 Job Bank.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted among 1,413 office workers between March 27 and April 7,
found that 36.16 percent of the respondents have invested in financial products
over the past six months.</P>
      <P>Some 73.1 percent of these investors complained about shrinkage of their
investable assets, saying that their wealth has contracted by 42.46 percent on
average.</P>
      <P>Only 7.03 percent of the investors have made profits, while 14.48 percent have
broken even on their investments, and 5.48 percent are unaware of their
investment outcomes, according to the poll.</P>
      <P>The poor investment performance, however, has not dampened the workers' interest
in financial investment, as nearly 77 percent of respondents indicated their
intention to continue investment in the next six months.</P>
      <P>Some 20.24 percent said they would take an aggressive approach, as opposed to
30.29 percent who planned to be more conservative.</P>
      <P>In addition, the survey revealed that 55.27 percent of workers have developed an
interest in acquiring investment know-how, in light of the financial crisis.
Those with full-time jobs and those who have not been affected by the furlough
policy are showing greater interest than others, the results indicated.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that workers are taking a more proactive attitude toward
continuing studies, amid the economic downturn.</P>
      <P>Nearly 66 percent of the respondents are engaged in continuing studies, up 19.13
percent from October 2008 when a similar survey was conducted.</P>
      <P>Regarding the objectives that the respondents are trying to achieve, the poll
showed that 62.83 percent wish to enhance their professional skills, 58.32
percent hope to improve their employment opportunities, and 49.08 percent want
to develop a second area of expertise.</P>
      <P>More than 43 percent of the respondents are focusing on studies on information
literacy and computer know-how, and approximately 37 percent are concentrating
on technical skills and personal talent.</P>
      <P>However, nearly 60 percent of the workers engaged in continuing studies have
reduced their spending in this regard because of the weak economy, with their
spending for this purpose averaging NT$5,159 per month.</P>
      <P>Self-study -- the option that costs the least money -- has become the most
popular choice, favored by 46.61 percent of the workers, according to the
survey. The second-most popular choice is enrolling in programs provided by
private educational institutions or cram schools -- an option that is favored by
35.11 percent of workers.</P>
      <P>Attending speeches or lectures was the next most popular choice, with 31.21
percent of workers opting for this route.</P>
      <P>Registering in university continuing studies programs, which was the top choice
in October, has now dropped to fifth place due to high costs, with 23.2 percent
of the workers choosing this option.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government pledged Thursday to cut back on the number of
foreign laborers working in the city and save those jobs for locals, as the
city's unemployment rate is estimated to have climbed past the national 5.75
percent average to break the 6 percent mark.</P>
      <P>City Director of Labor Affairs Chung Kung-chao made the statement after a city
councilor, Lin Kuo-cheng, expressed concern over rising unemployment in the
southern Taiwan port city.</P>
      <P>Quoting statistics from the Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs and the
city's Bureau of Labor Affairs, Lin said that the average national effective
employment rate among people seeking jobs was 38 percent in 2008, while in
Kaohsiung the figure was only 27 percent.</P>
      <P>In February, the effective employment rate among job seekers in Kaohsiung fell
to 10 percent, also much lower than the national average of 22 percent for that
month, he said.</P>
      <P>The figures show that there are fewer work opportunities in Kaohsiung than in
the northern part of the island, Lin said, urging the city bureau to take
measures to protect the employment rights of local citizens.</P>
      <P>At the City Council, Chung pointed out that the city's jobless population was
33,000 at the end of last year, and that as of February this year the number had
risen by 9,000. This means that the unemployment rate may have exceeded 6
percent, he added.</P>
      <P>There are currently some 706,000 working people in the port city, Chung said.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan tourism delegation is taking part in the World Travel Fair 2009 in
Shanghai, which is being held April 9-11 at the Shanghai New International Expo
Center.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation, led by hotelier Stanley Yen, honorary chairman of the
Taiwan Visitors Association, is composed of several government officials, chiefs
of local governments and executives of 37 Taiwanese travel agencies and hotels.</P>
      <P>Shanghai Deputy Mayor Zhao Wen paid a visit to the Taiwan pavilion soon after
the opening of the Shanghai World Travel Fair, at which she officiated.</P>
      <P>During talks with Zhao, Yen said that a majority of mainland Chinese people
still have an outdated impression that Taiwan's only attractions are Sun Moon
Lake and Alishan.</P>
      <P>In fact, he said, Taiwan has other rich tourism resources, such as quality
hotspring resorts, gourmet food, cycling tours and related facilities, its
aboriginal cultures and an exquisite tea culture.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chinese sightseers are just beginning to visit Taiwan in large
numbers, Yen said Taiwan's target of attracting one million Chinese tourists per
year could be exceeded. The number could reach 3 million or even 5 million a
year if Taiwan's tourism industry operators continue to improve the quality of
their products, said Yen, who is known as the godfather of Taiwan's hotel
service industry and is president of the Landis Hotels and Resorts group.</P>
      <P>Also speaking on the same occasion, Hualien County Magistrate Hsieh Shen-shan
suggested that mainland Chinese tourists should stay for at least one night in
Hualien if they visit the Pacific coast of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Only by making overnight visits can the tourists savor the quality and
attractions of Hualien," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that the Taiwan Visitors Association is leading a Taiwan
delegation to the Shanghai World Travel Fair, which has been a major indicator
of the development of China's outbound travel industry.</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan travel industry operators have participated in the Shanghai

      <P>The Executive Yuan approved an ambitious tourism expansion project Thursday in
its regular weekly meeting, with the aim of turning Taiwan into a tourism hub in
East Asia that could generate NT$550 billion (US$16.5 billion) in tourism
revenue in four years on a planned budget of NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan  instructed government  agencies to cooperate fully in
the program, which the government estimates will help create 400,000 jobs by
2012.</P>
      <P>Speaking after the meeting, Tourism Bureau Director-General Janice Lai said the
program will capitalize on upgrading travel quality in Taiwan to lure more
foreign tourists from around the world.</P>
      <P>Through a NT$30 billion fund dedicated to promoting local tourism, Lai said, the
government hopes to rack up NT$550 billion in tourism revenue by 2012, with some
NT$300 billion contributed by foreign tourists and the remaining NT$250 billion
generated from domestic travelers.</P>
      <P>In addition to U.S. and European tourists, Lai said, visitors from countries
such as China and India, as well as countries in the Middle East and Southeast
Asia, will be targeted in the program.</P>
      <P>The government hopes to achieve 4.1 million foreign tourist arrivals for 2009,
4.5 million in 2010, 5 million in 2011 and 5.5 million in 2012, she elaborated.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's marketing program, the Tourism Bureau will divide
the country into four major regions featuring different themes in an effort to
cater to the different tastes of the tourists from around the world, according
to Lai.</P>
      <P>To promote northern Taiwan, the bureau will feature lifestyle aspects such as
the arts, pop music and fashion, she said.</P>
      <P>Tea and flower gardens will be main focus of the bureau when it introduces
central Taiwan regions, while historic monuments will be the major attraction in
its efforts to promote southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The slow pace of life in eastern Taiwan will be capitalized on with an emphasis
on cycle tours and the cultures of indigenous tribes in the area, Lai continued,
adding that the offshore counties of Penghu and Kinmen will be promoted as
international resort islands and as the location of Cold War military relics,
respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No safety concerns from radioactive leakage at university: AEC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There are no safety concerns resulting from the leakage of radioactive material
at a northern Taiwan university described by the Atomic Energy Council (AEC) as
minimal, an AEC official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The amount of the released radiation is far below the allowable level, " the
official said, although he conceded that the level is higher than it has been in
the past.</P>
      <P>"The AEC has demanded that National Tsing Hua University makes a complete report
on the situation within two weeks and also that it makes improvements so that
the same thing does not happen again, " the official said.</P>
      <P>He noted that during a regular check of the Hsinchu City university in February
for radioactivity levels in the fourth quarter of 2008, the council noticed that
the iodine-131 levels in the grass and trees sampled around the production
facility for the radioactive isotope were slightly higher than previously
recorded figures.</P>
      <P>The council therefore alerted the university and told it to conduct checks and
find out the reasons for the changes.</P>
      <P>The council sent officials to the university in late March to learn more about
the situation and found that in order to increase its iodine-131 production, the
facility had modified its production process so that minimal levels of
iodine-131 were not absorbed by the activated carbon used in the manufacturing
process but were instead released into the atmosphere.</P>
      <P>Iodine-131, also called radio iodine, is an iodine radioisotope that has various
medical and pharmaceutical uses.</P>

      <P>The third round of talks between top negotiators from both sides of the Taiwan
Strait will be held in the Chinese city of Nanjing "barring accidents, " the
spokesman for the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Liu Te-shun said the two sides have both expressed hope that
the talks will take place in a city other than the Chinese capital of Beijing.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks at a press conference on the most recent visit  to  Shanghai
by Kao  Koong-lian,  vice  chairman  and secretary-general of the quasi-official
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , to arrange for the third meeting since last
June between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese counterpart, Chen
Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Kao, accompanied by his deputy Kao Wen-cheng, went to Shanghai Wednesday and
returned the following day.</P>
      <P>Liu said Kao was tasked with discussing procedural problems with ARATS officials
and to gain more understanding of the progress of talks between the two
intermediary bodies in terms of technical issues.</P>
      <P>Judging by the progress to date, the two bodies still need to communicate with
each other on certain technical problems, including the exact date of the high-
profile Chiang-Chen meeting</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said earlier in the week that in view of the
continued improvement in cross-strait ties, the third round of high-level cross-
strait talks will be held in May, ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>Asked about the issue of a proposed cross-strait economic cooperation framework
agreement -- a topic of great concern -- Liu said it is expected to be discussed

    <HEADLINE>TFT-LCD panel uptake expected to rise in Q2</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The global uptake of thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD)
panels is expected to regain near full capacity in the second half of this year
owing to increasing demand, a display market research and consulting firm
forecast Thursday.</P>
      <P>With uptake having dropped to around 70 percent since the start of the global
economic downturn in the final quarter of 2008, it is likely that it will rise
to 80 percent in the second quarter of 2009 and further to 90 percent in the
second half of the year, said David Hsieh, vice president of the Greater China
Market at DisplaySearch, during the 2009 Taiwan FPD International Conference in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>DisplaySearch statistics show that global shipments of large-area TFT-LCD panels
totaled 29.5 million units in February, up 23 percent from  the previous  month,
with  revenue  rising  14 percent month-on-month to reach US$2.96 billion.</P>
      <P>Both figures represent the first positive monthly growth since September 2008,
due mainly to increasing rush orders and inventory refills from clients,
according to DisplaySearch.</P>
      <P>The growth could be an indication that the TFT-LCD industry is at, or near, the
bottom of a cycle, the company said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which shipped 44 percent of the world's large-area panels in 2008, plans
to increase shipments by 12 percent in 2009, DisplaySearch data shows.</P>
      <P>Hsieh predicted that China will become an important market for Taiwan's TFT-LCD
panel sector this year, thanks to that country's latest economic stimulus
measures to encourage  home appliance purchases by rural consumers.</P>
      <P>The phase-out of traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) television sets -- which
presently number 150 million units worldwide -- also bodes well for a promising
market for the TFT-LCD sector in the coming years, Hsieh said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Dozens of medical institutions and professionals in southern Taiwan were found
of defrauding more than NT$70 million (US$2.09 million) from the National Health
Insurance program in over 100,000 cases in an investigation conducted during the
first three months of this year, a spokesman for the Tainan Public Prosecutors
Office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Although almost all the cases occurred in Tainan and Kaohsiung cities, the
spokesman said, they represent only "the tip of the iceberg" in the widespread
problem of fraud against the insurance system by medical institutions in the
country.</P>
      <P>Those accused of being involved in the insurance fraud cases include the
Department of Health (DOH) -governed Tainan Hospital Hsinhua Branch, 10 private
clinics, five pharmaceutical stores and about 70 nursing homes, as well as two
clinic owners, 19 medical doctors,  seven pharmacists, and four medical service
brokers, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The Tainan District Court granted a prosecutors' request to detain 12 suspects.
Fourteen others have been released on bail, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>During raids of the medical institutions, investigators removed a batch of
patient records and questioned 22 people, including nine physicians at the DOH
Tainan Hospital, the first time a public hospital was suspected to have been
involved in fraud, according to the spokesman.</P>
      <P>The nine medical professionals, including three active executives and six former
physicians at the hospital, were suspected of colluding with scores of local
nursing homes to defraud the national health care program of NT$30 million
between 2006 and 2008 by issuing a large number of chronic illness prescription
refill slips, according to spokesman.</P>
      <P>The nine doctors have been released on NT$800,000-NT$1 million bail after
admitting to committing fraud, the spokesman said. They had claimed they were
under pressure to reach their business targets set by the hospital to avoid
being fired, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>However, the hospital issued a statement Thursday denying that it had pressed
doctors to meet revenue objectives, adding that some of the accused were
contracted doctors and were unlikely to be under work performance pressure.</P>
      <P>Using fake prescriptions is a common fraud practice against the national health
insurance system, the spokesman added.</P>

      <P>U.S.-based Micron Technology Inc., a leading DRAM technology provider, will not
cooperate with Taiwan Memory Co. (TMC) , but looks forward to more support from
Taiwan's government, corporate executives said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Micron authorized the company's representative, Fred Fishburn, and Charles Kao,
president of Inotera Memories Inc. -- a cooperative partner of both Micron and
Nanya Technology Corp. -- to make the announcement.</P>
      <P>Kao told a news conference that after a comprehensive assessment, Micron has
decided not to cooperate with TMC, a company Taiwan's government is planning to
set up in collaboration with local and foreign business groups to revamp the
country's struggling dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip industry.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, Micron has decided instead to further reinforce its long-term
cooperation with Nanya Technology and Inotera Memories in research and
development of advanced DRAM technology.</P>
      <P>Micron has long been a key technology provider for Nanya and Inotera, both of
which are affiliates of the giant Formosa Plastics Group.</P>
      <P>Kao  said  Micron  hopes  the government  will  give  the Micron-Nanya-Inotera
alliance the same level of support as it would have given to a Micron-TMC
venture.</P>
      <P>Responding to Micron's announcement, TMC's appointed Convener John Hsuan said he
respects the company's decision.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming also said the ministry respects Micron's
decision and that if the Micron-Nanya-Inotera alliance needs the government's
assistance, it can present a concrete plan to the Ministry of Economic Affairs
for evaluation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Nanya Technology Chairman Wu Chia-chau said the Micron -Nanya-Inotera
alliance fully complies with TMC's goal of helping local DRAM manufacturers
acquire core technologies.</P>
      <P>"So we are hopeful that the government will make the best use of our resources
to consolidate the domestic DRAM industry and that in the process, will offer
the same treatment to our alliance as it gives to TMC," Wu added.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Nanya Technology began to invest in the development of DRAM
production technologies eight years ago in cooperation with IBM.</P>
      <P>"Over the past eight years, we have injected NT$40 billion in R&amp;D funds and
built up a certain level of technological proficiency, " Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Moverover, he went on, Nanya Technology has signed a 10-year technological
cooperation pact with Micron on an equal footing and will use Inotera as a joint
research platform.</P>
      <P>Reaffirming the company's commitment to the continued development of
sophisticated DRAM technologies, Wu said both Nanya Technology and Inotera will
increase their capital in the near future to improve their financial status.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the alliance is not seeking a government bailout. "What we need
is the government's assistance in the development of DRAM core technologies," he
added.</P>
      <P>According to Fishburn, Micron decided against an alliance with TMC mainly
because it feared that such a partnership could erode its technological
superiority by exposing its secrets to Elpida, a Japanese company which has
agreed to cooperate with TMC.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's six DRAM makers have suffered from a supply glut as the global economic
slump has sapped demand for electronics and machinery run with semiconductors.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs proposed the establishment of TMC in the hope
that it will focus on technological development to help local chipmakers compete
with their South Korean counterparts, aided by technology from American and
Japanese makers.</P>

      <P>Denying allegations that some 30 percent of the garlic sold in Taiwan originates
from China, the Agriculture and Food Agency (AFA) said Thursday that there have
been no legal imports of garlic from there.</P>
      <P>In fact, said AFA Secretary-General Hsu Han-ching, most of the foreign garlic
sold here is imported from Argentina.</P>
      <P>Hsu added that even if Taiwan signs an economic cooperation framework agreement
with China in the near future, the country will still not open its doors to
Chinese garlic.</P>
      <P>"Our policy of restricting  imports of Chinese garlic and protecting the rights
of local farmers will remain unchanged, " Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He told garlic farmers not to be fooled by lies by traders alleging that some 30
percent of Taiwan's garlic is imported from China, which he described as being
aimed at driving down prices.</P>
      <P>He noted that nationwide, the amount of land given over to garlic totaled 5,477
hectares this year, 429 hectares less than last year, with total annual
production expected to top 48,800 tons -- a 10 percent decrease year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Despite the decrease, local garlic can almost meet annual demand -- which
averages about 50,000 tons per year -- he went on, adding that the agency allows
the import of a small amount of garlic, mainly from Argentina, to ensure that
supply fully meets demand.</P>

hectares this year, 429 hectares less than last year, with total annual
production expected to top 48,800 tons -- a 10 percent decrease year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Despite the decrease, local garlic can almost meet annual demand -- which
averages about 50,000 tons per year -- he went on, adding that the agency allows
the import of a small amount of garlic, mainly from Argentina, to ensure that
supply fully meets demand.</P>

      <P>Signing a peace agreement with China will be the next step for Taiwan and China
to advance the warming relations and consolidate them for the long term,
although it will take a long time to achieve such a pact, a former
representative to the United States said Friday.</P>
      <P>"We talked about economic and trade agreements, and financial cooperation will
be next. The next thing after that will be a peace agreement, but it will take a
long time," said Stephen S.F. Chen, who is now a national policy advisor to
President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>"The so-called confidence-building measures (CBMs) will be beyond a peace
agreement," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks in response to a reporter's comment that there seems to be
some concern in Washington about possible military exchanges between Taiwan and
China, as the issue of CBMs has been raised more and more often recently.</P>
      <P>The senior diplomat said that a peace agreement between both sides of the Taiwan
Strait will come before the establishment of CBMs because only Taiwan
unilaterally terminated its civil war with China.</P>
      <P>"They still think the civil war is not over. That is why the peace agreement is
necessary. But a peace agreement does not necessarily include CBMs," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen contended that a hotline between military commanders on the Taiwan-
controlled island of Kinmen and nearby Xiamen City in China should be
established in the first stage of building up cross-strait CBMs because small
incidents could trigger war.</P>
      <P>"Small steps in reducing tension, such as a hotline between the frontline
commanders, may be a necessity in order to avoid any misunderstanding or any
mishaps," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will choose in May five scenic spots around the country that have
the potential to attract international tourists, and each will be given NT$300
million (US$8.88 million) for redevelopment over two years, Minister of
Transportation and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Thursday.</P>
      <P>As part of a tourism-boosting plan unveiled that day, the government plans to
develop at least 10 of the most attractive scenic spots around Taiwan with
international appeal, the first five of which will be unveiled during the
initial stage, according to Mao.</P>
      <P>He said each county can apply for the subsidies by mid-April by proposing
tourist destinations that have development value and have the potential to
attract investment.</P>
      <P>The tourism-stimulation plan aims to generate over the next four years NT$550
billion (US$16.3 billion) in tourism revenue, create 400,000 jobs in the tourism
industry, attract private investment worth NT$200 billion and bring in 10 world
famous hotel chains.</P>
      <P>So far, three of the 10 hotel chains have decided to set up operations, or have
already begun operating in Taiwan, including Le Meridien hotel group, which is
scheduled to open its first hotel in Taiwan in early 2011 in Taipei's Hsinyi
district. The first Marriott hotel in Taiwan, which is located in Taipei's Neihu
district, and the Novotel Taoyuan International Airport Taipei, which will open
later this year, according to a Tourism Bureau official.</P>
      <P>Japan's famous Kagaya hot spring hotel has also shown great interest in
venturing into Taipei's Beitou district, the official went on.</P>
      <P>The government plans to earmark NT$30 billion for the plan in four years until
2012, with NT$3 billion coming from the Tourism Development Fund each year and
the rest coming from the treasury, according to Mao.</P>
      <P>He added that an estimated NT$18.7 billion will be used for a tourism flagship
program and for upgrading specific tourist spots around the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, to strengthen the country's tourism competitiveness, the government
will spend NT$2 billion  on tourism  industry transformation and talent
cultivation, and another NT$9.3 billion on increasing added value in the
industry, the minister added.</P>

      <P>The United States' Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) , which reached its 30th
anniversary Friday, will remain unchanged for a long time despite the warming
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, a former representative to the United States said
that day.</P>
      <P>Stephen S.F. Chen, who now serves as a national policy advisor to President Ma
Ying-jeou and as convener of the non-government National Policy Foundation (NPF)
, made the remarks after hosting a NPF news conference to announce its holding
of an international conference April 12 on a retrospective of the TRA and its
prospects.</P>
      <P>"This particular legislation, the TRA, is the only domestic law of the U.S. that
covers its relations with Taiwan, so I think it's going to last for a long
time," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Enacted by the U.S. Congress April 10, 1979, the TRA has been the sole legal
document on the part of the United States governing bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The act requires the U.S. to guarantee defensive arms sales to Taiwan and to
maintain the capacity of the U.S. to resist any resort to force or other forms
of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic
system, of the people of Taiwan. It does not require the U.S. to intervene
militarily if the People's Republic of China attacks or invades Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he thinks the U.S. will make any adjustments to the TRA due to
concern about the warming relations between Taiwan and China, the senior
diplomat said he sees no such tendency.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that some people have the misguided notion that since Taiwan is now
warming up to China, relations between Taiwan and the U.S. are cooling off.</P>
      <P>He said despite the fact that Taiwan is improving relations with China, it still
thinks ties with the U.S. are the most important facet of its foreign relations
and that Washington remains the country's most important friend.</P>
      <P>"This development (between Taiwan and China) does not in any way endanger
relations between the Republic of China and the U.S. They can co-exist without
any problem," Chen said.</P>
      <P>As part of the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the passage of the TRA,
the NPF and the non-government Cross-Strait Interflow Prospect Foundation will
host the April 12 conference in which more than 300 government officials,
dignitaries and political experts from home and abroad will look back at the act
and inspire new thoughts on how to enhance U.S.-Taiwan relations.</P>
      <P>In addition to President Ma Ying-jeou and Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia,
other participants will include Winston Lord, former assistant secretary of
state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Douglas Paal, former director of the
American Institute in Taiwan Taipei Office, and Alan Romberg, former principal
deputy director of the U.S. State Department's Policy Planning Staff. ENDITEM/J

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 400 complaints about violations of the smoking ban have been filed
with the anti-smoking John Tung Foundation over the past three months since the
ban was put into force, foundation officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Of the total of 436 complaints received as of April 7, 72 percent involved
private workplaces,  Internet cafes, office buildings, billiard parlors,
toilets, restaurants, universities and colleges, shrimp fishing clubs,
hospitals, government agencies, karaoke parlors and even hookah bars, said Yau
Sea-wain, president of the foundation.</P>
      <P>Lin Ching-li, director of the foundation's tobacco hazards prevention division,
said that cases of employees complaining about their employers or supervisors
smoking in their offices were the most common at the beginning of the ban, but
he added that there has been an increasing number of complaints about smoking in
Internet cafes recently.</P>
      <P>Lin said the situation could be an indication that Internet cafe operators are
relaxing their attention to the ban.</P>
      <P>Among the complaints received by the foundation is a case in which a direct
selling company has posted a cigarette advertisement on its Web site, displaying
the brand, picture and price of the product and including a description that
encourages smoking among women.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, that case is being investigated by the health authorities in
the southern city of Tainan and the company will face a fine of up to NT$25
million (US$741,839) if the offense is established as having occurred.</P>
      <P>Another pending case is one in which a tobacco importer has been giving away
bonus cards to consumers of seven of its cigarette products.</P>
      <P>Yau said the promotional activity is obviously targeting young people and added
that if each of the products is considered an individual offense, the importer
can be fined a minimum of NT$35 million.</P>
      <P>The ban, which took effect Jan. 11, is considered a major step by Taiwan toward
its goal of becoming a smoke-free country.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the ban, smoking is not allowed on public transport or in the
indoor areas of most public premises, including roofed transport stations, KTV
parlors, Internet cafes, comic-book stores and offices manned by three or more
people.</P>
      <P>Smoking in prohibited areas can result in fines of up to NT$10,000 for the
offender and NT$50,000 for the owner of the establishment in which the offense
takes place.</P>
      <P>The new law requires that prominent "no smoking" signs be posted at the
entrances of such establishments and allows for fines of up to NT$30,000 for
owners who fail to comply.</P>
      <P>Vendors are not allowed to sell cigarettes to people under 18 years of age, to
display cigarettes on shelves that are accessible to consumers, or to sell
cigarettes from automatic vending machines, all of which are offenses that can
result in fines of up to NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>Cigarette advertisements and cigarette promotional activities are also banned,
with fines for violators set at a maximum of NT$500,000 for vendors, NT$25
million for cigarette companies and NT$1 million for the advertising media
involved.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Advance Auto Parts, the second largest retailer of automobile parts and
accessories in the United States, has decided to establish its Asian sourcing
center in Taiwan, expecting that improved links between Taiwan and China will
enhance its operational efficiency.</P>
      <P>Keven Dempsey, Advance Auto Parts vice president for global sourcing, announced
Thursday the company's plan to open its first overseas sourcing center, with the
opening slated for May 3.</P>
      <P>The planned center will be responsible for sourcing products for the company's
more than 3,000 retail outlets in the U.S. and for developing new items, and
Advance Auto Parts plans to hire 50 employees in Taiwan within the coming three
years to meet those needs, Dempsey said.</P>
      <P>The center's operations will cover most of Asia, including China, South Korea
and India.</P>
      <P>Dempsey  said a number of factors made Taiwan attractive, including potential
savings in leasing commercial space. The company found that renting office space
in Taipei is about 60 percent cheaper than in Hong Kong and 33 percent cheaper
than in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>He also said Taiwan's executive talent was more stable than similar
professionals in China, which will help the company save on personnel costs.</P>
      <P>With  the recent  opening  of more convenient  trade  and transportation links
between Taiwan and China, Dempsey said he believes there will be more foreign
businesses deciding to set up their regional operations in Taiwan in the future.</P>
      <P>Advance Auto Parts, founded in 1932 and headquartered in Roanoke, Virginia, was
ranked 476th in the Fortune Global 500 in 2008. It is the 23rd largest
specialized retailer in the U.S., with annual sales reaching US$5.1 billion last
year.</P>
      <P>Advance Auto Parts runs 3,368 stores in the U.S. and plans to open 105 more this
year, according to the company.</P>
      <P>Dempsey said his company's prospects are bright despite the economic slump,
because demand for replacement parts and accessories has been pushed higher by
motorists sticking to their old cars rather than replacing them with new ones.</P>
      <P>With Advance Auto Parts holding only a 13 percent of the American market in
retail store services and a 5 percent share of repair workshops, the company
still has considerable space to expand in the automotive aftermarket sector,
Dempsey said.</P>

      <P>Despite the global economic downturn, Taiwan is still one of the most popular
overseas destinations among Hong Kong vacationers, a local newspaper cited
business sources as saying Friday.</P>
      <P>The trend has been especially apparent as the four-day Easter weekend begins,
with 50 additional flights bound for Taiwan among the 900 flights taking off
from and landing at Hong Kong International Airport on Friday, the first day of
the Easter holiday.</P>

during the holiday period," the travel agent said.</P>
      <P>Given a boost by the film "Cape No. 7, " which was filmed in the popular beach
resort of Kenting in the southern part of the island, Taiwan has become one of
the most popular overseas destinations among Hong Kong travelers, along with

      <P>Farmers in eastern Taitung County are concerned about plummeting demand for
their orange varieties and fear it will put their businesses at risk, the local
farmers' association said Friday.</P>
      <P>Association officials said orders for the farmers' tangerines and Valencia
oranges have fallen by some 70 percent, dealing a severe blow to their
livelihoods.</P>
      <P>"Sluggish business conditions have pushed many buyers, even those who are long-
term customers, to cancel their orders, " an association official said,
attributing the problem to low consumer demand due to the floundering economy.</P>
      <P>While Valencia oranges are normally in short supply, Taitung County farmers had
a bumper crop of 370,000 kilograms this spring because of the mild weather in
recent months.</P>
      <P>Yet farmers have had no cause to celebrate, as half the fruit remains
unharvested on their farms, and prices for the fruit has fallen to NT$100 (US$3)
for 3.5 kgs.,  said Donghe farmers' association officials.</P>
      <P>"Even at that price, it is hard to sell all of them," an official lamented.</P>
      <P>To help relieve pressure  on farmers,  the Taitung County Government announced
it will organize promotional sales of the fruit in city centers on the last two
weekends of this month.</P>
      <P>It will also ask local schools to buy the fruit to serve as part of students'

    <DATELINE>04/10/09  18:37:00</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives  of Taiwan's "small but beautiful" magazine industry are heading
to London in early May for an international forum at which they plan to present
the industry's strength as a leading force in the Chinese-language world.</P>
      <P>They also hope to learn what they can from their international partners on how
to survive the ongoing global economic slump.</P>
      <P>Yu Kuo-ting, chairman of the Magazine Business Association of Taipei, will lead
a delegation to the International Federation of the Periodical Press (FIPP)
conference. In a pre-departure interview with the Central News Agency, he said
Taiwan's magazine industry is quite advanced in terms of innovation, agenda
setting, graphic design and printing capability.</P>
      <P>"This is a result of more than 40 years of democratic development in Taiwan,
during which its cultural workers have enjoyed freedom of expression and a free
market," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Though  Taiwan's  magazine  industry  enjoys  an edge over counterparts from
China in the Chinese-language cultural sphere, he said the advantage has been
eroded as a growing number of Western magazines seek to establish direct contact
with Chinese publications.</P>
      <P>To date, however, Western magazines have failed to gain a strong foothold in
China, mainly because of cultural barriers that even the Taiwanese find
difficult to surmount, Yu said, leaving opportunities for Taiwan's magazine
industry to play a key role in Chinese-language communities as China gradually
opens up its cultural market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan already has a number of successful business models, Yu said,  citing The
Studio Classroom series of English teaching publications in Taipei, a popular
brand that has attracted tens of thousands of Taiwanese keen to learn English
through print, audio and video media tools.</P>
      <P>Yu also cited CommonWealth Magazine to demonstrate that Taiwan's magazine
industry is caring,  innovative  and forward looking, constantly bringing new
ideas and new hopes to its readers and their society.</P>
      <P>Even the tabloid-like Next magazine,  with its diversified content, can be
regarded as a proof that Taiwan has indeed matured into a democratic and
multicultural society, he added.</P>
      <P>Similar to Taiwan's music industry, whose recordings are highly popular in
Chinese cultural circles, the island's magazine industry is a "large gem" and a
leading industry that Yu said he believes will shine throughout the world simply
by being a vital "life-giving" and "meaning-creating" entity.</P>
      <P>Yu, president of the Business Weekly Media Group, said his group's Business
Weekly now has a circulation of 160,000 copies in a country of 23 million
people, while its United States "counterpart" of a similar title prints 900,000
copies for a population 13 times larger than Taiwan's.</P>
      <P>"We may not have the experience of operating in a huge market like China, Japan,
Europe and the U.S., but Taiwan's magazine business is 'small but beautiful,'"
he said.</P>
      <P>Learning to gain a niche in large markets is one of the goals the delegation
will try to achieve during and after the May 4-6 FIPP conference in the British
capital.</P>
      <P>In addition to exchanging ideas with other participants, Yu's group will also
visit the BBC, the Haymarket Media Group and the Cambridge University Press.</P>
      <P>"We will be focusing our efforts on finding successful business models from
British and other nations' media corporations, " he said. "We will look into how
they are coping with the fast-changing market, their new ways of doing things
and how they are creating value -- in essence how they are trying to satisfy new
demands from customers in the digital age."</P>
      <P>Yu stressed that Taiwan's magazine publishers are demonstrating unprecedented
unity in a concerted effort to find new business opportunities, hoping that like
their information technology (IT) counterparts they can play a leading role in
the Chinese-language cultural market.</P>
      <P>"We are confident that the upcoming London trip will be rewarding not only for
the magazine industry itself but also for the customers they aim to serve at
home and abroad," he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NCKU unveils prototype of convenient breast cancer detector</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Researchers at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) have successfully developed
the world's first pocket-sized breast cancer detector for household use, the
university in southern Taiwan's Tainan City announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Experiments on human beings may start later this year to pave the way for mass
production next year, said Tzeng Yonhua, vice president for research and
development at NCKU.</P>
      <P>The device, whose size is similar to an iPhone, was invented using near-infrared
technology and is intended for the early detection and warning of breast cancer,
Tzeng said.</P>
      <P>The invention  is based on previous achievements  by U.S. biophysicist Britton
Chance, who is now a distinguished professor in NCKU's Institute of Innovations
and Advanced Studies, Tzeng said.</P>
      <P>NCKU has focused its research on streamlining the size of the device since
taking over the research project two years ago.</P>
      <P>Releasing near infrared lights of five to seven different wavelengths to detect
potential cancer cells, the device performs non-invasive screening on users, who
are not even required to take off their clothes or underwear, Tzeng said.</P>
      <P>"The device is especially  helpful  to women who are too embarrassed to receive
screening in hospitals," he said.</P>
      <P>Equipped with a liquid crystal display panel and a personal storage disc, the
device enables users to store the outcome of the screening and show it to their
doctors for further diagnosis if abnormalities are detected, Tzeng said.</P>
      <P>He said the technology can also be used to measure brain oxygen levels and blood
glucose levels as well as detect pancreatic cancer.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese manufacturers have expressed an interest in helping NCKU convert the
device's prototype into viable samples, which will be sent to hospitals and
medical schools in other countries for testing, Tzeng said.</P>
      <P>He said the device is expected to be sold at price of around NT$10,000 (US$280)
per unit,  making it affordable  for most households.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Animal rights activists on Friday urged the National Science Council (NSC) to
revoke a license for an international collaborative project to investigate main
seismic structure features of the earth's crust under Taiwan island to avoid
causing adverse effects on numerous forms of marine life.</P>
      <P>The activists made the appeal during a protest rally in front of the NSC, which
sponsored the Taiwan Integrated Geodynamics Research (TAIGER) project.</P>
      <P>The  earthquake   study  initiated  by  the  Columbia University-affiliated
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (L-DEO) is a sea floor investigation project in
the exclusive economic zones of Taiwan,  China,  Japan and the Philippines,
according to the conservationists.</P>
      <P>They noted that air guns, which will be used under the sea in the study, could
produce a noise equivalent to 265 decibels (dB) , and could be a threat to the
survival of sharks and dolphins.</P>
      <P>The U.S. government launched an environmental impact assessment last December,
completed the assessment and established measures aimed at minimizing adverse
effects on the marine ecosystem in March, according to the activists.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the NSC granted a research permit for the project without getting
an understanding of the results of the impact assessment, the conservationists
pointed out.</P>
      <P>They said the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has taken measures to
protect white dolphins and grey sharks in the Atlantic Ocean as well as other
marine species by stipulating that all investigation boats should keep at least
20 kilometers away from Taiwan's western coast and at least 150 kilometers away
from the coast of China and that a sonic boom will only be allowed at a depth of
at least 50 meters below the surface of the sea.</P>
      <P>That means most sea floor investigation projects would not meet the requirements
and should not be allowed to be conducted in the Taiwan Strait economic zone,
the activists said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the NSC convened a review meeting on the project last
December, but refused to make public the meeting minutes, the animal protection
activists said they should be given a chance to provide relevant information and
marine experts should be allowed to express their opinion to the NSC.</P>
      <P>In response, an NSC official Cheng Chien-hong said that boats used in the
experiment are equipped with safety facilities to protect marine animals and
five marine biologists abroad would call a halt to firing an air gun any time
they find it would go beyond the noise limit.</P>
      <P>Cheng argued the NSC's decision to issue the license was made considering that
while dolphins usually swim in waters at least three kilometers away from the
coast of Taiwan and that the experiment is conducted at 20 kilometers away from
the coast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Health surcharge on cigarettes to double starting June 1</HEADLINE>

04/10/09  20:45:38

    <TEXT>
      <P>The health surcharge on tobacco will be increased from NT$10 to NT$20 per pack
of cigarettes starting June 1 to discourage smoking and raise funds for the
country's health insurance program, Taiwan's top health official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ching-chuan, minister of the Department of Health, said that the price of a
pack of cigarettes is expected to increase by between NT$10 and NT$15 following
the increase in the health surcharge.</P>
      <P>Currently, a pack of cigarettes sells for NT$55 on average.</P>
      <P>Yeh estimated that the surcharge, which currently contributes NT$20 billion a
year to government programs, would generate between NT$32 billion and NT$36
billion after the increase, but he said he would not mind if his projection
turned out to be too high.</P>
      <P>"If more people quit smoking, the government's revenues from the health
surcharge will decrease, but this is something the government would love to
see," he said.</P>
      <P>Yeh indicated that NT$1.4 billion, or about 4 percent of the health surcharge,
will be used to help low- and middle-income families pay part of their health
insurance premiums.</P>
      <P>The DOH will also allocate NT$10 billion to the financially strapped National
Health Insurance program.</P>
      <P>To avoid confusion and profiteering, cigarette manufacturers will either print
or affix a sticker reading "NT$20 health surcharge" on each pack to help
differentiate between old and new cigarettes.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that starting June 1, tobacco distributors cannot raise the price of
cigarettes that do not have the "NT$20 health surcharge" marking, though they
can continue to sell them.</P>
      <P>Government  agencies  will monitor  the market  to prevent distributors from
hoarding cigarettes ahead of the June 1 launch date and selling them for a
higher profit margin, he added.</P>
      <P>"The situation of consumers buying old cigarettes at the price of the new
cigarettes will not happen," Yeh pledged.</P>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation, an anti-smoking group, recently criticized the DOH for
only spending NT$160 million from the surcharge funds to help the public kick
the habit of smoking, while shelling out NT$600 million to subsidize tobacco
manufacturers to print or affix the new marking.</P>
      <P>Yeh replied,  however,  that the DOH has already received confirmation from four
major tobacco manufacturers, including Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp., that
they will do the markings themselves at no extra cost to the government.</P>
      <P>For small tobacco manufacturers who will affix a sticker to their cigarettes, a
subsidy of NT$10 million will be paid by the DOH's Bureau of Health Promotion
rather than be taken out of the health surcharges, Yeh said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An exclusive shop for the display and sale of Taiwan's fine food was opened
Friday at an outlet of City Shop, an upscale supermarket in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>The opening ceremony of the speciality department at the store in the city's
Time Square was the first in China ever authorized by Taiwan's semi-official
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>A large number of customers were drawn to the event and treated to a wide
variety of delicious dishes prepared with products imported from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More than 600 items of Taiwan-made foodstuff recommended by TAITRA are being
sold at the 120-square meter department, including fruits, ingredients, snacks,
beverages, tea, rice, noodles, cookies and daily use items of famous Taiwanese
brands.</P>
      <P>Chen Chi-tang, a TAITRA official in charge of promoting Taiwanese agricultural
products, said a batch of Taiwan-grown mangos are slated to be marketed in the
shop in late May.</P>
      <P>In the future, TAITRA will introduce more original Taiwanese products, including
creative cultural or tourism-related items or handicrafts, into the shop, where
Chinese customers can indulge in a refined Taiwanese ambiance, Chen said.</P>
      <P>An executive with the City Supermarket Inc., a leading retailer of imported food
in Shanghai, said around half of the Taiwanese speciality products being sold at
the City Shop are shipped from Taiwan, with the other half purchased from
Taiwanese businessmen in Shanghai or Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>The opening of the exclusive Taiwanese food shop formed part of the New Zheng He
Project launched by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to help expand Taiwan's
foreign trade.</P>
      <P>Victor Chu, TAITRA's representative in Shanghai, said Thursday the special
Taiwanese food store was set up through the joint efforts of the TAITRA-
affiliated Taipei World Trade Center and City Shop executives.</P>
      <P>According to Chu, the increase in two-way exchanges between Taiwan and mainland
China brought about by the wider opening of cross-Taiwan Strait tourism last
year has helped to stir Chinese consumers' interest in Taiwan-made foodstuff.</P>
      <P>City Shop owns 12 stores in Shanghai and one in Beijing. The Shanghai-based food
importer also operates farms, tourism resort parks, coffee factories, bakeries
and foreign trade companies.</P>
      <P>City Shop began importing Taiwanese food products in 2000.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A tourism boosting plan put forward by the Executive Yuan is expected to help
inject new life into Keelung Port in northern Taiwan, Keelung Harbor Bureau
Director-General Hsiao Ding-shun said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao based his optimism on the prospect that the plan would bring in higher
numbers of tourists on cruise ships to Keelung Port -- Taiwan's largest sea port
in the north.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, two foreign cruise lines have projected they will make a
total of eight calls at the port this year, bringing a total of 18,000 tourists
to northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Rough estimates indicate that these foreign visitors could contribute NT$120
million (US$3.6 million) in tourism revenue to businesses in the port area, he
said, also voicing the hope that a government mega-tourism expansion plan will
help bolster businesses in the area.</P>
      <P>While figures for 2008 are not yet available, 272,000 passengers arrived in
Keelung Port on cruise liners in 2007, or 63.8 percent of the year's total,
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) statistics showed.</P>
      <P>A total of 426,000 tourists arrived on cruise liners at all of Taiwan's
international ports for the year, an increase of about 111,000 visitors, or a
35.3 percent increase, over the 2006 level, according to the same figures.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the Executive Yuan approved an ambitious tourism expansion project
in its regular weekly meeting with the aim of turning Taiwan into a tourism hub
in East Asia that could generate NT$550 billion (US$16.5 billion) in tourism
revenue in 2012 on a planned budget of NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>Of the total targeted spending, the government anticipates some NT$300 billion
of the total will be contributed by foreign tourists from around the world, with
the balance generated by domestic travelers.</P>
      <P>It also estimates that the plan will help create 400,000 jobs by 2012.</P>
      <P>The government hopes to attract 4.1 million foreign traveler arrivals in 2009,
4.5 million in 2010, 5 million in 2011 and 5.5 million in 2012, said Tourism

      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a special budget Friday that cleared the way to
finance an expanded NT$149.1 billion public works plan, another of several
measures the government has adopted to revive Taiwan's sputtering economy.</P>
      <P>The final amount authorized in the special budget was NT$1.5 billion less than
the NT$150.6 billion that had been approved after the bill's initial screening
in a legislature committee.</P>
      <P>The special budget will be financed by raising debt and will not be subject to
the debt ceiling as set by the Public Debt Act.</P>
      <P>The legislature also passed a resolution to authorize the central government to
commission townships to execute the special budget to prevent differences in
party affiliation between the local and central governments affecting the
budget's implementation.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party criticized the legislature, in which the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) controls nearly three-quarters of the seats, for circumventing the cities
and counties in the use of the special budget.</P>
      <P>"This is a blatantly pork-barrel move," Yang contended.</P>
      <P>He noted that between 80 percent and 90 percent of the heads of townships around
the island are KMT members.</P>
      <P>The legislature also suggested that the Executive Yuan prohibit the use of
foreign laborers and give priority to indigenous peoples in the public works
projects.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Friday that after
the execution of the special budget, the nation's gross domestic product (GDP)
is expected to rise by 0.68 percent.</P>

confidently.</P>
      <P>Of the 84,000 job openings, 25,000 are in the public sector, including 20,000
openings for volunteer military servicemen, 15,000 are in the private sector,
and the remaining 44,000 are research and management jobs at local universities

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed a special budget Friday that cleared the way to
finance an expanded NT$149.1 billion public works plan, another of several
measures the government has adopted to revive Taiwan's sputtering economy.</P>
      <P>The final amount authorized in the special budget was NT$1.5 billion less than
the NT$150.6 billion that had been approved after the bill's initial screening
in a legislature committee.</P>
      <P>The special budget will be financed by raising debt and will not be subject to
the debt ceiling as set by the Public Debt Act.</P>
      <P>The legislature also passed a resolution to authorize the central government to
commission townships to execute the special budget to prevent differences in
party affiliation between the local and central governments affecting the
budget's implementation.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party criticized the legislature, in which the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) controls nearly three-quarters of the seats, for circumventing the cities
and counties in the use of the special budget.</P>
      <P>"This is a blatantly pork-barrel move," Yang contended.</P>
      <P>He noted that between 80 percent and 90 percent of the heads of townships around
the island are KMT members.</P>
      <P>The legislature also suggested that the Executive Yuan prohibit the use of
foreign laborers and give priority to indigenous peoples in the public works
projects.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Friday that after
the execution of the special budget, the nation's gross domestic product (GDP)
is expected to rise by 0.68 percent.</P>
      <P>It will also create between 190,000 and 220,000 jobs, the CEPD estimated.</P>
      <P>Covered under the bill are projects to provide comfortable and convenient urban
transportation services, fast production and marketing networks, a safe
environment and facilities to upgrade the public's quality of life.</P>

an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>"The first two job fairs will take place Saturday in central Taiwan's Taichung
City and Hualien City in the eastern part of the country, " CLA Vice Minister
Kuo Fang-yu said, adding that the remaining two fairs will be held the following
weekend in Taoyuan County in northern Taiwan and in the southern city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>The job fairs are part of the CLA's efforts to help increase employment after
the country's unemployment rate surged to a record 5.75 percent in February amid
the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>In addition to offering 84,000 job openings, Kuo said, the four events will also
provide 71,000 openings for individuals to receive training or do research.</P>
      <P>"The four job fairs will feature three 'plenties' -- plenty of job
opportunities, plenty of display booths and plenty of services, " Kuo said
confidently.</P>
      <P>Of the 84,000 job openings, 25,000 are in the public sector, including 20,000
openings for volunteer military servicemen, 15,000 are in the private sector,
and the remaining 44,000 are research and management jobs at local universities
and colleges.</P>
      <P>To cater to the needs of job seekers, Kuo said five theme areas will be set up
at the fair venues to avoid overcrowding at certaining counters.</P>
      <P>The job fair in central Taiwan will feature at least 159 service booths and the
events in eastern, northern and southern Taiwan will accommodate 98, 155 and 182
stands, respectively, Kuo said, adding that the fairs are expected to lure an
estimated 100,000 job seekers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Keelung Harbor Bureau upbeat over tourism boosting plan</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
04/11/09  12:10:57
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A tourism boosting plan put forward by the Executive Yuan is expected to help
inject new life into Keelung Port in northern Taiwan, Keelung Harbor Bureau
Director-General Hsiao Ding-shun said Friday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao based his optimism on the prospect that the plan would bring in higher
numbers of tourists on cruise ships to Keelung Port -- Taiwan's largest sea port
in the north.</P>
      <P>According to Hsiao, two foreign cruise lines have projected they will make a
total of eight calls at the port this year, bringing a total of 18,000 tourists
to northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Rough estimates indicate that these foreign visitors could contribute NT$120
million (US$3.6 million) in tourism revenue to businesses in the port area, he
said, also voicing the hope that a government mega-tourism expansion plan will
help bolster businesses in the area.</P>
      <P>While figures for 2008 are not yet available, 272,000 passengers arrived in
Keelung Port on cruise liners in 2007, or 63.8 percent of the year's total,
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) statistics showed.</P>
      <P>A total of 426,000 tourists arrived on cruise liners at all of Taiwan's
international ports for the year, an increase of about 111,000 visitors, or a
35.3 percent increase, over the 2006 level, according to the same figures.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the Executive Yuan approved an ambitious tourism expansion project
in its regular weekly meeting with the aim of turning Taiwan into a tourism hub
in East Asia that could generate NT$550 billion (US$16.5 billion) in tourism
revenue in 2012 on a planned budget of NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>Of the total targeted spending, the government anticipates some NT$300 billion
of the total will be contributed by foreign tourists from around the world, with
the balance generated by domestic travelers.</P>
      <P>It also estimates that the plan will help create 400,000 jobs by 2012.</P>
      <P>The government hopes to attract 4.1 million foreign traveler arrivals in 2009,
4.5 million in 2010, 5 million in 2011 and 5.5 million in 2012, said Tourism
Bureau Director General Janice Lai.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese-American representatives urged the U.S. government Friday to reaffirm
its committment to and support for Taiwan to mark the 30th anniversary of the
enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>In a joint statement released at a news conference held in Washington,  D.C.,
the leaders of 11 Taiwanese-American groups expressed their appreciation to the
United States for enacting the TRA on April 10, 1979, providing a legal basis
for Washington's commitment to help Taiwan defend itself against possible
attacks by China.</P>
      <P>Equally important is a provision in the TRA that pledges to preserve and enhance
the human rights of all of Taiwan's people, the leaders said.</P>
      <P>They called on U.S. President Barack Obama and Congress to abandon the shackle
of the "one-China" policy, work to normalize the relations between the United
States and Taiwan, and help Taiwan participate in the international community on
an equal footing with other countries.</P>
      <P>The statement  came two weeks  after the U.S.  House  of Representatives adopted
a resolution in recognition of the 30th anniversary of the TRA's enactment.</P>
      <P>The resolution reaffirmed the TRA as "the cornerstone of U.S. relations with
Taiwan" and expressed support for "the strong and deepening relationship between
the United States and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Ben Liu, president of the North America Taiwanese Professors' Association,
stressed that the United States and East Asian countries share a common interest
in Taiwan's security and stability, and he urged the Obama administration to
follow the example of Congress and reaffirm Washington's commitment to honor the
terms of the TRA.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the Obama administration and Congress work together to find a
way to strengthen U.S.-Taiwan relations, deter China's military threats against
Taiwan, and help increase Taiwan's international presence.</P>
      <P>Susan Chang, president of the World Federation of Taiwanese Associations,
asserted that Taiwan is a country, regardless of how few diplomatic allies it
has.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan having transformed from a dictatorship to become a beacon of
democracy over the past 30 years, Taiwan's 23 million people deserve fairer
treatment in the international community, Chang said.</P>
      <P>According to Bob Yang, president of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs,
the leaders of the Taiwanese-American groups will jointly write a letter to
Obama to directly relay their opinions to him.</P>
      <P>Also taking part in Friday's news conference were the Taiwanese Association of
America, the World United Formosans for Independence, the Dr. Kang-Lu Wang
Memorial Foundation,  the North American Taiwanese Women's Association, the
Taiwanese Hakka Association for Public Affairs in North America, and the World

    <HEADLINE>MOFA set to open offices in Sapporo, Istanbul before summer</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) hopes to formally open its planned
representative offices in Sapporo, Japan, and Istanbul, Turkey before the summer
holiday, the foreign minister said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Francisco H. L. Ou said the ministry is now working on budgeting and staffing
plans for the new offices. He estimated it would take two or three more months
to complete the necessary arrangements, but noted that the governments of Japan
and Turkey have both given the green light for Taiwan to open the liasion
offices.</P>
      <P>Staffing levels at the two offices will be determined based on the number of
Taiwanese tourists who travel to the two cities. He disclosed that the Sapporo
office will be manned by four to five people while the Istanbul office will have
two to three people.</P>
      <P>Ou said the idea to open new offices in Sapporo and Istanbul was based on
Taiwan's frequent people-to-people exchanges with Japan and Turkey.</P>
      <P>Plans to open the new representative branches have won the approval of the
Executive Yuan, according to the MOFA.</P>
      <P>Since earlier this year, the MOFA has been reviewing the functions and
performance of its foreign representative offices to find ways to more
efficiently use the country's limited diplomatic resources.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently has 122 embassies and representative offices around the world,
which have to be staffed by a relatively large number of diplomats compared to
the number posted abroad by South Korea and Singapore, according to the
ministry.</P>
      <P>Taiwan maintains diplomatic relations with 23 countries, most of which are
located in the South Pacific and in Central and South America and the Caribbean.</P>
      <P>The minister also commented on Taiwan's ties with El Salvador, which recently
elected a president from a party with close ties to China's Communist Party,
leading to speculation that the Central American country could cut long-standing
ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ou, who recently concluded a visit to San Salvador, said the Foreign Ministry
holds a positive view of Taiwan-El  Salvador relations, noting that President-
elect Mauricio Funes said he would welcome President Ma Ying-jeou to attend his
inauguration slated for June 1.</P>
      <P>Ou said that in his meeting with Funes, the president-elect recognized the
achievements of Taiwan-El Salvador cooperation and indicated he would begin
talks with Taiwan on possible mutual cooperation plans after his government
assumes office.</P>

Taipei Public Library, Daan Forest Park, the Jiantan metro station, the area in
front of No. 90 Songjiang Road, the Taipei City Hall metro station, and the
Zhishan metro station.</P>
      <P>The report shows that of the 99 bicycle thefts reported between the January-
March period in the city, 54, or 54.55 percent, have been solved.</P>
      <P>A total of 604 cases were reported in 2008, with 265 cases, or 43.87 percent,
having been solved.</P>
      <P>In 2007, there were 383 reported bicycle theft cases, 123 cases, or 32.11
percent, of which have been solved.</P>
      <P>The National Police Agency (NPA) attributed the increase in bicycle theft to the
popularity of cycling as a leisure activity in recent years.</P>
      <P>Another factor is the lack of a system in the country to provide each bicycle
with an identification code, the NPA said, adding that the agency has recently
begun to promote such a system in an effort to reduce bicycle theft rates.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Remembering Chiang not nostalgia for dictatorship: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou clarified Saturday that the series of commemorative
events organized recently by his administration to pay tribute to the late
President Chiang Ching-kuo should not be mistaken as a show of nostalgia for the
martial law era or the country's authoritarian past.</P>
      <P>Ma raised the issue while addressing the opening of an exhibition held at the
National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Taipei to mark the 100th anniversary of
Chiang's birth.</P>
      <P>Critics have questioned the necessity and basis for the country, which is now a
vibrant democracy, to remember a political figure many regarded as an
authoritarian figure.</P>
      <P>By remembering Chiang, Ma stressed, the government is not trying to restore
martial law or dictatorial government, but to show its respect for the foresight
and wisdom displayed by Chiang in promoting various reforms that contributed to
Taiwan's modernization in the 1970s and 1980s.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, in any period in history, there are always "great figures" who
truly change their times and leave valuable legacies from which modern people
can gain experience and accumulate wisdom.</P>
      <P>Ma said that based on his observation of Chiang during the seven years he served
as an aide to the late president, the easygoing style of Chiang's leadership set
a very influential example for many Taiwanese politicians who followed him.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that he was also deeply impressed by Chiang's success in establishing a
clean government by promoting a code of conduct for civil  servants  and his
efforts  to boost Taiwan's  economic development.</P>
      <P>Lastly, the series of political reforms initiated by Chiang -- including lifting
martial law, removing a ban on the organization of political parties, reforming
the legislature, liberalizing newspapers and opening up travel to China by
Taiwan citizens to visit their relatives -- were all important elements forming
the foundation of Taiwan's freedom and democracy nowadays, he said.</P>
      <P>In memory of Chiang Ching-kuo, an outdoor concert is slated for Sunday at 7 p.m.
to 9 p.m. at the National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Ma is scheduled to host a ceremony in the Presidential Office to mark
the anniversary of Chiang Ching-kuo's birth and visit his mausoleum in Touliao,
Taoyuan County.</P>

      <P>All crew members aboard a Taiwanese fishing vessel hijacked by Somali pirates
off the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean early this week are alive and safe,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Henry Chen said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Concerns for the safety of the 30 crew members aboard the Win Far 161 long-line
fishing boat were raised after foreign wire services reported that Somali
pirates have threatened to kill American hostages on another hijacked vessel if
U.S. warships attack them off the Horn of Africa.</P>
      <P>"According to information secured by the ministry, all the Win Fa crew members
are safe, " Chen told the Central News Agency in an interview.</P>
      <P>Chen elaborated that the ministry has closely tracked the 700-ton deep-sea
fishing vessel's course since it fell under the control of Somali pirates
Monday.</P>
      <P>He said the ship was currently located north-northwest of the Seychelles and is
heading in a northwesterly direction toward the Somali coastline.</P>
      <P>The Win Far crew includes two Taiwanese -- skipper and the first engineer -- as
well as five Chinese, six Indonesians and 17 Filipinos.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ministry has been in close contact with the shipowner, who has
been quoted as wishing to maintain a low-profile so that he could be better
positioned to negotiate with hijackers when they make a ransom demand.</P>
      <P>"The ministry fully respects the shipowner's wish, " Chen reaffirmed Saturday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Taiwan Tuna Association said Saturday that the
association and the shipowner have been making every possible effort to rescue
the Win Far crew, including seeking assistance from U.S. and British naval
authorities and relevant international fishery organizations.</P>
      <P>The spokesman suggested that the hijackers' main goal is money and are therefore
not likely to take any rash actions as long as they have not received a ransom.</P>

      <P>The Lion, a sculptural rendition of a Chinese dragon designed by a Taiwanese
artist and her Japanese friend, has become a new attraction in London's
Chinatown since its public unveiling earlier this week.</P>
      <P>The work, designed by Hsiao-Chi Tsai and Kimiya Yoshikawa, was hung on the wall
of a building on the bustling Wardour Street.</P>
      <P>During its public unveiling Wednesday, Westminister Mayor Louise Hyam was
unreserved about her admiration for the sculpture, which she said has given
Chinatown a new landscape and will make it the most noted Chinatown in the
world.</P>
      <P>The 600-kilogram sculpture is 360 cm long by 145 cm wide with a splendid array
of colors ranging from red, white, and yellow to orange and green.</P>
      <P>Tsai said in an interview with the Central News Agency that the design for the
sculpture won a 20,000-pound Chinatown public art design competition in late
2007, paving the way for their finished piece to be publicly displayed in the
neighborhood.</P>
      <P>Tsai, 28, said that lion statues are usually placed at the entrance of Asian
temples or palaces, which she believes symbolizes avoiding the bad, embracing
the auspicious, and serving as guardians.</P>
      <P>"The work is trying to convey the sense of hospitality but also of carefully
guarding the premises," she said.</P>
      <P>To put a contemporary twist on the lion, the sculpture is comprised of thousands
of individually laser-cut pieces of colorful Perspex, she said.</P>
      <P>The diverse pieces represent the variety of East Asians living in the U.K.,
which gives out crystallic transparency under the sun, she added.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that while the design competition was hard, the production process has
been equally arduous.</P>
      <P>Since November, Tsai and Yoshikawa have worked an average of 12 hours a day on
the project, with their only thought being that they "wanted to be the best."</P>
      <P>Tsai said that "the production of the lion is like running a marathon, which is
tough, and we're glad to see it completed."</P>
      <P>David Tse, creative director of Chinatown Arts Space, expressed the hope that
the work will enhance the dynamism and creativity of London's Chinatown.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 200 people -- mostly Penghu residents -- staged a protest in Fengshan
in Kaohsiung County Saturday, voicing their strong opposition to the
government's plan to establish a nuclear waste storage site on a Penghu islet.</P>
      <P>The protesters, headed by Penghu County Magistrate Wang Chien-fa, chanted anti-
nuclear slogans at the rally held at a local temple and vowed to use whatever
power they had to stop the plan from being carried out.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) announced in mid-March that it has
listed Daren Township in Taitung County and Dongjiyu of Penghu County as the two
suggested  sites to store low-level radioactive waste.</P>
      <P>The two counties are required to decide whether or not to accept the proposal by
holding a referendum, according to the MOEA.</P>
      <P>At the protest rally, Wang admitted that slogans cannot save Dongjiyu, one of 90
islets in the Penghu archipelago in the Taiwan Strait, because the law says that
as long as Penghu County residents approve the project through the referendum,
Dongjiyu must serve as a depository for nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>It will not be up to Dongjiyu residents alone to decide whether or not to accept
the plan that Wang contended will damage the island's untainted natural
resources and environment.</P>
      <P>Dongjiyu covers more than 140 hectares of land, 100 hectares of which have been
listed by the Penghu County government as a "nature conservation zone" in an
attempt to block the state-run Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) from opening a
nuclear storage facility on the islet.</P>
      <P>Taipower, however, can still appropriate the other 40 hectares of land, Wang
said, and he urged county residents to unite in opposition to the referendum.</P>
      <P>"Since the government wants to develop tourism in Penghu, it should not act to
set up a nuclear waste storage site there, " he argued, vowing to fight to the
death against the facility.</P>
      <P>In addition to Wang, Yeh Chung-ju, chief of Wanan Township, and Legislator Wong
Chung-Chun of the ruling Kuomintang also joined the protest.</P>
      <P>Dongjiyu, located in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait, was once home to
nearly 3,000 people, but now the population has fallen to under 30 people, most
of whom make their living through fishing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan on Saturday said it was not
necessary to hold a referendum on an economic framework agreement that Taiwan's
government plans to sign with China.</P>
      <P>The country's top China policy coordinator made the remarks at a seminar on the
pros cand cons of a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>During the opposition-organized seminar, some critics contended that the plan
proposed by President Ma Ying-jeou's administration to sign an ECFA with China
could plunge Taiwan into a crisis in which its national sovereignty would be
eroded.</P>
      <P>In response, Lai argued that the proposed ECFA is just part of the government's
efforts to promote normalization of cross-strait relations and is unrelated to
such sensitive issues as national sovereignty or cross-strait unification.</P>
      <P>"As the proposed cross-strait trade pact is simply a general economic
cooperation accord and does not have anything to do with the sovereignty issue,
there is no need to put it up for a referendum if such a pact is actually
signed," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Expressing her understanding of some people's concern over the proposed accord's
possible adverse impact, Lai said the ECFA will mainly deal with fair trade
issues and will not touch on any sovereignty issues.</P>
      <P>"The government should address unfair treatment that our country may face in the
future, " Lai said, referring to disadvantages that local manufacturers in some
sectors may face after China forms a free trade area with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations next year.</P>
      <P>Noting that promoting the signing of an ECFA with China is an established
policy, Lai said the Ministry of Economic Affairs is still reviewing the risks
and advantages of such a pact and has yet to flesh out its content.</P>
      <P>"It's too early to criticize the yet-to-be-signed accord as a pact that would
lead to a 'one China market' or lead to cross-striat unfiication under a 'one
country, two systems' formula," Lai argued.</P>
      <P>Stressing that signing an agreement requires the consent of both sides, Lai said
the government will stand firm on its stance and will in no case compromise
national sovereignty during the negotiation process.</P>
      <P>However, Lai's argument failed to convince Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen who contended that the proposed pact is not only related
to national sovereignty but also involves Taiwan's major national interests.</P>
      <P>"Lai has not presented convincing evidence or insights to back her argument,"
Tsai said, adding that Lai should give a more detailed explanation to support
her argument that the proposed ECFA will by no means erode Taiwan's sovereign
status or major national interests.</P>
      <P>The seminar was part of a state-of-the-nation conference jointly organized by
the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union to review the Ma administration's China
policy and other major policy issues.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced Saturday the first case of Japanese
encephalitis this year and urged the public to be aware of the mosquito-borne
disease.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said the
case was reported about a month earlier than is normally the case, as over the
past decade the first case of the disease has typically been reported in May.</P>
      <P>The victim, a 53-year-old man developed the symptoms of fever and vomiting April
4. He showed signs of a stiff neck and other suspicious symptoms Wednesday and
was confirmed as having Japanese encephalitis Friday.</P>
      <P>An initial probe showed that the man resides in Pingtung County and works in
nearby Kaohsiung County during the day. He was not vaccinated for Japanese
encephalitis before and has not traveled overseas recently.</P>
      <P>"The family members of the man have not been ill and the cause of his infection
is still being investigated," Shih said.</P>
      <P>He said that the disease usually strikes between May and October, reaching its
peak between June and July.</P>
      <P>Shih also said that the DOH provides shots to children over 15 months old
between March and May every year, and he urged parents to ensure that their

      <P>If the ruling and opposition parties could have a dialogue, it will benefit
Taiwan's democratic development, a Presidential Office spokesman said Saturday,
regretting that an offer to have a discussion had been turned down by the
opposition head.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-chi made the remarks after Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen declined an invitation by President Ma Ying-jeou for a dialogue to
help narrow differences and forge a national consensus.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Ma's invitation was based on a conviction that "if both sides
could start from love for Taiwan and put the public's welfare on a pedestal,
then there would be no differences that could not be resolved and no parties
that would not cooperate."</P>
      <P>Wang cited as an example the passage of a NT$149.1 billion special budget for
the expanded public works under an economic stimulus plan a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai suggested several conditions for starting the dialogue, saying
that "if the requests are not met, there is no basis to start such a dialogue."</P>
      <P>Tsai, speaking on the sidelines of a two-day seminar on Ma administration's
China policy sponsored by the DPP and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , suggested
the scrapping of the platform established between China's Communist Party and
Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Tsai also asked Ma to retract his words that "it is inevitable and the sooner
the better for the two sides to sign the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA)."</P>
      <P>Tsai threatened that if the ruler "turns a deaf ear to rational suggestions,
then the party will consider whether to act, " adding that the DPP will stage a
massive protest on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office May
17 to demand that Ma apologize to the people.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei also said that the public has misgivings about the
signing of the framework agreement, and the Ma administration should not see
such feelings as "opposing for the sake of opposing."</P>
      <P>The Ma administration should cast away its predisposed position that the ECFA is
an established policy, and clearly answer the questions of the people, leaving
the final say on the matter to the public, Huang added.</P>

      <P>More than 6,000 people successfully landed jobs Saturday through mediation of
two Executive Yuan-organized job fairs, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said
in a statement.</P>
      <P>According to initial statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level council, the job
fair held in central Taiwan's Taichung City attracted 15,068 job seekers.</P>
      <P>About 30 percent of the 10,729 job seekers who actually applied for various
openings at the fair, or 3,150 hopefuls, managed to land jobs, the CLA statement
said.</P>
      <P>Among the successful applicants, 70 percent aged between 20 and 40, while the
remaining 30 percent were middle- and senior-aged hopefuls, the statement added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  3,225 hopefuls applied for internship at local enterprises or
research jobs at local universities and colleges, with 1,741 or more than 50
percent succeeding in realizing their goals. All these vacancies were mediated
by the Ministry of Education.</P>
      <P>The CLA statement further said a similar job fair held in eastern Taiwan's
Hualien on the same day drew 5,326 visitors, with 2,921 of them applying for
various job openings available.</P>
      <P>Among the hopefuls, 1,095 or nearly 40 percent of the total succeeded in finding
jobs. More than 40 percent of the successful applicants were younger than 40 and
about 50 percent aged over 45.</P>
      <P>In the eastern job fair, 326 hopefuls applied for internships and research
positions offered by the Ministry of Education, with an about 65 percent success
rate.</P>
      <P>Two more Cabinet-sponsored job fairs will be held next weekend -- one in Taoyuan

      <P>Taipower, however, can still appropriate the other 40 hectares of land, Wang
said, and he urged county residents to unite in opposition to the referendum.</P>
      <P>"Since the government wants to develop tourism in Penghu, it should not act to
set up a nuclear waste storage site there, " he argued, vowing to fight to the
death against the facility.</P>
      <P>In addition to Wang, Yeh Chung-ju, chief of Wanan Township, and Legislator Wong
Chung-Chun of the ruling Kuomintang also joined the protest.</P>
      <P>Dongjiyu, located in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait, was once home to
nearly 3,000 people, but now the population has fallen to under 30 people, most
of whom make their living through fishing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Mainland policy coordinator rules out referendum on trade pact</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan on Saturday said it was not
necessary to hold a referendum on an economic framework agreement that Taiwan's
government plans to sign with China.</P>
      <P>The country's top China policy coordinator made the remarks at a seminar on the
pros cand cons of a proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>During the opposition-organized seminar, some critics contended that the plan
proposed by President Ma Ying-jeou's administration to sign an ECFA with China
could plunge Taiwan into a crisis in which its national sovereignty would be
eroded.</P>
      <P>In response, Lai argued that the proposed ECFA is just part of the government's
efforts to promote normalization of cross-strait relations and is unrelated to
such sensitive issues as national sovereignty or cross-strait unification.</P>
      <P>"As the proposed cross-strait trade pact is simply a general economic
cooperation accord and does not have anything to do with the sovereignty issue,
there is no need to put it up for a referendum if such a pact is actually
signed," Lai said.</P>
      <P>Expressing her understanding of some people's concern over the proposed accord's
possible adverse impact, Lai said the ECFA will mainly deal with fair trade
issues and will not touch on any sovereignty issues.</P>
      <P>"The government should address unfair treatment that our country may face in the
future, " Lai said, referring to disadvantages that local manufacturers in some
sectors may face after China forms a free trade area with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations next year.</P>
      <P>Noting that promoting the signing of an ECFA with China is an established
policy, Lai said the Ministry of Economic Affairs is still reviewing the risks
and advantages of such a pact and has yet to flesh out its content.</P>
      <P>"It's too early to criticize the yet-to-be-signed accord as a pact that would
lead to a 'one China market' or lead to cross-striat unfiication under a 'one
country, two systems' formula," Lai argued.</P>
      <P>Stressing that signing an agreement requires the consent of both sides, Lai said
the government will stand firm on its stance and will in no case compromise
national sovereignty during the negotiation process.</P>
      <P>However, Lai's argument failed to convince Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen who contended that the proposed pact is not only related
to national sovereignty but also involves Taiwan's major national interests.</P>
      <P>"Lai has not presented convincing evidence or insights to back her argument,"
Tsai said, adding that Lai should give a more detailed explanation to support
her argument that the proposed ECFA will by no means erode Taiwan's sovereign
status or major national interests.</P>
      <P>The seminar was part of a state-of-the-nation conference jointly organized by
the DPP and the Taiwan Solidarity Union to review the Ma administration's China
policy and other major policy issues.</P>

      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced Saturday the first case of Japanese
encephalitis this year and urged the public to be aware of the mosquito-borne
disease.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, said the
case was reported about a month earlier than is normally the case, as over the
past decade the first case of the disease has typically been reported in May.</P>
      <P>The victim, a 53-year-old man developed the symptoms of fever and vomiting April
4. He showed signs of a stiff neck and other suspicious symptoms Wednesday and
was confirmed as having Japanese encephalitis Friday.</P>
      <P>An initial probe showed that the man resides in Pingtung County and works in
nearby Kaohsiung County during the day. He was not vaccinated for Japanese
encephalitis before and has not traveled overseas recently.</P>
      <P>"The family members of the man have not been ill and the cause of his infection
is still being investigated," Shih said.</P>
      <P>He said that the disease usually strikes between May and October, reaching its
peak between June and July.</P>
      <P>Shih also said that the DOH provides shots to children over 15 months old
between March and May every year, and he urged parents to ensure that their

    <HEADLINE>Proposal for dialogue between ruling party, opposition rejected</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>If the ruling and opposition parties could have a dialogue, it will benefit
Taiwan's democratic development, a Presidential Office spokesman said Saturday,
regretting that an offer to have a discussion had been turned down by the
opposition head.</P>
      <P>Wang Yu-chi made the remarks after Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairwoman
Tsai Ing-wen declined an invitation by President Ma Ying-jeou for a dialogue to
help narrow differences and forge a national consensus.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Ma's invitation was based on a conviction that "if both sides
could start from love for Taiwan and put the public's welfare on a pedestal,
then there would be no differences that could not be resolved and no parties
that would not cooperate."</P>
      <P>Wang cited as an example the passage of a NT$149.1 billion special budget for
the expanded public works under an economic stimulus plan a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai suggested several conditions for starting the dialogue, saying
that "if the requests are not met, there is no basis to start such a dialogue."</P>
      <P>Tsai, speaking on the sidelines of a two-day seminar on Ma administration's
China policy sponsored by the DPP and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , suggested
the scrapping of the platform established between China's Communist Party and
Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Tsai also asked Ma to retract his words that "it is inevitable and the sooner
the better for the two sides to sign the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA)."</P>
      <P>Tsai threatened that if the ruler "turns a deaf ear to rational suggestions,
then the party will consider whether to act, " adding that the DPP will stage a
massive protest on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office May
17 to demand that Ma apologize to the people.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Kun-huei also said that the public has misgivings about the
signing of the framework agreement, and the Ma administration should not see
such feelings as "opposing for the sake of opposing."</P>
      <P>The Ma administration should cast away its predisposed position that the ECFA is
an established policy, and clearly answer the questions of the people, leaving
the final say on the matter to the public, Huang added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 6,000 people successfully landed jobs Saturday through mediation of
two Executive Yuan-organized job fairs, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) said
in a statement.</P>
      <P>According to initial statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level council, the job
fair held in central Taiwan's Taichung City attracted 15,068 job seekers.</P>
      <P>About 30 percent of the 10,729 job seekers who actually applied for various
openings at the fair, or 3,150 hopefuls, managed to land jobs, the CLA statement
said.</P>
      <P>Among the successful applicants, 70 percent aged between 20 and 40, while the
remaining 30 percent were middle- and senior-aged hopefuls, the statement added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  3,225 hopefuls applied for internship at local enterprises or
research jobs at local universities and colleges, with 1,741 or more than 50
percent succeeding in realizing their goals. All these vacancies were mediated
by the Ministry of Education.</P>
      <P>The CLA statement further said a similar job fair held in eastern Taiwan's
Hualien on the same day drew 5,326 visitors, with 2,921 of them applying for
various job openings available.</P>
      <P>Among the hopefuls, 1,095 or nearly 40 percent of the total succeeded in finding
jobs. More than 40 percent of the successful applicants were younger than 40 and
about 50 percent aged over 45.</P>
      <P>In the eastern job fair, 326 hopefuls applied for internships and research
positions offered by the Ministry of Education, with an about 65 percent success
rate.</P>
      <P>Two more Cabinet-sponsored job fairs will be held next weekend -- one in Taoyuan
County and the other in Tainan City -- as part of the government's efforts to
increase employment after the country's unemployment rate surged to a record
5.75 percent in February amid the global economic slump.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ultra-marathon champion embraces life after having leg amputated</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/12/09  16:08:05</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As recently as eight months ago, Chiu Chu-jung was Taiwan's most formidable
female ultra-marathon runner. Competing around the world, in places as distant
as Japan, New Zealand and Greece, Chiu challenged, and defeated, some of the
best long-distance runners in the world.</P>
      <P>She was looking to continue to her success in a 1,150-kilometer race through
France in August 2008 when a blister began developing on her right foot.</P>
      <P>The experienced runner ignored the minor irritant just as she had done many
times in the past and persevered on. But bacteria that invaded her body through
the broken blisters turned into a lethal blood poisoning disease that had
doctors at a hospital in southern France fearing she might not survive.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, a double amputation that took away her right leg above the knee and
part of her left foot saved her life but has left Chiu to face the biggest
athletic challenge of her life: simply running again.</P>
      <P>The 52-year-old woman who almost ran effortlessly across deserts and up
mountains is now fighting just to get back on her feet, pursuing the goal with
the same determination that carried her through countless ultra-marathons,
without any self-pity.</P>
      <P>"So long as I am alive, everything will be OK," Chiu said at her home in
Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan, where she has been receiving treatment  and
undergoing  rehabilitation  at Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial
Hospital since returning from France on Sept. 27, 2008.</P>
      <P>Chiu has already started taking steps with the help of a walking assistance
device as she begins her long trek back to the jogging trail, a place ironically
she had no interest in for much of her young adult life.</P>
      <P>Chiu, an office worker at Kaohsiung-based China Steel Corp. (CSC) , described
herself as a woman who loved to dress well and who hated to be exposed to the
sun to protect her skin.</P>
      <P>It wasn't until the age of 37 that her athletic husband Lu Hua-chieh coaxed her
into giving running a try, even though she had not been keen on exercising since
her childhood.</P>
      <P>Once she began to jog with her husband, however, Chiu realized she had a gift
for long-distance running and was ready to pursue the activity for the rest of
her life.</P>
      <P>In her international competition debut at the 1996 Taipei International
Marathon,  she  finished  third  in the women's competition.</P>
      <P>In the following years, she experimented with different distances in races in
Taiwan, from 10 kilometers to the marathon-length 42.195 km.</P>
      <P>She then tried longer races spanning 50 km., 80 km. and 100 km. as well as
endurance tests of 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, seven days/seven nights, and 18
days and now is the Taiwanese female record-holder in most of those events.</P>
      <P>In March 2008, she further broke the Asian record for the seven days/seven
nights event previously held by Japanese runner Hiroko Okiyama, in an
international ultra-marathon in Greece. Running 785 km. in seven days and seven
nights, eclipsing Okiyama's record of 752 km., she finished second in the race
among 52 runners.</P>
      <P>It was five months later, however, that Chiu met her match, not on the race
course but from an invisible bacteria.</P>
      <P>Chiu, described as being able to run farther, longer and better than any other
woman in Taiwan, joined the "Transe Gaule" race in France Aug. 13, which
required her to run from Roscoff, a small fishing village on the northwestern
French coast, to the sunny tourist resort of Gruissan-Plage on the Mediterranean
coast in 18 days.</P>
      <P>Though she suffered from blisters from the beginning of the race, it wasn't
until the 16th day that she began to feel weak. Still, she insisted on
completing the event and ended up 17th among all 44 runners and second in the
women's division, covering the 1,150-km. distance in 125 hours, 7 minutes and 24
seconds.</P>
      <P>Only after the race did she discover how serious her condition was. Three
different kinds of pathogenic bacteria had invaded her body through the broken
blisters, causing a serious infection that eventually turned into a deadly form
of septicemia, or blood poisoning.</P>
      <P>Fearing that Chiu would not survive, doctors at a Montpellier hospital amputated
her right leg and bottom half of her left foot and also scraped most of the
flesh from the remaining leg in an effort to stop the infection from spreading.</P>
      <P>Her strong  will  that had carried  her through  so many long-distance
challenges helped keep her alive, and even today, Chiu does not blame anyone or
fate for her loss, even admitting that ignoring the blister at the time was
perfectly natural behavior because blisters are such a common occurrence among
ultra-marathon runners.</P>
      <P>She only recalls the physical pain she felt lying on a hospital bed because she
had no skin and was not allowed to move, but returning to Taiwan had great
therapeutic value, because, as she said, "so long as I was coming home, there
would be hope."</P>
      <P>Before Christmas last year, Chiu checked out of the Kaohsiung hospital and
returned home, ending her "most unforgettable journey" to begin a new one.</P>
      <P>The "Ultra-Marathon Mom" as she's known can now stand and walk a few steps with
the help of a prosthetic leg made for her.</P>
      <P>Her next step, Chiu said, is to "start learning from the beginning" in the hope
of returning to her old running haunts.</P>
      <P>"I am now in an ultra-marathon race of my own, " acknowledged Chiu, with the
destination the ability to run again.</P>
      <P>She figures the discipline she learned in long-distance running will serve her
well in her latest journey.</P>
      <P>"The only secret of success in running is to persist until the very end, " said
Chiu, who now has set a longer-term of participating in the Paralympic Games one
day in the future.</P>
      <P>"Life is long. One should not give up or be pessimistic (because of some
tribulations)."</P>

      <P>The Cabinet has mapped out a four-year plan to raise the quality of Taiwan's
tourism environment that it expects will boost revenues from international
tourists by 80 percent in four years, the Tourism Bureau disclosed in a report
released Sunday.</P>
      <P>In the analysis of Taiwan's tourist industry, the bureau said that in 2007,
international tourists spent US$5.1 billion in Taiwan, accounting for 1.34
percent of Taiwan's gross domestic product -- better than the United States,
Canada, Germany, Japan, South Korea and China.</P>
      <P>The planned campaign aims to increase annual tourism revenues to US$9 billion by
2012, accounting for more than 2 percent of Taiwan's GDP, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>The plan is expected to increase the number of international tourist arrivals by
an average of up to 4 percent each year -- from 4.1 million in 2009 to 5.5
million in 2012.</P>
      <P>Visitors from Japan will continue to constitute the biggest segment of
international tourist arrivals in 2009 and 2010, estimated to reach 1.09 million
and 1.1 million respectively in those two years.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors from China, however, is expected to grow rapidly, rising
from 320,000 in 2009 to 700,000 in 2010, and again to 1.2 million in 2011 to be
on par with tourist arrivals from Japan in that year.</P>
      <P>But in 2012, the number of tourists from China is expected to rise to 1.5
million, surpassing the number of visitors from Japan for the first time.</P>
      <P>Other estimated international tourist arrivals in 2012 are 1.18 million from
Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia; 720,000 from Europe, North America and
Australia; and 290,000 from South Korea, according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRA a positive force in U.S.-Taiwan-China relations: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Sunday said the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) has not
only symbolized the strong friendship and trust between the United States and
Taiwan over the past three decades, but will continue to serve as a strong
foundation for relations among the U.S., Taiwan and China in the future.</P>
      <P>The TRA has served to anchor peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait for
the past three decades, " Ma said in English at the opening ceremony of an
international conference on the TRA and its prospects on its 30th anniversary.</P>
      <P>"Its very existence  changed  the evolutionary  course  of cross-strait
development by stabilizing the trilateral relationship among Taiwan, the U.S.
and mainland China,he said.</P>
      <P>Describing the TRA as thesecond best choicein an imperfect world, the president
said the TRA has served to accommodate Taiwan's needs by keeping all aspects of
U.S.-Taiwan relations intact despite Washington's switching of diplomatic
recognition from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China in
1979.</P>
      <P>The TRA also created a resilient triangular framework for relations among U.S.,
Taiwan and China, he added.</P>
      <P>This resilience,  or dynamic status quo,  is of crucial importance for peace and
stability for East Asia,Ma said.</P>
      <P>Enacted by the U.S. Congress April 10, 1979, the TRA has been the sole legal
document on the United States side governing bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The act requires the U.S. to guarantee defensive arms sales to Taiwan and to
maintain the capacity of the U.S. to resist any resort to force or other forms
of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic
system, of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It does not require the U.S. to intervene militarily if the People' Republic of
China attacks or invades Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking of current cross-Taiwan Strait relations, President Ma said that his
administration's  continuous  efforts to improve relations with Beijing since
last May not only put an end to bilateral diplomatic belligerency in favor of
substantive economic cooperation, but also demonstrated to the world that Taiwan
wants to be a responsible peacemaker instead of troublemaker in the region.</P>
      <P>With the resilience of the TRA and the ever-warming relations with China,
especially on the economic front, Ma said this new equilibrium will create a
win-win-win situation for the U.S., Taiwan, and China to solve complex issues
through cooperation.</P>
      <P>Describing U.S.-Taiwan-China relations as a train, Ma said he hoped that they
will continue to remain on the right track and move smoothly forward.</P>
      <P>As part of the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the passage of the TRA,
the April 12 international conference was held by the nongovernmental National
Policy Foundation and the Cross-Strait Interflow Prospect Foundation.</P>
      <P>More than 300 government officials, dignitaries and political experts from home
and abroad are attending the conference to look back at the act and discuss new
ways to enhance U.S.-Taiwan relations.</P>

the end of May as an increase in Chinese tourist arrivals is expected ahead of
the holiday,  according to Hsu Kao-ching, secretary-general of the Tourism
Business Association in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement reached by Taiwan and China last June, the number of Chinese
allowed to visit Taiwan is capped at 3,000 per day, but arrivals in late April
and May are expected to exceed that number.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the agency will draw from the 170,000 quota slots that went unused
during the first three months of 2009 to provide additional spots beyond the
daily cap to meet demand.</P>
      <P>The National Immigration Agency anticipates approving about 500 Chinese visitor
applications more than the cap allows per day, or a total of 5,500, during the
last two weeks of April.</P>
      <P>The balance of 164,500 unused slots from the first quarter will be allocated
during other peak travel periods as necessary if applications from Chinese
visitors to travel in Taiwan exceeds the visitor ceiling.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that as more Chinese apply to come to Taiwan, the Immigration Agency's
manpower has grown tight, and that while it would accept all applications filed
during work hours, the maximum number of applications it can approve in one day
is limited to 4,311.</P>
      <P>A number of Chinese tourist groups are slated to arrive in the next six weeks
that will likely push their numbers above the established cap.</P>
      <P>A group of 20,000 people from a senior citizens' association in China is
scheduled to arrive in Taiwan in May in separate batches, making it the largest
ever Chinese tourist group to visit Taiwan, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the group will apply to visit on a special-case basis so as
not to count against the daily visitor quota.</P>
      <P>A 900-member group from China's Fujian province will visit Taiwan April 15 after
arriving in the Taiwan island county of Kinmen via a ferry between the island
and Xiamen in Fujian.</P>
      <P>After flying to Taiwan and touring the island, they will take the Taihua Ferry
traveling from Kaohsiung Harbor to Magong in the island county of Penghu April
20 before heading home the next day, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Also, several groups each composed of some 100 travelers from Guangxi and
Zhejiang provinces and Hainan Island, and tourism industry representatives from
various provinces in China,  are expected to attend the 2009 Taipei
International Tourism Exposition scheduled to open May 22 at the Taipei World
Trade Center, said Ding Lai, deputy secretary-general of the Taipei Association
of Travel Agents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRC should give Taiwan more international space: former U.S. official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
04/12/09  17:40:46
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former top-ranking U.S. official said Sunday in Taipei that given the warming
relations between Taiwan and China, Beijing should take further steps to give
Taiwan more space in the international  community,  calling progress  on this
issue "critical."</P>
      <P>Winston Lord, former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs, also asserted that Washington, while continuing to adhere to its
commitments to China and Taiwan, should not play a role in mediating problems
between the sides.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech at an international conference on the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA) 30 years after it was enacted, Lord contended that current cross-Taiwan
Strait relations are the most steady and promising -- if not prosperous -- in
sixty years, but "there is never room for complacency."</P>
      <P>The most immediate issue regarding future moves by Taipei and Beijing, he said,
is international space for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While the Chinese have loosened up somewhat and seem to be entertaining
flexibility on Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization, Lord
said Beijing should move fromhalting, limited steps to a more forthcoming
posture, there and elsewhere, consistent with Taiwan's dignity and stature.</P>
      <P>This can be reconciled with Beijing's principles if it has the will to do so,
Lord said.Progress on this issue is critical -- both on the merits of the case
and to show the Taiwan people that President Ma Ying-jeou's initiatives are
bearing fruit.</P>
      <P>China's position on security issues is also cause for concern, according to the
former diplomat.</P>
      <P>Lord said it might be hoped that increasing economic ties, bilateral dialogue
and general momentum will lead to progress in this area, but the picture so far
is not encouraging, as a recent Pentagon report indicated that China continues
to build up its missile force and its general military capabilities.</P>
      <P>In addition, fleeting references to confidence-building measures have not
yielded concrete steps either, said Lord, who now serves as the chairman
emeritus of the International Rescue Committee.</P>
      <P>On the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty, Lord said the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait need to seek ways to continue obfuscating the problem, adding that China
has shown some patience on the sovereignty issue -- perhaps in the belief that
time is on its side.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is a clear popular consensus in Taiwan that drawing closer to
the People's Republic of China (PRC) can only be envisioned if the mainland's
political system becomes more open, pluralistic and free, the former top-ranking
U.S. official seemed cautiously optimistic in this area.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that China will move toward greater transparency and liberty -- not
as a concession to the West but as the proven route to a brighter future,Lord
said.</P>
      <P>As to the U.S. role in relations among Washington, Beijing and Taipei, Lord said
the U.S. should continue to foster a positive environment for progress through
deft diplomacy incorporating both encouragement and admonition, as well as
adhere to its commitments to the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The U.S. should not, however, mediate in any fashion, even in the highly
unlikely event that the two sides sought to cast America in that role, Lord
said, because the future relationship between Taiwan and the PRC should be
resolved between themdirectly, peacefully and with the support of the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRA still serves U.S. interests in Taiwan: former AIT director</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three decades after the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) , the U.S.
domestic law still serves the interests of the United States in Taiwan, despite
the many political, economic, and strategic changes that have occurred, a former
U.S. diplomat said Sunday.</P>
      <P>From political, economic and strategic perspectives, the United States retains
strong but changing interests in its unofficial relations with Taiwan, said
Douglas Paal, former director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei
Office, at an international conference to mark the 30th anniversary of the TRA
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The instrument of the TRA, accompanied by confidence in the wisdom of the people
of Taiwan expressed  through ballot box democracy, is a source of reassurance
for both America and Taiwan going forward,he added.</P>
      <P>Enacted by the U.S. Congress April 10, 1979, the TRA has been the sole U.S.
legal document governing bilateral relations with Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The act requires the U.S. to guarantee defensive arms sales to Taiwan and to
maintain the capacity of the U.S. to resist any resort to force or other forms
of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic
system, of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It does not require the U.S. to intervene militarily if the People's Republic of
China attacks or invades Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Paal, U.S. calculations have changed enormously since 1979, because
politically, the U.S. sense of Taiwan as a plucky, stalwart outpost of freedom
against tyranny has eroded, while economically, China's trade with Taiwan and
the U.S. has grown significantly from 1979 levels.</P>
      <P>He said America still has important strategic interests in Taiwan because how
China's policy toward Taiwan evolves can be a strategic signal as to how China
wants to interact with America and the world.</P>
      <P>Also, how China's leaders manage the views in China that "reunification" with
the island would be an important component of Beijing's new maritime
assertiveness and promote better relations with Taipei can be indicators of
China's strategic ambitions, he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing's handling of Taipei's desire for participation in international
organizations like the World Health Assembly will also give the U.S. indications
of Chinese intentions, according to Paal.</P>
      <P>So far, there is much to be reassured about in China's recent dealings with
Taiwan, yet there are still sources of concern. The picture remains mixed,Paal
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Experts launch renewed efforts to conserve rare fish species</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
04/12/09  18:40:25
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has enlisted the help of four academics to launch another effort
to conserve the Formosan landlocked salmon -- a critically endangered indigenous
species -- later this month, officials of the Ministry of the Interior disclosed
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The officials at the Construction and Planning Agency said that an initial
survey by the four experts showed that the Luoyewei River in the Sheipa National
Park in central Taiwan is an ideal environment where artificially bred young fry
of the species can be released.</P>
      <P>The Formosan landlocked salmon -- a holdover from the last Ice Age -- has been
designated as a national treasure. The salmon became landlocked during the last
glacial epoch in frigid mountain streams, and thus its discovery in Taiwan -- a
subtropical island -- is considered a biological miracle.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted last October showed that after five successive typhoons stuck
central Taiwan in 2008, the number of the fish in Taiwan's mountain streams
dropped from some 5,300 to 3,600.</P>
      <P>The four academics in charge of the new conservation efforts are ecologist Lin
Sin-Chu, ichthyologist Tseng Ching-hsien, aquaculture expert Huang Yi-syun, and
river expert Ye Chao-sian.</P>
      <P>They have found that the 11.4-kilometer  river along  the 2,700-meter-high
Luoyewei Mountain has many deep ponds with agreeable temperatures and suitable
oxygen levels that provide ideal new habitats for the rare fish.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the new conservation efforts became necessary because
the 1,280 artificially bred young fish released in a number of rivers in the
national park between 2006 and 2008 had a survival rate of less than 1 percent,
mainly because of the typhoons last year.</P>
      <P>Most of the existing fish are found in the Cijiawan river, a protected sanctuary
for the Formosan landlocked salmon in the Sheipa National Park.</P>
      <P>Formosan landlocked salmon grow to about 30 centimeters in length and inhabit
cold, slow-flowing streams with gently sloping beds at elevations above 1,500
meters, such as the Cijiawan river upstream from the Dajia River.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No change of TRA needed for warming Taiwan-China ties: U.S. scholars</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no need to amend the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) or replace it with a
new one to adjust to new realities in Taiwan or to changing relations with China
because it has and will continue to serve United States interests, U.S. scholars
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>They were in Taipei attending a conference on the significance of the TRA 30
years after it was enacted, and Bonnie Glaser, a senior associate at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, asserted that the TRA continued to be
in Washington's interests.</P>
      <P>In her speech on the future direction of the TRA and its implications for cross-
Taiwan Strait relations, Glaser said the TRA does not need to be amended because
it addresses U.S. policy interests, not outcomes, and its efficacy has not been
affected substantially by shifting U.S.-China-Taiwan dynamics.</P>
      <P>The TRA endures because it serves the U.S.interest, she said.</P>
      <P>Alan Romberg, a distinguished fellow and director of the East Asia Program of
the Henry L. Stimson Center, echoed Glaser's view, saying that the TRA has been
interpreted and applied as a very useful statement of U.S. policy and a point of
reference.</P>
      <P>The fact that the U.S. has maintained that policy through all these years
regardless of many changes in the situation is a testament to its correctness
from the perspective of American interests,he said.</P>
      <P>Enacted by the U.S. Congress April 10, 1979, the TRA has been the sole U.S.
legal document governing Washington's bilateral relations with Taiwan in the
absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The act requires the U.S. to guarantee defensive arms sales to Taiwan and to
maintain the capacity of the U.S. to resist any resort to force or other forms
of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic
system, of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It does not require the U.S. to intervene militarily if the People's Republic of
China attacks or invades Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Drew Thompson, director of China Studies and a senior fellow of the U.S. think
tank Nixon Center, contended that the TRA is unlikely to change in the future as
it continues to serve its intended purpose to help maintain peace, security and
stability in the Western Pacific.</P>
      <P>The ambiguity encapsulated in the TRA benefits Taiwan. Changing it, in my
opinion, would not improve Taiwan's condition, nor would it necessarily further
the unique U.S.-Taiwan relationship, Thompson said.</P>
      <P>Changing it could potentially embolden China and increase anxiety in Taiwan,he
added.</P>
      <P>The scholars also seemed to agree that closer cooperation between Taiwan and
China serves U.S. interests because the consistent objective of U.S. policy is
to preserve cross-strait peace and stability.</P>
      <P>That goal has been advanced by the initiatives that President Ma Ying-jeou has
taken toward China over the past year, and the U.S. should continue to support
his approach, which has the support of a majority of the Taiwanese people, the
scholars argued.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Young men show highest increase in abnormal blood lipid levels</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Young and middle-aged men are the two groups that have exhibited the highest
rate of increase in abnormal blood lipid levels in recent years, two
cardiologists said at a health promotion event in Taipei Saturday.</P>
      <P>Nearly 80 percent of the more than 200 people who had their blood fat tested at
the event Saturday were found to have abnormally high blood lipid levels, which
can contribute to cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</P>
      <P>Chiang Fu-tien, president of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology, and Hwang Juey-
jen,  deputy chief executive  of Taiwan  Heart Foundation, said at the event
that blood fat levels have been on the rise among men in recent years.</P>
      <P>Based on the results of blood lipid tests done in 2002 and 2007, the percent of
men aged 30-40 who have high blood fat levels rose to 10.4 percent in 2007 from
8.3 percent in 2002, while the rate for men aged 50-60 increased by 3.1
percentage points to 16.5 percent in 2007.</P>
      <P>An increase in high blood lipid levels was not observed, however, in females of
any age group, they said.</P>
      <P>Higher levels of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) , known as "bad"
cholesterol, were found among both males and females between 2002 to 2007.</P>
      <P>Men in the 30-40 age bracket saw the largest increase -- 4 percentage points --
among all age groups while the 0.7 percentage point increase seen in women aged
40-50 was the biggest among female age groups, the two found.</P>
      <P>People who want to know whether they have high blood lipid levels should be
checked for total cholesterol, LDC-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C) and triglyceride levels after fasting for eight hours, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>Individuals with a total cholesterol level above 200 mg/dl and a higher LDC-C
level tend to have abnormally high levels of lipids, or fatty molecules, in the
blood.</P>
      <P>People with cardiovascular disease or diabetes should try to keep their LDC-C
level below 100 mg/dl, while those with one or without any risk factor for
developing cardiovascular disease should keep their LDC-C level below 160 mg/dl,
and those with two or more risk factors should keep their LDC-C level below 130
mg/dl, Hwang added.</P>
      <P>The blood test Saturday was held to mark Taiwan Blood Lipid Day, observed on the
100th day of every year.</P>
      <P>The event aims to remind adults to have a blood lipid test done during their
physical checkups and to promote the concept of exercising regularly, refraining
from alcohol, and eating a balanced diet that is low in fat and high in fiber,
Hwang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tzu Chi raises efficiency in bone marrow donor registry management</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation announced Sunday that newly added facilities
will allow it to further increase efficiency in managing its bone marrow donor
registry.</P>
      <P>The foundation indicated that the improvement of its electronized network was
made possible because of 60 computers donated by two of Taiwan's largest
computer companies -- Asustek Computer Inc. and Acer Inc.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi Hospital staff often go to different places in northern, central and
southern Taiwan to encourage members of the public to take a blood test and join
the registry as potential bone marrow donors.</P>
      <P>Previously they had to write down all initial information about potential donors
and their blood test results before going back to their offices to enter the
data in the registry. But now, with the new equipment that can be carried around
with them, Tzu Chi medical workers can transmit the information electronically
to the database directly on the spot.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony held to inaugurate the new system, Shih Ming-huang, director of
the Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center, said the improved electronized
database will allow staff members to eliminate errors caused by unclear
handwriting, shorten the time needed to find matching donors, and increase the
success rate of bone marrow transplants.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi established the bone marrow donor registry in 1993 to help patients with
blood diseases. The data bank has since become the largest marrow donor registry
in Asia and the fifth largest in the world.</P>
      <P>In 2002, the bone marrow registry was incorporated as a division of the Tzu Chi
Stem Cells Center, which was founded to improve research and treatment of blood
disease patients.</P>
      <P>Tzu center's registry consists of information about 350,000 potential bone
marrow donors and 11,000 units of umbilical cord blood.</P>
      <P>The data bank has provided bone marrow and stem cells in 1,428 donation cases.
The Hualien branch of Tzu Chi Hospital alone has conducted over 1,000 bone
marrow extractions from donors to help patients in hospitals around the world.</P>

      <P>A man who threw a large number of NT$1,000 bills out of a taxi on the freeway
was questioned by police in Changhua City Sunday.</P>
      <P>Police found more than NT$920,000 and some partly burned notes in two bags the
man was carrying after he was delivered to the Cihtong Police Station in
Changhua City.</P>
      <P>The man, identified only by his family name of Chen, grabbed a taxi at the
Taichung railway station and asked the driver to take him to Changhua City.</P>
      <P>As they were driving southbound on the freeway, the passenger began throwing
NT$1,000 bills out the car window on to the road, which prompted the cab driver
to take him to the police station. The police found him had lodged in a hotel in
Changhua City last night and had triggered the fire alarm for burning bills in
his room.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday, a man who hired a taxi to go from Chiayi to Sijhih in Taipei
County, also threw money out of the window on the freeway, causing chaos when
motorists stopped their cars to pick up the discarded money.  The man who said
that the money came from the sale of a piece of his land admitted to police that
he had thrown bills out of cabs on freeway many times in different places.</P>
      <P>Since throwing waste on highway is an offence which could be fined for NT$3000

further questioning.</P>

      <P>China's Ministry of Transport has approved the application by Taiwan Navigation
Co. to offer charter ferry services from the southern port of Kaohsiung to
China's Xiamen, a coastal city in Fujian province, starting April 20, Wen Wei
Po, a Hong Kong-based Chinese language newspaper reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Taihua Ferry managed by the company will be allowed to carry passengers
between the two destinations via Magong, the capital of the island county of
Penghu, as Taiwan and China have yet to reach a formal agreement  on opening
direct passenger  shipping links, according to the report.</P>
      <P>The Taihua Ferry will sail four round trips between Kaohsiung and Xiamen by May
31. The ferry company estimates it will take four hours to sail from Kaohsiung
to Magong and another six hours to get from Magong to Xiamen, based on an
estimated speed of 20 knots per hour, the report said.</P>
      <P>Operators of marine passenger liners have sought to explore the possibility of
offering passenger service between Taiwan and China, as the 108 direct charter
flights per week between the two countries cannot meet the demand created by an
increase in Chinese visitor arrivals.</P>
      <P>The 7,000 tickets available for the four round-trips were snapped up by a travel
agency in Xiamen because of the cheap cost relative to airfares.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ultra-marathon champion embraces life after having leg amputated</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/12/09  16:08:05</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As recently as eight months ago, Chiu Chu-jung was Taiwan's most formidable
female ultra-marathon runner. Competing around the world, in places as distant
as Japan, New Zealand and Greece, Chiu challenged, and defeated, some of the
best long-distance runners in the world.</P>
      <P>She was looking to continue to her success in a 1,150-kilometer race through
France in August 2008 when a blister began developing on her right foot.</P>
      <P>The experienced runner ignored the minor irritant just as she had done many
times in the past and persevered on. But bacteria that invaded her body through
the broken blisters turned into a lethal blood poisoning disease that had
doctors at a hospital in southern France fearing she might not survive.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, a double amputation that took away her right leg above the knee and
part of her left foot saved her life but has left Chiu to face the biggest
athletic challenge of her life: simply running again.</P>
      <P>The 52-year-old woman who almost ran effortlessly across deserts and up
mountains is now fighting just to get back on her feet, pursuing the goal with
the same determination that carried her through countless ultra-marathons,
without any self-pity.</P>
      <P>"So long as I am alive, everything will be OK," Chiu said at her home in
Kaohsiung City, southern Taiwan, where she has been receiving treatment  and
undergoing  rehabilitation  at Kaohsiung Medical University Chung-Ho Memorial
Hospital since returning from France on Sept. 27, 2008.</P>
      <P>Chiu has already started taking steps with the help of a walking assistance
device as she begins her long trek back to the jogging trail, a place ironically
she had no interest in for much of her young adult life.</P>
      <P>Chiu, an office worker at Kaohsiung-based China Steel Corp. (CSC) , described
herself as a woman who loved to dress well and who hated to be exposed to the
sun to protect her skin.</P>
      <P>It wasn't until the age of 37 that her athletic husband Lu Hua-chieh coaxed her
into giving running a try, even though she had not been keen on exercising since
her childhood.</P>
      <P>Once she began to jog with her husband, however, Chiu realized she had a gift
for long-distance running and was ready to pursue the activity for the rest of
her life.</P>
      <P>In her international competition debut at the 1996 Taipei International
Marathon,  she  finished  third  in the women's competition.</P>
      <P>In the following years, she experimented with different distances in races in
Taiwan, from 10 kilometers to the marathon-length 42.195 km.</P>
      <P>She then tried longer races spanning 50 km., 80 km. and 100 km. as well as
endurance tests of 12 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, seven days/seven nights, and 18
days and now is the Taiwanese female record-holder in most of those events.</P>
      <P>In March 2008, she further broke the Asian record for the seven days/seven
nights event previously held by Japanese runner Hiroko Okiyama, in an
international ultra-marathon in Greece. Running 785 km. in seven days and seven
nights, eclipsing Okiyama's record of 752 km., she finished second in the race
among 52 runners.</P>
      <P>It was five months later, however, that Chiu met her match, not on the race
course but from an invisible bacteria.</P>
      <P>Chiu, described as being able to run farther, longer and better than any other
woman in Taiwan, joined the "Transe Gaule" race in France Aug. 13, which
required her to run from Roscoff, a small fishing village on the northwestern
French coast, to the sunny tourist resort of Gruissan-Plage on the Mediterranean
coast in 18 days.</P>
      <P>Though she suffered from blisters from the beginning of the race, it wasn't
until the 16th day that she began to feel weak. Still, she insisted on
completing the event and ended up 17th among all 44 runners and second in the
women's division, covering the 1,150-km. distance in 125 hours, 7 minutes and 24
seconds.</P>
      <P>Only after the race did she discover how serious her condition was. Three
different kinds of pathogenic bacteria had invaded her body through the broken
blisters, causing a serious infection that eventually turned into a deadly form
of septicemia, or blood poisoning.</P>
      <P>Fearing that Chiu would not survive, doctors at a Montpellier hospital amputated
her right leg and bottom half of her left foot and also scraped most of the
flesh from the remaining leg in an effort to stop the infection from spreading.</P>
      <P>Her strong  will  that had carried  her through  so many long-distance
challenges helped keep her alive, and even today, Chiu does not blame anyone or
fate for her loss, even admitting that ignoring the blister at the time was
perfectly natural behavior because blisters are such a common occurrence among
ultra-marathon runners.</P>
      <P>She only recalls the physical pain she felt lying on a hospital bed because she
had no skin and was not allowed to move, but returning to Taiwan had great
therapeutic value, because, as she said, "so long as I was coming home, there
would be hope."</P>
      <P>Before Christmas last year, Chiu checked out of the Kaohsiung hospital and
returned home, ending her "most unforgettable journey" to begin a new one.</P>
      <P>The "Ultra-Marathon Mom" as she's known can now stand and walk a few steps with
the help of a prosthetic leg made for her.</P>
      <P>Her next step, Chiu said, is to "start learning from the beginning" in the hope
of returning to her old running haunts.</P>
      <P>"I am now in an ultra-marathon race of my own, " acknowledged Chiu, with the
destination the ability to run again.</P>
      <P>She figures the discipline she learned in long-distance running will serve her
well in her latest journey.</P>
      <P>"The only secret of success in running is to persist until the very end, " said
Chiu, who now has set a longer-term of participating in the Paralympic Games one
day in the future.</P>
      <P>"Life is long. One should not give up or be pessimistic (because of some
tribulations)."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cabinet estimates 80% rise in tourism revenues by 2012</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet has mapped out a four-year plan to raise the quality of Taiwan's
tourism environment that it expects will boost revenues from international
tourists by 80 percent in four years, the Tourism Bureau disclosed in a report
released Sunday.</P>
      <P>In the analysis of Taiwan's tourist industry, the bureau said that in 2007,
international tourists spent US$5.1 billion in Taiwan, accounting for 1.34
percent of Taiwan's gross domestic product -- better than the United States,
Canada, Germany, Japan, South Korea and China.</P>
      <P>The planned campaign aims to increase annual tourism revenues to US$9 billion by
2012, accounting for more than 2 percent of Taiwan's GDP, according to the
report.</P>
      <P>The plan is expected to increase the number of international tourist arrivals by
an average of up to 4 percent each year -- from 4.1 million in 2009 to 5.5
million in 2012.</P>
      <P>Visitors from Japan will continue to constitute the biggest segment of
international tourist arrivals in 2009 and 2010, estimated to reach 1.09 million
and 1.1 million respectively in those two years.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors from China, however, is expected to grow rapidly, rising
from 320,000 in 2009 to 700,000 in 2010, and again to 1.2 million in 2011 to be
on par with tourist arrivals from Japan in that year.</P>
      <P>But in 2012, the number of tourists from China is expected to rise to 1.5
million, surpassing the number of visitors from Japan for the first time.</P>
      <P>Other estimated international tourist arrivals in 2012 are 1.18 million from
Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia; 720,000 from Europe, North America and
Australia; and 290,000 from South Korea, according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRA a positive force in U.S.-Taiwan-China relations: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Sunday said the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) has not
only symbolized the strong friendship and trust between the United States and
Taiwan over the past three decades, but will continue to serve as a strong
foundation for relations among the U.S., Taiwan and China in the future.</P>
      <P>The TRA has served to anchor peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait for
the past three decades, " Ma said in English at the opening ceremony of an
international conference on the TRA and its prospects on its 30th anniversary.</P>
      <P>"Its very existence  changed  the evolutionary  course  of cross-strait
development by stabilizing the trilateral relationship among Taiwan, the U.S.
and mainland China,he said.</P>
      <P>Describing the TRA as thesecond best choicein an imperfect world, the president
said the TRA has served to accommodate Taiwan's needs by keeping all aspects of
U.S.-Taiwan relations intact despite Washington's switching of diplomatic
recognition from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China in
1979.</P>
      <P>The TRA also created a resilient triangular framework for relations among U.S.,
Taiwan and China, he added.</P>
      <P>This resilience,  or dynamic status quo,  is of crucial importance for peace and
stability for East Asia,Ma said.</P>
      <P>Enacted by the U.S. Congress April 10, 1979, the TRA has been the sole legal
document on the United States side governing bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>The act requires the U.S. to guarantee defensive arms sales to Taiwan and to
maintain the capacity of the U.S. to resist any resort to force or other forms
of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic
system, of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It does not require the U.S. to intervene militarily if the People' Republic of
China attacks or invades Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking of current cross-Taiwan Strait relations, President Ma said that his
administration's  continuous  efforts to improve relations with Beijing since
last May not only put an end to bilateral diplomatic belligerency in favor of
substantive economic cooperation, but also demonstrated to the world that Taiwan
wants to be a responsible peacemaker instead of troublemaker in the region.</P>
      <P>With the resilience of the TRA and the ever-warming relations with China,
especially on the economic front, Ma said this new equilibrium will create a
win-win-win situation for the U.S., Taiwan, and China to solve complex issues
through cooperation.</P>
      <P>Describing U.S.-Taiwan-China relations as a train, Ma said he hoped that they
will continue to remain on the right track and move smoothly forward.</P>
      <P>As part of the celebration of the 30th anniversary of the passage of the TRA,
the April 12 international conference was held by the nongovernmental National
Policy Foundation and the Cross-Strait Interflow Prospect Foundation.</P>
      <P>More than 300 government officials, dignitaries and political experts from home
and abroad are attending the conference to look back at the act and discuss new
ways to enhance U.S.-Taiwan relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to allow more Chinese tourist arrivals for Labor Day holiday</HEADLINE>

      <P>The National Immigration Agency will increase the daily quota of Chinese
tourists allowed to visit Taiwan beginning April 16 in response to an
anticipated increase in Chinese visitor arrivals for the May 1 Labor Day
holiday, local tourism operators said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Most tour buses and three- and four-star hotels in Taiwan are fully booked until
the end of May as an increase in Chinese tourist arrivals is expected ahead of
the holiday,  according to Hsu Kao-ching, secretary-general of the Tourism
Business Association in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement reached by Taiwan and China last June, the number of Chinese
allowed to visit Taiwan is capped at 3,000 per day, but arrivals in late April
and May are expected to exceed that number.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the agency will draw from the 170,000 quota slots that went unused
during the first three months of 2009 to provide additional spots beyond the
daily cap to meet demand.</P>
      <P>The National Immigration Agency anticipates approving about 500 Chinese visitor
applications more than the cap allows per day, or a total of 5,500, during the
last two weeks of April.</P>
      <P>The balance of 164,500 unused slots from the first quarter will be allocated
during other peak travel periods as necessary if applications from Chinese
visitors to travel in Taiwan exceeds the visitor ceiling.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that as more Chinese apply to come to Taiwan, the Immigration Agency's
manpower has grown tight, and that while it would accept all applications filed
during work hours, the maximum number of applications it can approve in one day
is limited to 4,311.</P>
      <P>A number of Chinese tourist groups are slated to arrive in the next six weeks
that will likely push their numbers above the established cap.</P>
      <P>A group of 20,000 people from a senior citizens' association in China is
scheduled to arrive in Taiwan in May in separate batches, making it the largest
ever Chinese tourist group to visit Taiwan, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the group will apply to visit on a special-case basis so as
not to count against the daily visitor quota.</P>
      <P>A 900-member group from China's Fujian province will visit Taiwan April 15 after
arriving in the Taiwan island county of Kinmen via a ferry between the island
and Xiamen in Fujian.</P>
      <P>After flying to Taiwan and touring the island, they will take the Taihua Ferry
traveling from Kaohsiung Harbor to Magong in the island county of Penghu April
20 before heading home the next day, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>Also, several groups each composed of some 100 travelers from Guangxi and
Zhejiang provinces and Hainan Island, and tourism industry representatives from
various provinces in China,  are expected to attend the 2009 Taipei
International Tourism Exposition scheduled to open May 22 at the Taipei World
Trade Center, said Ding Lai, deputy secretary-general of the Taipei Association
of Travel Agents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRC should give Taiwan more international space: former U.S. official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A former top-ranking U.S. official said Sunday in Taipei that given the warming
relations between Taiwan and China, Beijing should take further steps to give
Taiwan more space in the international  community,  calling progress  on this
issue "critical."</P>
      <P>Winston Lord, former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs, also asserted that Washington, while continuing to adhere to its
commitments to China and Taiwan, should not play a role in mediating problems
between the sides.</P>
      <P>In a keynote speech at an international conference on the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA) 30 years after it was enacted, Lord contended that current cross-Taiwan
Strait relations are the most steady and promising -- if not prosperous -- in
sixty years, but "there is never room for complacency."</P>
      <P>The most immediate issue regarding future moves by Taipei and Beijing, he said,
is international space for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While the Chinese have loosened up somewhat and seem to be entertaining
flexibility on Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization, Lord
said Beijing should move fromhalting, limited steps to a more forthcoming
posture, there and elsewhere, consistent with Taiwan's dignity and stature.</P>
      <P>This can be reconciled with Beijing's principles if it has the will to do so,
Lord said.Progress on this issue is critical -- both on the merits of the case
and to show the Taiwan people that President Ma Ying-jeou's initiatives are
bearing fruit.</P>
      <P>China's position on security issues is also cause for concern, according to the
former diplomat.</P>
      <P>Lord said it might be hoped that increasing economic ties, bilateral dialogue
and general momentum will lead to progress in this area, but the picture so far
is not encouraging, as a recent Pentagon report indicated that China continues
to build up its missile force and its general military capabilities.</P>
      <P>In addition, fleeting references to confidence-building measures have not
yielded concrete steps either, said Lord, who now serves as the chairman
emeritus of the International Rescue Committee.</P>
      <P>On the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty, Lord said the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait need to seek ways to continue obfuscating the problem, adding that China
has shown some patience on the sovereignty issue -- perhaps in the belief that
time is on its side.</P>
      <P>Noting that there is a clear popular consensus in Taiwan that drawing closer to
the People's Republic of China (PRC) can only be envisioned if the mainland's
political system becomes more open, pluralistic and free, the former top-ranking
U.S. official seemed cautiously optimistic in this area.</P>
      <P>I am hopeful that China will move toward greater transparency and liberty -- not
as a concession to the West but as the proven route to a brighter future,Lord
said.</P>
      <P>As to the U.S. role in relations among Washington, Beijing and Taipei, Lord said
the U.S. should continue to foster a positive environment for progress through
deft diplomacy incorporating both encouragement and admonition, as well as
adhere to its commitments to the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The U.S. should not, however, mediate in any fashion, even in the highly
unlikely event that the two sides sought to cast America in that role, Lord
said, because the future relationship between Taiwan and the PRC should be
resolved between themdirectly, peacefully and with the support of the people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRA still serves U.S. interests in Taiwan: former AIT director</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three decades after the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) , the U.S.
domestic law still serves the interests of the United States in Taiwan, despite
the many political, economic, and strategic changes that have occurred, a former
U.S. diplomat said Sunday.</P>
      <P>From political, economic and strategic perspectives, the United States retains
strong but changing interests in its unofficial relations with Taiwan, said
Douglas Paal, former director of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) Taipei
Office, at an international conference to mark the 30th anniversary of the TRA
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The instrument of the TRA, accompanied by confidence in the wisdom of the people
of Taiwan expressed  through ballot box democracy, is a source of reassurance
for both America and Taiwan going forward,he added.</P>
      <P>Enacted by the U.S. Congress April 10, 1979, the TRA has been the sole U.S.
legal document governing bilateral relations with Taiwan in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The act requires the U.S. to guarantee defensive arms sales to Taiwan and to
maintain the capacity of the U.S. to resist any resort to force or other forms
of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic
system, of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It does not require the U.S. to intervene militarily if the People's Republic of
China attacks or invades Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Paal, U.S. calculations have changed enormously since 1979, because
politically, the U.S. sense of Taiwan as a plucky, stalwart outpost of freedom
against tyranny has eroded, while economically, China's trade with Taiwan and
the U.S. has grown significantly from 1979 levels.</P>
      <P>He said America still has important strategic interests in Taiwan because how
China's policy toward Taiwan evolves can be a strategic signal as to how China
wants to interact with America and the world.</P>
      <P>Also, how China's leaders manage the views in China that "reunification" with
the island would be an important component of Beijing's new maritime
assertiveness and promote better relations with Taipei can be indicators of
China's strategic ambitions, he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing's handling of Taipei's desire for participation in international
organizations like the World Health Assembly will also give the U.S. indications
of Chinese intentions, according to Paal.</P>
      <P>So far, there is much to be reassured about in China's recent dealings with
Taiwan, yet there are still sources of concern. The picture remains mixed,Paal
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Experts launch renewed efforts to conserve rare fish species</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government has enlisted the help of four academics to launch another effort
to conserve the Formosan landlocked salmon -- a critically endangered indigenous
species -- later this month, officials of the Ministry of the Interior disclosed
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The officials at the Construction and Planning Agency said that an initial
survey by the four experts showed that the Luoyewei River in the Sheipa National
Park in central Taiwan is an ideal environment where artificially bred young fry
of the species can be released.</P>
      <P>The Formosan landlocked salmon -- a holdover from the last Ice Age -- has been
designated as a national treasure. The salmon became landlocked during the last
glacial epoch in frigid mountain streams, and thus its discovery in Taiwan -- a
subtropical island -- is considered a biological miracle.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted last October showed that after five successive typhoons stuck
central Taiwan in 2008, the number of the fish in Taiwan's mountain streams
dropped from some 5,300 to 3,600.</P>
      <P>The four academics in charge of the new conservation efforts are ecologist Lin
Sin-Chu, ichthyologist Tseng Ching-hsien, aquaculture expert Huang Yi-syun, and
river expert Ye Chao-sian.</P>
      <P>They have found that the 11.4-kilometer  river along  the 2,700-meter-high
Luoyewei Mountain has many deep ponds with agreeable temperatures and suitable
oxygen levels that provide ideal new habitats for the rare fish.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the new conservation efforts became necessary because
the 1,280 artificially bred young fish released in a number of rivers in the
national park between 2006 and 2008 had a survival rate of less than 1 percent,
mainly because of the typhoons last year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No change of TRA needed for warming Taiwan-China ties: U.S. scholars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12 (CNA)
04/12/09  19:18:03
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There is no need to amend the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) or replace it with a
new one to adjust to new realities in Taiwan or to changing relations with China
because it has and will continue to serve United States interests, U.S. scholars
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>They were in Taipei attending a conference on the significance of the TRA 30
years after it was enacted, and Bonnie Glaser, a senior associate at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, asserted that the TRA continued to be
in Washington's interests.</P>
      <P>In her speech on the future direction of the TRA and its implications for cross-
Taiwan Strait relations, Glaser said the TRA does not need to be amended because
it addresses U.S. policy interests, not outcomes, and its efficacy has not been
affected substantially by shifting U.S.-China-Taiwan dynamics.</P>
      <P>The TRA endures because it serves the U.S.interest, she said.</P>
      <P>Alan Romberg, a distinguished fellow and director of the East Asia Program of
the Henry L. Stimson Center, echoed Glaser's view, saying that the TRA has been
interpreted and applied as a very useful statement of U.S. policy and a point of
reference.</P>
      <P>The fact that the U.S. has maintained that policy through all these years
regardless of many changes in the situation is a testament to its correctness
from the perspective of American interests,he said.</P>
      <P>Enacted by the U.S. Congress April 10, 1979, the TRA has been the sole U.S.
legal document governing Washington's bilateral relations with Taiwan in the
absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>The act requires the U.S. to guarantee defensive arms sales to Taiwan and to
maintain the capacity of the U.S. to resist any resort to force or other forms
of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic
system, of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It does not require the U.S. to intervene militarily if the People's Republic of
China attacks or invades Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Drew Thompson, director of China Studies and a senior fellow of the U.S. think
tank Nixon Center, contended that the TRA is unlikely to change in the future as
it continues to serve its intended purpose to help maintain peace, security and
stability in the Western Pacific.</P>
      <P>The ambiguity encapsulated in the TRA benefits Taiwan. Changing it, in my
opinion, would not improve Taiwan's condition, nor would it necessarily further
the unique U.S.-Taiwan relationship, Thompson said.</P>
      <P>Changing it could potentially embolden China and increase anxiety in Taiwan,he
added.</P>
      <P>The scholars also seemed to agree that closer cooperation between Taiwan and
China serves U.S. interests because the consistent objective of U.S. policy is
to preserve cross-strait peace and stability.</P>
      <P>That goal has been advanced by the initiatives that President Ma Ying-jeou has
taken toward China over the past year, and the U.S. should continue to support
his approach, which has the support of a majority of the Taiwanese people, the
scholars argued.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Young men show highest increase in abnormal blood lipid levels</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12 (CNA)
04/12/09  19:45:44

    <TEXT>
      <P>Young and middle-aged men are the two groups that have exhibited the highest
rate of increase in abnormal blood lipid levels in recent years, two
cardiologists said at a health promotion event in Taipei Saturday.</P>
      <P>Nearly 80 percent of the more than 200 people who had their blood fat tested at
the event Saturday were found to have abnormally high blood lipid levels, which
can contribute to cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</P>
      <P>Chiang Fu-tien, president of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology, and Hwang Juey-
jen,  deputy chief executive  of Taiwan  Heart Foundation, said at the event
that blood fat levels have been on the rise among men in recent years.</P>
      <P>Based on the results of blood lipid tests done in 2002 and 2007, the percent of
men aged 30-40 who have high blood fat levels rose to 10.4 percent in 2007 from
8.3 percent in 2002, while the rate for men aged 50-60 increased by 3.1
percentage points to 16.5 percent in 2007.</P>
      <P>An increase in high blood lipid levels was not observed, however, in females of
any age group, they said.</P>
      <P>Higher levels of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) , known as "bad"
cholesterol, were found among both males and females between 2002 to 2007.</P>
      <P>Men in the 30-40 age bracket saw the largest increase -- 4 percentage points --
among all age groups while the 0.7 percentage point increase seen in women aged
40-50 was the biggest among female age groups, the two found.</P>
      <P>People who want to know whether they have high blood lipid levels should be
checked for total cholesterol, LDC-C and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C) and triglyceride levels after fasting for eight hours, Hwang said.</P>
      <P>Individuals with a total cholesterol level above 200 mg/dl and a higher LDC-C
level tend to have abnormally high levels of lipids, or fatty molecules, in the
blood.</P>
      <P>People with cardiovascular disease or diabetes should try to keep their LDC-C
level below 100 mg/dl, while those with one or without any risk factor for
developing cardiovascular disease should keep their LDC-C level below 160 mg/dl,
and those with two or more risk factors should keep their LDC-C level below 130
mg/dl, Hwang added.</P>
      <P>The blood test Saturday was held to mark Taiwan Blood Lipid Day, observed on the
100th day of every year.</P>
      <P>The event aims to remind adults to have a blood lipid test done during their
physical checkups and to promote the concept of exercising regularly, refraining
from alcohol, and eating a balanced diet that is low in fat and high in fiber,
Hwang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Tzu Chi raises efficiency in bone marrow donor registry management</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
04/12/09  21:25:08
(By Han Nai-kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation announced Sunday that newly added facilities
will allow it to further increase efficiency in managing its bone marrow donor
registry.</P>
      <P>The foundation indicated that the improvement of its electronized network was
made possible because of 60 computers donated by two of Taiwan's largest
computer companies -- Asustek Computer Inc. and Acer Inc.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi Hospital staff often go to different places in northern, central and
southern Taiwan to encourage members of the public to take a blood test and join
the registry as potential bone marrow donors.</P>
      <P>Previously they had to write down all initial information about potential donors
and their blood test results before going back to their offices to enter the
data in the registry. But now, with the new equipment that can be carried around
with them, Tzu Chi medical workers can transmit the information electronically
to the database directly on the spot.</P>
      <P>At a ceremony held to inaugurate the new system, Shih Ming-huang, director of
the Tzu Chi Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Center, said the improved electronized
database will allow staff members to eliminate errors caused by unclear
handwriting, shorten the time needed to find matching donors, and increase the
success rate of bone marrow transplants.</P>
      <P>Tzu Chi established the bone marrow donor registry in 1993 to help patients with
blood diseases. The data bank has since become the largest marrow donor registry
in Asia and the fifth largest in the world.</P>
      <P>In 2002, the bone marrow registry was incorporated as a division of the Tzu Chi
Stem Cells Center, which was founded to improve research and treatment of blood
disease patients.</P>
      <P>Tzu center's registry consists of information about 350,000 potential bone
marrow donors and 11,000 units of umbilical cord blood.</P>
      <P>The data bank has provided bone marrow and stem cells in 1,428 donation cases.
The Hualien branch of Tzu Chi Hospital alone has conducted over 1,000 bone
marrow extractions from donors to help patients in hospitals around the world.</P>

      <P>A man who threw a large number of NT$1,000 bills out of a taxi on the freeway
was questioned by police in Changhua City Sunday.</P>
      <P>Police found more than NT$920,000 and some partly burned notes in two bags the
man was carrying after he was delivered to the Cihtong Police Station in
Changhua City.</P>
      <P>The man, identified only by his family name of Chen, grabbed a taxi at the
Taichung railway station and asked the driver to take him to Changhua City.</P>
      <P>As they were driving southbound on the freeway, the passenger began throwing
NT$1,000 bills out the car window on to the road, which prompted the cab driver
to take him to the police station. The police found him had lodged in a hotel in
Changhua City last night and had triggered the fire alarm for burning bills in
his room.</P>
      <P>Last Wednesday, a man who hired a taxi to go from Chiayi to Sijhih in Taipei
County, also threw money out of the window on the freeway, causing chaos when
motorists stopped their cars to pick up the discarded money.  The man who said
that the money came from the sale of a piece of his land admitted to police that
he had thrown bills out of cabs on freeway many times in different places.</P>
      <P>Since throwing waste on highway is an offence which could be fined for NT$3000
(US$88)to NT$6000 (US$176), the man was referred to the freeway police for
further questioning.</P>

      <P>The Taihua Ferry will sail four round trips between Kaohsiung and Xiamen by May
31. The ferry company estimates it will take four hours to sail from Kaohsiung
to Magong and another six hours to get from Magong to Xiamen, based on an
estimated speed of 20 knots per hour, the report said.</P>
      <P>Operators of marine passenger liners have sought to explore the possibility of
offering passenger service between Taiwan and China, as the 108 direct charter
flights per week between the two countries cannot meet the demand created by an
increase in Chinese visitor arrivals.</P>
      <P>The 7,000 tickets available for the four round-trips were snapped up by a travel
agency in Xiamen because of the cheap cost relative to airfares.</P>

      <P>Albert Yu, communications manager of World Vision Taiwan, told the CNA in an
exclusive interview that the concert, which will feature 219 indigenous children
from the charity's cultural teams around Taiwan, will bring to audiences in
Taipei the beautiful voices and vibrant aboriginal spirit of the children.</P>
      <P>Pop Diva A-mei, who is of Puyuma indigenous origin, will make a guest appearance
at the concert to sing the hymn "Little Dream" with the children, he said.</P>
      <P>"World Vision works with these children and would also like to give them an
opportunity to display their talent and indigenous culture," Yu said.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, World Vision Taiwan has established 15 cultural teams in
different indigenous communities around Taiwan since 1979, and recently  founded
the Taiwan Children's  Choir to promote indigenous music.</P>
      <P>Noting that many of the children in the choir have gone through difficult times
because of natural disasters, or are unable to attend school because of their
families' financial situation, Yu said the choir serves as a"support mechanism"
that fosters interaction among the children and helps them to bounce from
adversity.</P>
      <P>"Many of the children have been able to find relief, find an outlet for their
problems by singing and performing their indigenous songs," he said.</P>
      <P>Lead by the noted Paiwan conductor Tivulangan Talivatan, the choir will bring
the richness of the singers' heritage to audiences in Taipei through 10 songs
performed in aboriginal languages and Mandarin Chinese.</P>
      <P>Yu called on the public to join the event, saying that every paying member of
the audience will not only be treated to a fantastic performance, but will also
be providing moral and financial support to the children on stage.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan will release a DVD and CD package of the live performance
and of recorded tracks in May to raise funds for the continuation of the
program.</P>
      <P>Tickets for the concert are available on the Web site http:

    <HEADLINE>50,000 children affected by parents' joblessness: survey</HEADLINE>

      <P>At least 50,000 elementary school children have been affected by their parents'
job losses, with 20 percent of them able to afford only two meals per day,
according to the results of a survey released Monday by a child welfare group.</P>
      <P>The survey results were released as Taiwan's February jobless rate surged to a
new high of 5.75 percent, or 624,000 unemployed, due to the sputtering economy
amid the global recession.</P>
      <P>The Child Welfare League Foundation said that of the children surveyed whose
parents do not have regular jobs, 72 percent said "they are worried about the
economic situation of their families."</P>
      <P>Over 30 percent said their parents could not pay their school fees on time and
that they were unable to take part in school activities such as outside field
trips or commencement tours due to a lack of funds.</P>
      <P>In addition, 35 percent of the children said they would not be taken to visit a
doctor if they were sick.</P>
      <P>The foundation conducted the survey late last year, sending out 5,479
questionnaires to fourth, fifth and sixth graders in 22 cities and counties in
which the group provides services, with 4,487 effective questionnaires collected
-- 81.9 percent of the total. The margin of error was plus or minus two
percentage points.</P>
      <P>The results show that the underprivileged families targeted by the group
reported a jobless rate as high as 20 percent, averaging one in every five
families, or four times the national average.</P>
      <P>Foundation Executive Director Wang Yu-min said underprivileged families have in
the past been able to find short-term work such as distributing pamphlets,
dishwashing or cleaning, but with the economy yet to bottom out, even such
menial jobs are now difficult to come by.</P>
      <P>Compared with the same period of last year, he went on, underprivileged families
needing assistance from the group to find jobs increased 70 percent, while
families in need of subsides increased by 17 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou inaugurated a newly completed tunnel in central Taiwan's
Nantou County Monday that shortens the travel time between two mountain villages
from two hours to just six minutes.</P>
      <P>Ma cut a ribbon at the ceremony to mark the official opening of the 361-meter
tunnel, which is on Nantou County Highway No. 83 linking the villages of Wanfeng
and Fachih -- both located in Jenai township -- and connected with Nantou County
Highway No. 71.</P>
      <P>The aboriginal residents of both villages belong to the Bunun tribe, although
the two villages are separated by a mountain. For nearly 30 years, residents of
each village had to spend two hours making a detour through Puli township if
they wanted to visit the other settlement.</P>
      <P>Nantou Magistrate Lee Chao-ching sought help with the issue from the central
government and received NT$183 million for the project, which covers 2.16 km of
roadway, including a 90-meter bridge and the 361-meter tunnel.</P>
      <P>County government officials pointed out that the opening of the Wanfeng Tunnel
has also made sightseeing trips between Nantou County's scenic areas more
convenient.</P>
      <P>Visitors can travel from Puli to the Lushan tourist resort and to Chingjing Farm
through Wushe on the outward trip, returning through the Aowanda Forest
Recreational Park and taking Nantou County Highway No. 83 to Wanfeng village.

    <HEADLINE>Fish procreation in Kenting area effective: researcher</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
04/13/09  18:08:22
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fish procreation at the Houpihu area in the Kenting National Park in southern
Taiwan's Pingtung County has shown signs of initial progress as the number of
fish species has increased from 50 to 178 over the past four years, a specialist
said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Immersing in the sea near Houpihu, one now can see thousands of fish swimming
around, including damsel fish, five flute porgies, butterfly fish and groupers,
" said M. S. Jeng, a researcher at the Biodiversity Research Center under
Taiwan's top research institute Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>He attributed the development to a 0.5-hectare "fish- feeding zone" at the
Houpihu coastal area in Hengchun township, along with the establishment of a
marine resources conservation district in 2005 by the center in collaboration
with the Kenting National Park Administration and local diving businesses.</P>
      <P>Since then, an agreement was reached among the parties concerned allowing divers
to give bread pieces to fish in the feeding zone while banning divers from
catching fish at the zone, Jeng said.</P>
      <P>Doing so has helped lure large flocks of a wide variety of fish to the zone and
boost revenue for tourism-related businesses, according to Jeng.</P>
      <P>For 2006 alone, local diving businesses at Houpihu earned an additional NT$1
million (US$30,000), he said.</P>
      <P>However, Jeng stressed that feeding is not a correct way to attract and preserve
fish because it may easily lead fish to lose its natural ability to seek
nutrients by itself.</P>
      <P>"It is unnecessary to feed fish to preserve it if local marine resources are
rich enough," he noted.</P>
      <P>But Jeng said human efforts to protect the environment and help conserve fish
are also important. More diversified fish species and undersea resources will
also woo more tourists and increase tourism revenues, he explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a "coral reef preservation week" co-sponsored by the Kenting National
Park and the ROC (Republic of China) Society for Reef Studies kicked off Monday
with an aim of building public awareness of the importance of environmental
protection.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Traveling at the head of a 90-member group of city officials and business
executives, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu arrived in Hong Kong Monday for a five-day
visit -- the latest sign of recent efforts by Taiwan and Hong Kong to build
long-stalled relations since Taiwan-China ties have improved.</P>
      <P>Apart from calling on Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang, Secretary of the
Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau Stephan Lam and other Hong Kong
officials, Hu will also attend a forum co-sponsored Wednesday by Taichung City
and Hong Kong to boost two-way exchanges.</P>
      <P>Delegates from the two sides will discuss in the forum issues related to
stepping up cooperation between Taichung and Hong Kong in trade, commerce,
tourism, culture and city management.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Hu will take part in a "2009 Taichung tea party" organized by the
Hong Kong office of the Taipei-based Taiwan Visitors Association, and in other
activities arranged by Hong Kong tourism promotion authorities before flying
back to Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong government decided in early January to establish a forum to boost
exchanges with Taiwan's cities on a regular basis, with Taichung City selected
as its first partner.</P>
      <P>A second meeting of the "Taichung-Hong Kong city exchange forum" will be held in
Taichung City, central Taiwan in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong government hopes to further advance interactions with cities in
Taiwan through the platform set up in the forum, a spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Hu last visited Hong Kong in early January, along with three other local
government chiefs from central Taiwan -- Taichung Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng,
Changhua Magistrate Cho Po-yuan and Nantou Magistrate Lee Chao-ching.</P>
      <P>Hu said during the last visit to Hong Kong that he noticed a great change in the
Hong Kong government's attitude toward Taiwan, as Hong Kong officials he met
during public occasions all showed keen interest in improving relations with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I used to be able to meet Hong Kong officials in a private capacity only," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Hu's ongoing trip to Hong Kong follows that of Hong Kong's Home Affairs
Secretary Tsang Tak-sing, who visited Taipei March 31-April 2 for an
international Buddhist forum. He was the first senior Hong Kong official to
visit Taiwan since Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China.</P>
      <P>Analysts have told reporters recently that Hong Kong's hands had been tied in
terms of building relations with Taiwan during the eight-years of tense
relations between Beijing and Taipei under former Taiwanese president Chen Shui-
bian's rule.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and China have significantly improved since Taiwan's
resident Ma Ying-jeou came into office in May last year. Hong Kong,  a British
colony until 1997, is a special administrative region of China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Quarantine, IPR on agricultural products to be included in ECFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
04/13/09  18:48:34
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In any cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact talks that take place in the future,
topics concerning agricultural affairs will focus on quarantine and relevant
testing of livestock and plants, as well as intellectual property rights (IPR)
protection for Taiwanese agricultural products, the vice minister of the
Cabinet-level Council of Agricultural Affairs (COA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu-tsai made the remarks at a meeting held by the Legislative Yuan
Economics Committee with the authorities who are working  on the proposed
signing of a cross-strait  economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>In a briefing to the committee on the COA's preparations for talks with China on
the proposed pact, Huang pointed out that as China is listed as an affected area
for many insect pests that affect fruit, as well as avian influenza and foot-
and-mouth disease, Taiwan must ensure that such pests and diseases are not
imported via cross-strait trading channels.</P>
      <P>The two sides of the strait must establish a mutual reporting system for plant
and animal disease outbreaks, and other operational mechanisms involving
quarantine examination and investigation, as well as procedures for negotiations
concerning the export and import of agricultural products, he said.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that the council will do all it can to protect Taiwan's
agricultural benefits during the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration has been working to promote the signing
of an ECFA with China, reasoning that when China enters a free trade arrangement
with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries -- the
so-called ASEAN Plus One scheduled to be established in 2010 -- tariffs on 93
percent of the products traded among the pact signatories will be removed.</P>
      <P>To avoid Taiwan being marginalized by this development -- as it would not be
involved in any ASEAN tariff reductions -- the government has been heavily
promoting the ECFA, in spite of strong protests by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, which is against any signing of such an agreement with China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same meeting, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said
that only once the two sides of the Taiwan Strait achieve common consensus on
the proposed ECFA will it be time for them to decide the actual content of such
a pact.</P>
      <P>Such a content finalization "would be soon, maybe in one or two months" after
they begin studying the proposal together, according to Yiin.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to questions by Legislator Ting Shou-Chung of
the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The two sides began a three-month period of individual studies last month on the
proposed ECFA, a precursor to the stage of joint research, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>During the individual study stage, Yiin noted, the government is trying to
exchange views on details of the proposal with its Chinese counterpart on every
possible occasion, including international conferences and academic workshops.</P>
      <P>He further said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has entrusted the
Taipei-based  Chung-Hua Institution  for Economic Research to review the latest
research and assessments involving the proposed cross-strait cooperation
agreement.</P>
      <P>The government "will not just take the positive aspects into consideration but
will also consider the possible negative effects" of such an economic
cooperation pact, he added.</P>
      <P>When the two sides reach the stage of forging an agreement, they will conduct
the signing on the negotiation platform of their respective  intermediary
bodies --  Taiwan's  Straits Exchange Foundation and the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits -- under the World Trade
Organization framework, Yiin stated.</P>
      <P>He also revealed that ECFA activities will start with trading in commodities.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA, six stages must be completed before an ECFA with China
can be put into effect,  including  separate assessments by each side, a joint
assessment, negotiations, the signing of the agreement,  legislative  approval
and finally, implementation.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Chuang Chia-jung and India's Sania Mirza exacted a small measure of
revenge Sunday when they defeated top seeds Czech Kveta Peschke and American
Lisa Raymond to capture the MPS Group Championships women's doubles in Ponte
Vedra Beach, Florida.</P>
      <P>Chuang and Mirza were ousted by Peschke and Raymond from the seminfinals of the
Sony Ericsson Open in two tight sets in early April, but returned the favor
Sunday in a tense 6-3, 4-6, 10-7 victory.</P>
      <P>It was Chuang's 11th career doubles title on the WTA tour, but her first with a
non-Taiwanese partner.</P>
      <P>Chuang is best known for her partnership with compatriot Chan Yung-jen on the
"Golden Doubles Team" that reached the finals of the Australian Open and U.S.
Open women's doubles in 2007 and won seven WTA Tour events from 2007 to 2008.</P>
      <P>But after having their dreams of an Olympic medal extinguished in the second
round of the Beijing Summer Games and losing in the first run of the 2008 U.S.
Open, the two split.</P>
      <P>Chuang then successfully teamed with compatriot Hsieh Su-wei at the end of 2008
to win one tour event in Seoul and a lower tier ITF event in Taipei, but in 2009
she has stuck with foreign partners, first Sun Tiantian of China at the
Australian Open, then Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan and now Mirza, who seems
to be the best fit.</P>
      <P>Playing for only the third time together, the unseeded duo knocked out the
tournament's first and fourth seeds and showed the ability to raise their games
in the clutch, winning two super tiebreakers in their four matches during the
week.</P>
      <P>Against Peschke and Raymond, Chuang and Mirza quickly jumped to a 5-1 lead in
the first-to-10 super tiebreaker and were able to hold on after their opponents
pulled to within 7-6 to capture the title, which earned them a total of
US$11,000 and 280 ranking points each.</P>
      <P>The victory propelled Chuang up to No. 14 in the women's doubles rankings, after
having fallen to No. 19 earlier this year. Her career-high ranking is No. 5,

      <P>A man who illegally cast more than NT$2 million (US$60,000) worth of cash notes
on freeways in Taiwan told police Monday he did it to get rid of evil spirits
that had been haunting him.</P>
      <P>The man, identified only by his family name Chen, told police that he had
discarded at least NT$2 million because he was "possessed by ghosts."</P>
      <P>Many motorists who saw him throwing out money stopped their cars on the freeways
to try to pick up the cash.</P>
      <P>He said he obtained the money after selling an apartment in the Neihu district
of Taipei City for NT$10 million (US$300,000).</P>
      <P>Chen was arrested Sunday and handed to Changhua  District Prosecutors Office
Monday on charges of hindering public security and destroying national notes.</P>
      <P>Chen was found to have another NT$2.44 million in cash notes with him after
police tracked him down Sunday at a Changhua City restaurant. Police later found
that he had burned cash notes worth about NT$500,000 at a hotel, where he had
checked into a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Chen acknowledged to police that he was the man caught in the act by a local
cable TV station which showed in its film on April 7 a man throwing out scores
of NT$1,000 cash notes from within a taxi traveling on Freeway No. 1 from Chiayi
County to Sijhih in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Chen told police that he did so because he was in a bad mood. He admitted having
flung money onto freeways several times before in various parts of Taiwan,
including Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Chiayi, and Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>He was arrested after a taxi driver carrying him on his last money-purging
episode in Taichung City called the police. The taxi driver had seen news
reports about a man throwing out money on a freeway and suspected Chen was the
man.</P>
      <P>As Chen rambled nonsensically during police questioning, police said they
suspected he suffers from mental illness.</P>
      <P>Ironically, he has a 78-year-old mother who is not doing well financially and
still needs to work odd jobs to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>Police rejected the finders keepers belief and said anyone they find who has
picked up the cash will be ordered to return it. So far no one has come forward
with any of the money.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cloud Gate Dance Theatre formally gets permanent home</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Homeless for more than a year, Taiwan's internationally renowned Cloud Gate
Dance Theatre has secured a new base of operations after an agreement was
reached that will allow the troupe to use a vacated office complex in Danshui,
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The contract was signed by Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei, Cloud Gate
Dance Foundation Chairwoman Shen Hsueh-yung and Cloud Gate Dance Theatre founder
Lin Hwai-min.</P>
      <P>The troupe has been homeless since a pre-dawn fire destroyed its rehearsal
studio, warehouse and production archives on Feb. 11, 2008.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the fire, Chou offered to provide the unused former Radio Taiwan
International (RTI) complex in Danshui Township to Cloud Gate to rebuild its
rehearsal studio.</P>
      <P>The plan quickly ran into roadblocks, however, because there was no legal basis
allowing the county government to permit a private group to use a vacant public
property.</P>
      <P>As a result, both the county government and the dance troupe have undergone a
cumbersome process rife with paperwork to complete the transfer.</P>
      <P>In line with the provisions of an act that encourages the private sector to
invest in public infrastructure construction, the county government mounted an
open tender last year for the Cloud Gate Dance Foundation, which operates Cloud
Gate Dance Theatre and its offshoot Cloud Gate 2, to bid to manage the unused
complex.</P>
      <P>The strict legal screening procedures were finally completed last week, paving
the way for the signing of the contract Monday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Chou urged the central government to enact a law as
soon as possible to facilitate the transfer of unused public properties to
performing arts groups or other artistic organizations for their use.</P>
      <P>"Only by so doing can we boost the development of creative cultural  industries,
" Chou said,  adding that the year-long commercial-style bidding process the
Cloud Gate experienced was actually an insult to the world acclaimed troupe.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Lin said the stringent legal procedure was
"painful" yet memorable because it has provided enormous opportunities for the
troupe to learn.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the complex will be renamed the Danshui Arts Education Center.</P>
      <P>"It will be a great challenge for Cloud Gate to manage the new center, " said
Lin, who hoped that the troupe will be able to thrive at the new center and get
a 10-year extension after its current 40-year contract expires.</P>
      <P>The two-story, square concrete building on a hillside above Hobe Fort and
overlooking the Danshui River and the town of Bali across the river, will need
fair amount of work before the company can move in, including the construction
of a dance floor.</P>
      <P>But there are large open rooms on both floors that could easily be turned into
dance and rehearsal studios and several small rooms than could be converted into
offices for the costume, design and production crews.</P>

      <P>There were 34.43 million computer virus attacks reported in the first quarter in
Taiwan, according to a report released Monday by the local chapter of a global
network for computer surveillance and attack prevention.</P>
      <P>The first quarter number reached 47 percent of total number of cases last year
and represented a 297 percent rise compared to the same period a year earlier.</P>
      <P>The number was also 9.79 percent higher than in the fourth quarter of 2008,
according to the report conducted by the Global Anti-virus Research and Support
Center of TrendLabs -- a branch of Trend Micro's global network committed to
computer virus threat surveillance.</P>
      <P>The Asian region has been fallen particularly vulnerable to self-executing
malicious software due to the popularity of the use of USB flash drives, said
Samson Tai, a TrendLabs senior technical adviser.</P>
      <P>Of the 10 most common computer viruses that occurred in the first quarter, the
top two were USB-related, he added.</P>
      <P>Tai advised computer users to switch off the self-executing directive by
pressing theShiftkey when connecting USB flash drives to computers to avoid
activating virus-affected files.</P>
      <P>Users can also disable auto-play functions by right clicking the USB drives and

    <HEADLINE>Legislature proposes to disallow political status language in ECFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislature's Economics Committee passed several proposals related to a
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, including
one that would bar language on the political status of Taiwan and China from the
deal.</P>
      <P>Terms such as "one-China principle" and "1992 Consensus, " as well as "giving up
anti-dumping and anti-compensatory subsidization" which is part of the China-
Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), would not be allowed
to be included in the ECFA, according to the proposal.</P>
      <P>The "1992 Consensus" refers to an understanding the ruling Kuomintang claims was
reached in Hong Kong in 1992 between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait that
there is only one China, but with both sides free to make their own
interpretations of what "one China" actually means.</P>
      <P>On Monday the Economics Committee invited agencies working on the proposed
framework agreement to discuss their preparations for the drafting of the pact.</P>
      <P>The meeting triggered heated debate among lawmakers on the briefing given by
ranking officials from the Council of Economic Planning and Development, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Council of Agriculture, and the Mainland
Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>After the question-and-answer session, the committee voted on a total of 14
proposals related to the ECFA, with several given the green light.</P>
      <P>One of the proposals passed would require the government, before any deal is
signed, to hold talks with representatives of the domestic industrial sectors
that are likely to be hurt by the framework agreement</P>
      <P>The government would have to evaluate the ECFA's possible impact on vulnerable
industrial sectors -- including towels, shoes, bedding, and ceramic and
porcelain ware -- and work out measures to compensate the businesses that would
suffer from the signing of the agreemnet.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang  lawmakers  also proposed to request the Executive Yuan to
include Taiwan's petroleum, textile, and precision machinery exports among the
items for which Chinese tariff reductions will be discussed under the Early
Harvest section of the framework agreement.</P>
      <P>Other proposals include asking the government to continue efforts to sign
agreements with other countries to help Taiwan join the global trading network
and attract international companies to use Taiwan as their East Asian investment
platform.</P>
      <P>The government should also take efforts to promote the signing of free trade
agreements (FTAs) with Taiwan's major trade partners, such as the United States,
Japan and Singapore, and should also insist on the principle of not having the
country's sovereignty belittled, the legislators proposed.</P>
      <P>Also passed were measures to not allow Chinese workers into Taiwan and not
expand the number of agricultural items that can be imported from China.</P>
      <P>The Economics Committee, however, did not approve proposals by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party that would require the government to organize a
referendum on the ECFA, to ask for Beijing's public promise not to block
Taiwan's signing of FTAs with other economies,  and to not engage  in
controversial  comprehensive cross-strait framework talks.</P>

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui will visit Japan next month on a trip that will be
devoted entirely to sightseeing, his staff said Monday.</P>
      <P>The staff said the former president will not call on any Japanese political
figures and that his trip is mainly aimed at completing the visit of the Oku No
Hosomich (The Narrow Road to the Deep North), the title of famed haiku poet
Matsuo Basho's most famous work, a poem-filled travelogue through Japan's remote
northeastern region of Tohoku.</P>
      <P>They noted that during Lee's visit of Japan in May 2007, he only completed half
of the 2,400-kilogram trail, and he expressed the hope at the time of revisiting
Japan to complete the entire journey, his staff added.</P>
      <P>According to the initial itinerary, Lee is scheduled to depart from Taipei for
Fukuoka, on the northern shore of the island of Kyushu, May 31, and later
transfer to Niigata in northern Japan via domestic flight. He will then travel
southward to complete the trail and return home via Nagoya June 7.</P>
      <P>Lee, 86, will be accompanied by his wife during the visit.</P>
      <P>Basho (1644-1694) is generally regarded as Japan's greatest haiku poet, largely
responsible for creating the art form with its 5-7-5 syllable syntax.</P>
      <P>One of the most famous travelogues ever, the Narrow Road continues to inspire
Japanese art and draws visitors to Tohoku (northeast), and each of the places
Basho visited continues to revere his poems and observations.</P>
      <P>In Basho's day, the land of Oku, literally "Within," was a place where farmers
eked out a meager living and bandits and hermits roamed in the mountains.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) expressed hope Monday that an
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China will be
formally included on the agenda of the fourth round of talks between their top
negotiators.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Chao Chien-min made the statement in a briefing to the
Legislative  Yuan's Economics  Committee  on the MAC's preparations for talks
with China on the proposed pact.</P>
      <P>He said the council will first seek Beijing's agreement to allow the ECFA to be
one of the topics in the upcoming third round of talks between Taiwan's Chiang
Pin-kung, chairman of the quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, and his
Chinese counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>Chao also rejected claims that a framework agreement would harm Taiwan's
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Chao said Taiwan and China signed six agreements in 2008, and none touched on
the controversial topic of sovereignty or used sensitive political language.</P>
      <P>He said he believes that when the two sides act to forge other agreements, such
as the ECFA, they will still continue to sign the deals in the same spirit and
with the same self-restraint, he noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>German wind power company suspends plans to invest in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Germany's InfraVest Wind Power Co. said Monday it will not make any further
investment in Taiwan's wind power development projects unless the government
comes up with concrete action in support of its policy to develop renewable
energy.</P>
      <P>Karl-Eugen Feifel, chairman of InfraVest, told a press conference that the
company will put on hold its plans for a further investment of more than 500
million euros in the next five years because it is not sure of the government's
determination to tap renewable energy sources.</P>
      <P>InfraVest is based in Taipei and has offices in Taichung, Changhua, and Miaoli.
It also has offices in China, Turkey, Brazil, and Germany.</P>
      <P>The company has already invested 300 million euros (US$398.46 million) in Taiwan
since its inception in 1999 and has built 88 giant wind turbines on Taiwan's
west coast between Miaoli and Changhua.</P>
      <P>He said that if it becomes certain by the end of this year that Infra Vest will
scrap all its investment plans in Taiwan, the company will still leave some of
its engineers behind to keep the wind turbines running.</P>
      <P>Feifel called for a change in the measures that allow state-owned Taiwan Power
Co. to purchase wind power from the private sector at an "unreasonable" price of
NT$2 per kilowatt-hour -- lower than the production cost of NT$2.6 per kilowatt-
hour.</P>
      <P>He also urged the Ministry of Economic Affairs to simplify the procedure for
screening applications to build new wind farms.</P>
      <P>Feifel expressed disappointment at the lack of progress the Legislative Yuan has
made in passing the Renewable Energy Development Bill.</P>
      <P>He said he had discussed the issue with senior energy officials numerous times
in the past 16 legislative sessions and that each time he was told that the bill
would be passed "in this session."</P>
      <P>Noting that the current legislative session is the third one under the new
Kuomintang government, Wang Yun-yi, deputy manager of InfraVest, said, "If the
law fails to get passed this time, it probably will never be passed in the
future."</P>
      <P>Wang Yun-ming, deputy director-general of the Bureau of Energy under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, affirmed that the government will continue to
support the development of wind power.</P>
      <P>He said that a new formula will be proposed to set a more reasonable price for
buying wind power from the private sector.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has set a goal to draw 10 percent of its electricity capacity from
renewable energy sources by 2010, and that wind power will make up 80 percent of
the 10 percent of the renewable energy.</P>

      <P>The  Environmental  Protection Administration  (EPA)  launched  a "green
living,  sustainable consumption" publicity campaign Monday to celebrate this
year's April 22 Earth Day and June 5 World Environment Day.</P>
      <P>"Starting Monday and lasting until June 30, the Cabinet-level agency will
collaborate with several retail chains and environmental protection bureaus in
cities and counties around the country to promote green purchasing and
sustainable consumption, " said EPA Minister Stephen Shen at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Noting that green purchasing means conservation of energy and reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions, Shen said the EPA intends to make the period an
"environmental protection season" to enhance public awareness of the importance
of maintaining the health of the planet.</P>
      <P>During the period from April 13-June 5, Shen said, consumers are encouraged to
purchase Earth-friendly products, particularly those which are efficient in
energy, water, and electricity consumption and low in carbon dioxide emmissions.</P>
      <P>To expand green purchasing from the government into the private sector, Shen
said, the EPA helped encourage 1,088 private enterprises and civic groups to
make NT$2.2 billion worth of green purchases in 2008, tripling the amount
recorded in 2007.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the EPA publicly honored the 18 companies and civic groups that
purchased more than NT$20 million worth of Earth-friendly products last year.</P>
      <P>Two hypermarts -- Far Eastern Geant and Carrefour -- will sponsor special trade
fairs in the coming weeks to lend support to the EPA's "green living,
sustainable consumption" campaign.</P>
      <P>From April 15 through April 28, Far Eastern Geant will market a selection of
Earth-friendly goods, and consumers who purchase more than NT$200 worth of those
products can take part in a lucky draw that offers many big prizes.</P>
      <P>Carrefour will launch a "one day volunteer" program on May 30 to clean up
neighborhoods or living environments. From May 1-30, consumers who purchase
Earth-friendly goods at its stroes can join a draw to win air conditioners.</P>

      <P>The local chapter of an international charity called on the public Monday to
give moral and financial support to the aboriginal children who make up its
Taiwan Children's Choir, as the group prepares to stage its first concert April
18 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Albert Yu, communications manager of World Vision Taiwan, told the CNA in an
exclusive interview that the concert, which will feature 219 indigenous children
from the charity's cultural teams around Taiwan, will bring to audiences in
Taipei the beautiful voices and vibrant aboriginal spirit of the children.</P>
      <P>Pop Diva A-mei, who is of Puyuma indigenous origin, will make a guest appearance
at the concert to sing the hymn "Little Dream" with the children, he said.</P>
      <P>"World Vision works with these children and would also like to give them an
opportunity to display their talent and indigenous culture," Yu said.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, World Vision Taiwan has established 15 cultural teams in
different indigenous communities around Taiwan since 1979, and recently  founded
the Taiwan Children's  Choir to promote indigenous music.</P>
      <P>Noting that many of the children in the choir have gone through difficult times
because of natural disasters, or are unable to attend school because of their
families' financial situation, Yu said the choir serves as a"support mechanism"
that fosters interaction among the children and helps them to bounce from
adversity.</P>
      <P>"Many of the children have been able to find relief, find an outlet for their
problems by singing and performing their indigenous songs," he said.</P>
      <P>Lead by the noted Paiwan conductor Tivulangan Talivatan, the choir will bring
the richness of the singers' heritage to audiences in Taipei through 10 songs
performed in aboriginal languages and Mandarin Chinese.</P>
      <P>Yu called on the public to join the event, saying that every paying member of
the audience will not only be treated to a fantastic performance, but will also
be providing moral and financial support to the children on stage.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan will release a DVD and CD package of the live performance
and of recorded tracks in May to raise funds for the continuation of the
program.</P>

      <P>At least 50,000 elementary school children have been affected by their parents'
job losses, with 20 percent of them able to afford only two meals per day,
according to the results of a survey released Monday by a child welfare group.</P>
      <P>The survey results were released as Taiwan's February jobless rate surged to a
new high of 5.75 percent, or 624,000 unemployed, due to the sputtering economy
amid the global recession.</P>
      <P>The Child Welfare League Foundation said that of the children surveyed whose
parents do not have regular jobs, 72 percent said "they are worried about the
economic situation of their families."</P>
      <P>Over 30 percent said their parents could not pay their school fees on time and
that they were unable to take part in school activities such as outside field
trips or commencement tours due to a lack of funds.</P>
      <P>In addition, 35 percent of the children said they would not be taken to visit a
doctor if they were sick.</P>
      <P>The foundation conducted the survey late last year, sending out 5,479
questionnaires to fourth, fifth and sixth graders in 22 cities and counties in
which the group provides services, with 4,487 effective questionnaires collected
-- 81.9 percent of the total. The margin of error was plus or minus two
percentage points.</P>
      <P>The results show that the underprivileged families targeted by the group
reported a jobless rate as high as 20 percent, averaging one in every five
families, or four times the national average.</P>
      <P>Foundation Executive Director Wang Yu-min said underprivileged families have in
the past been able to find short-term work such as distributing pamphlets,
dishwashing or cleaning, but with the economy yet to bottom out, even such
menial jobs are now difficult to come by.</P>
      <P>Compared with the same period of last year, he went on, underprivileged families
needing assistance from the group to find jobs increased 70 percent, while
families in need of subsides increased by 17 percent.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou inaugurated a newly completed tunnel in central Taiwan's
Nantou County Monday that shortens the travel time between two mountain villages
from two hours to just six minutes.</P>
      <P>Ma cut a ribbon at the ceremony to mark the official opening of the 361-meter
tunnel, which is on Nantou County Highway No. 83 linking the villages of Wanfeng
and Fachih -- both located in Jenai township -- and connected with Nantou County
Highway No. 71.</P>
      <P>The aboriginal residents of both villages belong to the Bunun tribe, although
the two villages are separated by a mountain. For nearly 30 years, residents of
each village had to spend two hours making a detour through Puli township if
they wanted to visit the other settlement.</P>
      <P>Nantou Magistrate Lee Chao-ching sought help with the issue from the central
government and received NT$183 million for the project, which covers 2.16 km of
roadway, including a 90-meter bridge and the 361-meter tunnel.</P>
      <P>County government officials pointed out that the opening of the Wanfeng Tunnel
has also made sightseeing trips between Nantou County's scenic areas more
convenient.</P>
      <P>Visitors can travel from Puli to the Lushan tourist resort and to Chingjing Farm
through Wushe on the outward trip, returning through the Aowanda Forest
Recreational Park and taking Nantou County Highway No. 83 to Wanfeng village.
From there, they can go through the new tunnel to Fachih village and then take
Nantou County Highway No. 71 back to Puli, the officials said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fish procreation in Kenting area effective: researcher</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fish procreation at the Houpihu area in the Kenting National Park in southern
Taiwan's Pingtung County has shown signs of initial progress as the number of
fish species has increased from 50 to 178 over the past four years, a specialist
said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Immersing in the sea near Houpihu, one now can see thousands of fish swimming
around, including damsel fish, five flute porgies, butterfly fish and groupers,
" said M. S. Jeng, a researcher at the Biodiversity Research Center under
Taiwan's top research institute Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>He attributed the development to a 0.5-hectare "fish- feeding zone" at the
Houpihu coastal area in Hengchun township, along with the establishment of a
marine resources conservation district in 2005 by the center in collaboration
with the Kenting National Park Administration and local diving businesses.</P>
      <P>Since then, an agreement was reached among the parties concerned allowing divers
to give bread pieces to fish in the feeding zone while banning divers from
catching fish at the zone, Jeng said.</P>
      <P>Doing so has helped lure large flocks of a wide variety of fish to the zone and
boost revenue for tourism-related businesses, according to Jeng.</P>
      <P>For 2006 alone, local diving businesses at Houpihu earned an additional NT$1
million (US$30,000), he said.</P>
      <P>However, Jeng stressed that feeding is not a correct way to attract and preserve
fish because it may easily lead fish to lose its natural ability to seek
nutrients by itself.</P>
      <P>"It is unnecessary to feed fish to preserve it if local marine resources are
rich enough," he noted.</P>
      <P>But Jeng said human efforts to protect the environment and help conserve fish
are also important. More diversified fish species and undersea resources will
also woo more tourists and increase tourism revenues, he explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a "coral reef preservation week" co-sponsored by the Kenting National
Park and the ROC (Republic of China) Society for Reef Studies kicked off Monday
with an aim of building public awareness of the importance of environmental
protection.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Traveling at the head of a 90-member group of city officials and business
executives, Taichung Mayor Jason Hu arrived in Hong Kong Monday for a five-day
visit -- the latest sign of recent efforts by Taiwan and Hong Kong to build
long-stalled relations since Taiwan-China ties have improved.</P>
      <P>Apart from calling on Hong Kong Chief Executive Donald Tsang, Secretary of the
Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau Stephan Lam and other Hong Kong
officials, Hu will also attend a forum co-sponsored Wednesday by Taichung City
and Hong Kong to boost two-way exchanges.</P>
      <P>Delegates from the two sides will discuss in the forum issues related to
stepping up cooperation between Taichung and Hong Kong in trade, commerce,
tourism, culture and city management.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Hu will take part in a "2009 Taichung tea party" organized by the
Hong Kong office of the Taipei-based Taiwan Visitors Association, and in other
activities arranged by Hong Kong tourism promotion authorities before flying
back to Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong government decided in early January to establish a forum to boost
exchanges with Taiwan's cities on a regular basis, with Taichung City selected
as its first partner.</P>
      <P>A second meeting of the "Taichung-Hong Kong city exchange forum" will be held in
Taichung City, central Taiwan in the coming months.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong government hopes to further advance interactions with cities in
Taiwan through the platform set up in the forum, a spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Hu last visited Hong Kong in early January, along with three other local
government chiefs from central Taiwan -- Taichung Magistrate Huang Chung-sheng,
Changhua Magistrate Cho Po-yuan and Nantou Magistrate Lee Chao-ching.</P>
      <P>Hu said during the last visit to Hong Kong that he noticed a great change in the
Hong Kong government's attitude toward Taiwan, as Hong Kong officials he met
during public occasions all showed keen interest in improving relations with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I used to be able to meet Hong Kong officials in a private capacity only," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Hu's ongoing trip to Hong Kong follows that of Hong Kong's Home Affairs
Secretary Tsang Tak-sing, who visited Taipei March 31-April 2 for an
international Buddhist forum. He was the first senior Hong Kong official to
visit Taiwan since Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China.</P>
      <P>Analysts have told reporters recently that Hong Kong's hands had been tied in
terms of building relations with Taiwan during the eight-years of tense
relations between Beijing and Taipei under former Taiwanese president Chen Shui-
bian's rule.</P>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and China have significantly improved since Taiwan's
resident Ma Ying-jeou came into office in May last year. Hong Kong,  a British
colony until 1997, is a special administrative region of China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Quarantine, IPR on agricultural products to be included in ECFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
04/13/09  18:48:34
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In any cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact talks that take place in the future,
topics concerning agricultural affairs will focus on quarantine and relevant
testing of livestock and plants, as well as intellectual property rights (IPR)
protection for Taiwanese agricultural products, the vice minister of the
Cabinet-level Council of Agricultural Affairs (COA) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu-tsai made the remarks at a meeting held by the Legislative Yuan
Economics Committee with the authorities who are working  on the proposed
signing of a cross-strait  economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>In a briefing to the committee on the COA's preparations for talks with China on
the proposed pact, Huang pointed out that as China is listed as an affected area
for many insect pests that affect fruit, as well as avian influenza and foot-
and-mouth disease, Taiwan must ensure that such pests and diseases are not
imported via cross-strait trading channels.</P>
      <P>The two sides of the strait must establish a mutual reporting system for plant
and animal disease outbreaks, and other operational mechanisms involving
quarantine examination and investigation, as well as procedures for negotiations
concerning the export and import of agricultural products, he said.</P>
      <P>Huang stressed that the council will do all it can to protect Taiwan's
agricultural benefits during the ECFA talks.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's administration has been working to promote the signing
of an ECFA with China, reasoning that when China enters a free trade arrangement
with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member countries -- the
so-called ASEAN Plus One scheduled to be established in 2010 -- tariffs on 93
percent of the products traded among the pact signatories will be removed.</P>
      <P>To avoid Taiwan being marginalized by this development -- as it would not be
involved in any ASEAN tariff reductions -- the government has been heavily
promoting the ECFA, in spite of strong protests by the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, which is against any signing of such an agreement with China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same meeting, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said
that only once the two sides of the Taiwan Strait achieve common consensus on
the proposed ECFA will it be time for them to decide the actual content of such
a pact.</P>
      <P>Such a content finalization "would be soon, maybe in one or two months" after
they begin studying the proposal together, according to Yiin.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks in response to questions by Legislator Ting Shou-Chung of
the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The two sides began a three-month period of individual studies last month on the
proposed ECFA, a precursor to the stage of joint research, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>During the individual study stage, Yiin noted, the government is trying to
exchange views on details of the proposal with its Chinese counterpart on every
possible occasion, including international conferences and academic workshops.</P>
      <P>He further said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has entrusted the
Taipei-based  Chung-Hua Institution  for Economic Research to review the latest
research and assessments involving the proposed cross-strait cooperation
agreement.</P>
      <P>The government "will not just take the positive aspects into consideration but
will also consider the possible negative effects" of such an economic
cooperation pact, he added.</P>
      <P>When the two sides reach the stage of forging an agreement, they will conduct
the signing on the negotiation platform of their respective  intermediary
bodies --  Taiwan's  Straits Exchange Foundation and the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits -- under the World Trade
Organization framework, Yiin stated.</P>
      <P>He also revealed that ECFA activities will start with trading in commodities.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA, six stages must be completed before an ECFA with China
can be put into effect,  including  separate assessments by each side, a joint
assessment, negotiations, the signing of the agreement,  legislative  approval
and finally, implementation.</P>

      <P>The public satisfaction level with quality of life has risen by 12.2 percentage
points compared with figures compiled in a survey carried out a year ago,
according to the latest survey results released Monday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission targeted 19
areas to be tackled by the survey, conducted nearly one year after the May 20
inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>Overall, 69.9 percent of the respondents said they were satisfied with their
quality of life, up 12.2 percent from last year's survey.</P>
      <P>In comparison, 26.5 percent said they were dissatisfied, down by around 5
percentage points from the previous year.</P>
      <P>The top four areas to receive  the greatest  degrees  of satisfaction were
listed as clean environment around the home (80.1 percent), convenient transport
around the home (79.9 percent) , the ability of water drainage systems around
the home to cope with flood conditions (78.1 percent), and family life (77.9
percent).</P>
      <P>The survey also found that the respondents were dissatisfied with the life-long
learning environment (25.2 percent), the amount and quality of social activities
available (31.2 percent), current working conditions (45.7 percent), and the
education environment for students (45.4 percent).</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted around the country March 24-25 and collected 1,080
effective samples with an error margin of plus or minus 3 percent.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Chuang Chia-jung and India's Sania Mirza exacted a small measure of
revenge Sunday when they defeated top seeds Czech Kveta Peschke and American
Lisa Raymond to capture the MPS Group Championships women's doubles in Ponte
Vedra Beach, Florida.</P>
      <P>Chuang and Mirza were ousted by Peschke and Raymond from the seminfinals of the
Sony Ericsson Open in two tight sets in early April, but returned the favor
Sunday in a tense 6-3, 4-6, 10-7 victory.</P>
      <P>It was Chuang's 11th career doubles title on the WTA tour, but her first with a
non-Taiwanese partner.</P>
      <P>Chuang is best known for her partnership with compatriot Chan Yung-jen on the
"Golden Doubles Team" that reached the finals of the Australian Open and U.S.
Open women's doubles in 2007 and won seven WTA Tour events from 2007 to 2008.</P>
      <P>But after having their dreams of an Olympic medal extinguished in the second
round of the Beijing Summer Games and losing in the first run of the 2008 U.S.
Open, the two split.</P>
      <P>Chuang then successfully teamed with compatriot Hsieh Su-wei at the end of 2008
to win one tour event in Seoul and a lower tier ITF event in Taipei, but in 2009
she has stuck with foreign partners, first Sun Tiantian of China at the
Australian Open, then Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan and now Mirza, who seems
to be the best fit.</P>
      <P>Playing for only the third time together, the unseeded duo knocked out the
tournament's first and fourth seeds and showed the ability to raise their games
in the clutch, winning two super tiebreakers in their four matches during the
week.</P>
      <P>Against Peschke and Raymond, Chuang and Mirza quickly jumped to a 5-1 lead in
the first-to-10 super tiebreaker and were able to hold on after their opponents
pulled to within 7-6 to capture the title, which earned them a total of
US$11,000 and 280 ranking points each.</P>
      <P>The victory propelled Chuang up to No. 14 in the women's doubles rankings, after
having fallen to No. 19 earlier this year. Her career-high ranking is No. 5,
achieved in mid-August 2008.</P>

      <P>A man who illegally cast more than NT$2 million (US$60,000) worth of cash notes
on freeways in Taiwan told police Monday he did it to get rid of evil spirits
that had been haunting him.</P>
      <P>The man, identified only by his family name Chen, told police that he had
discarded at least NT$2 million because he was "possessed by ghosts."</P>
      <P>Many motorists who saw him throwing out money stopped their cars on the freeways
to try to pick up the cash.</P>
      <P>He said he obtained the money after selling an apartment in the Neihu district
of Taipei City for NT$10 million (US$300,000).</P>
      <P>Chen was arrested Sunday and handed to Changhua  District Prosecutors Office
Monday on charges of hindering public security and destroying national notes.</P>
      <P>Chen was found to have another NT$2.44 million in cash notes with him after
police tracked him down Sunday at a Changhua City restaurant. Police later found
that he had burned cash notes worth about NT$500,000 at a hotel, where he had
checked into a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Chen acknowledged to police that he was the man caught in the act by a local
cable TV station which showed in its film on April 7 a man throwing out scores
of NT$1,000 cash notes from within a taxi traveling on Freeway No. 1 from Chiayi
County to Sijhih in Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Chen told police that he did so because he was in a bad mood. He admitted having
flung money onto freeways several times before in various parts of Taiwan,
including Taipei, Kaohsiung, Taichung, Chiayi, and Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>He was arrested after a taxi driver carrying him on his last money-purging
episode in Taichung City called the police. The taxi driver had seen news
reports about a man throwing out money on a freeway and suspected Chen was the
man.</P>
      <P>As Chen rambled nonsensically during police questioning, police said they
suspected he suffers from mental illness.</P>
      <P>Ironically, he has a 78-year-old mother who is not doing well financially and
still needs to work odd jobs to make ends meet.</P>
      <P>Police rejected the finders keepers belief and said anyone they find who has
picked up the cash will be ordered to return it. So far no one has come forward
with any of the money.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Homeless for more than a year, Taiwan's internationally renowned Cloud Gate
Dance Theatre has secured a new base of operations after an agreement was
reached that will allow the troupe to use a vacated office complex in Danshui,
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The contract was signed by Taipei County Magistrate Chou Hsi-wei, Cloud Gate
Dance Foundation Chairwoman Shen Hsueh-yung and Cloud Gate Dance Theatre founder
Lin Hwai-min.</P>
      <P>The troupe has been homeless since a pre-dawn fire destroyed its rehearsal
studio, warehouse and production archives on Feb. 11, 2008.</P>
      <P>Shortly after the fire, Chou offered to provide the unused former Radio Taiwan
International (RTI) complex in Danshui Township to Cloud Gate to rebuild its
rehearsal studio.</P>
      <P>The plan quickly ran into roadblocks, however, because there was no legal basis
allowing the county government to permit a private group to use a vacant public
property.</P>
      <P>As a result, both the county government and the dance troupe have undergone a
cumbersome process rife with paperwork to complete the transfer.</P>
      <P>In line with the provisions of an act that encourages the private sector to
invest in public infrastructure construction, the county government mounted an
open tender last year for the Cloud Gate Dance Foundation, which operates Cloud
Gate Dance Theatre and its offshoot Cloud Gate 2, to bid to manage the unused
complex.</P>
      <P>The strict legal screening procedures were finally completed last week, paving
the way for the signing of the contract Monday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Chou urged the central government to enact a law as
soon as possible to facilitate the transfer of unused public properties to
performing arts groups or other artistic organizations for their use.</P>
      <P>"Only by so doing can we boost the development of creative cultural  industries,
" Chou said,  adding that the year-long commercial-style bidding process the
Cloud Gate experienced was actually an insult to the world acclaimed troupe.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Lin said the stringent legal procedure was
"painful" yet memorable because it has provided enormous opportunities for the
troupe to learn.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the complex will be renamed the Danshui Arts Education Center.</P>
      <P>"It will be a great challenge for Cloud Gate to manage the new center, " said
Lin, who hoped that the troupe will be able to thrive at the new center and get
a 10-year extension after its current 40-year contract expires.</P>
      <P>The two-story, square concrete building on a hillside above Hobe Fort and
overlooking the Danshui River and the town of Bali across the river, will need
fair amount of work before the company can move in, including the construction
of a dance floor.</P>
      <P>But there are large open rooms on both floors that could easily be turned into
dance and rehearsal studios and several small rooms than could be converted into
offices for the costume, design and production crews.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Legislature proposes to disallow political status language in ECFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislature's Economics Committee passed several proposals related to a
proposed economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China, including
one that would bar language on the political status of Taiwan and China from the
deal.</P>
      <P>Terms such as "one-China principle" and "1992 Consensus, " as well as "giving up
anti-dumping and anti-compensatory subsidization" which is part of the China-
Hong Kong Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA), would not be allowed
to be included in the ECFA, according to the proposal.</P>
      <P>The "1992 Consensus" refers to an understanding the ruling Kuomintang claims was
reached in Hong Kong in 1992 between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait that
there is only one China, but with both sides free to make their own
interpretations of what "one China" actually means.</P>
      <P>On Monday the Economics Committee invited agencies working on the proposed
framework agreement to discuss their preparations for the drafting of the pact.</P>
      <P>The meeting triggered heated debate among lawmakers on the briefing given by
ranking officials from the Council of Economic Planning and Development, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Council of Agriculture, and the Mainland
Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>After the question-and-answer session, the committee voted on a total of 14
proposals related to the ECFA, with several given the green light.</P>
      <P>One of the proposals passed would require the government, before any deal is
signed, to hold talks with representatives of the domestic industrial sectors
that are likely to be hurt by the framework agreement</P>
      <P>The government would have to evaluate the ECFA's possible impact on vulnerable
industrial sectors -- including towels, shoes, bedding, and ceramic and
porcelain ware -- and work out measures to compensate the businesses that would
suffer from the signing of the agreemnet.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang  lawmakers  also proposed to request the Executive Yuan to
include Taiwan's petroleum, textile, and precision machinery exports among the
items for which Chinese tariff reductions will be discussed under the Early
Harvest section of the framework agreement.</P>
      <P>Other proposals include asking the government to continue efforts to sign
agreements with other countries to help Taiwan join the global trading network
and attract international companies to use Taiwan as their East Asian investment

      <P>The government should also take efforts to promote the signing of free trade
agreements (FTAs) with Taiwan's major trade partners, such as the United States,
Japan and Singapore, and should also insist on the principle of not having the
country's sovereignty belittled, the legislators proposed.</P>
      <P>Also passed were measures to not allow Chinese workers into Taiwan and not
expand the number of agricultural items that can be imported from China.</P>
      <P>The Economics Committee, however, did not approve proposals by the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party that would require the government to organize a
referendum on the ECFA, to ask for Beijing's public promise not to block
Taiwan's signing of FTAs with other economies,  and to not engage  in
controversial  comprehensive cross-strait framework talks.</P>

      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui will visit Japan next month on a trip that will be
devoted entirely to sightseeing, his staff said Monday.</P>
      <P>The staff said the former president will not call on any Japanese political
figures and that his trip is mainly aimed at completing the visit of the Oku No
Hosomich (The Narrow Road to the Deep North), the title of famed haiku poet
Matsuo Basho's most famous work, a poem-filled travelogue through Japan's remote
northeastern region of Tohoku.</P>
      <P>They noted that during Lee's visit of Japan in May 2007, he only completed half
of the 2,400-kilogram trail, and he expressed the hope at the time of revisiting
Japan to complete the entire journey, his staff added.</P>
      <P>According to the initial itinerary, Lee is scheduled to depart from Taipei for
Fukuoka, on the northern shore of the island of Kyushu, May 31, and later
transfer to Niigata in northern Japan via domestic flight. He will then travel
southward to complete the trail and return home via Nagoya June 7.</P>
      <P>Lee, 86, will be accompanied by his wife during the visit.</P>
      <P>Basho (1644-1694) is generally regarded as Japan's greatest haiku poet, largely
responsible for creating the art form with its 5-7-5 syllable syntax.</P>
      <P>One of the most famous travelogues ever, the Narrow Road continues to inspire
Japanese art and draws visitors to Tohoku (northeast), and each of the places
Basho visited continues to revere his poems and observations.</P>
      <P>In Basho's day, the land of Oku, literally "Within," was a place where farmers
eked out a meager living and bandits and hermits roamed in the mountains.</P>

      <P>Germany's InfraVest Wind Power Co. said Monday it will not make any further
investment in Taiwan's wind power development projects unless the government
comes up with concrete action in support of its policy to develop renewable
energy.</P>
      <P>Karl-Eugen Feifel, chairman of InfraVest, told a press conference that the
company will put on hold its plans for a further investment of more than 500
million euros in the next five years because it is not sure of the government's
determination to tap renewable energy sources.</P>
      <P>InfraVest is based in Taipei and has offices in Taichung, Changhua, and Miaoli.
It also has offices in China, Turkey, Brazil, and Germany.</P>
      <P>The company has already invested 300 million euros (US$398.46 million) in Taiwan
since its inception in 1999 and has built 88 giant wind turbines on Taiwan's
west coast between Miaoli and Changhua.</P>
      <P>He said that if it becomes certain by the end of this year that Infra Vest will
scrap all its investment plans in Taiwan, the company will still leave some of
its engineers behind to keep the wind turbines running.</P>
      <P>Feifel called for a change in the measures that allow state-owned Taiwan Power
Co. to purchase wind power from the private sector at an "unreasonable" price of
NT$2 per kilowatt-hour -- lower than the production cost of NT$2.6 per kilowatt-
hour.</P>
      <P>He also urged the Ministry of Economic Affairs to simplify the procedure for
screening applications to build new wind farms.</P>
      <P>Feifel expressed disappointment at the lack of progress the Legislative Yuan has
made in passing the Renewable Energy Development Bill.</P>
      <P>He said he had discussed the issue with senior energy officials numerous times
in the past 16 legislative sessions and that each time he was told that the bill
would be passed "in this session."</P>
      <P>Noting that the current legislative session is the third one under the new
Kuomintang government, Wang Yun-yi, deputy manager of InfraVest, said, "If the
law fails to get passed this time, it probably will never be passed in the
future."</P>
      <P>Wang Yun-ming, deputy director-general of the Bureau of Energy under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, affirmed that the government will continue to
support the development of wind power.</P>
      <P>He said that a new formula will be proposed to set a more reasonable price for
buying wind power from the private sector.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has set a goal to draw 10 percent of its electricity capacity from
renewable energy sources by 2010, and that wind power will make up 80 percent of
the 10 percent of the renewable energy.</P>

collaborate with several retail chains and environmental protection bureaus in
cities and counties around the country to promote green purchasing and

    <HEADLINE>MOFA mum on WHA negotiations</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) refused to confirm on Tuesday whether the
government has engaged in negotiations with China on participating in the
upcoming World Health Assembly (WHA) in May.</P>
      <P>Such talks, however, would be the best way to help Taiwan achieve its goal of
attending the WHA as an observer, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>Regarding whether the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have started substantive
negotiations, it is inappropriate for me to make any comment at the moment, said
Paul Chang, general-director of MOFA's Department of International
Organizations, at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>Should there be any communications, the government will uphold the principles of
dignity and autonomy and will not accept any arrangement that demeans or
belittles us,he added.</P>
      <P>Chang was responding to a report in a local daily Monday that Beijing has agreed
to let Taiwan participate in May's WHA meeting as an observer by invitation of
the WHO Secretariat, although some details have yet to be sorted out.</P>
      <P>The annual WHA -- the decision-making arm of the World Health Organization (WHO)
-- is scheduled to be held May 18-27 in Geneva. Taiwan is preparing to bid for
participation in the WHA for the 13th consecutive time since 1997, with previous
attempts blocked due to China's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Rebutting critics that cross-strait negotiations on the issue have taken place
behind closed doors and lack transparency, Chang said there is no such thing as
"closed-door meetings" and that the government has a clear goal, which is to
participate in the WHA as an observer.</P>
      <P>We believe that at the moment, not commenting on relative developments of the
issue can facilitate us in achieving our goal, " he said. The foreign ministry
will make any substantive results public and will accept public scrutiny, Chang
pledged.</P>
      <P>Asked what kind of arrangements would be considered by the government as
belittling Taiwan, Chang only said that the MOFA is working hard to fight for
participation guidelines that are in Taiwan's best interests, including on
Taiwan's designation at the WHA, the level of government officials allowed to
attend, and the rights that Taiwan will enjoy.</P>
      <P>Chang denied the local daily report's contention that Taiwan's observer status
would be re-examined on a "year-by-year" basis.</P>
      <P>He said according to WHO practice, there is no such a thing as permanent

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has advised travelers bound for Thailand
Tuesday to exercise caution, but said it will maintain its current yellow-level
travel alert issued a day earlier after monitoring other countriesdecisions.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry issued the yellow-level travel alert in consideration of
the safety of Taiwanese nationals,  bilateral relations between Taiwan and
Thailand, and other countermeasures taken by other countries, said MOFA deputy
spokesman James Chang at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>As the United Kingdom and Canada have issued a "high alert" for travel to
Bangkok and certain areas, he said the ministry will carefully evaluate whether
to raise its travel alert level for Thailand because such a decision should be
based on the situation throughout the country.</P>
      <P>A yellow alert is the third most serious alert for foreign travel, behind red
and orange alerts. An orange warning would mean that travelers are advised to
postpone or cancel their trips.</P>
      <P>Chang advised travelers to Thailand to exercise caution and avoid going to
Bangkok and its surrounding five districts, including Nonthaburi, Samut Prakan,
Pathum Thani, Nakhon Pathom and Ayutthaya.</P>
      <P>The ministry's representative office in Thailand has also set up a special task
force for emergencies and is maintaining close contact with Taiwanese
businessmen and expatriates, he added.</P>

      <P>Six local general aviation companies appealed to the government Tuesday to allow
them to operate private charters across the Taiwan Strait targeted at high-end
businesses and corporate leaders.</P>
      <P>They made the appeal after a meeting with three Chinese operators in the general
aviation sector in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The low-profile meeting was also attended by Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) Director-General Lee Long-wen and Wang Changshun, deputy
director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.</P>
      <P>Prior to last year, these small aviation companies were banned from carrying
passengers and cargo, with their services limited to aerial  photography,
atmospheric  observation  and measurement, construction services, and medical
transport.</P>
      <P>Taiwan then amended the Civil Aviation Law last year to allow general aviation
operators  to offer "special  business flight services" for corporate clients.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement signed by Taiwan and China in November 2008, however, the two
countries only agreed to liberalize cross-Taiwan Strait direct charter passenger
and cargo flights,  and allow businessmen to fly to and from China in their
private corporate jets.</P>
      <P>Companies  offering exclusive commercial  services in small aircraft to business
clients were excluded from the agreement, even though demand for such service
has grown markedly in the past year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two bluefin tuna fish up for auction at Pingtung tuna festival</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two bluefin tuna -- instead of one -- will be put up for auction at this year's
Pingtung Bluefin Tuna Cultural Festival, breaking the festival's tradition since
it was launched in 2001, the Donggang Fishermen's Association in Pingtung County
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The association decided to let the two northern bluefin tuna fish, recently
caught by the Donggang-based Shin Shen Ching No. 126 and Chen Lung Hsing No. 2
fishing boats, respectively, be auctioned Thursday to mark the approach of the
annual festival.</P>
      <P>It will be the first time in nine years that two northern bluefin tuna will be
auctioned at the two-month festival, which is slated to officially begin on May
2, association officials said.</P>
      <P>In compliance  with the rules set by the Pingtung County Government, to qualify
for the auction, the tuna must be of the northern bluefin tuna species and weigh
over 180 kilograms. It also has to be alive while being caught by a fishing boat
registered with the Pingtung or Kaohsiung County, association officials said.</P>
      <P>Apart from the requirements, the fish has to be the first tuna transported back
to the Donggang Harbor after the boat has reported its catch to the local
fishery radio station. The fish meeting all the above conditions will be
eligible for the auction as the festival's "first tuna."</P>
      <P>Although the Shin Shen Ching No. 126 was the first ship reporting its catch of a
giant northern bluefin tuna to the Donggang fishery radio station on April 11,
the Chen Lung Hsing No. 2 was the first boat that arrived back at the harbor
with a giant tuna that met the qualifications, after having made a report of its
catch to the radio station.</P>
      <P>The two tunas were shipped back to harbor in a difference of 13 minutes,
association officials said, noting that the arrival times of the first two boats
have never been so close.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-lung, skipper of the Chen Lung Hsin No. 2 fishing vessel, said he put
his boat in full gear at a speed of eight nautical miles per hour while shipping
the tuna back from the high seas to Donggang after learning that he could be the
quickest to return to the harbor.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-i, skipper of the Shin Shen Ching No. 126, lamented that his boat
failed to be the first boat back, but added that was because it is aging.</P>
      <P>The two vessels had intersected in waters off the coast of Pingtung County's
Eluanbi on the way back to Donggang, and the two skippers discovered that they
were elementary school classmates after landing at the harbor.</P>
      <P>The first bluefin tuna caught last year for the Pingtung Bluefin Tuna Cultural
Festival was auctioned for NT$1.73 million (US$57,055) at the festival.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) raised its travel alert level for certain
areas of Thailand to orange Tuesday, advising travelers to postpone any visits

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, China looking to cooperate in global telematics industry</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is looking to become a major worldwide  supplier  of automotive
telematics  devices through cooperation with China, said Deputy Minister of
Economic Affairs Huang Chung-chiou Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks at the opening of a forum in Taipei on cross-Taiwan
Strait cooperation and exchanges in the telematics industry.</P>
      <P>Huang said although the world automobile industry has been seriously hit by the
current economic recession, China's automobile production is forecast to reach
6.5 million to 7.5 million units this year to meet its huge domestic demand.</P>
      <P>China is emerging as a major automobile  consumption  and production market,
alongside the United States and Europe, driven by its efforts in recent years to
achieve rapid growth in this sector, Huang noted at the forum, which was
organized by the Institute for Information  Industry  and the Industrial
Technology  Research Institute.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the total production volume of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) in
Taiwan was 37.73 million, with a production value of NT$177.05 billion,
according to statistics quoted by Huang. Personal Navigation Devices (PNDs)
accounted for more than 70 percent of the total, with a delivery volume of more
than 29 million, he said. The production volume of PNDs is forecast to reach 80
million in 2012, he added.</P>
      <P>Roughly 175 million GPS-enabled handsets were manufactured in Taiwan in 2007,
and the figure is expected to reach 560 million in 2012, which indicates that
Taiwan has become an important supplier of telematics products, he said.</P>
      <P>In order to focus more on the development of telematics in the automobile
industry, the cost of electronic systems in vehicles would be adjusted from 19
percent to 40 percent of the total cost of automobile production in the future,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>As telematics companies in both Taiwan and China are specialists in their
respective fields, it would be mutually beneficial to the two sides to pool
their resources in order to become major suppliers of telematics devices, he
suggested.</P>
      <P>Dong Yang, Executive Vice President of the China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers,  said he is also keen to facilitate cooperation between the
automobile industries in Taiwan and China, and thus help through the current
global economic crisis and create economic benefits for both sides.</P>

      <P>Four fishermen from Taiwan's outlying Kinmen Island on Tuesday made a highly
unusual catch -- a big yellow croaker weighing 2.5 kilograms -- while they were
fishing in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>Chen Sung-shu, the 66-year-old skipper of the Sheng Lee fishing boat where the
fishermen worked, said it was the biggest yellow croaker that he has ever caught
in nearly 20 years.</P>
      <P>The fish of 60 centimeters long was purchased by another Kinmen fisherman for
NT$12,000 (US$356). That fisherman plans to re-sell it to China at a higher
price that could amount to NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>"It is already very difficult to catch big yellow croaker weighing over 1.5
kilograms nowadays, although the waters off Kinmen Island were once a fishing
ground rich in that specie of the fish, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>"I once caught as much as 4,500 kilograms of yellow croaker in just one haul in
1971," he recounted.</P>
      <P>According to officials at the Kinmen County Fisheries Research Institute, yellow
croaker -- a fish of high-value unique to waters off the county -- has become an
endangered specie as a result of poaching and overfishing by Chinese fishing
boats which illegally operate in the area.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is promoting a guidance plan aimed at
helping exporters of auto parts and accessories to create more business
opportunities abroad, a ministry official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA has crafted the plan as the industry is one of the most competitive of
Taiwan's small- and medium-sized enterprises in terms of exports, according to
Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Lin Sheng-chung.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although global automobile demand has fallen sharply since the
second half of last year due to the impact of the global economic downturn,
putting major auto parts manufacturers in Europe, the United States and Japan at
risk of collapse, Taiwan's counterparts have been relatively less affected by
the crisis thanks to their high quality after-sales services and products.</P>
      <P>The plan is part of the NT$8.53 billion (US$25.48 million) "New Zheng He Plan"
initiated by the MOEA last December to assist suppliers and manufacturers
producing goods for export, with the aim of attracting NT$540 billion in export
orders per year.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at the opening  of the 2009 Taipei International  Auto
Parts and Accessories Show and the Taipei International Automobile Electronics
Show running concurrently at the Taipei World Trade Center's Nangang Exhibition
Hall.</P>
      <P>Up to 1,100 manufacturers are taking part in the two shows, displaying their
latest products in 2,700 booths.</P>
      <P>The shows, which will run until April 17, are expected to attract 51,700 buyers

    <HEADLINE>Fort stands witness to late Taiwan president's inspiration to troops</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/14/09  19:53:31</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As various events held recently to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of
Taiwan's late President Chiang Ching-kuo are invoking the public's memories of
him, Chiang's close comradeship with the military posted on the Taiwan-held
island group of Kinmen during war times may be among the most remembered.</P>
      <P>One of the most important testimonies to Chiang's devotion to troops at a time
when the island faced the threat of an invasion from China after the two sides
split in 1949 was the General's Fort, a war-time historic site that has been
transformed into a tourist destination.</P>
      <P>Located in Houtou on the east side of Little Kinmen, the smaller of the two
major islands comprising Kinmen, the fort was intended as an outpost monitoring
the Jinlieh Channel which separates the two islands. It became well-known when
Chiang went there amid China's artillery shelling of the island group in 1958.</P>
      <P>The conflict, known internationally as the Battle of the Taiwan Strait or
locally as "823 Battle," began Aug. 23 that year with China launching heavy
bombardment on Kinmen, with more than 30,000 shells fired in the first 85
minutes alone.</P>
      <P>The Chinese military did not suspend the bombardment until Oct. 6, when the
intensive action had continued for 44 days.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 20, however, China resumed the shelling. This second action ran through
Oct. 25 when Beijing announced it would shift to the strategy of attacking
Kinmen on odd-numbered days and resting on even-numbered days.</P>
      <P>When the battle was over on Jan. 7, 1959, the Chinese troops had fired
approximately 480,000 shells, but still failed to pound Kinmen into submission,
thanks to not only support provided by the U.S. military, but also the
resilience of the Kinmen troops. In the battle, the army on Kinmen countered by
firing back 128,000 shells.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who started off as a militaryman and was then deputy secretary-general
of the National Defense Council, visited Little Kinmen on Oct. 21, the day after
the Chinese military resumed bombing Kinmen.</P>
      <P>In the fort in Houtou, Chiang met with Hau Pei-tsun, then commander of the 9th
Division of the army forces in Kinmen, to discuss defense strategy. The fort was
named the General's Fort in 1980 to pay tribute to Chiang.</P>
      <P>The meeting is also mentioned in the "823 Battle Journal" authored by Hau, who
later served as the chief of the general staff, the minister of national defense
and premier.</P>
      <P>"He (Chiang) did not come during the cease fire period but risked the shelling
to come to Kinmen, which demonstrated his nobility," Hau writes.</P>
      <P>Revisiting the General's Fort on Aug. 24, 2007, Hau recalled that fired shells
were everywhere in Little Kinmen at the times of the 823 Battle and that Chiang
was "the great man who made his way to the most dangerous site of the
bombardment."</P>
      <P>Hu Lian, who served as Kinmen's defense commander during the battle, writes in
his book "Remembering the Old Times in Kinmen" that "Despite the fierceness of
the war, he (Chiang) always took a small boat weathering choppy seas to reach
every site where the situation was the most violent to boost the morale of the
military and local residents, entertaining them with his witty and cheerful
speeches on each occasion."</P>
      <P>According to Hu, each of Chiang's visits to the battleground encouraged the
military so strongly that it was like "bringing an extra 100,000 soldiers" to
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Throughout his life, Chiang visited Kinmen on 123 occasions, with the combined
duration of stay totaling 352 days and his footsteps were found in all 12
islands and islets of Kinmen. The visits included three that took place during
the 823 Battle, making him a best friend who shared the fate of soldiers and
local residents in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>After Chiang's passing on Jan. 13, 1988, a museum was established in the
Jhongshanlin Recreational Area in Kinmen in commemoration of him.</P>
      <P>The museum, just like the General's Fort, bears witness to Chiang's sharing of
suffering and hardship with the soldiers and residents in Kinmen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The establishment of a new facility -- the Taipei Performing Arts Center -- will
inject new life into the city's Shihlin district, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hau made the remarks at a press conference at City Hall in which German
architect Ole Scheeren was invited to present his idea for the design of the
project.</P>
      <P>The blueprint, titled "Rubik Cube, " by Scheeren and his partner Rem Koolhaas of
the Netherlands-headquartered Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), won
the top prize in an international competition held by the city government to
seek proposals for the center.</P>
      <P>OMA made its contract bid in collaboration with the Taipei-based Artech
Architect house headed by Taiwanese architect Kris Yao.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Hau said a landmark building can change a city's
destiny, citing the example of how the Sydney Opera House affected the
development of that Australian city.</P>
      <P>The mayor also said he hopes the new center will resolve the long-standing
predicament that Taipei has only one international site for the performing arts
-- the National Theater and the National Concert Hall.</P>
      <P>The new facility will also be able to share Taipei's rich cultural and arts
resources, which have for long been concentrated in the city's southern region,
according to Hau.</P>
      <P>The city government plans to spend NT$4.5 billion (US$133.9 million) to build
the arts center and Lee Yong-ping, director of the city's Department of Cultural
Affairs, said the center, which will occupy two hectares of land, will be
situated close to the Shihlin night market, a popular tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>According to Scheeren's design, the main part of the center will comprise three
theaters -- one with a seating capacity of 1,500 people and the others each with
a capacity of 800.</P>
      <P>Scheeren also explained how his plan will allow the three theaters to be turned
into one giant stage through the concept of rotation he adopted from the Rubik
Cube puzzle.</P>
      <P>The construction is slated to begin in 2010, with completion projected for 2014,
according to the city government.</P>
      <P>Scheeren won fame through leading the design and construction of the China
Central Television Station (CCTV) and the Television Cultural Center (TVCC),
both in Beijing. He is responsible for OMA's work throughout Asia, including the
1,000-unit Scotts Tower in Singapore and a media center in Shanghai.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Consumers' Foundation demanded Tuesday that carriers
operating cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights cut their ticket prices by 42
percent.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Hsieh Tien-jen made the call at a news conference in which
he urged the aviation companies not to use market mechanisms as an excuse to
reject the call, because they are allowed to conduct their cross-strait business
with the permission of the government.</P>
      <P>Since the daily non-stop charter flights between Taiwan and China were
established last December, airline companies have seen their fuel costs and
travel times drop by about 50 percent, but some carriers have nevertheless
increased their cross-strait charter prices by some 3 percent despite the drop
in costs, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the passenger load factor on cross-strait charter flights averaged
more than 90 percent as of late last month, particularly on the routes from
Taiwan to Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. During the first
week of this month, in fact, charters serving these routes were all running 100
percent, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chih-kuo
admitted last November that prices for cross-strait charter flights could be
adjusted downward due to falling oil prices, while Lin Teh-he, deputy director-
general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, also said prices could be
slashed by as much as 20 percent.</P>
      <P>However, nothing concrete has been done to bring the airlines into line, he
pointed out.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) will impose
controls on two chemical substances -- phthalate esters and bisphenol A -- to
protect people from the hazard to health that they pose, according to an EPA
statement released Monday.</P>
      <P>The statement said phthalate esters are used to give flexibility and stability
to plastic products but can harm the reproductive system. They are also
suspected of causing growth retardation, it said.</P>
      <P>The EPA is planning to ban the use of di-(2-ethylhexy) phthalate, di-n-octyl
phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate and butylbenzyl phthalate in the production of
toys for children aged under 14.</P>
      <P>Bisphenol A, the statement continued, is often used in making epoxy resins and
polycarbonate products and is a commonly used chemical raw material, although it
has been proven to interrupt the endocrine adjustment system.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based  Consumers' Foundation  recently discovered bisphenol A in
plastic feeding bottles for infants, triggering public health concerns.</P>
      <P>The discovery prompted the EPA to list the chemical substance as toxic to a
degree that is harmful to the health and the environment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) refused to confirm on Tuesday whether the
government has engaged in negotiations with China on participating in the
upcoming World Health Assembly (WHA) in May.</P>
      <P>Such talks, however, would be the best way to help Taiwan achieve its goal of
attending the WHA as an observer, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>Regarding whether the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have started substantive
negotiations, it is inappropriate for me to make any comment at the moment, said
Paul Chang, general-director of MOFA's Department of International
Organizations, at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>Should there be any communications, the government will uphold the principles of
dignity and autonomy and will not accept any arrangement that demeans or
belittles us,he added.</P>
      <P>Chang was responding to a report in a local daily Monday that Beijing has agreed
to let Taiwan participate in May's WHA meeting as an observer by invitation of
the WHO Secretariat, although some details have yet to be sorted out.</P>
      <P>The annual WHA -- the decision-making arm of the World Health Organization (WHO)
-- is scheduled to be held May 18-27 in Geneva. Taiwan is preparing to bid for
participation in the WHA for the 13th consecutive time since 1997, with previous
attempts blocked due to China's obstruction.</P>
      <P>Rebutting critics that cross-strait negotiations on the issue have taken place
behind closed doors and lack transparency, Chang said there is no such thing as
"closed-door meetings" and that the government has a clear goal, which is to
participate in the WHA as an observer.</P>
      <P>We believe that at the moment, not commenting on relative developments of the
issue can facilitate us in achieving our goal, " he said. The foreign ministry
will make any substantive results public and will accept public scrutiny, Chang
pledged.</P>
      <P>Asked what kind of arrangements would be considered by the government as
belittling Taiwan, Chang only said that the MOFA is working hard to fight for
participation guidelines that are in Taiwan's best interests, including on
Taiwan's designation at the WHA, the level of government officials allowed to
attend, and the rights that Taiwan will enjoy.</P>
      <P>Chang denied the local daily report's contention that Taiwan's observer status
would be re-examined on a "year-by-year" basis.</P>
      <P>He said according to WHO practice, there is no such a thing as permanent
observer, and, therefore, each year the Secretariat will send letters to notify
observers, like the Vatican, about the time and place of its annual meeting and
request the observers to provide the list of their delegation.</P>
      <P>According  to  the  WHA  Rules  of  Procedures,  the  WHO director-general may
invite states having made application for membership, territories on whose
behalf application for associate membership has been made, and states which have
signed but not accepted the Constitution to send observers to sessions of the
Health Assembly.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has advised travelers bound for Thailand
Tuesday to exercise caution, but said it will maintain its current yellow-level
travel alert issued a day earlier after monitoring other countriesdecisions.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry issued the yellow-level travel alert in consideration of
the safety of Taiwanese nationals,  bilateral relations between Taiwan and
Thailand, and other countermeasures taken by other countries, said MOFA deputy
spokesman James Chang at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>As the United Kingdom and Canada have issued a "high alert" for travel to
Bangkok and certain areas, he said the ministry will carefully evaluate whether
to raise its travel alert level for Thailand because such a decision should be
based on the situation throughout the country.</P>
      <P>A yellow alert is the third most serious alert for foreign travel, behind red
and orange alerts. An orange warning would mean that travelers are advised to
postpone or cancel their trips.</P>
      <P>Chang advised travelers to Thailand to exercise caution and avoid going to
Bangkok and its surrounding five districts, including Nonthaburi, Samut Prakan,
Pathum Thani, Nakhon Pathom and Ayutthaya.</P>

      <P>Six local general aviation companies appealed to the government Tuesday to allow
them to operate private charters across the Taiwan Strait targeted at high-end
businesses and corporate leaders.</P>
      <P>They made the appeal after a meeting with three Chinese operators in the general

      <P>The low-profile meeting was also attended by Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) Director-General Lee Long-wen and Wang Changshun, deputy
director of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.</P>
      <P>Prior to last year, these small aviation companies were banned from carrying
passengers and cargo, with their services limited to aerial  photography,
atmospheric  observation  and measurement, construction services, and medical
transport.</P>
      <P>Taiwan then amended the Civil Aviation Law last year to allow general aviation
operators  to offer "special  business flight services" for corporate clients.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement signed by Taiwan and China in November 2008, however, the two
countries only agreed to liberalize cross-Taiwan Strait direct charter passenger

private corporate jets.</P>
      <P>Companies  offering exclusive commercial  services in small aircraft to business
clients were excluded from the agreement, even though demand for such service
has grown markedly in the past year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two bluefin tuna fish up for auction at Pingtung tuna festival</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two bluefin tuna -- instead of one -- will be put up for auction at this year's
Pingtung Bluefin Tuna Cultural Festival, breaking the festival's tradition since
it was launched in 2001, the Donggang Fishermen's Association in Pingtung County
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The association decided to let the two northern bluefin tuna fish, recently
caught by the Donggang-based Shin Shen Ching No. 126 and Chen Lung Hsing No. 2
fishing boats, respectively, be auctioned Thursday to mark the approach of the
annual festival.</P>
      <P>It will be the first time in nine years that two northern bluefin tuna will be
auctioned at the two-month festival, which is slated to officially begin on May
2, association officials said.</P>
      <P>In compliance  with the rules set by the Pingtung County Government, to qualify
for the auction, the tuna must be of the northern bluefin tuna species and weigh
over 180 kilograms. It also has to be alive while being caught by a fishing boat
registered with the Pingtung or Kaohsiung County, association officials said.</P>
      <P>Apart from the requirements, the fish has to be the first tuna transported back
to the Donggang Harbor after the boat has reported its catch to the local
fishery radio station. The fish meeting all the above conditions will be
eligible for the auction as the festival's "first tuna."</P>
      <P>Although the Shin Shen Ching No. 126 was the first ship reporting its catch of a
giant northern bluefin tuna to the Donggang fishery radio station on April 11,
the Chen Lung Hsing No. 2 was the first boat that arrived back at the harbor
with a giant tuna that met the qualifications, after having made a report of its
catch to the radio station.</P>
      <P>The two tunas were shipped back to harbor in a difference of 13 minutes,
association officials said, noting that the arrival times of the first two boats
have never been so close.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-lung, skipper of the Chen Lung Hsin No. 2 fishing vessel, said he put
his boat in full gear at a speed of eight nautical miles per hour while shipping
the tuna back from the high seas to Donggang after learning that he could be the
quickest to return to the harbor.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-i, skipper of the Shin Shen Ching No. 126, lamented that his boat
failed to be the first boat back, but added that was because it is aging.</P>
      <P>The two vessels had intersected in waters off the coast of Pingtung County's
Eluanbi on the way back to Donggang, and the two skippers discovered that they
were elementary school classmates after landing at the harbor.</P>
      <P>The first bluefin tuna caught last year for the Pingtung Bluefin Tuna Cultural
Festival was auctioned for NT$1.73 million (US$57,055) at the festival.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, China looking to cooperate in global telematics industry</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is looking to become a major worldwide  supplier  of automotive
telematics  devices through cooperation with China, said Deputy Minister of
Economic Affairs Huang Chung-chiou Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang made the remarks at the opening of a forum in Taipei on cross-Taiwan
Strait cooperation and exchanges in the telematics industry.</P>
      <P>Huang said although the world automobile industry has been seriously hit by the
current economic recession, China's automobile production is forecast to reach
6.5 million to 7.5 million units this year to meet its huge domestic demand.</P>
      <P>China is emerging as a major automobile  consumption  and production market,
alongside the United States and Europe, driven by its efforts in recent years to
achieve rapid growth in this sector, Huang noted at the forum, which was
organized by the Institute for Information  Industry  and the Industrial
Technology  Research Institute.</P>
      <P>In 2007, the total production volume of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) in
Taiwan was 37.73 million, with a production value of NT$177.05 billion,
according to statistics quoted by Huang. Personal Navigation Devices (PNDs)
accounted for more than 70 percent of the total, with a delivery volume of more
than 29 million, he said. The production volume of PNDs is forecast to reach 80
million in 2012, he added.</P>
      <P>Roughly 175 million GPS-enabled handsets were manufactured in Taiwan in 2007,
and the figure is expected to reach 560 million in 2012, which indicates that
Taiwan has become an important supplier of telematics products, he said.</P>
      <P>In order to focus more on the development of telematics in the automobile
industry, the cost of electronic systems in vehicles would be adjusted from 19
percent to 40 percent of the total cost of automobile production in the future,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>As telematics companies in both Taiwan and China are specialists in their
respective fields, it would be mutually beneficial to the two sides to pool
their resources in order to become major suppliers of telematics devices, he
suggested.</P>
      <P>Dong Yang, Executive Vice President of the China Association of Automobile
Manufacturers,  said he is also keen to facilitate cooperation between the
automobile industries in Taiwan and China, and thus help through the current
global economic crisis and create economic benefits for both sides.</P>

      <P>Four fishermen from Taiwan's outlying Kinmen Island on Tuesday made a highly
unusual catch -- a big yellow croaker weighing 2.5 kilograms -- while they were
fishing in the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>Chen Sung-shu, the 66-year-old skipper of the Sheng Lee fishing boat where the
fishermen worked, said it was the biggest yellow croaker that he has ever caught
in nearly 20 years.</P>
      <P>The fish of 60 centimeters long was purchased by another Kinmen fisherman for
NT$12,000 (US$356). That fisherman plans to re-sell it to China at a higher
price that could amount to NT$50,000.</P>
      <P>"It is already very difficult to catch big yellow croaker weighing over 1.5
kilograms nowadays, although the waters off Kinmen Island were once a fishing
ground rich in that specie of the fish, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>"I once caught as much as 4,500 kilograms of yellow croaker in just one haul in
1971," he recounted.</P>
      <P>According to officials at the Kinmen County Fisheries Research Institute, yellow
croaker -- a fish of high-value unique to waters off the county -- has become an
endangered specie as a result of poaching and overfishing by Chinese fishing
boats which illegally operate in the area.</P>

opportunities abroad, a ministry official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MOEA has crafted the plan as the industry is one of the most competitive of
Taiwan's small- and medium-sized enterprises in terms of exports, according to
Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Lin Sheng-chung.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although global automobile demand has fallen sharply since the
second half of last year due to the impact of the global economic downturn,
putting major auto parts manufacturers in Europe, the United States and Japan at
risk of collapse, Taiwan's counterparts have been relatively less affected by
the crisis thanks to their high quality after-sales services and products.</P>
      <P>The plan is part of the NT$8.53 billion (US$25.48 million) "New Zheng He Plan"
initiated by the MOEA last December to assist suppliers and manufacturers
producing goods for export, with the aim of attracting NT$540 billion in export
orders per year.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks at the opening  of the 2009 Taipei International  Auto
Parts and Accessories Show and the Taipei International Automobile Electronics
Show running concurrently at the Taipei World Trade Center's Nangang Exhibition
Hall.</P>
      <P>Up to 1,100 manufacturers are taking part in the two shows, displaying their
latest products in 2,700 booths.</P>
      <P>The shows, which will run until April 17, are expected to attract 51,700 buyers
from home and abroad, including representatives of manufacturers such as BMW,
Mercedes-Benz and Bosch.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Fort stands witness to late Taiwan president's inspiration to troops</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/14/09  19:53:31</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As various events held recently to mark the 100th anniversary of the birth of
Taiwan's late President Chiang Ching-kuo are invoking the public's memories of
him, Chiang's close comradeship with the military posted on the Taiwan-held
island group of Kinmen during war times may be among the most remembered.</P>
      <P>One of the most important testimonies to Chiang's devotion to troops at a time
when the island faced the threat of an invasion from China after the two sides
split in 1949 was the General's Fort, a war-time historic site that has been
transformed into a tourist destination.</P>
      <P>Located in Houtou on the east side of Little Kinmen, the smaller of the two
major islands comprising Kinmen, the fort was intended as an outpost monitoring
the Jinlieh Channel which separates the two islands. It became well-known when
Chiang went there amid China's artillery shelling of the island group in 1958.</P>
      <P>The conflict, known internationally as the Battle of the Taiwan Strait or
locally as "823 Battle," began Aug. 23 that year with China launching heavy
bombardment on Kinmen, with more than 30,000 shells fired in the first 85
minutes alone.</P>
      <P>The Chinese military did not suspend the bombardment until Oct. 6, when the
intensive action had continued for 44 days.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 20, however, China resumed the shelling. This second action ran through
Oct. 25 when Beijing announced it would shift to the strategy of attacking
Kinmen on odd-numbered days and resting on even-numbered days.</P>
      <P>When the battle was over on Jan. 7, 1959, the Chinese troops had fired
approximately 480,000 shells, but still failed to pound Kinmen into submission,
thanks to not only support provided by the U.S. military, but also the
resilience of the Kinmen troops. In the battle, the army on Kinmen countered by
firing back 128,000 shells.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who started off as a militaryman and was then deputy secretary-general
of the National Defense Council, visited Little Kinmen on Oct. 21, the day after
the Chinese military resumed bombing Kinmen.</P>
      <P>In the fort in Houtou, Chiang met with Hau Pei-tsun, then commander of the 9th
Division of the army forces in Kinmen, to discuss defense strategy. The fort was
named the General's Fort in 1980 to pay tribute to Chiang.</P>
      <P>The meeting is also mentioned in the "823 Battle Journal" authored by Hau, who
later served as the chief of the general staff, the minister of national defense
and premier.</P>
      <P>"He (Chiang) did not come during the cease fire period but risked the shelling
to come to Kinmen, which demonstrated his nobility," Hau writes.</P>
      <P>Revisiting the General's Fort on Aug. 24, 2007, Hau recalled that fired shells
were everywhere in Little Kinmen at the times of the 823 Battle and that Chiang
was "the great man who made his way to the most dangerous site of the
bombardment."</P>
      <P>Hu Lian, who served as Kinmen's defense commander during the battle, writes in
his book "Remembering the Old Times in Kinmen" that "Despite the fierceness of
the war, he (Chiang) always took a small boat weathering choppy seas to reach
every site where the situation was the most violent to boost the morale of the
military and local residents, entertaining them with his witty and cheerful
speeches on each occasion."</P>
      <P>According to Hu, each of Chiang's visits to the battleground encouraged the
military so strongly that it was like "bringing an extra 100,000 soldiers" to
Kinmen.</P>
      <P>Throughout his life, Chiang visited Kinmen on 123 occasions, with the combined
duration of stay totaling 352 days and his footsteps were found in all 12
islands and islets of Kinmen. The visits included three that took place during
the 823 Battle, making him a best friend who shared the fate of soldiers and
local residents in Kinmen.</P>
      <P>After Chiang's passing on Jan. 13, 1988, a museum was established in the
Jhongshanlin Recreational Area in Kinmen in commemoration of him.</P>
      <P>The museum, just like the General's Fort, bears witness to Chiang's sharing of
suffering and hardship with the soldiers and residents in Kinmen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`Taipei Performing Arts Center' to be new landmark</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 14 (CNA)
04/14/09  21:00:02
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The establishment of a new facility -- the Taipei Performing Arts Center -- will
inject new life into the city's Shihlin district, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hau made the remarks at a press conference at City Hall in which German
architect Ole Scheeren was invited to present his idea for the design of the
project.</P>
      <P>The blueprint, titled "Rubik Cube, " by Scheeren and his partner Rem Koolhaas of
the Netherlands-headquartered Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), won
the top prize in an international competition held by the city government to
seek proposals for the center.</P>
      <P>OMA made its contract bid in collaboration with the Taipei-based Artech
Architect house headed by Taiwanese architect Kris Yao.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Hau said a landmark building can change a city's
destiny, citing the example of how the Sydney Opera House affected the
development of that Australian city.</P>
      <P>The mayor also said he hopes the new center will resolve the long-standing
predicament that Taipei has only one international site for the performing arts
-- the National Theater and the National Concert Hall.</P>
      <P>The new facility will also be able to share Taipei's rich cultural and arts
resources, which have for long been concentrated in the city's southern region,
according to Hau.</P>
      <P>The city government plans to spend NT$4.5 billion (US$133.9 million) to build
the arts center and Lee Yong-ping, director of the city's Department of Cultural
Affairs, said the center, which will occupy two hectares of land, will be
situated close to the Shihlin night market, a popular tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>According to Scheeren's design, the main part of the center will comprise three
theaters -- one with a seating capacity of 1,500 people and the others each with
a capacity of 800.</P>
      <P>Scheeren also explained how his plan will allow the three theaters to be turned
into one giant stage through the concept of rotation he adopted from the Rubik
Cube puzzle.</P>
      <P>The construction is slated to begin in 2010, with completion projected for 2014,
according to the city government.</P>
      <P>Scheeren won fame through leading the design and construction of the China
Central Television Station (CCTV) and the Television Cultural Center (TVCC),
both in Beijing. He is responsible for OMA's work throughout Asia, including the
1,000-unit Scotts Tower in Singapore and a media center in Shanghai.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Consumers' Foundation demanded Tuesday that carriers
operating cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights cut their ticket prices by 42
percent.</P>
      <P>Foundation Chairman Hsieh Tien-jen made the call at a news conference in which
he urged the aviation companies not to use market mechanisms as an excuse to
reject the call, because they are allowed to conduct their cross-strait business
with the permission of the government.</P>
      <P>Since the daily non-stop charter flights between Taiwan and China were
established last December, airline companies have seen their fuel costs and
travel times drop by about 50 percent, but some carriers have nevertheless
increased their cross-strait charter prices by some 3 percent despite the drop
in costs, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the passenger load factor on cross-strait charter flights averaged
more than 90 percent as of late last month, particularly on the routes from
Taiwan to Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. During the first
week of this month, in fact, charters serving these routes were all running 100
percent, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Minister of Transportation and Communications Mao Chih-kuo
admitted last November that prices for cross-strait charter flights could be
adjusted downward due to falling oil prices, while Lin Teh-he, deputy director-
general of the Civil Aeronautics Administration, also said prices could be
slashed by as much as 20 percent.</P>
      <P>However, nothing concrete has been done to bring the airlines into line, he
pointed out.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) will impose
controls on two chemical substances -- phthalate esters and bisphenol A -- to
protect people from the hazard to health that they pose, according to an EPA
statement released Monday.</P>
      <P>The statement said phthalate esters are used to give flexibility and stability
to plastic products but can harm the reproductive system. They are also
suspected of causing growth retardation, it said.</P>
      <P>The EPA is planning to ban the use of di-(2-ethylhexy) phthalate, di-n-octyl
phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate and butylbenzyl phthalate in the production of
toys for children aged under 14.</P>
      <P>Bisphenol A, the statement continued, is often used in making epoxy resins and
polycarbonate products and is a commonly used chemical raw material, although it
has been proven to interrupt the endocrine adjustment system.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based  Consumers' Foundation  recently discovered bisphenol A in
plastic feeding bottles for infants, triggering public health concerns.</P>
      <P>The discovery prompted the EPA to list the chemical substance as toxic to a
degree that is harmful to the health and the environment.</P>

      <P>The number of applicants for unemployment benefits continues to decrease in

      <P>The number dropped to 5,000 per working day in March and further to 4,200 per
working day so far in April, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the Employment Insurance Law, workers who lose their jobs through
no fault of their own and who fail to find new ones within 14 days of
registering with a government-run employment service organization can receive 60
percent of their insured wages for up to six months.</P>
      <P>They are required to report to a CLA employment service center every month to
have their unemployed status verified in order to continue receiving the
benefits.</P>
      <P>From May, the maximum duration for unemployment benefits will be extended to
nine months for older workers and those with physical or mental disabilities.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) will impose
controls on two chemical substances -- phthalate esters and bisphenol A -- to
protect people from the hazard to health that they pose, according to an EPA
statement released Monday.</P>
      <P>The statement said phthalate esters are used to give flexibility and stability
to plastic products but can harm the reproductive system. They are also
suspected of causing growth retardation, it said.</P>
      <P>The EPA is planning to ban the use of di-(2-ethylhexy) phthalate, di-n-octyl
phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate and butylbenzyl phthalate in the production of
toys for children aged under 14.</P>
      <P>Bisphenol A, the statement continued, is often used in making epoxy resins and
polycarbonate products and is a commonly used chemical raw material, although it
has been proven to interrupt the endocrine adjustment system.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based  Consumers' Foundation  recently discovered bisphenol A in
plastic feeding bottles for infants, triggering public health concerns.</P>
      <P>The discovery prompted the EPA to list the chemical substance as toxic to a
degree that is harmful to the health and the environment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'One-handed knife king' finds solace, success in the kitchen</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/15/09  16:50:44</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuo Hsing-chung owns two popular Thai food restaurants in Taipei that serve
dishes meticulously prepared by him and a team of cooks. At first glance, the
restaurants are just two more good choices for Thai food in Taiwan's capital
city, led by an accomplished chef.</P>
      <P>It's only when clients enter Kuo's restaurant on Taipei's Guangfu South Road and
run into the owner that they notice he is missing his left hand -- a condition
that has existed since birth -- and they invariably wonder how he manages to
stir-fry his dishes.</P>
      <P>Kuo is just one of many individuals in Taiwan who has had to overcome a physical
disability, but his acquired profession is one that does not lend itself easily
to working with only one hand, as he has discovered during his 16-year career.</P>
      <P>Some of the simplest kitchen tasks, such as cutting vegetables or stir-frying
dishes in a wok, nearly drove Kuo away from the profession more than once, but
he persevered through the challenges and now the chef known in the trade as the
"one-handed knife king" treats his missing hand as nothing more than an
inconvenience.</P>
      <P>"I have only one hand, but I can do what a normal person cannot do with two
hands,  " the 32-year-old chef says proudly and confidently.</P>
      <P>Originally from the Thai-Burmese border town of Mae Salong, Kuo faltered and
cried numerous times in his pursuit of success after coming to Taiwan with his
family at the age of 12.</P>
      <P>"Fortunately, I didn't give up on myself in the early years of my
apprenticeship. I have accomplished what others may have thought I could never
achieve," he reflects.</P>
      <P>In retrospect, Kuo says he isolated himself from other people when he first came
to Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Back then, I felt at loss about the future. From a primitive Thai-Burmese
border town to a city like Taipei, I was afraid of strangers' gazes or glares.
Walking in public, I instinctively hid my deformed left hand and did not like to
expose it in front of others. They would talk about behind my back," he recalls.</P>
      <P>A turning point came when he turned 16. His uncle had opened a Thai restaurant
and recruited him as an apprentice.</P>
      <P>"I was assigned to work in the kitchen. At first, I thought it was good as I
didn't need to face customers. But my deformity, coupled with my inability to
interact with others, discouraged cooks from teaching me anything," he remembers
vividly.</P>
      <P>"They even told my uncle that I was unlikely to become a cook or chef. I was
enraged by their contempt but reacted with resignation. Since they didn't want
to teach me, I didn't want to learn, " Kuo adds.</P>
      <P>After working in the kitchen for half a year, Kuo still could not hold a knife
properly, and he was ready to give up.</P>
      <P>But thanks to the repeated encouragement of his father and uncle, and the shock
of seeing others get promoted ahead of him, Kuo finally saw the light. "I
couldn't throw in the towel so easily. I was determined to learn by myself if
nobody would teach me. "</P>
      <P>He began to observe how cooks cut different foods. During breaks, he would
practice cutting discarded carrots and cabbages, using his left elbow to keep
foods in place as he was cutting them. It was not an easy maneuver for him, and
he cut himself often.</P>
      <P>After several months of "groping in the dark, " he gradually acquired top
cutting skills, slicing cabbage, for instance, in consistent sizes. Fellow cooks
began calling him the "one-handed knife king."</P>
      <P>Then came the equally difficult challenge of stir-frying or sauteing foods.</P>
      <P>"Woks tend to be heavy. Every step -- stirring, seasoning or flavoring, and
heating -- should be perfectly timed for a stir-fried dish to be delicious," Kuo
relates.</P>
      <P>He remembers that he threw away the first sauteed dish he prepared after four
months of practice because other workers at his uncle's restaurant yelled that
the dish had a "burnt smell."</P>
      <P>His lack of progress left him downcast and in despair. Worse still, because he
could only use one hand to stir-fry foods, he suffered severe back ligament
injuries.</P>
      <P>"The debilitating pain frequently made me cry in the middle of the night. At one
point, I thought of giving up, " Kuo remembers.</P>
      <P>"But realizing that I didn't have too many other choices kept me from yielding.
Even though I had to endure more hardships and adversity, I couldn't afford to
give up," Kuo recounts.</P>
      <P>After three years of diligent and arduous study, Kuo finally emerged as a
skilled chef of Thai cuisine who can cut and saute a wide variety of fine Thai
dishes.</P>
      <P>In all, it took him eight years to climb to the post of chief chef at his
uncle's restaurant at the age of 24.</P>
      <P>To perfect his culinary art and skill, Kuo has traveled to Thailand many times
to study with noted Thai chefs, he said he was lucky to have such an
opportunity.</P>
      <P>"They repeatedly encouraged me to take part in culinary contests and they often
reminded me that I should never lose self-confidence because I can do with one
hand what others have to do with two hands," Kuo recalls.</P>
      <P>"Their words sounded  like a wake-up  call,  kindling  my self-confidence and
letting me understand that I'm not frail, " he says.</P>
      <P>With firm determination and plenty of confidence, Kuo decided to set up his own
restaurant at the age of 28.</P>
      <P>"Over the years, my disability has become my strength. Having recognized this,
I'm confident I can cope with many of my life's challenges ahead."</P>

involve victims between the ages of 12 and 17 in Taipei City, which highlights
the vulnerability of teenagers to this type of violence, the city's Department
of Social Welfare said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the Taipei City Center for Protection of Domestic Violence and
Sexual Assault show that in 2007, there were 82 reported cases of rape that took
place during real meetings between persons that had first made contact online,
accounting for 11.1 percent of all rape cases reported in the city during the
year.</P>
      <P>The number of such cases increased slightly to 86 in 2008, accounting for 10.8
percent of all sexual assault cases.</P>
      <P>There were 17 such cases during the first three months of 2009, accounting for
10.9 percent of all rape cases reported during that period.</P>
      <P>In these cases, the largest group of victims -- more than 60 percent -- were in
the 12-17 age group, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Chiang Hsing-hui, director of the center, said that social workers  have found
that many teenage rape victims  had been experiencing great pressure and had
suffered setbacks and expected to gain acceptance from friends on the Internet.</P>
      <P>The desire to meet someone of the opposite sex also exposes teenagers to
dangerous situations, Chiang said.</P>

      <P>China and Taiwan have recently agreed to establish the first cross-Taiwan Strait
platform for cooperation and mutual exchanges in the telematics industry.</P>
      <P>Ke Jyh-sheng, president of Taiwan's quasi-official Institute for Information
Industry (III), signed a letter of intent Monday with Lu Ning, president of
China's Changchun Optoelectronics Information Industry Association, and Cheng
Fu-hsiung, vice chairman of the Taipei-based Taiwan Electrical Electronic
Manufacturers' Association as a precursor to the cross-strait cooperation.</P>
      <P>The cooperation agreement, once established, will allow Taiwan to assist
Changchun City, in northeastern China's Jilin Province, in developing a wireless
broadband network while opening the doors for cross-strait cooperation in the
automobile electronics and telematics application sectors.</P>
      <P>The signing of the letter of intent marked an achievement of a cross-strait
conference on telematics cooperation and exchanges that was held April 13-14 at
the Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's E-Lead Electronic Corp. signed an agreement with the
College of Automotive Engineering of Jilin University Monday at the closing of
the Taipei conference, beginning the first concrete cooperation effort of the
two sides in the telematics industry.</P>
      <P>E-Lead Vice Chairman Chen Hsi-yiao said that under the new cooperative ties, his
company will work with Jilin University in the development and manufacture of
automotive electronic products.</P>
      <P>In the preliminary stage, Chen went on, the two sides will focus on efforts to
come up with an improved tire pressure monitoring system.</P>
      <P>At the signing ceremony, III Vice President Wang Wei expressed anticipation that
the pact will attract more Taiwanese automotive electronics  producers  to seek
R&amp;D collaboration  with  Jilin University, as well as with the First
Automobile Works (FAW) Group Corp., one of China's three largest auto
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>The just-ended cross-strait conference on telematics cooperation and exchanges
was the third in a series of activities prepared by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs as part of a "bridging" program it initiated to boost cross-strait

      <P>The government will spend up to NT$60 million (US$1.78 million) to help
households around Taiwan to improve the safety of their gas water heaters and
reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, Minister of the Interior Liao
Liao-yi said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Liao told a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Social Welfare and Environmental
Hygiene Committee that a recent survey shows that about 34,000 households in
Taiwan are prone to carbon monoxide poisoning because their gas water heaters
have been installed at locations where ventilation is poor.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the National Fire Agency under the Ministry of the
Interior in March, collected information from the families of 960,000 junior
middle school students.</P>
      <P>The results showed that of the 34,000 households with a high risk of carbon
monoxide poisoning, 20,000 said they would improve the situations themselves.</P>
      <P>Liao said his ministry will grant a subsidy of NT$3,000 to each of the remaining
14,000 households to reduce gas poisoning risk by relocating their gas water
heaters to safer locations or by improving the ventilation in their homes.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that he is not sure where the money will come from, but said he
will try to coordinate with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to come up with
funds for the plan.</P>
      <P>According to the National Fire Agency, most carbon monoxide poisoning accidents
caused by bathroom gas water heaters occur during the period from December to
March when people normally do not open windows in the cold season.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the agency showed that the number of carbon monoxide
poisoning accidents in Taiwan have steadily risen in recent years after falling
in 2006.</P>
      <P>There were 176 such cases nationwide in 2005, resulting in 31 deaths and 358

    <HEADLINE>18 pigs culled in Changhua County FMD scare: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15 (CNA)
04/15/09  19:56:29

    <TEXT>
      <P>Eighteen pigs on a farm in the central county of Changhua were culled late
Monday after they were found to have developed symptoms of the highly contagious
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a county official confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chou-tseh, head of the county's Bureau of Animal Health Inspection and
Quarantine, said the 18 pigs were killed on the farm immediately after a
veterinarian  at the Changhua meat market discovered April 13 that 10 out of 50
pigs sent to the meat market by the farm appeared to have FMD symptoms.</P>
      <P>A total of 947 pigs were being raised on the farm, Kuo added.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, seven other pig farms within a 1-km radius of the farm were
disinfected later Monday in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus, and
vaccinations were also given to about 5,000 pigs being raised in the
neighborhood.</P>
      <P>According to officials of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection  and
Quarantine under the Cabinet-level  Council of Agriculture (COA), there are
about 12,000 hog farms in Taiwan, with 90 percent of their stock having received
no FMD inoculation.</P>
      <P>Monday's report was the fourth of its kind since February, following the first
case reported in Yunlin County Feb. 4, a second reported in Changhua County Feb.
9 and a third in Chiayi County March 27, COA officials reported.</P>
      <P>They urged the public not to panic over the development, describing the
appearance of sporadic cases as normal in the process of gradual reduction of
inoculation percentage on way to eradicating the disease.</P>
      <P>Under guidelines set by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), Taiwan
is entitled to apply for status as an FMD-free country with the body before its
2010 annual meeting slated for May of that year if no more cases are reported
and no vaccinations are given to livestock for one year before applying for FMD-
free status, according to the COA.</P>
      <P>Once a country reports an FMD outbreak, it can take up to 40 years before it can
eventually be listed as FMD-free, as has been the case in some European
countries, COA officials noted.</P>
      <P>The percentage of pigs in Taiwan to have received FMD vaccination has dropped
from 50 percent last November to less than 10 percent on average at each farm,
moving toward a zero injection rate so as to meet OIE requirements, COA
officials went on.</P>
      <P>After the first FMD case was reported in Taiwan March 20, 1997, Taiwan has been
trying to stamp out the disease as quickly as possible, they added.</P>
      <P>Since then, all pig farms and slaughterhouses around the country have
continuously conducted disinfection work to keep the virus at bay.</P>
      <P>Taiwan used to raise as many as 12 million pigs per year in the peak years, with
7 million exported to Japan annually, according to the COA officials. Taiwan now
raises only about 6.4 million pigs a year, mainly for local consumption, the
officials noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Formosan black bear cub was donated to the Taipei Zoo in a ceremony held
Wednesday in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>Lee Teng-cheng, owner of the bear cub and a resident of the county's Changchi
township, said donating the four-and-a-half-month old male cub felt like "giving
away his daughter," so much so that he even prepared some of the cub's favorite
fruit as a "dowry."</P>
      <P>Jason Yeh, director of the Taipei Zoo, presided over the donation ceremony, with
Hwang Mei-hsiu, an assistant professor at National Pingtung University of
Science &amp; Technology who has long dedicated herself to research on the
bears, serving as "matchmaker."</P>
      <P>As a gesture of appreciation for Lee's generosity, Yeh also announced that
elementary school children from Changchi township will now be given free
admission to the zoo.</P>
      <P>Lee bought a pair of bears and various other wild animals more than 20 years ago
in local shops because he did not have the heart to see them being killed for
restaurant guests. He was later forced to get rid of most of them, especially
after the enactment of the Wildlife  Conservation  Act in 1989,  which prohibits
private individuals from keeping or breeding protected species.</P>
      <P>However, he could not bring himself to part with the bears, one of which gave
birth to her seventh cub late last year.</P>
      <P>Lee, who fought with the government to be allowed to keep the two previous
surviving cubs, reached an agreement with Taipei Zoo two years ago that he would
give away the latest cub because the zoo's own Formosan black bear could no
longer breed.</P>
      <P>Lee noted Wednesday that since the Formosan black bear is an endangered species,
and "not my personal asset, " he was willing to give it away, although he has
said previously that if the bears kept by government agencies or the academic
sector are barren, competent people in the private sector should be allowed to
breed the animals.</P>

      <P>The number of arriving Chinese visitors broke the 3,000 mark for the first time
Wednesday to reach 3,043, according to statistics released that day by the
Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>The tourists, among a total of 105 tour groups from major Chinese cities and
provinces, arrived in Taiwan throughout the day, either via direct charter
flights across the Taiwan Strait or through Hong Kong or Macau, Tourism Bureau
officials said.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement signed by the two sides of the Taiwan Strait last
June, Taiwan allows entry of a maximum of 3,000 Chinese tourists per day,
although due to the global economic downturn, the daily figure had never before
hit the daily limit.</P>
      <P>Tourism officials said the unrealized quotas from previous months can be used to
accommodate the influx of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait relations improving steadily, more Chinese tourists are
expected to visit Taiwan in the future, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>As Thailand has been plagued by anti-government protests in recent weeks, the
officials said, many tourists have dropped their Thailand travel plans and have
instead included Taiwan on their vacation itineraries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, many Hong Kong citizens also took advantage of their Easter holidays
to visit Taiwan, leading to a full load factor on nearly all Hong Kong-Taiwan
flights and prompting carriers operating the route to offer additional flights
in recent days to meet the surge in demand.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Ma hopes to see renewable energy legislation passed this year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou urged the Executive Yuan Wednesday to integrate the seven
different versions of a draft bill on renewable energy development and push for
its passage in the current session of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Ma made the call at the opening of the third national conference on energy
policy, which is being held over two days at the Taipei International Convention
Center.</P>
      <P>Ma also stated that it is Taiwan's duty as part of the international community
to save energy and cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions  in an effort  to help
achieve  sustainable  global development.</P>
      <P>He noted that the government has set a goal of reducing energy intensity --
calculated as units of energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product --
by 20 percent in 2015 from the 2005 level, and further by 50 percent in 2025.</P>
      <P>The government will also push to cut carbon emissions in the period 2016-2020 to
the 2008 level, is aiming for a reduction in 2025 to the 2000 level, and has set
a goal of halving the volume in 2050 from the 2025 level, the president said.</P>
      <P>He said that while these are ambitious goals, no action will be taken in Taiwan
if the government does not set such targets. He also pointed out that an
environmental protection component has been included in every project in his
government's four-year NT$500 billion national economic stimulus package.</P>
      <P>Also at the opening of the energy conference, Premier Liu Chao-shuan said the
government is faced with the challenge of devising a comprehensive strategy for
the research and development of green energy technologies and to put Taiwan in
play in the expanding global market for green energy products.</P>
      <P>Liu urged the participants at the conference to set aside their preconceived
ideas and positions and assist the government in drafting a blueprint for the
development of sustainable energy.</P>
      <P>All governments around the world are facing the major task of finding a balance
among developing energy, growing the economy and protecting the environment, he
said.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the industrial, governmental and academic sectors taking part
in the energy conference were expected to discuss issues related to sustainable
development and energy safety; energy management and efficiency improvement;
energy prices and market opening; and energy technology and industrial
development.</P>
      <P>The conference was overshadowed by a German wind power company's threat to pull
its investments out of Taiwan in an attempt to push the government to come up
with concrete action in support of its policy to develop renewable energy.</P>
      <P>The conference also drew demonstrations by anti-nuclear activists who gathered
outside the venue to protest against the ongoing construction of the fourth
nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The national energy conference, launched in 1998, was slated to be held every
three years, but since then there had been only one other meeting -- in 2005 --
as it has been plagued by nuclear energy disputes.</P>

      <P>Three city and township chiefs from Japan's Okinawa Prefecture arrived Wednesday
in eastern Taiwan's Hualien City for a two-day visit to promote bilateral
exchanges.</P>
      <P>The three Japanese officials from Ishigaki City,  Yonaguni township and Taketomi
township signed a pledge with Hualien City Mayor Tsai Chi-ta to jointly push for
making one-day trips between the two sides possible, Hualien City officials
said.</P>
      <P>Due to the geographic proximity between the Hualien area and the Japanese
localities, the two sides are planning to work out tour packages that could
bring tourists and business people to the two countries and back within one day,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>Such an arrangement should be very appealing to both Taiwanese and Japanese
people as well as travelers from other countries, they added, forecasting that
more than 1 million foreign tourists would be attracted to eastern Taiwan's
regions each year on the planned "one-day two-countries" tour packages.</P>
      <P>Ishigaki City on Ishigaki Island is the southernmost Japanese city and the two
townships all belong to Okinawa's Yaeyama Islands, which are only about 120
kilometers away from Taiwan's Hualien County.</P>
      <P>These Japanese islands far from Tokyo have long maintained close economic and
cultural links with Taiwan, and the two sides are expected to gradually form a
regional trade bloc as a result of ever increasing two-way exchanges.</P>

      <P>The container handling volume at the port of Kaohsiung made some recovery in
March, signifying that the global economy was slowly warming up, the Kaohsiung
Harbor Bureau indicated Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Officials at the bureau quoted statistics as showing that Kaohsiung port handled
718,800 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in March, up from 551,000 TEUs in
February and 619,100 TEUs in January.</P>
      <P>They noted that the March figure, however, was still lower than the monthly
average of 800,000 TEUs in recent years.</P>
      <P>In the January-March period, Kaohsiung handled a total of 1.89 million TEUs,
lower than the 2.46 million TEUs recorded in the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung's container-handling volume saw an year-on-year decline for the fifth
consecutive month in February, mainly because of the severe global economic
downturn and partly because of the Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the moderate increase in March to growing exports -- an
apparent indicator that the world economy was recovering slowly.</P>
      <P>In the past years, Kaohsiung port handled nearly 10 million TEUs per year, or an
average of 800,000 TEUs per month, but the volume began to decline precipitously
in the fourth quarter of 2008, with a year-on-year decrease of more than 10
percent recorded in October, more than 24 percent in November and December, and
28 percent in January.</P>

      <P>Chen Hsiao-ping, vice president of the Bureau of National Health Insurance under
the Cabinet-level Department of Health, explained in detail the historical
background of the national health insurance system, its special features,
factors contributing to its success and the challenges it faces.</P>
      <P>His address drew much attention as it came at a time when President Barack

      <P>If Taiwan signs an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)  with China,
this would definitely contribute to future negotiations with the United States
on a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) , Taiwan's representative to
Washington, D.C. said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Jason C. Yuan, who is currently on a home consultation tour in Taipei, made the
remarks at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense
Committee.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from legislators after reporting on the latest developments
in Taiwan-U.S. relations and U.S. policy toward Taiwan under U.S. President
Barack Obama, Yuan said the direction of the new U.S. administration's trade
policy remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>Amid the current global economic downturn, Yuan said, calls for protectionism
are rife in the United States and its Congress is not keen on FTA talks with
other countries at the moment.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, American politicians friendly toward Taiwan have
suggested that Taiwan foster a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, if Taiwan can sign an ECFA with China, it would be very
helpful in future FTA talks with the U.S.</P>
      <P>As the Obama administration has publicly voiced support for the resumption of
visits to Taiwan by U.S. Cabinet-level officials, the Taiwan representative
office has stepped up efforts to invite senior U.S. officials to visit Taiwan in
the future, Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Yuan further said his office has also listed "signing of an extradition accord

      <P>On Taiwan's bid for joining the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer, Yuan
said the U. S. adminsitration presented a report to Congress last week, in which
it holds a positive stance on Taiwan's bid and clearly states that it would not

    <HEADLINE>'One-handed knife king' finds solace, success in the kitchen</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/15/09  16:50:44</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuo Hsing-chung owns two popular Thai food restaurants in Taipei that serve
dishes meticulously prepared by him and a team of cooks. At first glance, the
restaurants are just two more good choices for Thai food in Taiwan's capital
city, led by an accomplished chef.</P>
      <P>It's only when clients enter Kuo's restaurant on Taipei's Guangfu South Road and
run into the owner that they notice he is missing his left hand -- a condition
that has existed since birth -- and they invariably wonder how he manages to
stir-fry his dishes.</P>
      <P>Kuo is just one of many individuals in Taiwan who has had to overcome a physical
disability, but his acquired profession is one that does not lend itself easily
to working with only one hand, as he has discovered during his 16-year career.</P>
      <P>Some of the simplest kitchen tasks, such as cutting vegetables or stir-frying
dishes in a wok, nearly drove Kuo away from the profession more than once, but
he persevered through the challenges and now the chef known in the trade as the
"one-handed knife king" treats his missing hand as nothing more than an
inconvenience.</P>
      <P>"I have only one hand, but I can do what a normal person cannot do with two
hands,  " the 32-year-old chef says proudly and confidently.</P>
      <P>Originally from the Thai-Burmese border town of Mae Salong, Kuo faltered and
cried numerous times in his pursuit of success after coming to Taiwan with his
family at the age of 12.</P>
      <P>"Fortunately, I didn't give up on myself in the early years of my
apprenticeship. I have accomplished what others may have thought I could never
achieve," he reflects.</P>
      <P>In retrospect, Kuo says he isolated himself from other people when he first came
to Taipei.</P>
      <P>"Back then, I felt at loss about the future. From a primitive Thai-Burmese
border town to a city like Taipei, I was afraid of strangers' gazes or glares.
Walking in public, I instinctively hid my deformed left hand and did not like to
expose it in front of others. They would talk about behind my back," he recalls.</P>
      <P>A turning point came when he turned 16. His uncle had opened a Thai restaurant
and recruited him as an apprentice.</P>
      <P>"I was assigned to work in the kitchen. At first, I thought it was good as I
didn't need to face customers. But my deformity, coupled with my inability to
interact with others, discouraged cooks from teaching me anything," he remembers
vividly.</P>
      <P>"They even told my uncle that I was unlikely to become a cook or chef. I was
enraged by their contempt but reacted with resignation. Since they didn't want
to teach me, I didn't want to learn, " Kuo adds.</P>
      <P>After working in the kitchen for half a year, Kuo still could not hold a knife
properly, and he was ready to give up.</P>
      <P>But thanks to the repeated encouragement of his father and uncle, and the shock
of seeing others get promoted ahead of him, Kuo finally saw the light. "I
couldn't throw in the towel so easily. I was determined to learn by myself if
nobody would teach me. "</P>
      <P>He began to observe how cooks cut different foods. During breaks, he would
practice cutting discarded carrots and cabbages, using his left elbow to keep
foods in place as he was cutting them. It was not an easy maneuver for him, and
he cut himself often.</P>
      <P>After several months of "groping in the dark, " he gradually acquired top
cutting skills, slicing cabbage, for instance, in consistent sizes. Fellow cooks
began calling him the "one-handed knife king."</P>
      <P>Then came the equally difficult challenge of stir-frying or sauteing foods.</P>
      <P>"Woks tend to be heavy. Every step -- stirring, seasoning or flavoring, and
heating -- should be perfectly timed for a stir-fried dish to be delicious," Kuo
relates.</P>
      <P>He remembers that he threw away the first sauteed dish he prepared after four
months of practice because other workers at his uncle's restaurant yelled that
the dish had a "burnt smell."</P>
      <P>His lack of progress left him downcast and in despair. Worse still, because he
could only use one hand to stir-fry foods, he suffered severe back ligament
injuries.</P>
      <P>"The debilitating pain frequently made me cry in the middle of the night. At one
point, I thought of giving up, " Kuo remembers.</P>
      <P>"But realizing that I didn't have too many other choices kept me from yielding.
Even though I had to endure more hardships and adversity, I couldn't afford to
give up," Kuo recounts.</P>
      <P>After three years of diligent and arduous study, Kuo finally emerged as a
skilled chef of Thai cuisine who can cut and saute a wide variety of fine Thai
dishes.</P>
      <P>In all, it took him eight years to climb to the post of chief chef at his
uncle's restaurant at the age of 24.</P>
      <P>To perfect his culinary art and skill, Kuo has traveled to Thailand many times
to study with noted Thai chefs, he said he was lucky to have such an
opportunity.</P>
      <P>"They repeatedly encouraged me to take part in culinary contests and they often
reminded me that I should never lose self-confidence because I can do with one
hand what others have to do with two hands," Kuo recalls.</P>
      <P>"Their words sounded  like a wake-up  call,  kindling  my self-confidence and
letting me understand that I'm not frail, " he says.</P>
      <P>With firm determination and plenty of confidence, Kuo decided to set up his own
restaurant at the age of 28.</P>
      <P>"Over the years, my disability has become my strength. Having recognized this,
I'm confident I can cope with many of my life's challenges ahead."</P>

      <P>More than 60 percent of sexual assault cases that result from online encounters
involve victims between the ages of 12 and 17 in Taipei City, which highlights
the vulnerability of teenagers to this type of violence, the city's Department
of Social Welfare said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Statistics from the Taipei City Center for Protection of Domestic Violence and
Sexual Assault show that in 2007, there were 82 reported cases of rape that took
place during real meetings between persons that had first made contact online,
accounting for 11.1 percent of all rape cases reported in the city during the
year.</P>
      <P>The number of such cases increased slightly to 86 in 2008, accounting for 10.8
percent of all sexual assault cases.</P>
      <P>There were 17 such cases during the first three months of 2009, accounting for
10.9 percent of all rape cases reported during that period.</P>
      <P>In these cases, the largest group of victims -- more than 60 percent -- were in
the 12-17 age group, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>Chiang Hsing-hui, director of the center, said that social workers  have found
that many teenage rape victims  had been experiencing great pressure and had
suffered setbacks and expected to gain acceptance from friends on the Internet.</P>
      <P>The desire to meet someone of the opposite sex also exposes teenagers to
dangerous situations, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>She advised parents to spend more time with their children and pay closer
attention to their Internet use to help prevent them from making any potentially
dangerous in-person contact with people they encounter casually online.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China and Taiwan have recently agreed to establish the first cross-Taiwan Strait
platform for cooperation and mutual exchanges in the telematics industry.</P>
      <P>Ke Jyh-sheng, president of Taiwan's quasi-official Institute for Information
Industry (III), signed a letter of intent Monday with Lu Ning, president of
China's Changchun Optoelectronics Information Industry Association, and Cheng
Fu-hsiung, vice chairman of the Taipei-based Taiwan Electrical Electronic
Manufacturers' Association as a precursor to the cross-strait cooperation.</P>
      <P>The cooperation agreement, once established, will allow Taiwan to assist
Changchun City, in northeastern China's Jilin Province, in developing a wireless
broadband network while opening the doors for cross-strait cooperation in the
automobile electronics and telematics application sectors.</P>
      <P>The signing of the letter of intent marked an achievement of a cross-strait
conference on telematics cooperation and exchanges that was held April 13-14 at
the Taipei World Trade Center Nangang Exhibition Hall.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan's E-Lead Electronic Corp. signed an agreement with the
College of Automotive Engineering of Jilin University Monday at the closing of
the Taipei conference, beginning the first concrete cooperation effort of the
two sides in the telematics industry.</P>
      <P>E-Lead Vice Chairman Chen Hsi-yiao said that under the new cooperative ties, his
company will work with Jilin University in the development and manufacture of
automotive electronic products.</P>
      <P>In the preliminary stage, Chen went on, the two sides will focus on efforts to
come up with an improved tire pressure monitoring system.</P>
      <P>At the signing ceremony, III Vice President Wang Wei expressed anticipation that
the pact will attract more Taiwanese automotive electronics  producers  to seek
R&amp;D collaboration  with  Jilin University, as well as with the First
Automobile Works (FAW) Group Corp., one of China's three largest auto
manufacturers.</P>
      <P>The just-ended cross-strait conference on telematics cooperation and exchanges
was the third in a series of activities prepared by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs as part of a "bridging" program it initiated to boost cross-strait
industrial and business cooperation and exchanges.</P>
      <P>The program has already succeeded in pushing through cross-strait exchanges in
the fields of traditional herbal medicine and solar energy.</P>
      <P>The telematics event drew more than 80 Chinese professionals in the field from

      <P>The government will spend up to NT$60 million (US$1.78 million) to help
households around Taiwan to improve the safety of their gas water heaters and
reduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning, Minister of the Interior Liao
Liao-yi said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Liao told a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Social Welfare and Environmental
Hygiene Committee that a recent survey shows that about 34,000 households in
Taiwan are prone to carbon monoxide poisoning because their gas water heaters
have been installed at locations where ventilation is poor.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the National Fire Agency under the Ministry of the
Interior in March, collected information from the families of 960,000 junior
middle school students.</P>
      <P>The results showed that of the 34,000 households with a high risk of carbon
monoxide poisoning, 20,000 said they would improve the situations themselves.</P>
      <P>Liao said his ministry will grant a subsidy of NT$3,000 to each of the remaining
14,000 households to reduce gas poisoning risk by relocating their gas water
heaters to safer locations or by improving the ventilation in their homes.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that he is not sure where the money will come from, but said he
will try to coordinate with the Ministry of Economic Affairs to come up with
funds for the plan.</P>
      <P>According to the National Fire Agency, most carbon monoxide poisoning accidents
caused by bathroom gas water heaters occur during the period from December to
March when people normally do not open windows in the cold season.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the agency showed that the number of carbon monoxide
poisoning accidents in Taiwan have steadily risen in recent years after falling
in 2006.</P>
      <P>There were 176 such cases nationwide in 2005, resulting in 31 deaths and 358
people injured; 38 cases in 2006, causing 20 deaths and 86 people injured; 41
cases in 2007, leading to 15 deaths and 90 people injured; and 68 cases in 2008,
killing 13 people and injuring 155 others.</P>
      <P>The statistics also showed that in January of this year alone, there were 16
carbon monoxide poisoning cases, causing 10 people to lose their lives and 40
others to suffer injuries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>18 pigs culled in Changhua County FMD scare: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  15 (CNA)
04/15/09  19:56:29
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eighteen pigs on a farm in the central county of Changhua were culled late
Monday after they were found to have developed symptoms of the highly contagious
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a county official confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chou-tseh, head of the county's Bureau of Animal Health Inspection and
Quarantine, said the 18 pigs were killed on the farm immediately after a
veterinarian  at the Changhua meat market discovered April 13 that 10 out of 50
pigs sent to the meat market by the farm appeared to have FMD symptoms.</P>
      <P>A total of 947 pigs were being raised on the farm, Kuo added.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, seven other pig farms within a 1-km radius of the farm were
disinfected later Monday in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus, and
vaccinations were also given to about 5,000 pigs being raised in the
neighborhood.</P>
      <P>According to officials of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection  and
Quarantine under the Cabinet-level  Council of Agriculture (COA), there are
about 12,000 hog farms in Taiwan, with 90 percent of their stock having received
no FMD inoculation.</P>
      <P>Monday's report was the fourth of its kind since February, following the first
case reported in Yunlin County Feb. 4, a second reported in Changhua County Feb.
9 and a third in Chiayi County March 27, COA officials reported.</P>
      <P>They urged the public not to panic over the development, describing the
appearance of sporadic cases as normal in the process of gradual reduction of
inoculation percentage on way to eradicating the disease.</P>
      <P>Under guidelines set by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), Taiwan
is entitled to apply for status as an FMD-free country with the body before its
2010 annual meeting slated for May of that year if no more cases are reported
and no vaccinations are given to livestock for one year before applying for FMD-
free status, according to the COA.</P>
      <P>Once a country reports an FMD outbreak, it can take up to 40 years before it can
eventually be listed as FMD-free, as has been the case in some European
countries, COA officials noted.</P>
      <P>The percentage of pigs in Taiwan to have received FMD vaccination has dropped
from 50 percent last November to less than 10 percent on average at each farm,
moving toward a zero injection rate so as to meet OIE requirements, COA
officials went on.</P>
      <P>After the first FMD case was reported in Taiwan March 20, 1997, Taiwan has been
trying to stamp out the disease as quickly as possible, they added.</P>
      <P>Since then, all pig farms and slaughterhouses around the country have
continuously conducted disinfection work to keep the virus at bay.</P>
      <P>Taiwan used to raise as many as 12 million pigs per year in the peak years, with
7 million exported to Japan annually, according to the COA officials. Taiwan now
raises only about 6.4 million pigs a year, mainly for local consumption, the
officials noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Formosan black bear cub was donated to the Taipei Zoo in a ceremony held
Wednesday in southern Taiwan's Pingtung County.</P>
      <P>Lee Teng-cheng, owner of the bear cub and a resident of the county's Changchi
township, said donating the four-and-a-half-month old male cub felt like "giving
away his daughter," so much so that he even prepared some of the cub's favorite
fruit as a "dowry."</P>
      <P>Jason Yeh, director of the Taipei Zoo, presided over the donation ceremony, with
Hwang Mei-hsiu, an assistant professor at National Pingtung University of
Science &amp; Technology who has long dedicated herself to research on the
bears, serving as "matchmaker."</P>
      <P>As a gesture of appreciation for Lee's generosity, Yeh also announced that
elementary school children from Changchi township will now be given free
admission to the zoo.</P>
      <P>Lee bought a pair of bears and various other wild animals more than 20 years ago
in local shops because he did not have the heart to see them being killed for
restaurant guests. He was later forced to get rid of most of them, especially
after the enactment of the Wildlife  Conservation  Act in 1989,  which prohibits
private individuals from keeping or breeding protected species.</P>
      <P>However, he could not bring himself to part with the bears, one of which gave
birth to her seventh cub late last year.</P>
      <P>Lee, who fought with the government to be allowed to keep the two previous
surviving cubs, reached an agreement with Taipei Zoo two years ago that he would
give away the latest cub because the zoo's own Formosan black bear could no
longer breed.</P>
      <P>Lee noted Wednesday that since the Formosan black bear is an endangered species,
and "not my personal asset, " he was willing to give it away, although he has
said previously that if the bears kept by government agencies or the academic
sector are barren, competent people in the private sector should be allowed to
breed the animals.</P>

      <P>The number of arriving Chinese visitors broke the 3,000 mark for the first time
Wednesday to reach 3,043, according to statistics released that day by the
Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>The tourists, among a total of 105 tour groups from major Chinese cities and
provinces, arrived in Taiwan throughout the day, either via direct charter
flights across the Taiwan Strait or through Hong Kong or Macau, Tourism Bureau
officials said.</P>
      <P>According to an agreement signed by the two sides of the Taiwan Strait last
June, Taiwan allows entry of a maximum of 3,000 Chinese tourists per day,
although due to the global economic downturn, the daily figure had never before
hit the daily limit.</P>
      <P>Tourism officials said the unrealized quotas from previous months can be used to
accommodate the influx of Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait relations improving steadily, more Chinese tourists are
expected to visit Taiwan in the future, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>As Thailand has been plagued by anti-government protests in recent weeks, the
officials said, many tourists have dropped their Thailand travel plans and have
instead included Taiwan on their vacation itineraries.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, many Hong Kong citizens also took advantage of their Easter holidays

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou urged the Executive Yuan Wednesday to integrate the seven
different versions of a draft bill on renewable energy development and push for
its passage in the current session of the legislature.</P>
      <P>Ma made the call at the opening of the third national conference on energy
policy, which is being held over two days at the Taipei International Convention
Center.</P>
      <P>Ma also stated that it is Taiwan's duty as part of the international community
to save energy and cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions  in an effort  to help
achieve  sustainable  global development.</P>
      <P>He noted that the government has set a goal of reducing energy intensity --
calculated as units of energy consumption per unit of gross domestic product --
by 20 percent in 2015 from the 2005 level, and further by 50 percent in 2025.</P>
      <P>The government will also push to cut carbon emissions in the period 2016-2020 to
the 2008 level, is aiming for a reduction in 2025 to the 2000 level, and has set
a goal of halving the volume in 2050 from the 2025 level, the president said.</P>
      <P>He said that while these are ambitious goals, no action will be taken in Taiwan
if the government does not set such targets. He also pointed out that an
environmental protection component has been included in every project in his
government's four-year NT$500 billion national economic stimulus package.</P>
      <P>Also at the opening of the energy conference, Premier Liu Chao-shuan said the
government is faced with the challenge of devising a comprehensive strategy for
the research and development of green energy technologies and to put Taiwan in
play in the expanding global market for green energy products.</P>
      <P>Liu urged the participants at the conference to set aside their preconceived
ideas and positions and assist the government in drafting a blueprint for the
development of sustainable energy.</P>
      <P>All governments around the world are facing the major task of finding a balance
among developing energy, growing the economy and protecting the environment, he
said.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the industrial, governmental and academic sectors taking part
in the energy conference were expected to discuss issues related to sustainable
development and energy safety; energy management and efficiency improvement;
energy prices and market opening; and energy technology and industrial
development.</P>
      <P>The conference was overshadowed by a German wind power company's threat to pull
its investments out of Taiwan in an attempt to push the government to come up
with concrete action in support of its policy to develop renewable energy.</P>
      <P>The conference also drew demonstrations by anti-nuclear activists who gathered
outside the venue to protest against the ongoing construction of the fourth
nuclear power plant.</P>
      <P>The national energy conference, launched in 1998, was slated to be held every
three years, but since then there had been only one other meeting -- in 2005 --
as it has been plagued by nuclear energy disputes.</P>

township signed a pledge with Hualien City Mayor Tsai Chi-ta to jointly push for
making one-day trips between the two sides possible, Hualien City officials
said.</P>
      <P>Due to the geographic proximity between the Hualien area and the Japanese
localities, the two sides are planning to work out tour packages that could
bring tourists and business people to the two countries and back within one day,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>Such an arrangement should be very appealing to both Taiwanese and Japanese
people as well as travelers from other countries, they added, forecasting that
more than 1 million foreign tourists would be attracted to eastern Taiwan's
regions each year on the planned "one-day two-countries" tour packages.</P>
      <P>Ishigaki City on Ishigaki Island is the southernmost Japanese city and the two
townships all belong to Okinawa's Yaeyama Islands, which are only about 120

      <P>Officials at the bureau quoted statistics as showing that Kaohsiung port handled
718,800 20-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in March, up from 551,000 TEUs in
February and 619,100 TEUs in January.</P>
      <P>They noted that the March figure, however, was still lower than the monthly
average of 800,000 TEUs in recent years.</P>
      <P>In the January-March period, Kaohsiung handled a total of 1.89 million TEUs,
lower than the 2.46 million TEUs recorded in the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung's container-handling volume saw an year-on-year decline for the fifth
consecutive month in February, mainly because of the severe global economic
downturn and partly because of the Lunar New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the moderate increase in March to growing exports -- an
apparent indicator that the world economy was recovering slowly.</P>
      <P>In the past years, Kaohsiung port handled nearly 10 million TEUs per year, or an
average of 800,000 TEUs per month, but the volume began to decline precipitously
in the fourth quarter of 2008, with a year-on-year decrease of more than 10
percent recorded in October, more than 24 percent in November and December, and
28 percent in January.</P>
      <P>The volume dropped to a seven-year low of 551,000 TEUs in February, before

      <P>A senior official from Taiwan gave a presentation at the annual conference of
the World Health Care Congress (WHCC) Tuesday on the country's well-developed
health insurance system.</P>
      <P>Chen Hsiao-ping, vice president of the Bureau of National Health Insurance under
the Cabinet-level Department of Health, explained in detail the historical
background of the national health insurance system, its special features,
factors contributing to its success and the challenges it faces.</P>
      <P>His address drew much attention as it came at a time when President Barack
Obama's administration is actively promoting reform of the United States' health
care system.</P>
      <P>Chen used diagrams, graphs and solid figures to give an extensive and vivid
analysis and to make comparisons between the health insurance systems in Taiwan
and the U.S.</P>
      <P>His presentation impressed many foreign public health officials and medical
professionals at the WHCC conference, which is also being attended by health
care industry representatives from across the United States and around the world
with a view to exchanging opinions and experiences in medical service
development.</P>
      <P>A number of participants asked Chen questions during the Q&amp;A session
following his speech and expressed admiration over the wide coverage, efficiency
and relatively low premiums that are the hallmarks of Taiwan's national health
insurance system. Many of them also said it is worthy of emulation by the United
States.</P>
      <P>Muhammad Yunus, the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize winner who founded Grameen Bank to
help poor people in Bangladesh build their own businesses, also spoke at the
session, recounting his experience in developing social enterprises  in
Bangladesh that offer health insurance services for impoverished people.</P>
      <P>The sixth WHCC conference opened Tuesday and will run until Thursday.</P>

      <P>If Taiwan signs an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA)  with China,
this would definitely contribute to future negotiations with the United States
on a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) , Taiwan's representative to
Washington, D.C. said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Jason C. Yuan, who is currently on a home consultation tour in Taipei, made the
remarks at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and National Defense
Committee.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from legislators after reporting on the latest developments
in Taiwan-U.S. relations and U.S. policy toward Taiwan under U.S. President
Barack Obama, Yuan said the direction of the new U.S. administration's trade
policy remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>Amid the current global economic downturn, Yuan said, calls for protectionism
are rife in the United States and its Congress is not keen on FTA talks with
other countries at the moment.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, American politicians friendly toward Taiwan have
suggested that Taiwan foster a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere.</P>
      <P>For instance, he said, if Taiwan can sign an ECFA with China, it would be very
helpful in future FTA talks with the U.S.</P>
      <P>As the Obama administration has publicly voiced support for the resumption of
visits to Taiwan by U.S. Cabinet-level officials, the Taiwan representative
office has stepped up efforts to invite senior U.S. officials to visit Taiwan in
the future, Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Yuan further said his office has also listed "signing of an extradition accord
with the U.S. and pushing the Obama administration to grant visa-free treatment
for prospective Taiwan tourists" as priority tasks on its work agenda.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's bid for joining the World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer, Yuan
said the U. S. adminsitration presented a report to Congress last week, in which
it holds a positive stance on Taiwan's bid and clearly states that it would not
like to see China interfer with the issue.</P>
      <P>WHA is the decision-making arm of the U.N.-affiliated World Health Organization.</P>

      <P>Members of the Animal Rescue Team Taiwan managed to catch six seriously ill
stray dogs in the central city of Taichung and transport them to the
organization's base in Kaohsiung City Wednesday for emergency treatment after a
marathon chase of more than 18 hours.</P>
      <P>The operation, which involved transporting the dogs over a long distance of 200
kilometers, was launched after the non-profit organization was informed that a
pack of stray dogs sheltered by a vagrant living in an abandoned property in
Taichung were suffering from severe skin disease, had lost almost all their hair
and were bleeding from many parts of their bodies.</P>
      <P>In preparation  for the rescue operation,  volunteers were dispatched one week
in advance to inspect the location, and wooden planks and cardboard were used to
block off all possible exits.</P>
      <P>The operation, however, did not go as smoothly as anticipated, although the area
was cordoned off, a blowpipe was being used to sedate the animals, and local
residents and volunteers from northern and central Taiwan joined the effort.</P>
      <P>The team eventually captured the animals after almost a whole day of work and
delivered them immediately to the Hung-Li Animal Hospital in Kaohsiung for
treatment.</P>
      <P>According to veterinarian Feng Tzung-hung, all six dogs were infected with
demodiscosis, scabies and chronic dermatitis and infested with fleas and ticks
-- conditions that were attributed to the state of their living environment.</P>
      <P>Two of the dogs were suffering from canine ehrlichiosis and coagulation
disorders, and another two had many festering wounds on their bodies, Feng said.</P>
      <P>He said that the animals will require up to two months of treatment before they
could recover fully.</P>
      <P>The rescue team, meanwhile, promised that it will help find people to adopt the
dogs when they recover.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in 1995, the Animal Rescue Team Taiwan has saved
thousands of abused and injured stray dogs and helped find homes overseas for
more than 100 of them.</P>
      <P>The organization, run by a retired math teacher Joseph Nee and his dog-loving
family, rescues strays mainly in southern Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou confirmed Thursday that President Ma Ying-
jeou is planning to attend the inauguration ceremony of El Salvadore President-
elect Mauricio Funes in June.</P>
      <P>Ou made the remarks while reporting to the Legislative Yuan about his visit to
El Salvador March 31-April 7 to cement bilateral relations with the Central
American country and express gratitude to the outgoing government for its long-
term support of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Ou said that during his meetings with Funes and El Salvadore's outgoing
President Antonio Saca he informed them both of Ma's intention to attend the
inauguration ceremony on June 1.</P>
      <P>"Funes said that it would be an honor to have President Ma at the ceremony and
that Ma will be accorded great hospitality," Ou related.</P>
      <P>The foreign ministry is currently planning Ma's state visit to El Salvador and
his delegation is likely to include a cultural performing group -- an
unprecedented arrangement that will demonstrate Taiwan's soft power, Ou said.</P>
      <P>However, the Presidential Office has not yet given a final word on the plan and
the details are still being finalized, he added.</P>
      <P>In response to ruling Kuomintang Legislator John Chiang's question on whether
New York will be the first choice for the president's transit stops, Ou said the
stopover arrangements in the United States will be in low keyed but will adhere
to the principles of "dignity, safety, comfort, convenience."</P>
      <P>Regarding bilateral relations between Taiwan and El Salvador, Ou said the ties
remain strong and that Funes' recent statements indicated that he had adopted a
more "flexible and open" stance on Taiwan relations. Since the end of last year,
Funes has been emphasizing his intention to develop economic and trade relations
with Beijing, which has been a change from the suggestions in his election
campaign that he would switch diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China, Ou
noted.</P>
      <P>"Funes stressed that his government will give top priority to the welfare of El
Salvadore's people, and that its diplomacy will be based on national interests
instead of ideology, " Ou said, adding that Funes also said he hoped to
strengthen cooperation with Taiwan at all levels.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) lowered its travel alert for certain
areas of Thailand Thursday, lifting its advisory for travelers to postpone trips

      <P>"Because the anti-government demonstrators in Thailand have ended their three-
week long protests, the foreign ministry has lowered its travel alert from
orange to yellow," the MOFA said in a press release.</P>
      <P>A yellow alert is a reminder for travelers to exercise caution, while an orange
travel alert advises travelers to postpone their trips, and a red alert warns
travelers not to enter the area in question under any circumstances.</P>

surrounding five districts -- Nonthaburi, Samut Prakan, Pathum Thani, Nakhon

      <P>Taiwan's information and communication technology (ICT) companies have a more
optimistic outlook on the economy for the second quarter of this year than they
did in the previous quarter, but remain conservative about the outlook for the
whole year, according to the results of an industry survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the survey, conducted by the Institute for Information Industry's Market
Intelligence Center (MIC) among ICT manufacturers at the beginning of the second
quarter, 42.3 percent of ICT respondents expressed confidence that the industry
will resume growth gradually in the second quarter, compared with 6.3 percent
who had said so in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>The respondents said they were particularly optimistic about the outlook for the
communication industry and the computer hardware and peripherals industry, with
80 percent of them saying they believe these sectors will maintain steady
recovery or enjoy sharp growth in the second quarter, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>MIC analyst Huang Yi-shuian attributed the overall optimistic sentiment to the
effect of government policies that include bailing out failing enterprises,
providing  unemployment  benefits and developing an economic stimulus package.</P>
      <P>More than 25 percent of computer hardware and peripherals manufacturers who
responded to the poll forecast that their business turnover will increase 41
percent to 50 percent year-on-year in the second quarter, while 44 percent of
the manufacturers predicted a downturn or growth of less than 20 percent, the
survey revealed.</P>
      <P>In terms of Taiwan's economic prospects for the whole year, the survey indicated
that 26.8 percent of respondents think the economy will rebound slowly this
year, while 47.4 percent predicted it will contract slightly or even sharply.
The figure translated into a decrease of 29.6 percent over the same period last
year when 77 percent of the respondents in a similar poll said they expected the
economy to contract.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 18.6 percent of the respondents forecast that the global ICT industry
will rebound gradually this year, while most of them predicted it will slump.</P>
      <P>The most pessimistic sentiment was found among information software and services
providers, with 70 percent of them predicting that the global ICT industry will
remain weak.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou urged Japan Thursday to upgrade the level of its economic
meetings with Taiwan to further enhance bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Economic meetings between the two countries are currently being attended by
officials at the bureau chief level, but should be upgraded to the ministerial
or vice ministerial level, Ma said.</P>
      <P>In the long term, he said, Taiwan hopes a free trade agreement or economic
partnership agreement could be established between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while receiving representatives of the Japan
Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Fukuoka Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.</P>
      <P>Ma said that soon after his inauguration in May 2008, he repositioned Taiwan
relations with Japan as a special partnership and this year has continued to
work to strengthen bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to open an office in the Hakkaido capital of Sapporo later in
the year and is preparing to set up a cultural center in Tokyo in a bid to
promote cultural and tourism exchanges between the two sides, Ma said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Taiwan-Japan working holiday program scheduled to be launched
June 1 will help to promote exchanges between young people of the two countries,
and the charter flight services set to begin in October between Taipei's
Sungshan airport and the Tokyo International Airport will be a milestone in
aviation links between the two countries, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan maintains very close trade relations with Japan, with the
bilateral trade volume in 2008 amounting to US$64 billion. Japan was Taiwan's
second-largest trading partner, and Taiwan was Japan's fifth-largest trading
partner during the year, he added.</P>
      <P>Also, the two countries concluded their 16th round of fishery talks in February,
which further cemented the relations, Ma said.</P>

      <P>The Alishan cherry blossom festival came to an end Wednesday after a month
during which it attracted 304,485 visitors to view the wide range of flower
species in the Alishan Forest Recreation Area in southern Taiwan's Chiayi
County, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The single-day number of visitors peaked at 27,186 on March 22 during the
festival, which ran from March 15-April 15, said officials of the Forestry
Bureau  under the Cabinet-level  Council  of Agriculture.</P>
      <P>Although the festival has ended, a variety of flowers, including the Cerasus
sieboldii cherry, Oshima cherry, Prunus lannesiana, camellias, azaleas and
daisies, are still in full bloom in this late spring season, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Alishan and Yangmingshan in suburban Taipei in the north of the country are two
famous sites where visitors can witness the bursting forth of spring as the
flowers bloom in splendor. However, Alishan is the only place in the country
where such large plantations of Yoshino cherry trees, originally from Japan, can
be found.</P>
      <P>The oldest Yoshino cherry tree on Alishan was planted in 1903.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Elderly cyclists embark on 2,000-km journey</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thirty elderly cyclists began a 2,000-km journey from Taiwan Thursday that will
take them to Shanghai, Nanjing and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The cyclists, with a combined age of more than 2,000, are all volunteers for
Concern &amp; Care Society, a Christian group that is dedicated to the care of
the elderly.</P>
      <P>Lee Chi-wei, leader of the group and executive director of the society, said
before their departure from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport that the ride
was planned about a year and a half ago.</P>
      <P>"All the members have undergone five sessions of physical training and physical
examination to ensure that they would be able to endure the grueling 20-day,
2,000-km trip," Lee added.</P>
      <P>The eldest member of the group, Kang Meng-lin, 84, said, "We completed an
islandwide 931-km ride in 12 days in 2007. We are confident that we can
successfully make this 2,000-km journey to Beijing."</P>
      <P>The group departed from downtown Taipei at 5 a.m. Thursday, going along Guandu
wharf and crossing the Danshui River to Pali, Taipei County, before proceeding
to Tayuan township, Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Five hours later, the cyclists, including three volunteers from Singapore,
arrived at the airport in high spirits.</P>
      <P>"The group will not focus on speed, but will hit the road with the dream of
conquering the 2,000-km challenge," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He noted that all the cyclists have served their country throughout their lives,
even after their retirement.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the ride is to send the message that "dreaming is not a
prerogative of young people only, and getting old is not the end of life, " he
said. "Those who break out of solitude can find hope in life."</P>
      <P>The group is scheduled to return to Taipei May 5.</P>
      <P>Concern &amp; Care Society, which Lee helped to found in 2001, has recruited
retirees as volunteers to visit elderly people living alone.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Loser dogs' snap back at social stereotypes</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/16/09  17:10:06</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA Staff Reporter</P>
      <P>The growing popularity of the Taiwanese television seriesMy Queen,is attributed
in no small part to the attraction it holds for tens of thousands of female
viewers, some of whom identify closely with the main character, Shan Wu-shuang.</P>
      <P>Shan is a 30-something successful single journalist who is stigmatized in the
society as aloser, ormakeinuin Japanese. She is independent and competent, but
is unpopular among her colleagues and even among some of her friends because she
is highly competitive. Despite Shan's achievements, she is viewed as a loser
because she is single -- particularly by her mother who tries everything she can
to find a love match for her daughter.</P>
      <P>The termmakeinu (loser dog) was coined by a famous Japanese female writer, Sakai
Junko, in her 2003 bestsellerMakeinu no toboe" (The Howl of the Loser Dog). In
the book, Sakai stated with some degree of pride that although many over-30
singles in Tokyo, like herself, were seen as losers, this was not necessarily
how they saw themselves because they were satisfied with their lives and their
achievements.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan society, which is heavily influenced by Japanese culture, single women
over the age of 30 often encounter the same types of pressures as females in
this age group in Japan.</P>
      <P>Eva Chang, a single 33-year-old media worker, told the CNA that it is difficult
for her to ignore the expectations of her family and the society. However, she
said firmly, she will not be rushed into marriage simply because she is
ofmarriageable age.</P>
      <P>I am single because I have not found the right person, but that is something
that takes time and patience,Chang said.</P>
      <P>She noted that in her experience, many Taiwanese men lack confidence and find
women like her intimidating because they are well-educated, financially
independent, smart, and intellectual.</P>
      <P>This female demographic in Taiwan is one that been growing in recent years.
Statistics from the Ministry of Interior show that 29.6 percent of Taiwanese
women in the age group 30-39 were single in 2007, but by 2008 the figure had
jumped to 32.3 percent.</P>
      <P>One reason for the shift may be that single women are finding ways to defang the
stigma against them in conservative East Asian societies.</P>
      <P>For example, some women in Asia used themakeinulabel to forge a positive group
identity, in much the same way that some close female friends in other societies
affectionately call each other bitchor some African Americans greet each other
asnigger, according to Lee Ming-tsung, an assistant professor at National Taiwan
University's Department and Graduate Institute of Sociology.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the mass media in Asia continues to use makeinuin a derogatory
context to describe women who are in fact independent and successful, while at
the same time it depicts marriage as the only path to happiness, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Marriage is a lifestyle that one chooses, he said.It is an important option but
not the only one, and certainly not the only one that guarantees happiness.</P>
      <P>While some people may be taking their social cues from the media in Asia, there
are others who have been immersed in Western cultures and have therefore had a
firsthand look at the status that is accorded to single women in more liberal
societies.</P>
      <P>A 36-year-old public relations specialist surnamed Wang who grew up in the
United States noted that in that country single independent women over the age
of 30 are not seen as picky or flawed in some way, but rather are regarded as
mature and attractive.</P>
      <P>Wang's personal views are more closely aligned with Western norms, as she thinks
marriage is personal choice and sees no need to marry someone unless such a
union would contribute to her happiness.</P>
      <P>One cannot force marriage, Wang said.It is something good, but I will not allow
myself to be unhappy simply because I am single."</P>
      <P>Wang said her right to choose also includes setting the standard for what she
wants in a husband.</P>
      <P>As time passes,  I might adjust my standards,  but not necessarily lower them,
she said.However, even by doing so, I would be making my own choice, and I would
be comfortable with that."</P>
      <P>How long it would take before such views become the mainstream in Taiwan is
anyone's guess, but Lee thinks that the country should not continue to lag
behind 21st century trends in this regard, as it reflects poorly on the society.</P>
      <P>It is time to stop labeling women and stereotyping minorities, because this is
not characteristic of a civil society, he said.</P>
      <P>Diversity, openness, respect and tolerance are what constitute civilization, Lee
said, adding that the mass media and schools should take the lead in reeducating
the public along these lines.</P>
      <P>On an individual level, people need to focus more on self awareness than on love
and marriage, he suggested.</P>
      <P>He thinks that a person  must first discover  and become comfortable with his or
her self before he or she could form a meaningful intimate relationship with
someone else.</P>
      <P>It's much easier to see ourselves through the eyes of others and that is why we
keep looking for someone who would be a 'mirror' for us, Lee said.However, only
when one discovers one's self can one learn to be alone and not be lonely.</P>
      <P>For Chang, being alone is nothing to balk at. One can be happy without being
married, she said.It might be a rougher path to take, but certainly not an
erroneous one.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Foreign ministry vows to respect U.S. decision on security at AIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
04/16/09  18:17:23

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said Thursday that his ministry will respect
any decision by the United States to post Marine Corps (USMC) personnel at the
new American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) compound that will be built in Taipei's
Neihu District.</P>
      <P>"We will respect the U.S. decision and will not oppose it, " Ou said at an
interpellation session of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National
Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>"We will be looking forward to it because it would have positive connotations,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Ou was responding to ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lin Yu-fang's question
on a Taipei Times report that the the USMC held a meeting with U.S. State
Department officials earlier this month in Washington to discuss proposals for
protecting a number of new U.S. embassy buildings, including the new AIT office
complex that will be completed in 2012.</P>
      <P>If the plan goes through, the Marines would be the first U.S. military forces to
be stationed in Taiwan since the U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing in 1979, the report added.</P>
      <P>AIT spokesman Thomas Hodges did not comment directly on the report, saying only
that there have been no changes in the status of this matter since the AIT's
last public discussion of it one year ago.</P>
      <P>"The AIT's planned new office in Neihu will include housing for a security
detachment. Such plans are in keeping with U.S. global security standards. These
plans represent no change in U.S. policy toward Taiwan," Hodges said.</P>
      <P>Lin suggested that if the U.S. decides to send armed Marines to take charge of
AIT security, Taiwan should also resume its posting of military police to its
representative office in Washington and its Twin Oaks Estate there.</P>
      <P>Ou said that if the U.S. makes a request to post Marine Corps guards at the AIT
new headquarters, the MOFA will of course make a similar request to send
military police to Washington, based on the principles of reciprocity and equal
status. However, this will require further discussion, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan military police posted at the country's  Washington representative office
were replaced by private armed security guards in 2003 because foreign military
police are not permitted to carry guns on U.S. soil.</P>
      <P>Opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party  Legislator  Tsai Huang-lang said if
the U.S. goes through with the plan, the significance would be twofold -- an
indirect acknowledgement of Taiwan's sovereignty and an upgrade of the
importance of security across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chang Hsien-yao also expressed a similar view, saying that it
would indirectly indicate that the AIT is being viewed as an embassy and an
extension of U.S. territory.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of diplomatic relations, Taiwan and the U.S. maintain close
substantive ties. The AIT functions as the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan and
its head is also treated as the top U.S. representative to Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Since the beginning of this year, the Prosecutors Office in southern Taiwan's
Chiayi area has given scholarships to 150 local students with money raised from
crime perpetrators, a source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Money for the scholarships -- which range from NT$2,000 (US$60) for each junior
high school student and NT$1,000 for each elementary school student in every
semester -- came from funds paid to the Chiayi Prosecutors Office by
perpetrators of minor offenses in return for deferred prosecution.</P>
      <P>The scholarships program began in 2007, benefiting 90 poor students that year,
according to a worker with the Hsin Kang Foundation of Culture and Education
(HKFCE) which cooperates in the program.</P>
      <P>The scholarships were not issued in 2008 due to insufficient time to make
arrangements, said the HKFCE official.</P>
      <P>From 2006, the Chiayi Prosecutors Office began funding local charitable groups
with the public funds to help them pay for social services for local residents,
he added.</P>
      <P>The aim is to help children from impoverished or low-income families stay in
school to continue their studies and pave a good future for them, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiayi Chief Prosecutor Hung Kuang-shuan presided over a ceremony at the Hsin
Kang Junior High School Wednesday in which he handed out the scholarships to
students of the school in need of monetary assistance. HKFCE Chairman Frank
Chang also attended the activity.</P>
      <P>Hung urged the disadvantaged students not to drop out of school because of their
families' economic difficulties and encouraged them to keep studying as a means
of finding new horizons in their lives and striving forward.</P>
      <P>"We hope that our aid would help them ride over current difficulties and make a
turnaround on the road of their lives, " he said.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi Prosecutors Office has NT$10 million (US$298,000) worth of this kind
of public funds under its disposal this year, Hung said in early January when
the office sponsored an activity to help impoverished families celebrate the
Lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>Because of the widespread economic downturn, many low income families have seen
their livelihoods greatly affected, said Hung.</P>

      <P>Launched four years ago by the Taiwan International Calligraphy Association  and
South  Korea's  ladies'  Chinese  calligraphy association, the office said the
exhibition is unlike any other because it promotes calligraphy and features
exclusively the work of female calligraphers from Asia.</P>
      <P>"Chinese calligraphy is not only part of China's cultural heritage but also
represents Oriental art, as it has been passed on to countries deeply influenced
by Chinese culture such as South Korea and Japan," the press statement said.</P>
      <P>The exhibition will be open to the public every day from 9 a.m. to 6: 30 p.m.

    <HEADLINE>Optimism growing among Taiwanese investors: survey</HEADLINE>

      <P>Forty-three percent of investors in Taiwan expect the country's economic
situation to improve in the second quarter of 2009, indicating that investors
are emerging from a prevailing sentiment of pessimism, according to the results
of a survey released Thursday by ING Investment Management Asia/Pacific.</P>
      <P>The percentage represents an upswing of 29 percentage points from the previous
survey conducted in December 2008, in which only 14 percent of Taiwanese
investors predicted the situation would be better in the first quarter of 2009.</P>
      <P>The increase is the highest seen among the 13 Asia-Pacific markets surveyed,
which also include China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>The latest survey conducted in March 2009 found that the pan-Asia investor
sentiment index -- excluding Japan, Australia and New Zealand -- stood at 85 for
the first quarter of 2009, up from 73 for the previous quarter, driven mainly by
strong confidence displayed by investors in China, India and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The increase moved the index from "pessimistic" back into the "neutral"
category.</P>
      <P>According to ING, the optimistic sentiment of Taiwanese investors is reflected
in their expectations for the stock market and stock investment returns.</P>
      <P>As many as 35 percent of Taiwanese investors surveyed in March expected the
stock index to rise in the coming quarter (Q2 2009) , while only 9 percent of
investors surveyed in December were positive about the outlook of the stock
market for the coming quarter (Q1 2009).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 40 percent of Taiwanese investors surveyed in March predicted returns
will increase in the coming quarter, when only 13 percent of respondents in
December held such a view.</P>
      <P>The feeling of optimism is also encouraging Taiwanese investors to adopt a more
aggressive approach toward investment, with the percentage of investors who
prefer high-risk investments rising from 15 percent in the fourth quarter of
2008 to 31 percent in the first quarter of 2009, the survey results show.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead to the coming quarter, 35 percent of investors in March said they
will increase cash deposits, down from 51 percent in December, and 28 percent
said they will adjust their investment portfolios.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The price of rice wine, a staple ingredient in local cuisine, is expected to
drop sharply after a legislative committee passed the first reading of an
amended tax law Thursday to reduce the duty levied on the product.</P>
      <P>The Financial Committee reviewed the draft amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol
Law regarding duty on local and imported distilled liquor and decided that the
tax will be adjusted depending on the alcohol content of the product, setting
the tariff at NT$2.5 per degree of alcohol per liter.</P>
      <P>The public is expected to be able to buy much cheaper rice wine as early as May
once the amendment clears the legislature.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der noted that a 0.6-liter bottle of rice wine sells
for around NT$180 (including NT$111 in tax) at present, and said that after the
tax cuts, the price per bottle will drop to between NT$60 and NT$65.</P>
      <P>The committee also attached a resolution that the cost of a bottle of rice wine
will not exceed NT$50. Even if this means that rice wine will be sold below cost
price, the committee believes this is the best way to eradicate the common
practice of buying much cheaper bootleg rice wine instead of the legal product.</P>
      <P>Hsu An-hsiuan, president of the state-owned Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. said
Thursday that he will continue to communicate with lawmakers, saying that he
"could only accept a price range of between NT$58 and NT$60 per bottle."</P>
      <P>Other distilled spirits such as whisky and brandy, which have a higher alcohol
content, will not see much difference in their selling prices.</P>
      <P>The ministry noted that before the implementation of the Tobacco and Alcohol
Law, rice wine sales for 1994-1996 averaged 210 million bottles annually.</P>
      <P>Since 2003, however, following Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization,  rice  wine  has  been  levied  with  an NT$185-per-liter tax in
line with WTO tax regulations on distilled spirits.</P>
      <P>Since then, annual sales of locally produced rice wine have dropped to about
750,000 bottles, just 3.6 percent of the pre-WTO volume.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Sport divers urged not to disturb coral spawning off Kenting</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Recreational divers should stay out of the water off the Kenting National Park
in southern Taiwan in the coming days to avoid disrupting the annual coral
spawning, the head of the Taiwanese Coral Reef Society (TCRS) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Coral spawning has become a famous attraction for divers in recent years, but
TCRS President Cheng Ming-hsiu said domestic conditions have "not yet matured
sufficiently" for local divers to experience such a spectacle.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the coral on the reefs around Kenting has begun spawning, an
annual spectacle that is expected to reach a peak this weekend.</P>
      <P>As the Kenting National Park Administration has failed to draw up any
regulations governing the observation of the coral spawning, Cheng said,
recreational divers should not dive in the waters off Kenting to observe the
annual spectacle.</P>
      <P>For one thing, he said, the park administration has not even set a cap on the
number of people allowed to dive in the area each day to admire the coral
spawning.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Cheng went on, the spawning is best observed at night, and night
diving requires advanced training.</P>
      <P>"Without proper training and equipment, divers are likely to sustain injuries or
damage the coral and other marine resources, " Cheng explained.</P>
      <P>Another problem lies in the fact that no local insurance companies are willing
to sell insurance policies to local divers at the moment, with the exception of
Cathay Life Insurance Co., which provides coverage for marine researchers with
Academia Sinica, Taiwan's foremost academic institute.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, some local divers have joined dive trips arranged by local
operators to experience the coral spawning in recent years, posing a threat to
the coral reef ecosystems, as well as their own safety.</P>
      <P>To discourage people from diving in the area during the spawning period, Cheng
said his association will cooperate with Public Television Service to broadcast
live footage of the coral spawning this Saturday at 8 p.m.</P>
      <P>"Our underwater camera crew will present every aspect of the spawning of coral,
as well as the reef's fish and invertebrates, to TV viewers," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He also urged the government to revise its civil service recruitment system to
pave the way for employing marine biologists and ecologists in public service,
thus better protecting the country's marine resources and ecosystems.</P>

      <P>Echoing a call from President Ma Ying-jeou for the speedy enactment of a draft
statute for renewable energy development, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Thursday
that the Cabinet has designated 2009 as "the year to start up the renewable
energy act."</P>
      <P>Liu made the pledge at the closing ceremony of a national energy conference --
the third of its kind in Taiwan -- aimed at charting the country's energy
policy.</P>
      <P>Noting that the renewable energy development statute pending legislative
approval is aimed at building Taiwan into a low-carbon society with low carbon
dioxide emissions, Liu said the executive branch will make every effort to push
the Legislative Yuan to pass the bill this year.</P>
      <P>The passage of the bill will provide  a legal basis for establishing a mechanism
for the procurement of renewable energy, figuring out viable market prices and
removing hurdles to the development of renewable energy,  Liu said,  adding that
only completion of this groundwork can turn Taiwan into an advanced country in
terms of renewable energy development.</P>
      <P>He also reaffirmed the government's commitment to accelerating the development
of green energy industries through technological breakthroughs, increased
investment and market opening.</P>
      <P>"It is believed that guided by a low-carbon industrial policy, green energy
industries, including the solar power industry, will inject new blood into the
local economy, " the premier said confidently.</P>
      <P>On the development of nuclear energy, Liu commented that the controversial form
of energy is a "transitional option" in the process of Taiwan's metamorphosis
into a low-carbon society.</P>
      <P>"With three nuclear power plants in operation and another under construction,
Taiwan cannot deny the fact that nuclear energy is one of its transitional
options on its way toward a low-carbon society, " Liu said in response to
protests by anti-nuclear power activists over the government's energy policy.</P>
      <P>In the future, Liu went on, the government will focus its concern and energy on
ensuring the safety of its nuclear power generators, improving  radioactive
waste  treatment  technology,  enhancing operational transparency  and
reinforcing public supervision of nuclear power generation.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) is keeping close tabs on foreign

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou urged Japan Thursday to upgrade the level of its economic
meetings with Taiwan to further enhance bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Economic meetings between the two countries are currently being attended by
officials at the bureau chief level, but should be upgraded to the ministerial
or vice ministerial level, Ma said.</P>
      <P>In the long term, he said, Taiwan hopes a free trade agreement or economic
partnership agreement could be established between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks while receiving representatives of the Japan
Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Fukuoka Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.</P>
      <P>Ma said that soon after his inauguration in May 2008, he repositioned Taiwan
relations with Japan as a special partnership and this year has continued to
work to strengthen bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to open an office in the Hakkaido capital of Sapporo later in
the year and is preparing to set up a cultural center in Tokyo in a bid to
promote cultural and tourism exchanges between the two sides, Ma said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Taiwan-Japan working holiday program scheduled to be launched
June 1 will help to promote exchanges between young people of the two countries,
and the charter flight services set to begin in October between Taipei's
Sungshan airport and the Tokyo International Airport will be a milestone in
aviation links between the two countries, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan maintains very close trade relations with Japan, with the
bilateral trade volume in 2008 amounting to US$64 billion. Japan was Taiwan's
second-largest trading partner, and Taiwan was Japan's fifth-largest trading
partner during the year, he added.</P>
      <P>Also, the two countries concluded their 16th round of fishery talks in February,
which further cemented the relations, Ma said.</P>

      <P>The Alishan cherry blossom festival came to an end Wednesday after a month
during which it attracted 304,485 visitors to view the wide range of flower
species in the Alishan Forest Recreation Area in southern Taiwan's Chiayi
County, officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The single-day number of visitors peaked at 27,186 on March 22 during the
festival, which ran from March 15-April 15, said officials of the Forestry

      <P>Thirty elderly cyclists began a 2,000-km journey from Taiwan Thursday that will
take them to Shanghai, Nanjing and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The cyclists, with a combined age of more than 2,000, are all volunteers for
Concern &amp; Care Society, a Christian group that is dedicated to the care of
the elderly.</P>
      <P>Lee Chi-wei, leader of the group and executive director of the society, said
before their departure from Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport that the ride
was planned about a year and a half ago.</P>
      <P>"All the members have undergone five sessions of physical training and physical
examination to ensure that they would be able to endure the grueling 20-day,
2,000-km trip," Lee added.</P>
      <P>The eldest member of the group, Kang Meng-lin, 84, said, "We completed an
islandwide 931-km ride in 12 days in 2007. We are confident that we can
successfully make this 2,000-km journey to Beijing."</P>
      <P>The group departed from downtown Taipei at 5 a.m. Thursday, going along Guandu
wharf and crossing the Danshui River to Pali, Taipei County, before proceeding
to Tayuan township, Taoyuan County.</P>
      <P>Five hours later, the cyclists, including three volunteers from Singapore,
arrived at the airport in high spirits.</P>
      <P>"The group will not focus on speed, but will hit the road with the dream of
conquering the 2,000-km challenge," Lee said.</P>
      <P>He noted that all the cyclists have served their country throughout their lives,
even after their retirement.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the ride is to send the message that "dreaming is not a
prerogative of young people only, and getting old is not the end of life, " he
said. "Those who break out of solitude can find hope in life."</P>
      <P>The group is scheduled to return to Taipei May 5.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Loser dogs' snap back at social stereotypes</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/16/09  17:10:06</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>CNA Staff Reporter</P>
      <P>The growing popularity of the Taiwanese television seriesMy Queen,is attributed
in no small part to the attraction it holds for tens of thousands of female
viewers, some of whom identify closely with the main character, Shan Wu-shuang.</P>
      <P>Shan is a 30-something successful single journalist who is stigmatized in the
society as aloser, ormakeinuin Japanese. She is independent and competent, but
is unpopular among her colleagues and even among some of her friends because she
is highly competitive. Despite Shan's achievements, she is viewed as a loser
because she is single -- particularly by her mother who tries everything she can
to find a love match for her daughter.</P>
      <P>The termmakeinu (loser dog) was coined by a famous Japanese female writer, Sakai
Junko, in her 2003 bestsellerMakeinu no toboe" (The Howl of the Loser Dog). In
the book, Sakai stated with some degree of pride that although many over-30
singles in Tokyo, like herself, were seen as losers, this was not necessarily
how they saw themselves because they were satisfied with their lives and their
achievements.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan society, which is heavily influenced by Japanese culture, single women
over the age of 30 often encounter the same types of pressures as females in
this age group in Japan.</P>
      <P>Eva Chang, a single 33-year-old media worker, told the CNA that it is difficult
for her to ignore the expectations of her family and the society. However, she
said firmly, she will not be rushed into marriage simply because she is
ofmarriageable age.</P>
      <P>I am single because I have not found the right person, but that is something
that takes time and patience,Chang said.</P>
      <P>She noted that in her experience, many Taiwanese men lack confidence and find
women like her intimidating because they are well-educated, financially
independent, smart, and intellectual.</P>
      <P>This female demographic in Taiwan is one that been growing in recent years.
Statistics from the Ministry of Interior show that 29.6 percent of Taiwanese
women in the age group 30-39 were single in 2007, but by 2008 the figure had
jumped to 32.3 percent.</P>
      <P>One reason for the shift may be that single women are finding ways to defang the
stigma against them in conservative East Asian societies.</P>
      <P>For example, some women in Asia used themakeinulabel to forge a positive group
identity, in much the same way that some close female friends in other societies
affectionately call each other bitchor some African Americans greet each other
asnigger, according to Lee Ming-tsung, an assistant professor at National Taiwan
University's Department and Graduate Institute of Sociology.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that the mass media in Asia continues to use makeinuin a derogatory
context to describe women who are in fact independent and successful, while at
the same time it depicts marriage as the only path to happiness, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Marriage is a lifestyle that one chooses, he said.It is an important option but
not the only one, and certainly not the only one that guarantees happiness.</P>
      <P>While some people may be taking their social cues from the media in Asia, there
are others who have been immersed in Western cultures and have therefore had a
firsthand look at the status that is accorded to single women in more liberal
societies.</P>
      <P>A 36-year-old public relations specialist surnamed Wang who grew up in the
United States noted that in that country single independent women over the age
of 30 are not seen as picky or flawed in some way, but rather are regarded as
mature and attractive.</P>
      <P>Wang's personal views are more closely aligned with Western norms, as she thinks
marriage is personal choice and sees no need to marry someone unless such a
union would contribute to her happiness.</P>
      <P>One cannot force marriage, Wang said.It is something good, but I will not allow
myself to be unhappy simply because I am single."</P>
      <P>Wang said her right to choose also includes setting the standard for what she
wants in a husband.</P>
      <P>As time passes,  I might adjust my standards,  but not necessarily lower them,
she said.However, even by doing so, I would be making my own choice, and I would
be comfortable with that."</P>
      <P>How long it would take before such views become the mainstream in Taiwan is
anyone's guess, but Lee thinks that the country should not continue to lag
behind 21st century trends in this regard, as it reflects poorly on the society.</P>
      <P>It is time to stop labeling women and stereotyping minorities, because this is
not characteristic of a civil society, he said.</P>
      <P>Diversity, openness, respect and tolerance are what constitute civilization, Lee
said, adding that the mass media and schools should take the lead in reeducating
the public along these lines.</P>
      <P>On an individual level, people need to focus more on self awareness than on love
and marriage, he suggested.</P>
      <P>He thinks that a person  must first discover  and become comfortable with his or
her self before he or she could form a meaningful intimate relationship with
someone else.</P>
      <P>It's much easier to see ourselves through the eyes of others and that is why we
keep looking for someone who would be a 'mirror' for us, Lee said.However, only
when one discovers one's self can one learn to be alone and not be lonely.</P>
      <P>For Chang, being alone is nothing to balk at. One can be happy without being
married, she said.It might be a rougher path to take, but certainly not an
erroneous one.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Foreign ministry vows to respect U.S. decision on security at AIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
04/16/09  18:17:23

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Francisco H.L. Ou said Thursday that his ministry will respect
any decision by the United States to post Marine Corps (USMC) personnel at the
new American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) compound that will be built in Taipei's
Neihu District.</P>
      <P>"We will respect the U.S. decision and will not oppose it, " Ou said at an
interpellation session of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National
Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>"We will be looking forward to it because it would have positive connotations,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Ou was responding to ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Lin Yu-fang's question
on a Taipei Times report that the the USMC held a meeting with U.S. State
Department officials earlier this month in Washington to discuss proposals for
protecting a number of new U.S. embassy buildings, including the new AIT office
complex that will be completed in 2012.</P>
      <P>If the plan goes through, the Marines would be the first U.S. military forces to
be stationed in Taiwan since the U.S. switched diplomatic recognition from
Taipei to Beijing in 1979, the report added.</P>
      <P>AIT spokesman Thomas Hodges did not comment directly on the report, saying only
that there have been no changes in the status of this matter since the AIT's
last public discussion of it one year ago.</P>
      <P>"The AIT's planned new office in Neihu will include housing for a security
detachment. Such plans are in keeping with U.S. global security standards. These
plans represent no change in U.S. policy toward Taiwan," Hodges said.</P>
      <P>Lin suggested that if the U.S. decides to send armed Marines to take charge of
AIT security, Taiwan should also resume its posting of military police to its
representative office in Washington and its Twin Oaks Estate there.</P>
      <P>Ou said that if the U.S. makes a request to post Marine Corps guards at the AIT
new headquarters, the MOFA will of course make a similar request to send
military police to Washington, based on the principles of reciprocity and equal
status. However, this will require further discussion, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan military police posted at the country's  Washington representative office
were replaced by private armed security guards in 2003 because foreign military
police are not permitted to carry guns on U.S. soil.</P>
      <P>Opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party  Legislator  Tsai Huang-lang said if
the U.S. goes through with the plan, the significance would be twofold -- an
indirect acknowledgement of Taiwan's sovereignty and an upgrade of the
importance of security across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chang Hsien-yao also expressed a similar view, saying that it
would indirectly indicate that the AIT is being viewed as an embassy and an
extension of U.S. territory.</P>
      <P>Despite the absence of diplomatic relations, Taiwan and the U.S. maintain close
substantive ties. The AIT functions as the de facto U.S. embassy in Taiwan and
its head is also treated as the top U.S. representative to Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, the Prosecutors Office in southern Taiwan's
Chiayi area has given scholarships to 150 local students with money raised from
crime perpetrators, a source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Money for the scholarships -- which range from NT$2,000 (US$60) for each junior
high school student and NT$1,000 for each elementary school student in every
semester -- came from funds paid to the Chiayi Prosecutors Office by
perpetrators of minor offenses in return for deferred prosecution.</P>
      <P>The scholarships program began in 2007, benefiting 90 poor students that year,
according to a worker with the Hsin Kang Foundation of Culture and Education
(HKFCE) which cooperates in the program.</P>
      <P>The scholarships were not issued in 2008 due to insufficient time to make
arrangements, said the HKFCE official.</P>
      <P>From 2006, the Chiayi Prosecutors Office began funding local charitable groups
with the public funds to help them pay for social services for local residents,
he added.</P>
      <P>The aim is to help children from impoverished or low-income families stay in
school to continue their studies and pave a good future for them, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiayi Chief Prosecutor Hung Kuang-shuan presided over a ceremony at the Hsin
Kang Junior High School Wednesday in which he handed out the scholarships to
students of the school in need of monetary assistance. HKFCE Chairman Frank
Chang also attended the activity.</P>
      <P>Hung urged the disadvantaged students not to drop out of school because of their
families' economic difficulties and encouraged them to keep studying as a means
of finding new horizons in their lives and striving forward.</P>
      <P>"We hope that our aid would help them ride over current difficulties and make a
turnaround on the road of their lives, " he said.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi Prosecutors Office has NT$10 million (US$298,000) worth of this kind
of public funds under its disposal this year, Hung said in early January when
the office sponsored an activity to help impoverished families celebrate the
Lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>Because of the widespread economic downturn, many low income families have seen
their livelihoods greatly affected, said Hung.</P>

      <P>Forty-three percent of investors in Taiwan expect the country's economic
situation to improve in the second quarter of 2009, indicating that investors
are emerging from a prevailing sentiment of pessimism, according to the results
of a survey released Thursday by ING Investment Management Asia/Pacific.</P>
      <P>The percentage represents an upswing of 29 percentage points from the previous
survey conducted in December 2008, in which only 14 percent of Taiwanese
investors predicted the situation would be better in the first quarter of 2009.</P>
      <P>The increase is the highest seen among the 13 Asia-Pacific markets surveyed,
which also include China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>The latest survey conducted in March 2009 found that the pan-Asia investor
sentiment index -- excluding Japan, Australia and New Zealand -- stood at 85 for
the first quarter of 2009, up from 73 for the previous quarter, driven mainly by
strong confidence displayed by investors in China, India and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The increase moved the index from "pessimistic" back into the "neutral"
category.</P>
      <P>According to ING, the optimistic sentiment of Taiwanese investors is reflected
in their expectations for the stock market and stock investment returns.</P>
      <P>As many as 35 percent of Taiwanese investors surveyed in March expected the
stock index to rise in the coming quarter (Q2 2009) , while only 9 percent of
investors surveyed in December were positive about the outlook of the stock
market for the coming quarter (Q1 2009).</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 40 percent of Taiwanese investors surveyed in March predicted returns
will increase in the coming quarter, when only 13 percent of respondents in
December held such a view.</P>
      <P>The feeling of optimism is also encouraging Taiwanese investors to adopt a more
aggressive approach toward investment, with the percentage of investors who
prefer high-risk investments rising from 15 percent in the fourth quarter of
2008 to 31 percent in the first quarter of 2009, the survey results show.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead to the coming quarter, 35 percent of investors in March said they
will increase cash deposits, down from 51 percent in December, and 28 percent
said they will adjust their investment portfolios.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The price of rice wine, a staple ingredient in local cuisine, is expected to
drop sharply after a legislative committee passed the first reading of an
amended tax law Thursday to reduce the duty levied on the product.</P>
      <P>The Financial Committee reviewed the draft amendment to the Tobacco and Alcohol
Law regarding duty on local and imported distilled liquor and decided that the
tax will be adjusted depending on the alcohol content of the product, setting
the tariff at NT$2.5 per degree of alcohol per liter.</P>
      <P>The public is expected to be able to buy much cheaper rice wine as early as May
once the amendment clears the legislature.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Lee Sush-der noted that a 0.6-liter bottle of rice wine sells
for around NT$180 (including NT$111 in tax) at present, and said that after the
tax cuts, the price per bottle will drop to between NT$60 and NT$65.</P>
      <P>The committee also attached a resolution that the cost of a bottle of rice wine
will not exceed NT$50. Even if this means that rice wine will be sold below cost
price, the committee believes this is the best way to eradicate the common
practice of buying much cheaper bootleg rice wine instead of the legal product.</P>
      <P>Hsu An-hsiuan, president of the state-owned Taiwan Tobacco and Liquor Corp. said
Thursday that he will continue to communicate with lawmakers, saying that he
"could only accept a price range of between NT$58 and NT$60 per bottle."</P>
      <P>Other distilled spirits such as whisky and brandy, which have a higher alcohol
content, will not see much difference in their selling prices.</P>
      <P>The ministry noted that before the implementation of the Tobacco and Alcohol
Law, rice wine sales for 1994-1996 averaged 210 million bottles annually.</P>
      <P>Since 2003, however, following Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization,  rice  wine  has  been  levied  with  an NT$185-per-liter tax in
line with WTO tax regulations on distilled spirits.</P>
      <P>Since then, annual sales of locally produced rice wine have dropped to about
750,000 bottles, just 3.6 percent of the pre-WTO volume.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Sport divers urged not to disturb coral spawning off Kenting</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Recreational divers should stay out of the water off the Kenting National Park
in southern Taiwan in the coming days to avoid disrupting the annual coral
spawning, the head of the Taiwanese Coral Reef Society (TCRS) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Coral spawning has become a famous attraction for divers in recent years, but
TCRS President Cheng Ming-hsiu said domestic conditions have "not yet matured
sufficiently" for local divers to experience such a spectacle.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, the coral on the reefs around Kenting has begun spawning, an
annual spectacle that is expected to reach a peak this weekend.</P>
      <P>As the Kenting National Park Administration has failed to draw up any
regulations governing the observation of the coral spawning, Cheng said,
recreational divers should not dive in the waters off Kenting to observe the
annual spectacle.</P>
      <P>For one thing, he said, the park administration has not even set a cap on the
number of people allowed to dive in the area each day to admire the coral
spawning.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Cheng went on, the spawning is best observed at night, and night
diving requires advanced training.</P>
      <P>"Without proper training and equipment, divers are likely to sustain injuries or
damage the coral and other marine resources, " Cheng explained.</P>
      <P>Another problem lies in the fact that no local insurance companies are willing
to sell insurance policies to local divers at the moment, with the exception of
Cathay Life Insurance Co., which provides coverage for marine researchers with
Academia Sinica, Taiwan's foremost academic institute.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, some local divers have joined dive trips arranged by local
operators to experience the coral spawning in recent years, posing a threat to
the coral reef ecosystems, as well as their own safety.</P>
      <P>To discourage people from diving in the area during the spawning period, Cheng
said his association will cooperate with Public Television Service to broadcast
live footage of the coral spawning this Saturday at 8 p.m.</P>
      <P>"Our underwater camera crew will present every aspect of the spawning of coral,
as well as the reef's fish and invertebrates, to TV viewers," Cheng said.</P>
      <P>He also urged the government to revise its civil service recruitment system to
pave the way for employing marine biologists and ecologists in public service,
thus better protecting the country's marine resources and ecosystems.</P>

      <P>Echoing a call from President Ma Ying-jeou for the speedy enactment of a draft
statute for renewable energy development, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Thursday
that the Cabinet has designated 2009 as "the year to start up the renewable
energy act."</P>
      <P>Liu made the pledge at the closing ceremony of a national energy conference --
the third of its kind in Taiwan -- aimed at charting the country's energy
policy.</P>
      <P>Noting that the renewable energy development statute pending legislative
approval is aimed at building Taiwan into a low-carbon society with low carbon
dioxide emissions, Liu said the executive branch will make every effort to push
the Legislative Yuan to pass the bill this year.</P>
      <P>The passage of the bill will provide  a legal basis for establishing a mechanism
for the procurement of renewable energy, figuring out viable market prices and
removing hurdles to the development of renewable energy,  Liu said,  adding that
only completion of this groundwork can turn Taiwan into an advanced country in
terms of renewable energy development.</P>
      <P>He also reaffirmed the government's commitment to accelerating the development
of green energy industries through technological breakthroughs, increased
investment and market opening.</P>
      <P>"It is believed that guided by a low-carbon industrial policy, green energy
industries, including the solar power industry, will inject new blood into the
local economy, " the premier said confidently.</P>
      <P>On the development of nuclear energy, Liu commented that the controversial form
of energy is a "transitional option" in the process of Taiwan's metamorphosis
into a low-carbon society.</P>
      <P>"With three nuclear power plants in operation and another under construction,
Taiwan cannot deny the fact that nuclear energy is one of its transitional
options on its way toward a low-carbon society, " Liu said in response to
protests by anti-nuclear power activists over the government's energy policy.</P>
      <P>In the future, Liu went on, the government will focus its concern and energy on
ensuring the safety of its nuclear power generators, improving  radioactive
waste  treatment  technology,  enhancing operational transparency  and
reinforcing public supervision of nuclear power generation.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH) is keeping close tabs on foreign

      <P>Echoing a call from President Ma Ying-jeou for the speedy enactment of a draft
statute for renewable energy development, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Thursday
that the Cabinet has designated 2009 as "the year to start up the renewable
energy act."</P>
      <P>Liu made the pledge at the closing ceremony of a national energy conference --
the third of its kind in Taiwan -- aimed at charting the country's energy
policy.</P>
      <P>Noting that the renewable energy development statute pending legislative
approval is aimed at building Taiwan into a low-carbon society with low carbon
dioxide emissions, Liu said the executive branch will make every effort to push
the Legislative Yuan to pass the bill this year.</P>
      <P>The passage of the bill will provide  a legal basis for establishing a mechanism
for the procurement of renewable energy, figuring out viable market prices and
removing hurdles to the development of renewable energy,  Liu said,  adding that
only completion of this groundwork can turn Taiwan into an advanced country in
terms of renewable energy development.</P>
      <P>He also reaffirmed the government's commitment to accelerating the development
of green energy industries through technological breakthroughs, increased
investment and market opening.</P>
      <P>"It is believed that guided by a low-carbon industrial policy, green energy
industries, including the solar power industry, will inject new blood into the
local economy, " the premier said confidently.</P>
      <P>On the development of nuclear energy, Liu commented that the controversial form
of energy is a "transitional option" in the process of Taiwan's metamorphosis
into a low-carbon society.</P>
      <P>"With three nuclear power plants in operation and another under construction,
Taiwan cannot deny the fact that nuclear energy is one of its transitional
options on its way toward a low-carbon society, " Liu said in response to
protests by anti-nuclear power activists over the government's energy policy.</P>
      <P>In the future, Liu went on, the government will focus its concern and energy on
ensuring the safety of its nuclear power generators, improving  radioactive
waste  treatment  technology,  enhancing operational transparency  and
reinforcing public supervision of nuclear power generation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A flagship store selling Hakka-themed souvenirs -- the first of its kind in the
capital -- was officially opened Friday in Taipei as part of the government's
efforts to promote Hakka culture and related local industries.</P>
      <P>Huang Yu-cheng, minister of the Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs, said at
a news conference that promoting the development of Hakka industries is his
council's most important task this year.</P>
      <P>"I'm glad the initial results have been achieved with the opening of this
flagship store, " Huang said. "The brand `Hakka Taiwan' is the council's
guarantee of high quality products."</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the council has been helping Hakka villages to develop
characteristic souvenirs by providing consultations on quality control,
packaging and marketing.</P>
      <P>More than 299 companies have been included in the program, launching more than
530 Hakka-themed products ranging from snacks and tea products to handicrafts
and cosmetics, he added.</P>
      <P>"With 11 more Hakka souvenir stores set to open around the country this year,
the next step will be taking our Hakka products to the international stage,"
Huang continued, adding that the council is seeking opportunities to help Hakka
products gain a presence in international exhibitions such as food fairs.</P>
      <P>In addition to the flagship  store located at the Taiwan Handicraft Promotion
Center in downtown Taipei, three more retail outlets are scheduled to open in
the coming weeks -- in Miaoli's Da Hu Wineland Resort, the Guansi Rest Area on
the No. 3 Freeway and the Lion's Head Mountain Scenic Area in Hsinchu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chinese daily tourist arrivals expected to average 4,100 next week</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of arriving tourists from China is expected to hit an average of
4,100 per day next week since the National Immigration  Agency (NIA)  adjusted
the mechanism for calculating the daily quota for Chinese tourists allowed to
visit Taiwan from April 16, a Tourism Bureau official said Friday.</P>
      <P>On Thursday alone, 6,809 Chinese arrived in Taiwan, including 5,379 ordinary
tourists and a group of 1,430 workers for Amway China, which had applied for
groups of its employees to visit Taiwan on a special-case basis, according to
Tourism Bureau statistics.</P>
      <P>Chinese tourist arrivals have been increasing sharply since mid-March, the
official went on, citing statistics that show the daily number of tourist
arrivals from China averaged 631 in January, 593 in February, 1,946 in March and
2,945 in the first half of April.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau estimated that the weekly number of inbound tourists from
China will set a new high of over 28,700 from April 17-April 23.</P>
      <P>Under an agreement reached by Taiwan and China last June, the number of Chinese
allowed to visit Taiwan was capped at 3,000 per day, but arrivals in late April
and May are expected to exceed that number, according to the official.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the NIA has begun drawing from the 170,000 quota slots that went
unused during the first three months of 2009 to provide additional spots beyond
the daily cap to meet demand.</P>
      <P>Although according to the agreement with China, Taiwan is allowed to adjust
upward the daily ceiling for Chinese visitor arrivals one year after it opening
its doors to Chinese tourists July 4 last year, the Tourism Bureau has no plans
to make permanent adjustments, said Janice Lai, director-general of the bureau.</P>
      <P>With the daily number of Chinese tourists soaring past the 3,000 cap, the bureau
will focus its efforts on ensuring that local travel agencies maintain high
service standards and stick to a requirement that Chinese tourists should be
granted treatment costing no less than US$60 per day, she went on.</P>
      <P>In order to cope with the problems of inadequate numbers of hotel rooms and tour
buses to accommodate the anticipated huge influx of Chinese visitors, Lai said
an additional 474 hotels and a number of homestays will be used to meet the
demand, while the bureau is studying the possibility of including leisure farms
with lodging facilities into their travel itineraries, Lai said.</P>
      <P>The Directorate  General of Highways is also evaluating a suggestion by tourism
operators to relax a restriction that tour buses used to transport Chinese
tourists must not be in operation for more than seven years and that coaches
bought from the United States and Europe in operation for less than 10 years
should be allowed to be used.</P>

      <P>The average cargo load factor for cargo charter flights between Taiwan and China
increased to over 80 percent last week, due probably to an improvement in the
economic situation, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>CAA statistics show that the services, launched last Dec. 15 following the
signing of a cross-strait pact the previous month, recorded an average cargo
load factor of just 44 percent in the first four weeks following their
inauguration.</P>
      <P>The factor rose to 55.6 percent during the fifth to eighth weeks and further to
64.7 percent during the ninth to 12th weeks.</P>
      <P>Between the 13th and 16th weeks, the factor climbed to 71.09 percent, reaching
82.4 percent in the week of April 6-12, the most recent week for which figures
were available, according to the CAA.</P>
      <P>The pact allows carriers from both sides to operate up to 60 cargo charter
flights per month in total, with 30 flights between Shanghai and Taoyuan or
Kaohsiung and another 30 flights between Guangzhou and Taoyuan or Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>However, no carriers have opted to operate the Guangzhou route so far, mainly
because of its proximity to Hong Kong, while the Shanghai route is being
operated at full capacity.</P>

      <P>The Chung-Hua Institute for Economic Research (CIER) , a local think tank,
revised its prediction Friday for Taiwan's economic performance  in 2009 to a
3.59 percent contraction, but forecast the economy will grow by 3.88 percent the
following year.</P>
      <P>The latest forecast was announced at a press conference presided over by CIER
President Daigee Shaw and Wang Lee-rong, director of the institute's Center for
Economic Forecasting.</P>
      <P>Wang described the economic condition in 2009 as "tough, " but said stock
trading has been showing signs of improvement.</P>
      <P>According to the CIER report, the economy continued to be marred in Q1 by the
economic downturn that began in the second half of 2008.</P>
      <P>Overshadowed by the lingering recession, the economy is forecast to contract by
9.12 percent in Q1 while shrinking by 6.61 percent in Q2, according to the CIER
forecast.</P>
      <P>It also predicted an economic contraction of 2.37 percent in Q3, but said the
downturn will bottom out in Q4 to produce a growth of 4.12 percent.</P>
      <P>At the end of 2008, the institute publicized its economic outlook for 2009 as a
growth of 1.24 percent.</P>
      <P>Amid the recession, many domestic and foreign research institutes have made
downward adjustments to their economic predictions for the country, with the
Polaris Research Institute putting forward up the most pessimistic forecast of a
4.8 percent contraction.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CIER also predicted that the annual consumption will shrink by 0.06
percent in the first half of the year and that domestic investment will contract
by 29.49 percent in the six-month period.</P>
      <P>The consumer price index will contract by 0.69 percent in 2009, while the
wholesale price index will shrink by 6.91 percent, according to the CIER report,
which forecast that the average value of the U.S. dollar against the new Taiwan
dollar will be NT$33.6 this year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the unemployment rate will register 5.88 percent on average in 2009,
higher than the 2008 level of 4.14 percent, the CIER predicted.</P>
      <P>In 2010, consumption is expected to grow by 1.32 percent, while domestic
investment will rise by 4.81 percent, the research institute forecast,
predicting an average of NT$32.88 against the greenback that year and an average
5.72 percent unemployment rate.</P>

      <P>The panda house at the Taipei Zoo received Friday its 1 millionth visitor since
its opening less than three months ago to showcase two pandas given by China to

      <P>The pandas were offered to Taiwan as a gift in 2005 after a visit to China by

    <HEADLINE>AIT announces Taiwan's finalists for democracy video challenge</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) on Friday announced Taiwan's finalists
for the worldwide  contest "Democracy Video Challenge (DVC) aimed at enhancing
the global dialogue on democracy.</P>
      <P>AIT Director Stephen M. Young, who presented certificates to Taiwanese finalists
at a news conference, said the AIT launched the contest in Taiwan in October
2008 to engage individuals from Taiwan in a global dialogue on democracy.</P>
      <P>The challenge provided an opportunity for dialogue and exchange on the important
subject of democracy, Young said.Democracy is a fundamental value shared by the
people of the United States and the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Michael Ying-mao Kau, former deputy foreign minister and a senior fellow of the
event partner Taiwan Foundation for Democracy (TFD) , said at the news
conference that the holding of the competition is significant on three levels.</P>
      <P>While the competition demonstrates the U.S.soft power in promoting democracy, it
also serves as a platform for the young generation to think over the question of
what democracy is, Kau said.</P>
      <P>It also provides a chance for Taiwanese people to think about the nature of our
own democracy and in which direction our democratic development should go,he
added.</P>
      <P>Announced by the AIT last fall,  the DVC is a worldwide competition initiated by
the U.S. Department of State which asks budding filmmakers, democracy advocates,
and the general public to create three minute YouTube videos that complete the
phrase, Democracy is...."</P>
      <P>Selected from a total of eight entries by a panel of democracy advocates, film
scholars and AIT representatives, the Taiwanese finalists areDBC Jmovie-
Democracy,Goldfish, Ocean, Democracy, andDemocracy.</P>
      <P>Lee Chia-hua and Chang Chia-yun, filmmakers ofDemocracyand freshmen in National
Taiwan University of ArtsDepartment  of Filmmaking, told the Central News Agency
that to them, democracy is respecting and listening to others so that everyone
can create a better world together.</P>
      <P>Lee said that through making the video, she had a deeper understanding of the
meaning of democracy, especially when she had to research for certain democracy
movement events that happened in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Asked if the theme of the challenge is a bit too serious, Chang said democracy
does not have to be a serious topic, but rather an interesting one because it
all depends on the angle from which people interpret it.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan finalists, whose videos can be found at http:
//www.videochallenge.america.gov/video.html, will now compete with other entries
from the East Asia Pacific region.</P>
      <P>A judging panel in the United States will choose the best three, who will then
join a worldwide competition, according to Scott Robinson, director of the AIT's
American Cultural Center.</P>
      <P>Seven winning videos -- one each from Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and Pacific,
Europe, the Near East and North Africa, South and Central Asia, and the Western
Hemisphere, as well as one anonymous video -- will be chosen through public
voting on YouTube, Robinson said.</P>
      <P>They will be eligible for an all-expenses paid trip to the U.S. that includes
screenings of their videos in New York, Hollywood and Washington, meetings with
film directors, public officials and democracy advocates, and visits to film
sets and television program sets, he added.</P>
      <P>Friday's awards ceremony was co-hosted by the Taiwan partners of the DVC,
including the TFD, the Council for Cultural Affairs, Chinese Taipei Film
Archive, Taiwan Film and Culture Association, SPOT Taipei Film House and
National Taiwan University of the Arts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition party leader urged the government Friday to immediately examine
whether the 840 metric tons of drywall products Taiwan imported from China last
year might have contained harmful chemicals.</P>
      <P>Lin Jih-jia, secretary-general of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, called the
government's attention to news reports from the United States that defective
drywall products imported from China and used by American builders in more than
100,000 homes, including many in Florida, posed a health hazard to homeowners
and apartment dwellers.</P>
      <P>Citing customs statistics, Lin, a former legislator, said Taiwan imported 840
metric tons of drywall products from China at a cost of NT$42 million in 2008.</P>
      <P>"If the drywall material is tainted, some 12,000 households in Taiwan could have
been affected," he said, adding that the government should adopt emergency
measures to find out whether the drywall products imported from China contained
harmful substances.</P>
      <P>According to recent reports from the United States, American builders imported
millions of pounds of drywall products from China at the height of the housing
boom following the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.</P>
      <P>The reports said that more than 300 homeowners complained that the putrid sulfur
odor emissions -- a rotten-egg stench which grows worse with heat and humidity
-- from the wallboard had corroded copper in electrical outlets and metal
surfaces behind refrigerators.</P>
      <P>The dwellers in these houses also complained that the odor caused them to
experience respiratory irritation, and they said they were worried that the
tainted drywall might cause long-term damage to their health, according to the
reports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Financial regulator raises doubts over Singfor Life land purchase</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 17 (CNA)
04/17/09  20:04:21
(By Y.L. Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) , Taiwan's financial regulator, has
raised questions over the legality of Singfor Life Insurance Co.'s NT$2.818
billion (US$83.37 million) winning bid for a coveted piece of land in Taipei's
upscale Xinyi District.</P>
      <P>Singfor Life, whose bid was far above the NT$1.833 billion floor price, said
immediately after winning the tender that it had purchased the land on behalf of
a construction company operated by Chen Chung-ming, a Taiwanese businessman with
investments in China.</P>
      <P>Singfor Life reportedly made an NT$200 million commission by reselling the land
to Chen's company soon after being named the winner of the tender for the 29-7
piece of the "D3" plot of land in the Xinyi District.</P>
      <P>Late Thursday, the FSC indicated that at first glance, Singfor Life's bid was
illegal because a company cannot act as a proxy for another legal entity in a
tender and because it may have violated a ban against buying property imposed on
it by the FSC last year.</P>
      <P>The regulatory body noted, however, that it could not make a final determination
until it had gathered complete details on the transaction.</P>
      <P>FSC Chairman Sean Chen said Friday that if Singfor fails to give a convincing
explanation on its latest move, it would be fined again. He said the FSC had
reminded Singfor of the ban a day before Thursday's tender.</P>
      <P>Singfor Life first drew the scrutiny of the FSC last July when it acquired two
plots (29 and 29-1) in the Xinyi District's "D3" plot of land, considered the
last plot in the upscale neighborhood available for the development of luxury
apartments, from Citibank Taiwan for NT$3.389 billion.</P>
      <P>The deal also included the rights to bid on other plots owned by Citibank.</P>
      <P>Last December, the FSC fined Singfor Life NT$4.5 million and also barred it from
acquiring property until it sold, within one year, the 29 and 29-1 plots. The
regulator determined the insurer had spent more than an insurance company with
negative net worth is allowed to spend on a real estate acquisition.</P>
      <P>By law, it should not have been able to pay more than NT$100 million in any such
transaction.</P>
      <P>Singfor Life said it sold the 29 and 29-1 pieces to the construction firm
Wednesday, a day before Thursday's bid, to comply with the FSC requirement, but
the FSC insisted it had not lifted the restriction imposed on Singfor.</P>
      <P>The life insurer also said its purchase Thursday of the 29-7 plot, the last of
three pieces of the D3 plot, was necessary to avoid violating a contractual
obligation it had with Citibank Taiwan based on the contract the two parties
signed on the D3 plot last July.</P>
      <P>Not convinced by Singfor Life's explanation, the FSC also said it will check
whether there were other irregularities in the deal, such as whether Singfor
Life colluded with the construction to resell it the properties at an
artificially low price.</P>
      <P>The price paid by Singfor Life for the 29-7 plot works out to about NT$1.53
million per ping (the measure of area used in Taiwan equal to about 3.3 square
meters) of floor space that will be allowed to be built on the 919-ping plot.</P>
      <P>The 1,552-ping D3 plot has an average floor space ratio of about 3.8, meaning a
developer will be allowed to build about 6,700 pings of space.</P>
      <P>The deal was attractive to Chen because of the exclusivity of the property and
expectations that Taiwan's real estate market will rebound in the second half of
this year because of warming relations between Taiwan and China, according to
sources from Singfor Life.</P>
      <P>The 29-7 plot of land fetched  a high price because its development could be
merged with that of adjacent properties said Lin Chin-sheng, a real estate
appraiser.</P>
      <P>He added that the insurance company has adequate liquidity to pay property taxes
and other fees even if market conditions are not appropriate for developing the
property.</P>
      <P>Under Taipei City government regulations, the land could be used for residential
buildings, which must occupy at least two-thirds of its area, Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, using the land to construct an international hotel is also permitted,
once the developer registers the project with the city government to ensure that
it benefits the city, Lin added.</P>

      <P>A research center under the Council of Agriculture (COA) vowed Friday to turn a
conservation site for black-faced spoonbill in southern Taiwan into the top
research facility on the endangered birds.</P>
      <P>The COA's Endemic Species Research Institute made the pledge on the eve of
taking over the black-faced spoonbill conservation center in Chiku, Tainan.</P>
      <P>Hsueh Mei-li, an associate researcher at the Endemic Species Research Institute,
noted that the center was set up in November 2005 by the Tainan County
government after receiving funds from the Forestry Bureau.</P>
      <P>The Tainan County government decided to relinquish its control of the center,
Hsueh said, because it did not feel it had enough qualified scientists and
management talent to operate the center in an optimal way.</P>
      <P>She noted that according to statistics from the Construction &amp; Planning
Administration under the Minister of the Interior, Taiwan currently has two
world-class wetlands -- Tainan County's Sichao wetland and the Chiku black-faced
spoonbill conservation research center -- with the latter also the largest
conservation site for black-faced spoonbills.</P>
      <P>She said more than 1,500 black-faced spoonbills arrived in Taiwan last year to
weather the winter, an indication that the conservation efforts have paid off
given that the bird's worldwide population is only about 2,000.</P>
      <P>She noted that the Endemic Species Research Institute already has low-, middle-
and high-altitude research and experimental stations.</P>
      <P>With the new addition of the Chiku center, the institute will be able to conduct
more comprehensive research on Taiwan's ecological systems, Hsueh noted.</P>
      <P>She also said that the institute is planning to sponsor the first international
symposium at the Chiku research center in early November.</P>

      <P>One young Taiwanese tennis player will be heading to the French Open in Paris to
join 15 other youths from around the world to trade shots with two of the game's
legendary players, Andre Agassi and his wife, Steffi Graf.</P>
      <P>In a promotion being run by watchmaker and official French Open sponsor
Longines, one budding star under 12 will be carefully selected from each of 16
countries to participate in the June 6 event, with the 16 players forming eight
teams that will each take a shot at tennis' leading couple, winners of a
combined 30 grand slam singles titles.</P>
      <P>Longines Taiwan announced Friday that Taiwan would be one of the 16 countries
participating in the event and that local tennis marketing firm Integration

      <P>The young boy and girl players will be chosen based on rigorous criteria,
including national ranking,  their past results, an interview, an Internet vote,
and their performance in the ranking tournament for players 12 and under to take
place in mid-May.</P>
      <P>A group of 32 pre-selected boys and girls will be screened based on the first

    <HEADLINE>Ma aims to control drug abuse recidivism to within 30 percent</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that Taiwan's anti-drug efforts can be
described as "successful" so long as the recidivism rate of incarcerated drug
addicts within five years after being released from detention is controlled to
within 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during his visit to the Ming-Teh branch of southern Taiwan's
Tainan Prison, accompanied by Justice Minister Wang Ching-feng. He was the first
president of Taiwan to visit the only state-run drug addiction treatment center
in the country.</P>
      <P>Ma said he once set the ambitious goal of zero recidivism for incarcerated drug
abusers when he served as minister of justice between 1993 and 1996, but
admitted Friday that it was not a realistic goal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's efforts to crack down on drug crimes should focus on reducing the
number of first-time drug offenders, which would automatically lead to a drop in
the number of habitual offenders, Ma said.</P>
      <P>The country's efforts can be considered successful if none of the offenders
detained for obligatory drug treatment are recidivists, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>During  his visit,  the president  also  acknowledged  the achievements of the
Ming-Teh center in lowering the relapse tendency of addicted inmates by taking
advantage of the power of religion.</P>
      <P>The Ming-Teh prison branch has been inviting Buddhist and Christian groups to
help the inmates quit their addiction to drugs, by offering spiritual support
and assisting the addicted in restoring their faith in life and in themselves.</P>
      <P>In 2008, only 34 percent of drug addicts forced to undergo treatment in the
Ming-Teh center were found to have again committed the crime of taking drugs,
such as heroin and morphine, that are listed in the first-degree category, after
they were released from detention, according to the prison.</P>
      <P>Drug abuse has been on the rise in Taiwan, as more young people experiment with
contraband drugs, such as ecstasy. Legislator Huang Chih-hsiung of the ruling
Kuomindtang said April 7 that the number of people addicted to drugs has
increased to over 230,000 people from the level of around 200,000 in 2006.</P>

include many that have won awards in competitions. They include the original
species, the single-flower type, the multiflora type and the standard type.</P>
      <P>The word Paphiopedilum was derived from the Greek word "Paphian," which refers
to the Roman Goddess Venus, and "pedilon" which means slipper.</P>
      <P>Kao Chi-ching, vice chairman of the Taiwan Paphiopedilum Society, said that
Taiwan's orchid growers have cultivated about 3 million Lady's slipper orchids,
most of which are locally developed species.</P>
      <P>Kao said the Lady's slipper orchids are distinctive because their flowers are
different from other orchids and that they appear in various shapes and colors.</P>
      <P>He added that the award-winning orchids will remain on display until April 19,
while the others, including many new hybrid Lady's slipper orchid species, will
be on display until April 26.</P>
      <P>The Lady's slipper orchids are also known in the United States as moccasin
flowers.  They are so named because of the flowers' slipper-shaped pouches. The
pouch can trap insects in order to force them to climb up past the staminode,
behind which they collect or deposit pollinia.</P>
      <P>Lady's slipper orchids originated in the tropical and subtropical forests  of
Southeast  Asia,  including  southern  China,  but over-collecting has caused
the flowers to become rare and endangered in their original habitats.</P>
      <P>The orchids bloom in a variety of colors ranging from white, maroon, yellow,
red, pink, and green to nearly black. The color of the blooms may be solid,
blended, striped or spotted. The flowers have a waxy texture, and can last six
weeks or longer.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New flight routes to be announced in 3rd round of cross-strait talks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Friday that new flight routes will be
announced in the third round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said that in addition to the present charter
flights, the next round of talks between Taiwan and China will discuss the
launch of regular passenger and cargo fights and additional flights and routes.</P>
      <P>The 108 cross-strait flights permitted at present serve eight destinations in
Taiwan and 21 destinations in China, Lai said as she introduced the agenda for
the next round of talks set for Nanjing, China as a Chinese delegation arrived
in Taiwan Friday for a preparatory meeting on the talks.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that four major issues will be covered in the talks, including cross-
strait cooperation in combating crimes and judicial assistance, the launch of
regular cross-Taiwan Strait flights, cross-strait financial cooperation and
Chinese investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Addressing progress in cross-strait tourism, she also said that when Taiwan
first opened to Chinese tourists in July last year, the number of arrivals was
initially low. But the number has increased dramatically since Chinese New Year
this year, averaging between 2,000 and 3,000 arrivals daily.</P>
      <P>In recent days, the number of Chinese tourists even hit 4,000, she said.</P>
      <P>"To maintain the quality of tourism in Taiwan, we hope that the number could
maintain an average of 3,000 daily," she added.</P>
      <P>The first round of talks between Taiwan and China took place in Beijing in June,
leading to the opening of Chinese tourists and weekend charter flights.</P>
      <P>The second round of talks was held in Taipei in November, with both sides
signing four agreements, including the expansion of air links between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has developed a new drug for diabetes patients that will begin its first
clinical trials on humans at a local medical center in 2010, marking the first
drug ever to be developed on the island.</P>
      <P>The National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) announced Friday that it has
formed an alliance with six local pharmaceutical manufacturers to conduct
investigational new drug trials on humans of its developed anti-diabetes drug,
DPP-IV, at Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH).</P>
      <P>The alliance --  composed of Genovate  Biotechnology,  the Taipei-based China
Chemical and Pharmaceutical Co., Nang Kuang Pharmaceutical, Yuan Shin Group, TTY
Biopharm, and Taiwan Biotech -- recently  obtained  investment  from the
government's  National Development Fund, according to the NHRI.</P>
      <P>Chao Yu-sheng, director of the NHRI Division of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical
Research, estimated that the first- and second-stage clinical trials will
require NT$200 million (US$5.9 million) , with the national fund to cover 85
percent of the cost and the alliance to take care of the rest.</P>
      <P>TVGH will supervise the trials on humans, Chao noted.</P>
      <P>Noting it will take 10-15 years and an investment of US$1 billion to get a new
drug to the market, Chao added that the third stage of clinical trials for the
DPP-IV inhibitor will be undertaken overseas.</P>
      <P>At that point, the local pharmaceutical factories that have obtained the NHRI
technology transfer might offer authorization to use the technology in exchange
for further injections of capital.</P>
      <P>Diabetes is considered to be the world's fourth top killer. In the global
market, there are drugs developed by Merck and Novartis that have proven
effective in treating Type 2 diabetes patients.</P>
      <P>Chao, who led the DPP-IV inhibitor development, said he has discovered during
animal tests that the chemical elements of the new drug are similar to that of
the Merck drug, but the effect is better.</P>

      <P>Tour packages that connect tourist attractions on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait will emerge as a new travel fashion now that direct air and shipping
links have been established, a senior official predicted Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview  with Radio Taiwan International, Minister of
Transportation and Communications Mao Chih-kuo said the opening of direct cross-
strait transportation links has drawn the two sides closer, which has not only
benefited Taiwanese businessmen with interests in China and passengers from both
sides but will also help attract foreign visitors to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that many new tour packages that connect Taiwanese and Chinese
tourist attractions will be introduced in the travel market in the future," Mao
said.</P>
      <P>He forecast, for instance, that future tour packages may include visits to the
National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei and the Palace Museum in Beijing to
allow vacationers to compare ancient Chinese art collections kept at the two
famous museums.</P>
      <P>Likewise, tour packages featuring comparisons of special customs and cultures on
the two sides may also be introduced in the market to attract research-savvy
tourists, Mao said.</P>
      <P>In his view, Mao said, bona fide tourism does not lie in deliberate creation of
amusement parks or designation of scenic areas, but rather in the day-to-day
ways of life and activities.</P>
      <P>"In Europe, any street scene and human interaction can form an attraction that
touches or moves the heart of visitors, " Mao said. "That's the highest goal of
tourism development, but it takes a long time to foster and cultivate."</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has listed tourism as one of six new emerging
industries,  Mao said priority will be given to the development of tourism-
related facilities and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In the coming four years, he said, the government will attract at least 10 more
international tourist hotel chains to operate in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Renovation of the Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan's main gateway, is also
in progress, Mao said, adding that when the first phase of the facelift of the
First Terminal is completed at the end of 2011, the airport will resume its past
glory.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the third round of cross-strait talks scheduled for late April or
early May will touch on the issue of upgrading the current direct cross-strait
charter flights to regular scheduled flights, Mao refrained from making a direct
response.</P>
      <P>He instead  said it's a "matter  of course"  that direct cross-strait air links
move from charter services to scheduled flights.</P>
      <P>"At the moment, one thing is certain -- that the number of diect cross-strait
flights will increase. As to the scope or level of the increase, that depends on
negotiations by the two sides," Mao added.</P>
      <P>Top negotiators from both sides -- Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
President Chen Yunlin -- are scheduled to meet in Nanjing late this month or
early May to discuss a range of issues, including cooperation in financial
services and fight against crime and the expansion of direct flight services.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Suspected FMD cases in Changhua County false alarm: official</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) on Friday tentatively ruled out the possibility
that pigs on a pig farm in the central county of Changhua were infected with
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) earlier in the week.</P>
      <P>The COA's Bureau of Animal Health Inspection and Quarantine noted that initial
tests on 18 pigs killed Monday in Hsiusui Village, Changhua County, showed that
none were infected with the highly contagious disease.</P>
      <P>But bureau officials said that to ensure the safety of the hog industry, they
have adopted stringent quarantine measures after the pigs showed suspected
symptoms of FMD.</P>
      <P>Changhua County animal health officials were instructed to control human and
vehicle movements  to the farm,  and adopt disinfection and visiting measures.</P>
      <P>Pigs in farms within a 1-kilometer radius of the farm were given shots while the
livestock farms within a 3-km radius of the farm will also be visited to ensure
no abnormalities exist.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations, if farm owners deliberately conceal infections,
they will be fined between NT$10,000 and NT$50,000 and they will not be
compensated for animals culled.</P>
      <P>If the culled pigs are confirmed to have not been infected with FMD, then the
farm owner will be compensated according to the law.</P>
      <P>The COA said there are about 12,000 hog farms in Taiwan, with 90 percent of
their stock having received no FMD inoculation.</P>
      <P>But there have been three FMD reports since February. Following the first case
reported in Yunlin County Feb. 4, a second was reported in Changhua County Feb.
9 and a third emerged in Chiayi County March 27, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>They said there was no need for the public to panic over the development,
describing the appearance of sporadic cases as normal when the percentage of
animals receiving inoculations is gradually falling.</P>
      <P>Fewer inoculations were given last year as part of a process to eradicate the
disease and re-establish Taiwan as an FMD-free country.</P>
      <P>Under guidelines set by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) , Taiwan
is entitled to apply to be treated as an FMD-free country with the body before
its May 2010 annual meeting if no cases are reported and no vaccinations are
given to livestock for one year before applying for FMD-free status, according
to the COA.</P>

anxiety; as a man of understanding he is free from doubt; and as a man of
courage he is free from fear."</TEXT>

      <P>A third round of talks between the top negotiators of Taiwan's Strait Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), has been scheduled to open April 25, an SEF
official confirmed Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The plan is to open the third round of talks April 25," said SEF Deputy
Secretary-General Ma Shao-chang in the first direct SEF response to media
speculation about the exact date of the talks scheduled to take place in
Nanjing.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks at a press briefing about the morning session of a
preparatory meeting in Taipei between delegations led by ARATS Vice President
Zheng Lizhong and his Taiwanese counterpart, SEF Vice Chairman Kao Koong-lian.</P>
      <P>The meeting is aimed at hammering out details of procedural problems and
technical issues for the upcoming Nanjing talks between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>Noting that the session went smoothly and that both sides reached consensus on
90 percent of the procedural issues, Ma added that one or two details were left
to be finalized in the next preparatory meeting, which will be held in Nanjing
on the day the delegates arrive.</P>
      <P>Asked about the hotly discussed issue of signing an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China, Ma said the matter was not touched upon
as it is not on the agenda of the third round of talks, although he added that
Chiang and Chen might exchange views on the issue in Nanjing.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has great interest in signing an ECFA with China, as the administration
of President Ma Ying-jeou thinks such an economic pact would not only help
normalize relations with China but would also prevent Taiwan's marginalization
in the process of China's economic integration with other countries in the
region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Human rights covenants major progress for Taiwan: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  April  17 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent ratification of two human rights covenants by Taiwan is expected to
help upgrade the country's international presence, Taiwan's representative to
the United Kingdom said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Chang Siao-yue, despite Taiwan not being a member of the United
Nations, the March 31 ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights signifies Taiwan's intent to abide by the highest human rights standards,
marking an important milestone in the country's progress in human rights
protection.</P>
      <P>The move by Taiwan has won high praise from the global human rights group
Amnesty International.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's actions present a strong model for the region that economic growth and
prosperity can go hand-in-hand with increasing respect for human rights, " said
Sam Zarifi, Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific director, in a statement
released April 9.</P>
      <P>The covenants were introduced by the United Nations in 1966 and came into force
in 1976. The Republic of China became a signatory to the covenants in 1967, when
it was still a member of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>With the human rights situation in Taiwan being not in compliance with the
requirements set forth in the documents at that time, the ROC government did not
proceed immediately with the ratification of the covenants and the procedure was
suspended after the country lost its U.N. membership in 1971.</P>
      <P>During  the  former  Democratic  Progressive  Party  (DPP) administration,  the
Cabinet  submitted  the covenants  to the legislature for endorsement, first in
2001 and again in 2002, 2005 and February 2008, but because of differences among
the legislators, no decision was made on the issue.</P>
      <P>A major bone of contention was a clause in the covenants promising self-
determination of all peoples, which some feared could fuel a bid by pro-
independence activists to promote a plebiscite on the issue of independence
versus unification with China and thereby escalate tension across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The covenants failed to win the support of the then-opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
and People First Party, which together held a majority  in the  legislature
during  the  eight  years  the pro-independence DPP was in power.</P>
      <P>With President Ma Ying-jeou's strong support for the ratification of the
covenants following his inauguration last May, the legislature eventually
ratified them and passed a law on the enforcement of the two covenants March 31.</P>

      <P>A Chinese delegation visiting Taipei to talk with its Taiwanese counterparts on
details of an upcoming third round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks pledged Saturday
to make joint efforts to combat the financial crisis and boost cooperation in
promoting the welfare of the people on both sides.</P>
      <P>Zheng Lizhong, vice president of the quasi-official Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) and his Taiwanese counterpart Kao Koong-lian,
vice chairman and secretary-general of the quasi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) made the pledge at the opening of a preparatory session for the
third round of talks between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President
Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>"While both sides of the Taiwan Strait are under the impact of the global
financial crisis, we believe that on the basis of the fruitful results that have
been achieved, we can overcome this universal difficulty by strengthening
bilateral cooperation and boosting confidence," said Zheng.</P>
      <P>Noting that cross-strait communications have been smooth and harmonious over the
past year and that relations between Taiwan and China have now been put "on the
track of peaceful development," Zheng said that both sides should follow policy
of "easy issues and economic topics first, difficult issues and political topics
later."</P>
      <P>"Holding the preparatory session in Taipei for the first time is especially
meaningful, as it symbolizes that negotiations between the SEF and ARATS are on
an equal footing," Kao said.</P>
      <P>In the face of the economic downturn, he went on, the SEF and ARATS should seize
the historic opportunity, focus on the big picture and work together on
improving relations and increasing mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>Although details of the third round of talks had yet to be hammered out in
Saturday's session, the upcoming Chiang-Chen meeting is expected to cover issues
such as regularly scheduled cross-strait flights, financial cooperation,
tackling cross-strait crime and opening Taiwan to investment from China.</P>
      <P>While the meeting between Cheng and Kao was harmonious and pleasant, the
atmosphere outside the conference room was extremely tense with tight security
on high alert for fear that protests led by opposition Democratic Progressive
Party politicians against the Chinese delegation that took place a day earlier
at the airport might occur again.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of policemen surrounded the hotel at which the meeting took place,
using cameras to closely monitor any movement, but no demonstrations took place.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An exhibition of Paphiopedilum orchids -- better known as Lady's slipper orchids
-- opened at the National Museum of Natural Sciences in Taipei Friday and will
run until April 26.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan Paphiopedilum Society, the organizer of the event, the
more than 200 pots of Lady's slipper orchids put on display at the exhibition
include many that have won awards in competitions. They include the original
species, the single-flower type, the multiflora type and the standard type.</P>
      <P>The word Paphiopedilum was derived from the Greek word "Paphian," which refers
to the Roman Goddess Venus, and "pedilon" which means slipper.</P>
      <P>Kao Chi-ching, vice chairman of the Taiwan Paphiopedilum Society, said that
Taiwan's orchid growers have cultivated about 3 million Lady's slipper orchids,
most of which are locally developed species.</P>
      <P>Kao said the Lady's slipper orchids are distinctive because their flowers are
different from other orchids and that they appear in various shapes and colors.</P>
      <P>He added that the award-winning orchids will remain on display until April 19,
while the others, including many new hybrid Lady's slipper orchid species, will
be on display until April 26.</P>
      <P>The Lady's slipper orchids are also known in the United States as moccasin
flowers.  They are so named because of the flowers' slipper-shaped pouches. The
pouch can trap insects in order to force them to climb up past the staminode,
behind which they collect or deposit pollinia.</P>
      <P>Lady's slipper orchids originated in the tropical and subtropical forests  of
Southeast  Asia,  including  southern  China,  but over-collecting has caused
the flowers to become rare and endangered in their original habitats.</P>
      <P>The orchids bloom in a variety of colors ranging from white, maroon, yellow,
red, pink, and green to nearly black. The color of the blooms may be solid,
blended, striped or spotted. The flowers have a waxy texture, and can last six
weeks or longer.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has developed a new drug for diabetes patients that will begin its first
clinical trials on humans at a local medical center in 2010, marking the first
drug ever to be developed on the island.</P>
      <P>The National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) announced Friday that it has
formed an alliance with six local pharmaceutical manufacturers to conduct
investigational new drug trials on humans of its developed anti-diabetes drug,
DPP-IV, at Taipei Veterans General Hospital (TVGH).</P>
      <P>The alliance --  composed of Genovate  Biotechnology,  the Taipei-based China
Chemical and Pharmaceutical Co., Nang Kuang Pharmaceutical, Yuan Shin Group, TTY
Biopharm, and Taiwan Biotech -- recently  obtained  investment  from the
government's  National Development Fund, according to the NHRI.</P>
      <P>Chao Yu-sheng, director of the NHRI Division of Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical
Research, estimated that the first- and second-stage clinical trials will
require NT$200 million (US$5.9 million) , with the national fund to cover 85
percent of the cost and the alliance to take care of the rest.</P>
      <P>TVGH will supervise the trials on humans, Chao noted.</P>
      <P>Noting it will take 10-15 years and an investment of US$1 billion to get a new
drug to the market, Chao added that the third stage of clinical trials for the
DPP-IV inhibitor will be undertaken overseas.</P>
      <P>At that point, the local pharmaceutical factories that have obtained the NHRI
technology transfer might offer authorization to use the technology in exchange
for further injections of capital.</P>
      <P>Diabetes is considered to be the world's fourth top killer. In the global
market, there are drugs developed by Merck and Novartis that have proven
effective in treating Type 2 diabetes patients.</P>
      <P>Chao, who led the DPP-IV inhibitor development, said he has discovered during
animal tests that the chemical elements of the new drug are similar to that of
the Merck drug, but the effect is better.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) on Friday tentatively ruled out the possibility
that pigs on a pig farm in the central county of Changhua were infected with
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) earlier in the week.</P>
      <P>The COA's Bureau of Animal Health Inspection and Quarantine noted that initial
tests on 18 pigs killed Monday in Hsiusui Village, Changhua County, showed that
none were infected with the highly contagious disease.</P>
      <P>But bureau officials said that to ensure the safety of the hog industry, they
have adopted stringent quarantine measures after the pigs showed suspected
symptoms of FMD.</P>
      <P>Changhua County animal health officials were instructed to control human and
vehicle movements  to the farm,  and adopt disinfection and visiting measures.</P>
      <P>Pigs in farms within a 1-kilometer radius of the farm were given shots while the
livestock farms within a 3-km radius of the farm will also be visited to ensure
no abnormalities exist.</P>
      <P>According to the regulations, if farm owners deliberately conceal infections,
they will be fined between NT$10,000 and NT$50,000 and they will not be
compensated for animals culled.</P>
      <P>If the culled pigs are confirmed to have not been infected with FMD, then the
farm owner will be compensated according to the law.</P>
      <P>The COA said there are about 12,000 hog farms in Taiwan, with 90 percent of
their stock having received no FMD inoculation.</P>
      <P>But there have been three FMD reports since February. Following the first case
reported in Yunlin County Feb. 4, a second was reported in Changhua County Feb.
9 and a third emerged in Chiayi County March 27, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>They said there was no need for the public to panic over the development,
describing the appearance of sporadic cases as normal when the percentage of
animals receiving inoculations is gradually falling.</P>
      <P>Fewer inoculations were given last year as part of a process to eradicate the
disease and re-establish Taiwan as an FMD-free country.</P>
      <P>Under guidelines set by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) , Taiwan
is entitled to apply to be treated as an FMD-free country with the body before
its May 2010 annual meeting if no cases are reported and no vaccinations are
given to livestock for one year before applying for FMD-free status, according
to the COA.</P>

      <P>Tour packages that connect tourist attractions on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait will emerge as a new travel fashion now that direct air and shipping
links have been established, a senior official predicted Friday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview  with Radio Taiwan International, Minister of
Transportation and Communications Mao Chih-kuo said the opening of direct cross-
strait transportation links has drawn the two sides closer, which has not only
benefited Taiwanese businessmen with interests in China and passengers from both
sides but will also help attract foreign visitors to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that many new tour packages that connect Taiwanese and Chinese
tourist attractions will be introduced in the travel market in the future," Mao
said.</P>
      <P>He forecast, for instance, that future tour packages may include visits to the
National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei and the Palace Museum in Beijing to
allow vacationers to compare ancient Chinese art collections kept at the two
famous museums.</P>
      <P>Likewise, tour packages featuring comparisons of special customs and cultures on
the two sides may also be introduced in the market to attract research-savvy
tourists, Mao said.</P>
      <P>In his view, Mao said, bona fide tourism does not lie in deliberate creation of
amusement parks or designation of scenic areas, but rather in the day-to-day
ways of life and activities.</P>
      <P>"In Europe, any street scene and human interaction can form an attraction that
touches or moves the heart of visitors, " Mao said. "That's the highest goal of
tourism development, but it takes a long time to foster and cultivate."</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has listed tourism as one of six new emerging
industries,  Mao said priority will be given to the development of tourism-
related facilities and infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In the coming four years, he said, the government will attract at least 10 more
international tourist hotel chains to operate in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Renovation of the Taoyuan International Airport, Taiwan's main gateway, is also
in progress, Mao said, adding that when the first phase of the facelift of the
First Terminal is completed at the end of 2011, the airport will resume its past
glory.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the third round of cross-strait talks scheduled for late April or
early May will touch on the issue of upgrading the current direct cross-strait
charter flights to regular scheduled flights, Mao refrained from making a direct
response.</P>
      <P>He instead  said it's a "matter  of course"  that direct cross-strait air links
move from charter services to scheduled flights.</P>
      <P>"At the moment, one thing is certain -- that the number of diect cross-strait
flights will increase. As to the scope or level of the increase, that depends on
negotiations by the two sides," Mao added.</P>
      <P>Top negotiators from both sides -- Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
President Chen Yunlin -- are scheduled to meet in Nanjing late this month or
early May to discuss a range of issues, including cooperation in financial
services and fight against crime and the expansion of direct flight services.</P>
      <P>Preparatory talks for the planned Chiang-Chen meeting will be held in Taipei
Saturday to flesh out texts of three agreements to be signed and a joint
statement that will be issued at encounter in Nanjing.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese and Japanese coast guard personnel are still looking for two crew
members of a Taiwanese fishing vessel that sank near the disputed Tiaoyutai
Islands early Friday, a fishery official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The 99-ton Hsing Tong Chuan No. 86, based out of Suao in the northeastern county
of Yilan, sank some 20 nautical miles west of the Tiaoyutai Islands after it was
allegedly hit by a Panama-registered tanker, the official from the Fisheries
Administration under the Council of Agriculture said.</P>
      <P>Eleven of the 13 crew manning the vessel were rescued by fishing boats operating
nearby, but the ship's captain, Ho Hsi-chuan, and chief engineer Hsu Chung-wen,
were still missing.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Maritime Patrol Directorate General under the
Coast Guard Administration, a Japanese diver combed the interior of the sunken
ship Friday evening but did not find the two missing men.</P>
      <P>Coast guard personnel from Taiwan and Japan will continue search operations
during the 72-hour "golden time" for rescue, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials said the 160,000-ton Panamanian tanker TOSA is suspected of having
hit the Taiwanese fishing boat.</P>
      <P>A Hualien coast guard vessel stopped the TOSA, but the tanker refused to put
into Hualien Harbor on Taiwan's eastern coast for investigation and continued
its voyage to Singapore, escorted by the coast guard vessel.</P>
      <P>Coast guard officials said they will seek permission through diplomatic or other
channels to board the tanker to look for evidence that it was involved in a
collision.</P>
      <P>Two other foreign ships -- the Fratzis Star of the Marshall Islands and the Hong
Kong-registered CHS World -- were also stopped, but were allowed to continue
after radar data showed that they were many miles away from the collision site
at the time.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials said Japan had dispatched five fast boats,
two helicopters and three divers to assist in the search and rescue mission,
while four Taiwanese coast guard ships and helicopters from the National
Airborne Service Corps were also mobilized.</P>
      <P>The rescued Hsing Tong Chuan crew members include one Taiwanese fisherman, two

      <P>Taiwan announced Friday the launch of a program to issue small loans to
fishermen in El Salvador to help them turn salt fields along the eastern coast
of their country into shrimp farms.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Ambassador to El Salvador Carlos S.C. Liao and Salvadoran
Agriculture Ministry Mario Ernesto Salaverria hosted a ceremony at a fishery
station in eastern El Salvador to mark the launch of the loans, which will total
US$100,000.</P>
      <P>In addition to the financial support, a Taiwanese technical mission in El
Salvador will also teach local breeders how to cultivate shrimp and increase
output, according to a statement by the ROC embassy in El Salvador.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that the loans will benefit 320 fishermen and help
increase their local shrimp output to 66 tons per year. The annual production
value is assessed at US$270,000, which will produce a net annual income of
US$150,000 for the breeders, the statement said.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Salaverria expressed gratitude for the financial support, saying that
Taiwan has helped his country a great deal in terms of agricultural development.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese technical missions have over the years not only helped local farmers
grow vegetables and fruit but have also assisted them in establishing irrigation
systems and promoting marketing, Liao said.</P>
      <P>With the new Salvadoran government set to assume office June 1, Liao promised
that Taiwan will continue to initiate plans in line with its agricultural
policies to help El Salvador's sustainable development.</P>
      <P>The Central American  country is one of 23 that maintain diplomatic ties with
Taiwan. In 2008, Taiwanese exports there reached US$89.71 million, while imports
from El Salvador amounted to US$20.09 million.</P>

      <P>Cycling around Taiwan has emerged as a popular travel package for visitors from
China and other countries, tourism industry sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>On Friday, a 19-member Chinese tour group completed a seven-day, 1,200-km bike
tour around Taiwan, with all the members describing the journey as an
unforgettable and enthralling experience when they reached their final
destination -- Danshui on the outskirts of Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The group was the first from China to make the round-Taiwan bike trip since the
Chinese government formally began allowing its people to make sightseeing trips
to Taiwan last July.</P>
      <P>Chen Miaolin, vice president of the China Tourism Association, told local
reporters that he was very impressed by the spectacular sunset ocean scenery
when he arrived at Eluanbi  on Taiwan's southernmost coast on the third day of
the tour.</P>
      <P>"Standing looking out over the Bashi Channel, I was too excited to control
myself from exalting `how beautiful is the treasure island of Taiwan,'" Chen
recalled.</P>
      <P>Most of the other members of the group were senior executives of a noted four-
star tourist hotel chain in China.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, they spent more than a year planning the NT$100,000 (US$2,994
)-per-person bike tour package in collaboration with Taiwanese travel agents.</P>
      <P>Each member was provided with a high-end bicycle and other necessary accessories
by Taiwan's famous bicycle company Giant Manufacturing Co. after their arrival
aboard a direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight earlier this month. A team of
technicians also escorted the group on its journey.</P>
      <P>"All the group members were satisfied with the arrangements, praising the deal
as `worth more than the price' and as an easy and healthy travel experience,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>When the group cycled past South Bay on the Kenting National Park coastline,
many members jumped into the sea and swam for more than an hour, enjoying the
magnificent beach scenery, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>Yeh Zhou, a 50-year-old cycling fan, said the feelings he experienced cycling
along Taiwan's coastline were even deeper than the movement he felt when he
cycled from Hangzhou in southeastern China to the capital city of Beijing last
year.</P>
      <P>In his view, Yeh said, Taiwan's cycle trails are far better and far more
beautiful than those in many other places around the world.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ching,  a local travel  industry  representative  who accompanied the
group, said at least 30 other Chinese tour groups are lining up for similar
around-Taiwan bike trips later this year.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, quite a few cyclists from Japan, the United States and
Europe are also coming to Taiwan to enjoy the thrill of cycling on Taiwan's
beautiful roads.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that a group of bicycle dealers from Denmark are scheduled to
come to Taiwan late this year for a cycling trip and to appraise the market
potential of organizing package tours.</P>
      <P>Giant President Ho You-jen said cycle tours of Taiwan have emerged as a popular
travel package in the global tourist community, adding that many tourists also
purchase Taiwan-made bicycles after concluding their tours. He added that cycle
touring is expected to create NT$1 billion-worth of business opportunities per
year for the local tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Ho said his company will cooperate with local air carriers to bring cycling fans
from around the world to Taiwan to experience the enjyoment of cycling here.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Launch of regular cross-strait flights might help lower fares</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/18/09  18:47:50</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The daily charter flights between Taiwan and China inaugurated four months ago
have attracted severe criticism, with detractors complaining about excessive
pricing, but the opening of regular flights, expected later this year, is
raising hopes of cheaper fares.</P>
      <P>The issue is one of the major items on the agenda of the latest round of cross-
Taiwan Strait negotiations taking place Saturday in Taipei, with the official
signing of an agreement expected April 26 during talks in Nanjing between
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese
counterpart,  Association  for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President
Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>According to Lee Long-wen,  director-general  of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) , upgrading the charter services to regularly scheduled
services will mean an increase in supply, while the increased cargo capacity
provided by regular passenger flights will also help lower operating costs,
leaving room for carriers to reduce ticket prices.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yung-ching, director of the CAA's Air Transport Division, said the rate of
decrease will depend on how many flights are offered.</P>
      <P>"Usually, ticket prices are in inverse proportion to the number of flights
available, " Yeh said. "However, if there is only a limited increase in the
number of flights, with demand still exceeding supply, it will not be easy for
prices to be reduced."</P>
      <P>Local carriers have proposed that the number of flights should at least be
tripled to meet demand.</P>
      <P>The daily charter services launched last Dec. 15 provide up to 108 flight per
week at present -- 54 by Taiwanese carriers and another 54 by Chinese carriers
-- and have recorded an average passenger load factor of nearly 90 percent.</P>
      <P>Of the 21 Chinese destinations served by the flights, Shanghai remains the most
popular, with 40 flights to and from Taiwan per week.</P>
      <P>The next-most popular are flights serving Hangzhou, Beijing and Shenzhen, which
have 12 to 14 flights per week, followed by Guangzhou, which has eight flights
per week.</P>
      <P>The other 16 destinations -- Chengdu, Chongqing, Dalian, Guilin, Wuhan, Fuzhou,
Qingdao, Changsha, Haikou, Kunming, Xian, Shenyang, Tianjin and Zhengzhou,
Xiamen and Nanjing -- see between one and three flights per week, although some
have only one flight every several weeks.</P>
      <P>The popularity of the charter services is due largely to their convenience and
short travel time as compared to regular flight services for which transit is
required through a third area such as Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>For example, the charter flight between Taipei and Shanghai take less than 90
minutes, while it takes nearly six hours to travel via Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The shorter travel distance, however, has not resulted in lower fares.</P>
      <P>According to a report released April 14 by the Consumers' Foundation, economic-
class, round-trip charter flight tickets valid for 30 days between Taipei and
Shanghai cost NT$13,776 (US$411) on average in April -- 40 percent more
expensive than the flights via Hong Kong, which cost NT$9,844 on average.</P>
      <P>Despite such high prices, there are hardly any empty seats on the charter
flights.</P>
      <P>Ticket agent Lin Ko-pen pointed out that most consumers, many of whom are
business people operating in China, do not care about the price as long as they
can get a seat, especially those with urgent travel needs.</P>
      <P>"A customer came to me April 10 asking for a one-way ticket departing April 12
from Taipei to Shanghai.  The ticket cost NT$14,000, but he bought it anyway,"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>The recent influx of Chinese tourists to Taiwan is also helping to keep the
cross-strait charter service extremely busy, with the number of daily arrivals
rising to nearly 3,000 per day in the first half of April since tourism groups
in various Chinese provinces launched a "10,000 people travel to Taiwan"
campaign in February to promote Taiwan tours.</P>
      <P>According to travel agent Chen Shih-chieh, almost 50 percent of the weekly quota
of 108 flights  are being used for popular destinations such as Shanghai,
Hangzhou and Beijing, making flights very difficult to book for other
destinations.</P>
      <P>"Chengdu, where there are many Taiwanese businessmen, has only one flight per
week, making reservations for travel tours no easy task," he said.</P>
      <P>Airline companies in Taiwan have suggested that the number of charter flights
should be expanded before the regular service is launched.</P>
      <P>The regular services  should at first target only popular destinations such as
Shanghai, while charter flight services should continue for other destinations
for which demand is lower, they proposed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Third round of cross-strait talks to open April 26 in Nanjing</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A third round of talks between the top negotiators of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , is set to open April 26 in Nanjing, high-
level officials from either side of the Taiwan Strait announced Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary-general of the quasi-official SEF,
and ARATS Vice President Zheng Lizhong, made the announcement in separate press
conferences at the conclusion of a day-long joint preparatory session in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"We have reached consensus on many issues, which I believe will lay a great
foundation for the third round of talks," Kao said.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, the SEF delegation is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing April 25
aboard a direct charter flight and there will be another preparatory meeting
that same afternoon to finalize the details of the talks.</P>
      <P>He said the third round of talks between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS
President Chen Yunlin will officially open April 26 with four major topics on
the agenda -- regularly scheduled cross-strait flights to augment the existing
charter services, financial cooperation, tackling cross-strait crime and
providing legal assistance, and opening Taiwan to investment from China.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen are expected to sign agreements on the first three issues that
afternoon, while a decision by both sides on what to do about the issue of
opening Taiwan to Chinese capital should be revealed after the meeting, Kao
added.</P>
      <P>Chiang will later meet with Wang Yi, director of the China State Council's
Taiwan Affairs Office, and will visit Taiwanese businessmen based in Yangzhou,
Suzhou, Kunshan and Shanghai before returning to Taiwan April 29, he said.</P>
      <P>On the issue of launching regularly scheduled flights, the SEF vice chairman
said the Chiang-Chen talks will discuss the launch of a new flight route that he
said would be more convenient for travelers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,
but he did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>As to the issue of cracking down on cross-strait crime and the provision of
legal assistance, the agreement expected to be signed will include a clause
concerning the repatriation of economic criminals, Kao went on, adding that this
is a category that was missed out in the Kinmen Agreement signed in 1990 by the
Red Cross Societies of Taiwan and China for extraditing criminals and suspects
who flee across the strait to escape justice.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the hotly discussed issue of Taiwan signing an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China will be touched upon in the
third round of Chiang-Chen talks and be included formally on the agenda of a
fourth round of talks scheduled for the end of the year, Kao did not answer
directly, saying only that Taiwan and China should be able to start discussing
the issue at some point in the future when the time is ripe but that at present,
both sides can only make separate preparatory efforts.</P>
      <P>Zheng said in an earlier press conference that signing a comprehensive  trade
pact  with  Taiwan  will facilitate  the establishment  of a cross-strait
economic cooperation mechanism beneficial to both economies.</P>
      <P>"Both sides of the Taiwan Strait are adopting a proactive attitude on the issue
and are trying to create (favorable) conditions for it step by step, " Zheng
said, adding that "We should proceed to discuss the issue when conditions are
ripe."</P>
      <P>Taiwan has great interest in singing an ECFA with China, as the administration
of President Ma Ying-jeou thinks such an economic pact would not only help
normalize relations with China but would also prevent Taiwan's marginalization
in the process of China's economic integration with other countries in the
region.</P>

      <P>Chen Hung, a patient suffering from a neurological and muscle wasting disease,
released Saturday the sixth in a series of his books that have been "written" by
blinking his eyes.</P>
      <P>Chen's wife, Liu Hsueh-hui, told a book launch party held in Taipei that like
the previous five, the publication of this latest book, "An Easy Fish in Shallow
Water, " involved no easy task, but he insisted on doing it because writing is
one of his favorite.</P>
      <P>"He is trying to encourage other patients suffering from the same disease as
himself and those with other rare diseases," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Also attending the party, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said the way Chen faces his
life allows  the public  to see the infinite possibilities of life and to learn
to adopt a positive and optimistic attitude toward life.</P>
      <P>Chen, who began to have trouble walking in 1997, was diagnosed in 1999 to have
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) , a condition
that affect some 350,000 people around the world, and kills more than 100,000
each year.</P>
      <P>Also known as Lou Gehring's disease, ALS/MND leads to symptoms such as muscle
weakness and stiffness. The cause of the disease is unknown and there is no
cure.</P>
      <P>The disease did not defeat Chen, although now he can only communicate with the
outside world by blinking his eyes.</P>
      <P>Chen began to "write" books with the help of his wife, blinking his eyes to
represent Chinese phonetic symbols, and published in 2002 his first book since
suffering from the disease.</P>
      <P>In 2007, he was certified by the Guinness World Records for "the record for most
blinked words published" -- 190,185 -- between 1999 and 2007.</P>

      <P>A vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Council Affairs (MAC) said
Saturday that the upcoming third round of talks between the top cross-Taiwan
Strait negotiators on both sides will only address the general principles of
allowing Chinese investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The final statement, expected to be issued after the talks, will illustrate
only the principles rather than specific categories to be opened to Chinese
investment, " said Fu Tung-cheng in response to an inquiry from CNA after a one-
day preparatory session for the third round of talks.</P>
      <P>The talks between Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and
Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan

regularly  scheduled cross-strait flights, financial cooperation, tackling

      <P>According to Fu, both sides have agreed to include the issue of opening to
Chinese investment on the agenda but will not make any resolution on it due to
the complexity of the subject.</P>
      <P>As opening Taiwan to investment from Chinese banks, securities and insurance
institutions involves professional operations, it will be included in the
discussions on cross-strait financial cooperation, Fu went on, adding that it
will fall under the purview of the Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory
Commission.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which coordinates Taiwan's policy toward China, oversees SEF
operations.</P>

      <P>The 2009 Hakka Tung Blossom Festival kicked off in Miaoli County Saturday with a
ceremony that was attended by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, along with Council for
Hakka Affairs Minister Huang Yu-cheng, Miaoli Magistrate Liu Cheng-hung and Wu
Po-hsiung, honorary chairman of the World Hakka Federation and also chairman of
the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The festival opened with the performance of a tung blossom dance at a village
resort in the county, organized by the Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs
to celebrate the fall of what is popularly known as "April Snow" or "May snow"
because of the way the fallen blossoms carpet the ground.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that the tung blossom festival has become a significant annual event
for the Hakka people and he invited the public to appreciate the clean-white
beauty of the tung flowers at a slow pace and to taste the rich culture the
Hakka people have created.</P>
      <P>According to the council, 10 county and city governments, as well as 45 civic
groups, have organized 100 activities around northern and central Taiwan to
allow the public to experience local cultures and lifestyles while appreciating
the beauty of the tung flowers.</P>
      <P>The festival, now in its eighth year, is organized by the council to promote a
culture industry centered on the Hakka, an ethnic group known for its diligence,
frugality and hospitality.</P>
      <P>Attracted by increasing trade opportunities in the unique culture industry,
which  covers  the  fields  of tourism,  ecological conservation, local cuisine
and creative handicraft production, more and more local governments have become
involved in organizing festival celebrations and this year, Yilan County,
Keelung City, Taipei County, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu County,  Miaoli County,
Taichung County, Changhua County, Yunlin County and Nantou County have all
prepared tung blossom appreciation activities to attract visitors.</P>
      <P>Huang said the tung blossoms have also drawn the attention of foreign tourists
over the years, adding that this year, the council has placed advertisements at
airports in Tokyo and Beijing in the hope of attracting more visitors to Hakka
villages in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, it has also prepared free tour brochures providing information
about the events in the 2009 Hakka Tung Blossom Festival that will run through
May 17, he went on.</P>
      <P>The information, including maps of the best places for tung blossom
appreciation, is also available on the council's Web site at
http://tung.hakka.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>April and May are the months when the tung trees are in full bloom in central
and northern Taiwan and the white flowers have become a symbol of the Hakka
people. Every year, the flowering season is celebrated in Hakka villages with
traditional music and song, coupled with the consumption of Hakka delicacies.</P>
      <P>The Hakka originally lived in central China but gradually migrated south during
different dynasties and settled in Jiangxi, Fujian and Guangdong provinces, as
well as in Taiwan, after fleeing from war and famine, where they become known in
Chinese as literally "guest people."</P>
      <P>A 2008 survey by the council found that Taiwan's Hakka people, using a broad
definition of the term, accounts for 25.6 percent of the country's total
population. The first wave of migrants came from China to Taiwan in the 1690s,
when China was under the rule of the Qing Dynasty.</P>

      <P>The Taiwanese delegation attending the 2009 Boao Forum for Asia met with Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao Saturday on the sidelines of the event, which formally opened
that day in the southern Chinese island province of Hainan.</P>
      <P>In his brief welcoming remarks at the meeting, which was opened to reporters for
just five minutes, Wen urged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to "face the
future, bury old grudges, cooperate with each other and move forward together
"and called for them to seize the present opportunity to achieve peace in the
strait.</P>
      <P>Not every member of the Taiwanese delegation of academics and business leaders

Strait Common Market Foundation Chairman Chan Hou-sheng and foundation director-
in-chief Douglas Hung were present.</P>
      <P>Chien has previously served as foreign minister and as Taiwan's representative

seeking "peaceful development" between the two sides and boosting cross-strait
cooperation in the fields of trade, the economy and investment, in a report he
made March 5 to the annual session of the National People's Congress, China's
parliament.</P>
      <P>After Chien had finished making his remarks, the meeting was closed to
reporters.</P>

      <P>Two government-sponsored job fairs in northern and southern Taiwan Saturday
helped more than 11,000 people landed jobs, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
officials said that same day.</P>
      <P>The job fairs were two in a series of four such events organized by the Cabinet-
level council to help trim unemployed population as the country's jobless rate
surged to a record 5.75 percent in February.</P>
      <P>Initial statistics showed that the job fair in Taoyuan county in northern Taiwan
attracted 41,078 visitors and 11,368 of them applied for various job vacancies
provided by public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>About 27 percent of those applicants, or 3,031 of the total, successfully found
jobs, the CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 1,042, or 20.46 percent of the 5,093 applicants, found internship at
private enterprises or research positions at various local universities.</P>
      <P>As to the job fair in Tainan in the south, 24.54 percent of the 18,873
applicants succeeded in landing positions, the officials said.</P>
      <P>While attending the opening ceremony for the job fair in Taoyuan Saturday,
President Ma Ying-jeou encouraged jobless people, including those who became out
of work during the recent global economic downturn, not to lose self-confidence.</P>
      <P>He also promised that his administration will do whatever it can to create jobs,
saying that the economic stimulus package launched this year will help create
190,000 to 220,000 job openings.</P>
      <P>Two similar job fairs were held in central and eastern Taiwan last weekend, with

      <P>Taiwan can do something for China, particularly in charitable services for
disadvantaged groups of people, Taiwan's top representative to the 2009 Boao
Forum told Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao Saturday.</P>
      <P>Fredrick Chien, a former president of the Control Yuan who also once  served  as
Taiwan's  minister  of foreign  affairs  and representative to the United
States, met with Wen on the sidelines of the annual international forum of
government officials and business leaders in China's southern island province of
Hainan.</P>
      <P>Only the first few minutes of the Chien-Wen meeting was open for media coverage
while the remaining part of their talks were held behind the closed door.</P>
      <P>Chien told reporters after his longer-than-expected talks with Wen that he came
up with several proposals in his capacity as a Taiwanese citizen, not as a
representative of Taiwan's government.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, he told Wen that Taiwan's Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation is planning to build a new community in Indonesia that will comprise
a mixture of hospitals, factories, schools and housing units to accommodate
4,000 households in a slum.</P>
      <P>In the Tzu Chi project, the Indonesian slum will also be developed into a
tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>Chien, who is attending the Boao Forum as the top adviser to the Taipei-based
Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation, said he had received a positive reply
from Tzu Chi that it is willing to mount a similar project in China.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chien said some Taiwanese civic groups are help with restoration
of the ancient Loulan Castle in China's Xinjiang Province.</P>
      <P>Responding to Wen's remarks at the beginning of their talks that the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits are connected at the roots and share the same blood, Chien
said he noticed that Wen advocated the ideas of seeking cross-strait "peaceful
development" and boosting bilateral engagements on an equal footing, in his
March 5 report to the National People's Congress, China's parliament.</P>
      <P>Based on Wen's such proposals, Chien told Wen that he looks forward to seeing
China help Taiwan realize its goal of attracting 1 million Chinese tourists a
year and purchase electric home appliances to help Taiwanese makers ride out the
current global economic recession.</P>
      <P>In an apparent effort to allay some Taiwan's pro-independence groups'
apprehensions that he might represent President Ma Ying-jeou to broach the
proposal of signing a cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) , Chien said he didn't mention throughout his talks with Wen anything
about such topics or issues regarding Taiwan's desire to join the "ASEAN Plus 3"
regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation to the 2009 Boao Forum is composed of 30-plus
academics, bankers and business executives.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan announced Friday the launch of a program to issue small loans to
fishermen in El Salvador to help them turn salt fields along the eastern coast
of their country into shrimp farms.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Ambassador to El Salvador Carlos S.C. Liao and Salvadoran
Agriculture Ministry Mario Ernesto Salaverria hosted a ceremony at a fishery
station in eastern El Salvador to mark the launch of the loans, which will total
US$100,000.</P>
      <P>In addition to the financial support, a Taiwanese technical mission in El
Salvador will also teach local breeders how to cultivate shrimp and increase
output, according to a statement by the ROC embassy in El Salvador.</P>
      <P>It has been estimated that the loans will benefit 320 fishermen and help
increase their local shrimp output to 66 tons per year. The annual production
value is assessed at US$270,000, which will produce a net annual income of
US$150,000 for the breeders, the statement said.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Salaverria expressed gratitude for the financial support, saying that
Taiwan has helped his country a great deal in terms of agricultural development.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese technical missions have over the years not only helped local farmers
grow vegetables and fruit but have also assisted them in establishing irrigation
systems and promoting marketing, Liao said.</P>
      <P>With the new Salvadoran government set to assume office June 1, Liao promised
that Taiwan will continue to initiate plans in line with its agricultural
policies to help El Salvador's sustainable development.</P>
      <P>The Central American  country is one of 23 that maintain diplomatic ties with
Taiwan. In 2008, Taiwanese exports there reached US$89.71 million, while imports

      <P>Cycling around Taiwan has emerged as a popular travel package for visitors from
China and other countries, tourism industry sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>On Friday, a 19-member Chinese tour group completed a seven-day, 1,200-km bike
tour around Taiwan, with all the members describing the journey as an
unforgettable and enthralling experience when they reached their final
destination -- Danshui on the outskirts of Taipei City.</P>
      <P>The group was the first from China to make the round-Taiwan bike trip since the
Chinese government formally began allowing its people to make sightseeing trips
to Taiwan last July.</P>
      <P>Chen Miaolin, vice president of the China Tourism Association, told local
reporters that he was very impressed by the spectacular sunset ocean scenery
when he arrived at Eluanbi  on Taiwan's southernmost coast on the third day of
the tour.</P>
      <P>"Standing looking out over the Bashi Channel, I was too excited to control
myself from exalting `how beautiful is the treasure island of Taiwan,'" Chen
recalled.</P>
      <P>Most of the other members of the group were senior executives of a noted four-
star tourist hotel chain in China.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, they spent more than a year planning the NT$100,000 (US$2,994
)-per-person bike tour package in collaboration with Taiwanese travel agents.</P>
      <P>Each member was provided with a high-end bicycle and other necessary accessories
by Taiwan's famous bicycle company Giant Manufacturing Co. after their arrival
aboard a direct cross-Taiwan Strait charter flight earlier this month. A team of
technicians also escorted the group on its journey.</P>
      <P>"All the group members were satisfied with the arrangements, praising the deal
as `worth more than the price' and as an easy and healthy travel experience,"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>When the group cycled past South Bay on the Kenting National Park coastline,
many members jumped into the sea and swam for more than an hour, enjoying the
magnificent beach scenery, Chen went on.</P>
      <P>Yeh Zhou, a 50-year-old cycling fan, said the feelings he experienced cycling
along Taiwan's coastline were even deeper than the movement he felt when he
cycled from Hangzhou in southeastern China to the capital city of Beijing last
year.</P>
      <P>In his view, Yeh said, Taiwan's cycle trails are far better and far more
beautiful than those in many other places around the world.</P>
      <P>Tsai Ching,  a local travel  industry  representative  who accompanied the
group, said at least 30 other Chinese tour groups are lining up for similar
around-Taiwan bike trips later this year.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, quite a few cyclists from Japan, the United States and
Europe are also coming to Taiwan to enjoy the thrill of cycling on Taiwan's
beautiful roads.</P>
      <P>Tsai also said that a group of bicycle dealers from Denmark are scheduled to
come to Taiwan late this year for a cycling trip and to appraise the market
potential of organizing package tours.</P>
      <P>Giant President Ho You-jen said cycle tours of Taiwan have emerged as a popular
travel package in the global tourist community, adding that many tourists also
purchase Taiwan-made bicycles after concluding their tours. He added that cycle
touring is expected to create NT$1 billion-worth of business opportunities per
year for the local tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Ho said his company will cooperate with local air carriers to bring cycling fans
from around the world to Taiwan to experience the enjyoment of cycling here.</P>

      <P>The daily charter flights between Taiwan and China inaugurated four months ago
have attracted severe criticism, with detractors complaining about excessive
pricing, but the opening of regular flights, expected later this year, is
raising hopes of cheaper fares.</P>
      <P>The issue is one of the major items on the agenda of the latest round of cross-
Taiwan Strait negotiations taking place Saturday in Taipei, with the official
signing of an agreement expected April 26 during talks in Nanjing between
Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his Chinese
counterpart,  Association  for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits President
Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>According to Lee Long-wen,  director-general  of the Civil Aeronautics
Administration (CAA) , upgrading the charter services to regularly scheduled
services will mean an increase in supply, while the increased cargo capacity
provided by regular passenger flights will also help lower operating costs,
leaving room for carriers to reduce ticket prices.</P>
      <P>Yeh Yung-ching, director of the CAA's Air Transport Division, said the rate of
decrease will depend on how many flights are offered.</P>
      <P>"Usually, ticket prices are in inverse proportion to the number of flights
available, " Yeh said. "However, if there is only a limited increase in the
number of flights, with demand still exceeding supply, it will not be easy for
prices to be reduced."</P>
      <P>Local carriers have proposed that the number of flights should at least be
tripled to meet demand.</P>
      <P>The daily charter services launched last Dec. 15 provide up to 108 flight per
week at present -- 54 by Taiwanese carriers and another 54 by Chinese carriers
-- and have recorded an average passenger load factor of nearly 90 percent.</P>
      <P>Of the 21 Chinese destinations served by the flights, Shanghai remains the most
popular, with 40 flights to and from Taiwan per week.</P>
      <P>The next-most popular are flights serving Hangzhou, Beijing and Shenzhen, which
have 12 to 14 flights per week, followed by Guangzhou, which has eight flights
per week.</P>
      <P>The other 16 destinations -- Chengdu, Chongqing, Dalian, Guilin, Wuhan, Fuzhou,
Qingdao, Changsha, Haikou, Kunming, Xian, Shenyang, Tianjin and Zhengzhou,
Xiamen and Nanjing -- see between one and three flights per week, although some
have only one flight every several weeks.</P>
      <P>The popularity of the charter services is due largely to their convenience and
short travel time as compared to regular flight services for which transit is
required through a third area such as Hong Kong or Macau.</P>
      <P>For example, the charter flight between Taipei and Shanghai take less than 90
minutes, while it takes nearly six hours to travel via Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The shorter travel distance, however, has not resulted in lower fares.</P>
      <P>According to a report released April 14 by the Consumers' Foundation, economic-
class, round-trip charter flight tickets valid for 30 days between Taipei and
Shanghai cost NT$13,776 (US$411) on average in April -- 40 percent more
expensive than the flights via Hong Kong, which cost NT$9,844 on average.</P>
      <P>Despite such high prices, there are hardly any empty seats on the charter
flights.</P>
      <P>Ticket agent Lin Ko-pen pointed out that most consumers, many of whom are
business people operating in China, do not care about the price as long as they
can get a seat, especially those with urgent travel needs.</P>
      <P>"A customer came to me April 10 asking for a one-way ticket departing April 12
from Taipei to Shanghai.  The ticket cost NT$14,000, but he bought it anyway,"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>The recent influx of Chinese tourists to Taiwan is also helping to keep the
cross-strait charter service extremely busy, with the number of daily arrivals
rising to nearly 3,000 per day in the first half of April since tourism groups
in various Chinese provinces launched a "10,000 people travel to Taiwan"
campaign in February to promote Taiwan tours.</P>
      <P>According to travel agent Chen Shih-chieh, almost 50 percent of the weekly quota
of 108 flights  are being used for popular destinations such as Shanghai,
Hangzhou and Beijing, making flights very difficult to book for other
destinations.</P>
      <P>"Chengdu, where there are many Taiwanese businessmen, has only one flight per
week, making reservations for travel tours no easy task," he said.</P>
      <P>Airline companies in Taiwan have suggested that the number of charter flights
should be expanded before the regular service is launched.</P>
      <P>The regular services  should at first target only popular destinations such as
Shanghai, while charter flight services should continue for other destinations
for which demand is lower, they proposed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Third round of cross-strait talks to open April 26 in Nanjing</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A third round of talks between the top negotiators of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) and its Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , is set to open April 26 in Nanjing, high-
level officials from either side of the Taiwan Strait announced Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman and secretary-general of the quasi-official SEF,
and ARATS Vice President Zheng Lizhong, made the announcement in separate press
conferences at the conclusion of a day-long joint preparatory session in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"We have reached consensus on many issues, which I believe will lay a great
foundation for the third round of talks," Kao said.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, the SEF delegation is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing April 25
aboard a direct charter flight and there will be another preparatory meeting
that same afternoon to finalize the details of the talks.</P>
      <P>He said the third round of talks between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS
President Chen Yunlin will officially open April 26 with four major topics on
the agenda -- regularly scheduled cross-strait flights to augment the existing
charter services, financial cooperation, tackling cross-strait crime and
providing legal assistance, and opening Taiwan to investment from China.</P>
      <P>Chiang and Chen are expected to sign agreements on the first three issues that
afternoon, while a decision by both sides on what to do about the issue of
opening Taiwan to Chinese capital should be revealed after the meeting, Kao
added.</P>
      <P>Chiang will later meet with Wang Yi, director of the China State Council's
Taiwan Affairs Office, and will visit Taiwanese businessmen based in Yangzhou,
Suzhou, Kunshan and Shanghai before returning to Taiwan April 29, he said.</P>
      <P>On the issue of launching regularly scheduled flights, the SEF vice chairman
said the Chiang-Chen talks will discuss the launch of a new flight route that he
said would be more convenient for travelers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,
but he did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>As to the issue of cracking down on cross-strait crime and the provision of
legal assistance, the agreement expected to be signed will include a clause
concerning the repatriation of economic criminals, Kao went on, adding that this
is a category that was missed out in the Kinmen Agreement signed in 1990 by the
Red Cross Societies of Taiwan and China for extraditing criminals and suspects
who flee across the strait to escape justice.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the hotly discussed issue of Taiwan signing an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China will be touched upon in the
third round of Chiang-Chen talks and be included formally on the agenda of a
fourth round of talks scheduled for the end of the year, Kao did not answer
directly, saying only that Taiwan and China should be able to start discussing
the issue at some point in the future when the time is ripe but that at present,
both sides can only make separate preparatory efforts.</P>
      <P>Zheng said in an earlier press conference that signing a comprehensive  trade
pact  with  Taiwan  will facilitate  the establishment  of a cross-strait
economic cooperation mechanism beneficial to both economies.</P>
      <P>"Both sides of the Taiwan Strait are adopting a proactive attitude on the issue
and are trying to create (favorable) conditions for it step by step, " Zheng
said, adding that "We should proceed to discuss the issue when conditions are
ripe."</P>
      <P>Taiwan has great interest in singing an ECFA with China, as the administration
of President Ma Ying-jeou thinks such an economic pact would not only help
normalize relations with China but would also prevent Taiwan's marginalization
in the process of China's economic integration with other countries in the
region.</P>

      <P>Chen Hung, a patient suffering from a neurological and muscle wasting disease,
released Saturday the sixth in a series of his books that have been "written" by
blinking his eyes.</P>
      <P>Chen's wife, Liu Hsueh-hui, told a book launch party held in Taipei that like
the previous five, the publication of this latest book, "An Easy Fish in Shallow
Water, " involved no easy task, but he insisted on doing it because writing is
one of his favorite.</P>
      <P>"He is trying to encourage other patients suffering from the same disease as
himself and those with other rare diseases," Liu said.</P>
      <P>Also attending the party, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said the way Chen faces his
life allows  the public  to see the infinite possibilities of life and to learn
to adopt a positive and optimistic attitude toward life.</P>
      <P>Chen, who began to have trouble walking in 1997, was diagnosed in 1999 to have
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) , a condition
that affect some 350,000 people around the world, and kills more than 100,000
each year.</P>
      <P>Also known as Lou Gehring's disease, ALS/MND leads to symptoms such as muscle
weakness and stiffness. The cause of the disease is unknown and there is no
cure.</P>
      <P>The disease did not defeat Chen, although now he can only communicate with the
outside world by blinking his eyes.</P>
      <P>Chen began to "write" books with the help of his wife, blinking his eyes to
represent Chinese phonetic symbols, and published in 2002 his first book since
suffering from the disease.</P>
      <P>In 2007, he was certified by the Guinness World Records for "the record for most
blinked words published" -- 190,185 -- between 1999 and 2007.</P>

      <P>A vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Council Affairs (MAC) said
Saturday that the upcoming third round of talks between the top cross-Taiwan
Strait negotiators on both sides will only address the general principles of
allowing Chinese investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The final statement, expected to be issued after the talks, will illustrate
only the principles rather than specific categories to be opened to Chinese
investment, " said Fu Tung-cheng in response to an inquiry from CNA after a one-
day preparatory session for the third round of talks.</P>
      <P>The talks between Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and
Chen Yunlin, president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , will open April 26 in Nanjing and will discuss four issues --
regularly  scheduled cross-strait flights, financial cooperation, tackling
cross-strait crime and providing  legal assistance,  and opening Taiwan to
investment from China.</P>
      <P>According to Fu, both sides have agreed to include the issue of opening to
Chinese investment on the agenda but will not make any resolution on it due to
the complexity of the subject.</P>
      <P>As opening Taiwan to investment from Chinese banks, securities and insurance
institutions involves professional operations, it will be included in the
discussions on cross-strait financial cooperation, Fu went on, adding that it
will fall under the purview of the Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory
Commission.</P>
      <P>The MAC, which coordinates Taiwan's policy toward China, oversees SEF
operations.</P>
      <P>Saturday's preparatory session in Taipei was attended by Kao Koong-lian, vice
chairman and secretary-general of the SEF, and his Chinese counterpart, ARATS
vice president Zheng Lizhong.</P>
      <P>A dinner party was thrown in Zheng's honor later that evening in which he
expressed gratitude for the SEF's hospitality and wished everyone good health,
speaking in the Fukien dialect that is widely used in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The 2009 Hakka Tung Blossom Festival kicked off in Miaoli County Saturday with a
ceremony that was attended by Premier Liu Chao-shiuan, along with Council for
Hakka Affairs Minister Huang Yu-cheng, Miaoli Magistrate Liu Cheng-hung and Wu
Po-hsiung, honorary chairman of the World Hakka Federation and also chairman of
the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The festival opened with the performance of a tung blossom dance at a village
resort in the county, organized by the Cabinet-level Council for Hakka Affairs
to celebrate the fall of what is popularly known as "April Snow" or "May snow"
because of the way the fallen blossoms carpet the ground.</P>
      <P>Liu noted that the tung blossom festival has become a significant annual event
for the Hakka people and he invited the public to appreciate the clean-white
beauty of the tung flowers at a slow pace and to taste the rich culture the
Hakka people have created.</P>
      <P>According to the council, 10 county and city governments, as well as 45 civic
groups, have organized 100 activities around northern and central Taiwan to
allow the public to experience local cultures and lifestyles while appreciating
the beauty of the tung flowers.</P>
      <P>The festival, now in its eighth year, is organized by the council to promote a
culture industry centered on the Hakka, an ethnic group known for its diligence,
frugality and hospitality.</P>
      <P>Attracted by increasing trade opportunities in the unique culture industry,
which  covers  the  fields  of tourism,  ecological conservation, local cuisine
and creative handicraft production, more and more local governments have become
involved in organizing festival celebrations and this year, Yilan County,
Keelung City, Taipei County, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu County,  Miaoli County,
Taichung County, Changhua County, Yunlin County and Nantou County have all
prepared tung blossom appreciation activities to attract visitors.</P>
      <P>Huang said the tung blossoms have also drawn the attention of foreign tourists
over the years, adding that this year, the council has placed advertisements at
airports in Tokyo and Beijing in the hope of attracting more visitors to Hakka
villages in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, it has also prepared free tour brochures providing information
about the events in the 2009 Hakka Tung Blossom Festival that will run through
May 17, he went on.</P>
      <P>The information, including maps of the best places for tung blossom
appreciation, is also available on the council's Web site at
http://tung.hakka.gov.tw.</P>
      <P>April and May are the months when the tung trees are in full bloom in central
and northern Taiwan and the white flowers have become a symbol of the Hakka
people. Every year, the flowering season is celebrated in Hakka villages with
traditional music and song, coupled with the consumption of Hakka delicacies.</P>
      <P>The Hakka originally lived in central China but gradually migrated south during
different dynasties and settled in Jiangxi, Fujian and Guangdong provinces, as
well as in Taiwan, after fleeing from war and famine, where they become known in
Chinese as literally "guest people."</P>
      <P>A 2008 survey by the council found that Taiwan's Hakka people, using a broad
definition of the term, accounts for 25.6 percent of the country's total
population. The first wave of migrants came from China to Taiwan in the 1690s,
when China was under the rule of the Qing Dynasty.</P>

      <P>The Taiwanese delegation attending the 2009 Boao Forum for Asia met with Chinese
Premier Wen Jiabao Saturday on the sidelines of the event, which formally opened
that day in the southern Chinese island province of Hainan.</P>
      <P>In his brief welcoming remarks at the meeting, which was opened to reporters for
just five minutes, Wen urged the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to "face the
future, bury old grudges, cooperate with each other and move forward together
"and called for them to seize the present opportunity to achieve peace in the
strait.</P>
      <P>Not every member of the Taiwanese delegation of academics and business leaders
attended the meeting with Wen, but 10 of them, including the delegation head --
former Control Yuan President Fredrick Chien -- his wife Julie Chien, Cross-
Strait Common Market Foundation Chairman Chan Hou-sheng and foundation director-
in-chief Douglas Hung were present.</P>
      <P>Chien has previously served as foreign minister and as Taiwan's representative
to the United States and his meeting with Wen drew Taiwanese media attention. He
is attending the forum in the capacity of the senior advisor of the non-profit
Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation.</P>
      <P>In response to Wen's call, Chien said he noticed that Wen proposed the ideas of
seeking "peaceful development" between the two sides and boosting cross-strait
cooperation in the fields of trade, the economy and investment, in a report he
made March 5 to the annual session of the National People's Congress, China's
parliament.</P>
      <P>After Chien had finished making his remarks, the meeting was closed to
reporters.</P>
      <P>The  April  17-19  forum  is a non-government,  non-profit international
organization and its annual conferences gather leaders in government, business
and academia in Asia and other continents to share their visions on the most

      <P>Two government-sponsored job fairs in northern and southern Taiwan Saturday
helped more than 11,000 people landed jobs, Council of Labor Affairs (CLA)
officials said that same day.</P>
      <P>The job fairs were two in a series of four such events organized by the Cabinet-
level council to help trim unemployed population as the country's jobless rate
surged to a record 5.75 percent in February.</P>
      <P>Initial statistics showed that the job fair in Taoyuan county in northern Taiwan
attracted 41,078 visitors and 11,368 of them applied for various job vacancies
provided by public and private sectors.</P>
      <P>About 27 percent of those applicants, or 3,031 of the total, successfully found
jobs, the CLA officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 1,042, or 20.46 percent of the 5,093 applicants, found internship at
private enterprises or research positions at various local universities.</P>
      <P>As to the job fair in Tainan in the south, 24.54 percent of the 18,873
applicants succeeded in landing positions, the officials said.</P>
      <P>While attending the opening ceremony for the job fair in Taoyuan Saturday,
President Ma Ying-jeou encouraged jobless people, including those who became out
of work during the recent global economic downturn, not to lose self-confidence.</P>
      <P>He also promised that his administration will do whatever it can to create jobs,
saying that the economic stimulus package launched this year will help create
190,000 to 220,000 job openings.</P>
      <P>Two similar job fairs were held in central and eastern Taiwan last weekend, with
a slightly higher success rate of about 30 percent.</P>

      <P>Taiwan can do something for China, particularly in charitable services for
disadvantaged groups of people, Taiwan's top representative to the 2009 Boao
Forum told Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao Saturday.</P>
      <P>Fredrick Chien, a former president of the Control Yuan who also once  served  as
Taiwan's  minister  of foreign  affairs  and representative to the United
States, met with Wen on the sidelines of the annual international forum of
government officials and business leaders in China's southern island province of
Hainan.</P>
      <P>Only the first few minutes of the Chien-Wen meeting was open for media coverage
while the remaining part of their talks were held behind the closed door.</P>
      <P>Chien told reporters after his longer-than-expected talks with Wen that he came
up with several proposals in his capacity as a Taiwanese citizen, not as a
representative of Taiwan's government.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, he told Wen that Taiwan's Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation is planning to build a new community in Indonesia that will comprise
a mixture of hospitals, factories, schools and housing units to accommodate
4,000 households in a slum.</P>
      <P>In the Tzu Chi project, the Indonesian slum will also be developed into a
tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>Chien, who is attending the Boao Forum as the top adviser to the Taipei-based
Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation, said he had received a positive reply
from Tzu Chi that it is willing to mount a similar project in China.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chien said some Taiwanese civic groups are help with restoration
of the ancient Loulan Castle in China's Xinjiang Province.</P>
      <P>Responding to Wen's remarks at the beginning of their talks that the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits are connected at the roots and share the same blood, Chien
said he noticed that Wen advocated the ideas of seeking cross-strait "peaceful
development" and boosting bilateral engagements on an equal footing, in his
March 5 report to the National People's Congress, China's parliament.</P>
      <P>Based on Wen's such proposals, Chien told Wen that he looks forward to seeing
China help Taiwan realize its goal of attracting 1 million Chinese tourists a
year and purchase electric home appliances to help Taiwanese makers ride out the
current global economic recession.</P>
      <P>In an apparent effort to allay some Taiwan's pro-independence groups'
apprehensions that he might represent President Ma Ying-jeou to broach the
proposal of signing a cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) , Chien said he didn't mention throughout his talks with Wen anything
about such topics or issues regarding Taiwan's desire to join the "ASEAN Plus 3"
regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation to the 2009 Boao Forum is composed of 30-plus
academics, bankers and business executives.</P>

    <DATELINE>Boao,  China,  April 18 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan can do something for China, particularly in charitable services for
disadvantaged groups of people, Taiwan's top representative to the 2009 Boao
Forum told Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao Saturday.</P>
      <P>Fredrick Chien, a former president of the Control Yuan who also once  served  as
Taiwan's  minister  of foreign  affairs  and representative to the United
States, met with Wen on the sidelines of the annual international forum of
government officials and business leaders in China's southern island province of
Hainan.</P>
      <P>Only the first few minutes of the Chien-Wen meeting was open for media coverage
while the remaining part of their talks were held behind the closed door.</P>
      <P>Chien told reporters after his longer-than-expected talks with Wen that he came
up with several proposals in his capacity as a Taiwanese citizen, not as a
representative of Taiwan's government.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, he told Wen that Taiwan's Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation is planning to build a new community in Indonesia that will comprise
a mixture of hospitals, factories, schools and housing units to accommodate
4,000 households in a slum.</P>
      <P>In the Tzu Chi project, the Indonesian slum will also be developed into a
tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>Chien, who is attending the Boao Forum as the top adviser to the Taipei-based
Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation, said he had received a positive reply
from Tzu Chi that it is willing to mount a similar project in China.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chien said some Taiwanese civic groups are help with restoration
of the ancient Loulan Castle in China's Xinjiang Province.</P>
      <P>Responding to Wen's remarks at the beginning of their talks that the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits are connected at the roots and share the same blood, Chien
said he noticed that Wen advocated the ideas of seeking cross-strait "peaceful
development" and boosting bilateral engagements on an equal footing, in his
March 5 report to the National People's Congress, China's parliament.</P>
      <P>Based on Wen's such proposals, Chien told Wen that he looks forward to seeing
China help Taiwan realize its goal of attracting 1 million Chinese tourists a
year and purchase electric home appliances to help Taiwanese makers ride out the
current global economic recession.</P>
      <P>In an apparent effort to allay some Taiwan's pro-independence groups'
apprehensions that he might represent President Ma Ying-jeou to broach the
proposal of signing a cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) , Chien said he didn't mention throughout his talks with Wen anything
about such topics or issues regarding Taiwan's desire to join the "ASEAN Plus 3"
regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation to the 2009 Boao Forum is composed of 30-plus
academics, bankers and business executives.</P>

and Yilan.</P>
      <P>Ma joined some 5,000 runners at the Yilan Sports Park to launch the marathon
event,  which featured  42-km,  21-km and 10-km competitions, as well as a 5-km

    <HEADLINE>MOUs to be signed after 3rd round of cross-strait talks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China will sign memorandums of understanding (MOUs) on banking,
securities and futures,  and insurance shortly after a third round of cross-
Taiwan Strait talks slated be held April 25-29 in Nanjing, a local banking
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The two sides reached the consensus at a preparatory meeting for the cross-
strait talks presided over by Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Secretary-
General Kao Koong-lian and Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) Vice President Zheng Lizhong in Taipei a day earlier, according to Chang
Ming-daw, director-general of the Banking Bureau under the Financial Supervisory
Commission.</P>
      <P>Because of the complexity of each of the three items, especially the banking
part, the two sides decided not to sign the MOUs at the next round of talks
between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin set for
April 26 in Nanjing before holding further negotiations on the issues, said
Chang.</P>
      <P>Four topics will be included in the Nanjing talks -- financial cooperation,
augmenting the direct cross-strait charter flights with regular flights,
combating crime and opening Taiwan to investment from China, with agreements on
the first three issues expected to be signed during the talks.</P>
      <P>The agreement on financial cooperation is likely to cover bilateral financial
supervision cooperation, the establishment of a currency settlement mechanism,
increasing access to each other's financial markets, and the establishment of a
system to help Taiwanese businessmen in China to obtain loans, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Once a banking MOU is inked, Taiwan's banking and financial industry is expected
to post a 20 percent growth for five consecutive years thanks to the potential
benefits from wealth management services, including an estimated NT$3,000
billion (US$88.72 billion) increase in loan demand, NT$80 billion in net
interest revenue and NT$8 billion in service fees, according to a foreign bank
with operations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Local bankers also expressed hope that by signing a banking MOU with China,
Taiwan's banking industry will be granted the same preferential treatment
offered to their Hong Kong counterparts under the Closer Economic Partnership
Arrangement (CEPA) between the special administrative region and China.</P>
      <P>The preferential treatment can cover a wide range of areas, such as allowing
Taiwan banks to set up branches or subsidiaries in China and provide Chinese
yuan services, and relaxing restrictions on foreign insurance companies wishing
to set up insurance companies in China, the bankers added.</P>
      <P>According to Chinese regulations, foreign banks should set up representative
offices for two years before upgrading them to branches or subsidiaries, while
foreign insurance companies in China should have operated for over 30 years
within any World Trade Organization state with a minimum year-end total asset
value of US$500 million and should have established a representative office in
China for two years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Federation of Industry Chairman Lee Cheng-chia said the establishment  of
a currency  settlement  mechanism  should be prioritized during the third round
of cross-strait  talks and suggested that Taiwan and China authorize the Bank of
Taiwan and the Bank of China to handle related business.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan last July authorized some 1,240 local bank outlets to begin
exchanges between new Taiwan dollars and the Chinese yuan, with a daily
transaction limit of 20,000 yuan per person per day, the supplies of yuan are
insufficient and the cost of buying the Chinese currency is too high, as China's
monetary authority has yet to promise to provide Taiwan with yuan on a regular
basis, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan's banks buy Chinese yuan mainly from HSBC and Bank of America.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Lee said, building a cross-strait currency clearance mechanism to
normalize and systemize the clearance of Taiwanese and Chinese currencies is
essential.</P>

      <P>A 10-month-old baby girl who was dumped by her father into a pot of boiling
water Saturday in southern Taiwan's Changhua County remained in critical
condition as of Sunday morning in the intensive care unit of a local hospital.</P>
      <P>The infant's mother, identified only by her family name of Lin, scooped her out
of the pot and rushed to a nearby police station for help, whereupon officers
immediately sent her to the Burn Center at the Changhua Christian Hospital.</P>
      <P>The baby girl, who suffered second degree burns over 95 percent of her body,
deteriorated overnight and had to be placed on a respirator as she could no
longer breathe on her own, doctors said Sunday, adding that although she was
being given fluids, the prognosis was not good.</P>
      <P>Changhua Magistrate Cho Po-yuan paid a visit to the hospital where the baby is
being treated and asked the public to pray for her.</P>
      <P>The baby's father, a 47-year-old surnamed Huang with a history of drunkenness,
threw her into the boiling water after having a fierce argument with Lin, who is
alleged to have taunted him into carrying out the assault.</P>
      <P>Police arrested Huang and handed him over to the Changhua Prosecutors Office on
charges of attempted homicide following an initial investigation.</P>
      <P>Huang and Lin, who have lived together for 12 years but are not married, have
two daughters. The older one, a fifth grader, was placed with a foster family by

    <HEADLINE>Laid-off dad spends quality time with preschool daughters</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
04/19/09  17:57:33
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former employee of a high-tech company who was laid off late last year due to
the global economic crunch, has taken the opportunity of his enforced leisure to
spend rare quality time with his two young daughters on a tailor-made tricycle
riding the roads from northern Taiwan to the south.</P>
      <P>Riding and touring, the daughters, aged 4 and 5, learned that the rice seedlings
in southern Taiwan are further on than those in the north and that small plastic
windmills can help monitor the trike's speed, although they usually traveled at
less than 10 kph, said Chiang Ching-piao, the girls' father.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who calls himself "Peter Dad " and is from Taoyuan in northern Taiwan,
was watching the television cartoon En Famille with his daughters last December
when the youngsters expressed great yearning to travel on a donkey cart like the
little girl in the cartoon adapted from a novel by 19th-Century French writer
Hector Malot.</P>
      <P>"Peter Dad" thought about buying an ox cart to fulfill his daughters' wishes but
after long consideration and assessment, decided to get a tricycle instead.</P>
      <P>He then spent NT$12,000 to have a tricycle tailor-made by a manufacturer in
eastern Hualien County and determined to spend the break in his career with his
daughters, who have not yet entered elementary school. The machine has two seats
for the youngsters in the front and a driver's seat at the back.</P>
      <P>They set off March 17 from Taoyuan on a month-long cycle journey, riding the
country roads Monday through Friday, while Chiang's wife, a worker with an
airline company in Taoyuan, joined them on the weekends.</P>
      <P>Traveling at walking speed, the trio would stop for fun, food and rest whenever
they wanted and the girls would learn about the roadside wildflowers and would
see farmers working the land.</P>
      <P>They also visited parks in different cities, where the girls would rate the
slides, with one in the Chiayi Park descending from the roof of a public toilet
down to a sandpit taking top honors.</P>
      <P>It was not all plain sailing, of course, and the journey was occasionally
disrupted by flat tires, worn brakes and loose nuts and bolts.</P>
      <P>The worst situation was when they were riding on a downhill stretch  of road in
Chiayi County when the bike skidded and overturned, leaving the girls with
bruised legs and elbows and a little bit scared, said their father.</P>
      <P>The girls then asked him to install two plastic windmills they had bought at a
night market on the front of the bike to help monitor its speed.</P>
      <P>"The girls would ask me to slow down when the windmills spun wildly -- but they
would demand that I pedal faster when the windmills were not spinning at all,"
he said ruefully.</P>
      <P>Every evening after the girls went to bed Chiang would post about the day's
adventures on his blog.</P>
      <P>The blog helped them make friends, with some blog visitors even meeting them on
the road and riding with them for a while.</P>
      <P>The family reached Taiwan's southernmost town of Kenting April 15 and visited
the shooting locations of Cape No. 7 -- the biggest grossing locally produced
film in Taiwan's cinema history.</P>
      <P>They were also entertained by another blog visitor with duck rice noodles
accompanied with smoked fowl -- famous local delicacies in Pingtung County's
Hengchun township.</P>
      <P>They wrapped up their journey April 17 in Pingtung, where they headed for
Kaohsiung County to take the high speed train home, leaving their now-battered
tricycle to be transported home on an ordinary train.</P>
      <P>Once they got home, Chiang had to visit a clinic to get his sore arms treated,
but his five-year-old has already been asking him when he will take her for a
"real bicycle ride" to eastern Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait MOU expected to benefit local futures industry</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's futures industry is expected to be boosted when a proposed memorandum
of understanding (MOU) on the futures business is signed by Taiwan and China,
local futures companies said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The signing of the agreement will help improve transparency in the industry,
which is viewed widely as a promising sector but still in its fledgling stage in
China, according to an executive of Polaris MF Global Futures Co.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to be able to contribute a great deal if it forges
cooperative ties with China in this regard because local futures dealers
specialize in brokerage services, marketing, risk control, exploiting
information technology and delivering training programs, the executive said.</P>
      <P>The key will be whether Taiwanese funds can be used to invest in China's futures
markets, the executive added.</P>
      <P>China has numerous financial institutions of various sizes, so once the
agreement is inked, Taiwanese futures companies planning to venture into the
Chinese market will face the challenge of dealing with the different-sized
companies there, the executive noted.</P>
      <P>Mutual recognition of professional qualifications obtained in Taiwan and China
is also an important issue that should be addressed in the agreement, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a representative of Grand Cathay Futures Corp. said that to expand
the scope of exchanges between the new Taiwan dollar and the Chinese yuan, which
would facilitate investment in each other's markets, a currency clearing system
should be first set up before both sides could engage in cooperation in that
area.</P>
      <P>According  to statistics  compiled by the Futures Industry Association (FIA),
the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) was ranked as 17th in the world in terms of
trade volume in 2008, ahead of the Singapore and Hong Kong markets.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's futures market currently holds a total guarantee fund of NT$120
billion, while China's three futures markets -- located in the cities of
Shanghai, Dalian and Zhengzhou -- hold a total guarantee fund of 250 billion
yuan.</P>
      <P>China's future markets are mainly for the trading of commodity futures, such as
soybeans, wheat, cotton, plastics and metals, while financial futures play a
larger role in Taiwan's future market. The markets on both sides can strongly
complement each other if a cooperative agreement is clinched, according to
market analysts.</P>
      <P>Although an official cooperative mechanism has yet to be set up, futures
companies on both sides have already been engaged in cross-strait exchanges,
industry sources said.</P>
      <P>For example, Polaris, which has five operating centers and more than 300 staff
in Taiwan, is planning to send 50 employees to gain an understanding of Chinese
laws and regulations and spur them to gain professional certification in China,
while Grand Cathay Futures is looking forward to sharing its expertise with
large Chinese futures companies that have 20-30 subsidiaries, the sources added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 70 percent of the respondents to a recent government  survey are in favor
of inking an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China to deal
with two-way trade and investment issues, according to the poll results released
Sunday.</P>
      <P>The survey, carried out by a private consultancy for the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) also found that 23.5 percent of the respondents were not
in favor, contending that such an agreement is unnecessary.</P>
      <P>A total of 69.2 percent of those polled said they believe Taiwan and China will
develop even closer trade and commerce ties in the future.</P>
      <P>Around 60 percent of the respondents said that a Taiwan-China ECFA will help
Taiwan clinch similar accords with other countries, while 60 percent said lower
tariffs ensured by an ECFA will help Taiwanese products grab a bigger share of
the Chinese market, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Concerning the sensitive Taiwan sovereignty issue, 53.6 percent said they
believe the planned ECFA is designed to handle economic matters and will not
affect Taiwan's independent  sovereignty. Nevertheless, 37.7 percent said they
were concerned about such a development.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether Chinese investment in Taiwan should be permitted,
79.9 percent agreed that limited opening is acceptable, while 17.2 percent
strongly opposed the idea.</P>
      <P>Around 90 percent of the respondents said they would not purchase fewer locally
made products if more Chinese goods are allowed to enter the domestic market
under the terms of an ECFA.</P>
      <P>While close to 49 percent of the respondents said they believe that an ECFA will
help increase jobs in Taiwan, 23.7 percent did not agree, according to the
survey.</P>
      <P>The opinion poll was conducted April 8-11, collecting 1,067 valid questionnaires
from people aged between 20 and 69. It had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.</P>
      <P>The MAC expressed hope that the results of the survey will help narrow the gap
between the ruling party and the opposition, which is vehemently against such a
pact with China, with the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party and the
Taiwan Solidarity Union voicing fear that Taiwan's sovereign status would be
compromised.</P>
      <P>As for concern that an ECFA would deal a heavy blow to Taiwan's traditional
businesses, MAC officials said the council will make a more precise assessment
of the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan can do something for China: ex-official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Boao,  China,  April 18 (CNA)
04/19/09  10:42:28
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan can do something for China, particularly in charitable services for
disadvantaged groups of people, Taiwan's top representative to the 2009 Boao
Forum told Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao Saturday.</P>
      <P>Fredrick Chien, a former president of the Control Yuan who also once  served  as
Taiwan's  minister  of foreign  affairs  and representative to the United
States, met with Wen on the sidelines of the annual international forum of
government officials and business leaders in China's southern island province of
Hainan.</P>
      <P>Only the first few minutes of the Chien-Wen meeting was open for media coverage
while the remaining part of their talks were held behind the closed door.</P>
      <P>Chien told reporters after his longer-than-expected talks with Wen that he came
up with several proposals in his capacity as a Taiwanese citizen, not as a
representative of Taiwan's government.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, he told Wen that Taiwan's Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi
Foundation is planning to build a new community in Indonesia that will comprise
a mixture of hospitals, factories, schools and housing units to accommodate
4,000 households in a slum.</P>
      <P>In the Tzu Chi project, the Indonesian slum will also be developed into a
tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>Chien, who is attending the Boao Forum as the top adviser to the Taipei-based
Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation, said he had received a positive reply
from Tzu Chi that it is willing to mount a similar project in China.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chien said some Taiwanese civic groups are help with restoration
of the ancient Loulan Castle in China's Xinjiang Province.</P>
      <P>Responding to Wen's remarks at the beginning of their talks that the two sides
of the Taiwan Straits are connected at the roots and share the same blood, Chien
said he noticed that Wen advocated the ideas of seeking cross-strait "peaceful
development" and boosting bilateral engagements on an equal footing, in his
March 5 report to the National People's Congress, China's parliament.</P>
      <P>Based on Wen's such proposals, Chien told Wen that he looks forward to seeing
China help Taiwan realize its goal of attracting 1 million Chinese tourists a
year and purchase electric home appliances to help Taiwanese makers ride out the
current global economic recession.</P>
      <P>In an apparent effort to allay some Taiwan's pro-independence groups'
apprehensions that he might represent President Ma Ying-jeou to broach the
proposal of signing a cross-strait economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) , Chien said he didn't mention throughout his talks with Wen anything
about such topics or issues regarding Taiwan's desire to join the "ASEAN Plus 3"
regional economic integration.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation to the 2009 Boao Forum is composed of 30-plus
academics, bankers and business executives.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou kicked off a marathon event in northeastern Taiwan's
Yilan County Sunday by running five kilometers on a freeway connecting Taipei
and Yilan.</P>
      <P>Ma joined some 5,000 runners at the Yilan Sports Park to launch the marathon
event,  which featured  42-km,  21-km and 10-km competitions, as well as a 5-km
fun run.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Yilan Magistrate Lu Kuo-hua, Ma, a noted runner, turned in a time
of 27 minutes while enjoying the stunning views of the Yilan Plain.</P>
      <P>Part of the 55-km Beiyi Freeway was closed for the marathon. The freeway, also
known as the Chiang Wei-shui Freeway, is named to commemorate Chiang, a pioneer
of Taiwan's democracy movement who was born in Yilan County. The freeway, which
includes the 12.9-km Hsuehshan Tunnel -- the longest highway tunnel in East Asia
and the fifth-longest in the world -- was opened in 2006.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOUs to be signed after 3rd round of cross-strait talks</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China will sign memorandums of understanding (MOUs) on banking,
securities and futures,  and insurance shortly after a third round of cross-
Taiwan Strait talks slated be held April 25-29 in Nanjing, a local banking
official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The two sides reached the consensus at a preparatory meeting for the cross-
strait talks presided over by Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Secretary-
General Kao Koong-lian and Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) Vice President Zheng Lizhong in Taipei a day earlier, according to Chang
Ming-daw, director-general of the Banking Bureau under the Financial Supervisory
Commission.</P>
      <P>Because of the complexity of each of the three items, especially the banking
part, the two sides decided not to sign the MOUs at the next round of talks
between SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and ARATS President Chen Yunlin set for
April 26 in Nanjing before holding further negotiations on the issues, said
Chang.</P>
      <P>Four topics will be included in the Nanjing talks -- financial cooperation,
augmenting the direct cross-strait charter flights with regular flights,
combating crime and opening Taiwan to investment from China, with agreements on
the first three issues expected to be signed during the talks.</P>
      <P>The agreement on financial cooperation is likely to cover bilateral financial
supervision cooperation, the establishment of a currency settlement mechanism,
increasing access to each other's financial markets, and the establishment of a
system to help Taiwanese businessmen in China to obtain loans, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Once a banking MOU is inked, Taiwan's banking and financial industry is expected
to post a 20 percent growth for five consecutive years thanks to the potential
benefits from wealth management services, including an estimated NT$3,000
billion (US$88.72 billion) increase in loan demand, NT$80 billion in net
interest revenue and NT$8 billion in service fees, according to a foreign bank
with operations in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Local bankers also expressed hope that by signing a banking MOU with China,
Taiwan's banking industry will be granted the same preferential treatment
offered to their Hong Kong counterparts under the Closer Economic Partnership
Arrangement (CEPA) between the special administrative region and China.</P>
      <P>The preferential treatment can cover a wide range of areas, such as allowing
Taiwan banks to set up branches or subsidiaries in China and provide Chinese
yuan services, and relaxing restrictions on foreign insurance companies wishing
to set up insurance companies in China, the bankers added.</P>
      <P>According to Chinese regulations, foreign banks should set up representative
offices for two years before upgrading them to branches or subsidiaries, while
foreign insurance companies in China should have operated for over 30 years
within any World Trade Organization state with a minimum year-end total asset
value of US$500 million and should have established a representative office in
China for two years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Federation of Industry Chairman Lee Cheng-chia said the establishment  of
a currency  settlement  mechanism  should be prioritized during the third round
of cross-strait  talks and suggested that Taiwan and China authorize the Bank of
Taiwan and the Bank of China to handle related business.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan last July authorized some 1,240 local bank outlets to begin
exchanges between new Taiwan dollars and the Chinese yuan, with a daily
transaction limit of 20,000 yuan per person per day, the supplies of yuan are
insufficient and the cost of buying the Chinese currency is too high, as China's
monetary authority has yet to promise to provide Taiwan with yuan on a regular
basis, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>Currently, Taiwan's banks buy Chinese yuan mainly from HSBC and Bank of America.</P>
      <P>Therefore, Lee said, building a cross-strait currency clearance mechanism to
normalize and systemize the clearance of Taiwanese and Chinese currencies is
essential.</P>

      <P>A 10-month-old baby girl who was dumped by her father into a pot of boiling
water Saturday in southern Taiwan's Changhua County remained in critical
condition as of Sunday morning in the intensive care unit of a local hospital.</P>
      <P>The infant's mother, identified only by her family name of Lin, scooped her out
of the pot and rushed to a nearby police station for help, whereupon officers
immediately sent her to the Burn Center at the Changhua Christian Hospital.</P>
      <P>The baby girl, who suffered second degree burns over 95 percent of her body,
deteriorated overnight and had to be placed on a respirator as she could no
longer breathe on her own, doctors said Sunday, adding that although she was
being given fluids, the prognosis was not good.</P>
      <P>Changhua Magistrate Cho Po-yuan paid a visit to the hospital where the baby is
being treated and asked the public to pray for her.</P>
      <P>The baby's father, a 47-year-old surnamed Huang with a history of drunkenness,
threw her into the boiling water after having a fierce argument with Lin, who is
alleged to have taunted him into carrying out the assault.</P>
      <P>Police arrested Huang and handed him over to the Changhua Prosecutors Office on
charges of attempted homicide following an initial investigation.</P>
      <P>Huang and Lin, who have lived together for 12 years but are not married, have
two daughters. The older one, a fifth grader, was placed with a foster family by
county social welfare officials following the incident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Laid-off dad spends quality time with preschool daughters</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
04/19/09  17:57:33
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A former employee of a high-tech company who was laid off late last year due to
the global economic crunch, has taken the opportunity of his enforced leisure to
spend rare quality time with his two young daughters on a tailor-made tricycle
riding the roads from northern Taiwan to the south.</P>
      <P>Riding and touring, the daughters, aged 4 and 5, learned that the rice seedlings
in southern Taiwan are further on than those in the north and that small plastic
windmills can help monitor the trike's speed, although they usually traveled at
less than 10 kph, said Chiang Ching-piao, the girls' father.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who calls himself "Peter Dad " and is from Taoyuan in northern Taiwan,
was watching the television cartoon En Famille with his daughters last December
when the youngsters expressed great yearning to travel on a donkey cart like the
little girl in the cartoon adapted from a novel by 19th-Century French writer
Hector Malot.</P>
      <P>"Peter Dad" thought about buying an ox cart to fulfill his daughters' wishes but
after long consideration and assessment, decided to get a tricycle instead.</P>
      <P>He then spent NT$12,000 to have a tricycle tailor-made by a manufacturer in
eastern Hualien County and determined to spend the break in his career with his
daughters, who have not yet entered elementary school. The machine has two seats
for the youngsters in the front and a driver's seat at the back.</P>
      <P>They set off March 17 from Taoyuan on a month-long cycle journey, riding the
country roads Monday through Friday, while Chiang's wife, a worker with an
airline company in Taoyuan, joined them on the weekends.</P>
      <P>Traveling at walking speed, the trio would stop for fun, food and rest whenever
they wanted and the girls would learn about the roadside wildflowers and would
see farmers working the land.</P>
      <P>They also visited parks in different cities, where the girls would rate the
slides, with one in the Chiayi Park descending from the roof of a public toilet
down to a sandpit taking top honors.</P>
      <P>It was not all plain sailing, of course, and the journey was occasionally
disrupted by flat tires, worn brakes and loose nuts and bolts.</P>
      <P>The worst situation was when they were riding on a downhill stretch  of road in
Chiayi County when the bike skidded and overturned, leaving the girls with
bruised legs and elbows and a little bit scared, said their father.</P>
      <P>The girls then asked him to install two plastic windmills they had bought at a
night market on the front of the bike to help monitor its speed.</P>
      <P>"The girls would ask me to slow down when the windmills spun wildly -- but they
would demand that I pedal faster when the windmills were not spinning at all,"
he said ruefully.</P>
      <P>Every evening after the girls went to bed Chiang would post about the day's
adventures on his blog.</P>
      <P>The blog helped them make friends, with some blog visitors even meeting them on
the road and riding with them for a while.</P>
      <P>The family reached Taiwan's southernmost town of Kenting April 15 and visited
the shooting locations of Cape No. 7 -- the biggest grossing locally produced
film in Taiwan's cinema history.</P>
      <P>They were also entertained by another blog visitor with duck rice noodles
accompanied with smoked fowl -- famous local delicacies in Pingtung County's
Hengchun township.</P>
      <P>They wrapped up their journey April 17 in Pingtung, where they headed for
Kaohsiung County to take the high speed train home, leaving their now-battered
tricycle to be transported home on an ordinary train.</P>
      <P>Once they got home, Chiang had to visit a clinic to get his sore arms treated,
but his five-year-old has already been asking him when he will take her for a
"real bicycle ride" to eastern Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait MOU expected to benefit local futures industry</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's futures industry is expected to be boosted when a proposed memorandum
of understanding (MOU) on the futures business is signed by Taiwan and China,
local futures companies said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The signing of the agreement will help improve transparency in the industry,
which is viewed widely as a promising sector but still in its fledgling stage in
China, according to an executive of Polaris MF Global Futures Co.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is expected to be able to contribute a great deal if it forges
cooperative ties with China in this regard because local futures dealers
specialize in brokerage services, marketing, risk control, exploiting
information technology and delivering training programs, the executive said.</P>
      <P>The key will be whether Taiwanese funds can be used to invest in China's futures
markets, the executive added.</P>
      <P>China has numerous financial institutions of various sizes, so once the
agreement is inked, Taiwanese futures companies planning to venture into the
Chinese market will face the challenge of dealing with the different-sized
companies there, the executive noted.</P>
      <P>Mutual recognition of professional qualifications obtained in Taiwan and China
is also an important issue that should be addressed in the agreement, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a representative of Grand Cathay Futures Corp. said that to expand
the scope of exchanges between the new Taiwan dollar and the Chinese yuan, which
would facilitate investment in each other's markets, a currency clearing system
should be first set up before both sides could engage in cooperation in that
area.</P>
      <P>According  to statistics  compiled by the Futures Industry Association (FIA),
the Taiwan Futures Exchange (TAIFEX) was ranked as 17th in the world in terms of
trade volume in 2008, ahead of the Singapore and Hong Kong markets.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's futures market currently holds a total guarantee fund of NT$120
billion, while China's three futures markets -- located in the cities of
Shanghai, Dalian and Zhengzhou -- hold a total guarantee fund of 250 billion
yuan.</P>
      <P>China's future markets are mainly for the trading of commodity futures, such as
soybeans, wheat, cotton, plastics and metals, while financial futures play a
larger role in Taiwan's future market. The markets on both sides can strongly
complement each other if a cooperative agreement is clinched, according to
market analysts.</P>
      <P>Although an official cooperative mechanism has yet to be set up, futures
companies on both sides have already been engaged in cross-strait exchanges,
industry sources said.</P>
      <P>For example, Polaris, which has five operating centers and more than 300 staff
in Taiwan, is planning to send 50 employees to gain an understanding of Chinese
laws and regulations and spur them to gain professional certification in China,
while Grand Cathay Futures is looking forward to sharing its expertise with
large Chinese futures companies that have 20-30 subsidiaries, the sources added.</P>

develop even closer trade and commerce ties in the future.</P>
      <P>Around 60 percent of the respondents said that a Taiwan-China ECFA will help
Taiwan clinch similar accords with other countries, while 60 percent said lower
tariffs ensured by an ECFA will help Taiwanese products grab a bigger share of
the Chinese market, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Concerning the sensitive Taiwan sovereignty issue, 53.6 percent said they
believe the planned ECFA is designed to handle economic matters and will not
affect Taiwan's independent  sovereignty. Nevertheless, 37.7 percent said they
were concerned about such a development.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether Chinese investment in Taiwan should be permitted,
79.9 percent agreed that limited opening is acceptable, while 17.2 percent
strongly opposed the idea.</P>
      <P>Around 90 percent of the respondents said they would not purchase fewer locally
made products if more Chinese goods are allowed to enter the domestic market
under the terms of an ECFA.</P>
      <P>While close to 49 percent of the respondents said they believe that an ECFA will
help increase jobs in Taiwan, 23.7 percent did not agree, according to the
survey.</P>
      <P>The opinion poll was conducted April 8-11, collecting 1,067 valid questionnaires
from people aged between 20 and 69. It had a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.</P>
      <P>The MAC expressed hope that the results of the survey will help narrow the gap
between the ruling party and the opposition, which is vehemently against such a
pact with China, with the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party and the
Taiwan Solidarity Union voicing fear that Taiwan's sovereign status would be
compromised.</P>
      <P>As for concern that an ECFA would deal a heavy blow to Taiwan's traditional
businesses, MAC officials said the council will make a more precise assessment
of the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Buddhist charity offers tips on how to cope with financial crisis</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 20 (CNA)
04/20/09  12:28:09
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local Buddhist charity, the Tzu Chi Foundation, has been offering some tips on
how people can cope on an everyday basis with the effects of the financial
crisis that has gripped the world.</P>
      <P>As part of its 43rd founding anniversary celebrations, the foundation launched
an exhibition Sunday in Taipei to give details on how people can save money by
living simply.</P>
      <P>First, the foundation recommended that people use less of everything, starting
with plastic bags and disposable tableware.</P>
      <P>It suggested that shoppers carry their own bags rather than buying plastic bags
and that consumers take along their own cups to buy drinks rather than using
disposable cups.</P>
      <P>Living simply also means refraining from buying luxury items, such as cosmetics
and designer products, the charity said.</P>
      <P>The foundation called on people to use cheap endurable handbags instead of
expensive designer brands, and to buy functional mobile phones rather than fancy
ones.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan sells more than 7 million mobile phones a year domestically,
the foundation suggested the public learn to use their cell phones properly and
not to discard them if they are still usable.</P>
      <P>"When you do have to replace them, remember to turn them in to a recycling
station," the foundation said, adding that less them 20 percent of used mobile
phones in Taiwan are recycled.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by a foreign environmental group, the foundation said
if each mobile phone user worldwide hands over one phone for recycling, this can
save 2,400,000 tons of raw materials and cut carbon dioxide emissions by a
volume equivalent to that produced by 4 million cars.</P>
      <P>The volume of raw materials saved will be more significant if mobile phone
appliances such batteries, battery chargers, wireless earphones, and packing
materials are also recycled, said the foundation.</P>
      <P>Living more simply would not compromise the quality of life, as it does not cost
much to live happily, and people would not be deprived of their pleasure if that
pleasure  is derived from activities such as gardening, hiking, sports, reading,
voluntary service, and arts appreciation, said the foundation.</P>
      <P>In order to convince the general public that they can live simply and save
money, the exhibition also includes several practical examples.</P>
      <P>The exhibition was staged at the foundation's seven offices in downtown Taipei.

    <HEADLINE>Legislative speaker calls for connecting flight accord with China</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
04/20/09  13:35:01
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Monday that it is critically
important for Taiwan to sign an accord with China on connecting flight rights,
which would be beneficial to Taiwanese air carriers.</P>
      <P>"The Legislative Yuan will ask Taiwan negotiators in the upcoming cross-strait
talks to seek that goal," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Connecting flight rights, also known as the Fifth Freedom of the Air, allow air
carriers to fly passengers from one's own country to a second country, and from
that country to a third country, with tickets available on any or all sectors.</P>
      <P>On  concerns  that  such  an  agreement  might  involve "nation-to-nation"
political barriers, Wang suggested that the two sides shelve sovereignty
disputes and focus on substantive issues.</P>
      <P>Negotiators from Taiwan and China are expected to discuss four main topics in
Nanjing April 26 in their third round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks. The topics
on the agenda are financial cooperation, augmenting the direct cross-strait
charter flights with regular flights, combating crime, and opening Taiwan to
investment from China. Agreements on the first three issues are expected to be
signed during the talks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Sheng-chung expressed hope at
the Legislative Yuan that the issue of patent rights infringement  will be
included in the fourth round of cross-strait talks.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Reporters receive hypoxia tolerance training at WuFeng Lab</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of reporters traveled Monday to Jade Mountain, Taiwan's highest peak,
after receiving hypoxia tolerance training in a lab at the WuFeng Institute of
Technology in southern Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>The five journalists and cameramen from a local daily newspaper and two cable TV
stations continued their training to adapt to a high-altitude environment in
preparation for their upcoming coverage of an attempt to summit Everest by four
Taiwanese climbers in May.</P>
      <P>They received  the hypoxia  tolerance  training  at WuFeng Institute's Hypoxia
Environment Lab, simulating an oxygen level similar to that found at a height of
6,000 meters above sea level.</P>
      <P>They stayed in a 9.9 sq. ft. hypoxia ward all night to familiarize themselves
with dealing with a lack of oxygen, according to Prof. Su Chung-hui, a project
manager at the laboratory.</P>
      <P>Noting that most people usually cannot tolerate the hypoxia room for more than
an hour, Su said all five signed consent forms before entering the room, while
lab staff closely monitored them around the clock.</P>
      <P>The five then traveled Monday to Jade Mountain, Taiwan's highest peak, to
continue their training to adapt to a high-altitude environment.</P>
      <P>They are scheduled to depart from Taiwan April 30 for Nepal and to reach Everest
base camp May 9 to cover the Everest expedition by four Taiwanese climbers -- Wu
Yu-lung, Huang Chih-hao, Hsieh Ying-su and Chiang Hsiu-chen -- around mid-May.</P>
      <P>The four climbers received hypoxia tolerance training at the lab in March.</P>
      <P>The expedition, the first by a Taiwan alpine team since 1996, is being sponsored
by Atunas, a sports gear supplier that also operates an outdoor resort, the
Atunas Holiday Country, in Chiayi County.</P>
      <P>Of the four climbers, Chiang is the only woman. She reached the summit of
Everest from the north 14 years ago.</P>
      <P>The latest expedition plans to make its summit attempt on the south face of the
mountain, the conventional route.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou hailed the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) Monday as the
cornerstone of cross-Taiwan Strait peace and the mutually beneficial ties that
are developing among Taiwan, China and the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Office with members of
the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ,
including CSIS President and CEO and former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense
John Hamre as well as other academics familiar with Asian and China affairs.</P>
      <P>"The TRA is the key to preserving peace in the strait and has served as a
pillar, supporting mutually beneficial relations between Taiwan and mainland
China over the past 30 years, " the president said.</P>
      <P>Since assuming office in May 2008, Ma said, he has actively sought to improve
Taiwan's links with China and the United States, which had soured during the
2000-2008 period under the former Democratic Progressive Party administration.</P>
      <P>With improved China ties, there have also been initial signs of progress in
Taiwan's relations with the United States and Japan as well as in other
diplomatic relations, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma has been invited to give a keynote speech by teleconference from Taiwan at a
seminar to be organized by the CSIS in Washington, D.C. April 22 to examine the
role of the TRA in Taipei-Beijing- Washington ties 30 years after its enactment.</P>
      <P>It will be Ma's first exchange with U.S. academics in such a forum since he took
office.</P>
      <P>Ma will be introduced by Richard Armitage, a former U.S. deputy secretary of
state, according to the host.</P>
      <P>Almost all major U.S. think tanks have sponsored seminars to mark the 30th
anniversary of the U.S. law, particularly at a time of warming relations between
Taiwan and China.</P>

      <P>Junk e-mails from Taiwan constituted 19 percent of global spam in 2007, but fell
to 10 percent of the 119.6 billion junk e-mails sent in 2008, according to the
Cupertino, California-based company.</P>
      <P>The declining number sent Taiwan's ranking in the Asia-Pacific region as a

      <P>According to the producer of Norton anti-virus software, 90 percent of global
junk e-mail was sent from bots and botnets -- one of the most sophisticated and

    <HEADLINE>Lawmaker proposes ban on children-targeted life insurance</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
04/20/09  20:22:51
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the economic recession causing an increasing unemployment rate, the ethical
risks created by selling life insurance policies targeting minors has inspired a
call for a ban on the sale of life insurance policies for children aged under
14.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kao Jyh-peng of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party proposed
an amendment to the Insurance Law last week at the Legislative Yuan to make the
ban possible and his proposal has received sufficient endorsement by lawmakers
for it to be put on the legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, life insurance policies for children aged 14 or under,
or those who are diagnosed as suffering from a mental disorder, pay out funeral
benefits to a maximum of NT$2 million (US$59,000).</P>
      <P>Although there is no provision  of death benefits to the beneficiary of the
policy in the event of the death of the insured child, the funeral payout can
still be an attractive enough incentive for parents to murder their children,
according to Chen Charng-ven, a well-known local attorney and president of the
Republic of China Red Cross Society who recently published his opinions in a
local newspaper.</P>
      <P>In response to the call, Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)
Chairman Sean Chen said he supports the proposed ban and that the commission has
moved to review the law.</P>
      <P>According to data provided by police authorities and insurance businesses, the
latest attempted murder for the purpose of claiming insurance benefits was
reported in Taoyuan County last year when a 43-year-old truck driver tried to
drown his 11-year-old daughter in a river so that he could claim the NT$2
million funeral benefit.</P>
      <P>The attempt failed and the father, who had credit card debts in excess of
NT$600,000, was arrested, convicted of attempted murder and given a 12-year
prison term.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1997, the law had prohibited insurers from marketing life policies for
children aged under 14, but the legislature amended the law to allow parents to
insure their children with no ceiling on the death benefits.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the legislature revised the law again according to a proposal by Hsieh
Chi-ta, at the time a legislator of the opposition New Party, to set a ceiling
of NT$1 million for funeral compensation, which was later raised again to NT$2
million following demands of insurance businesses.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue, Chiang Chao-kuo, a law professor at National Taipei
University, suggested that parents should be allowed to purchase medical or
annuity insurance policies for their children that "are only payable as long as
the insured is still alive."</P>
      <P>According to statistics of the Life Insurance Association, as of the end of
2008, the total population of children aged under 14 stood at just over 3.9
million, more than 2.5 million of whom had private insurance -- mostly medical
insurance -- packages.</P>

      <P>Two Legislative Yuan committees adopted an amendment Monday, paving the way for
legislation to weed out teachers in Taiwan's schools who are found to have
molested their students.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers serving on the Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee
and the Education and Culture Committee held a joint meeting and adopted the
amendment to the Statute Governing the Appointment of Educators.</P>
      <P>The amendment would require teachers accused of sexual assaults against their
students be suspended from their posts. If the school's Gender  Equity Education
Committee  has established  that the allegations are true, they will be laid off
immediately and will never be allowed to work for any schools again.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislators who introduced the amendment said the amendment is necessary
because under the existing law, teachers who are suspended pending investigation
into their alleged sexual assaults can still receive half of their salaries, and
after the period of suspension is over, they can return to their teaching posts,
placing students in peril.</P>
      <P>Many of the teachers in Taiwan's schools who molested their students are repeat
offenders, Feng Chiao-lan, director-general of the Humanistic Education
Foundation, pointed out at a public hearing held at the legislature before the
legislators began to screen the amendment.</P>
      <P>Feng deplored that school principals usually play down the incidents and allow
teachers to continue to serve in their teaching posts.</P>
      <P>From 2006 to 2008, a total of 288 sexual assault cases occurred in Taiwan's
schools at all levels, according to statistics compiled by the Domestic Violence
and Sexual Assault Prevention Committee under the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that nearly all the victims were students, with 68
percent of the them being underage.</P>
      <P>The amendment was introduced by legislators of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT),
including Huang Chao-shun and Chao Li-yun. It will be submitted to the
legislature to undergo a floor debate and the second and third readings before
becoming law.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, senior education officials said the Ministry of Education will
establish a sex offenders registry, which will allow the personnel offices of
all schools to find out easily whether an applicant for a teaching job is a sex
offender.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the database will include the ID numbers of all the
teachers fired because of their sexual offenses against students, and that even
if they have changed their names, they can still be identified easily.</P>

      <P>The soon-to-be-inaugurated DHL operational center in Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport is being regarded as a powerful magnet to help attract
investors to invest in a project to build an "aviation city" surrounding the
airport near Taipei.</P>
      <P>The new DHL operational center, located in the Farglory Free Trade Zone, will be
inaugurated April 24. It will help raise shipment management efficiency of the
international express and logistic service provider in Taiwan by three times,
according to a DHL Taiwan executive.</P>
      <P>The higher efficiency in handling cargo shipment is expected to attract
companies to set up their operational base in the planned aviation city.</P>
      <P>The construction of the new facility worth NT$210 million (US$6.16 million)
began in August 2007.</P>
      <P>An aviation city, also known as an aerotropolis, is a new type of mini-city
comprising aviation-intensive  businesses  and related enterprises  extending up
to 25 kilometers outward from major airports.</P>
      <P>The aviation city project to be built around the Taiwan Taoyuan airport is part
of the major national construction development plans initiated by the
administration of President Ma Ying-jeou, which is hoping to attract NT$1
trillion of foreign investment.</P>
      <P>The project is expected to be completed by the year 2020.</P>

      <P>Hong Kong action movie star Jackie Chan will stay on as an International
Goodwill Ambassador for Deaflympics Taipei 2009 despite controversial comments
he recently made about Taiwan's democracy, a Taipei City government official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Emile Chih-jen  Sheng,  director  of the city's  Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission and CEO of the 2009 Taipei Deaflympics Organizing
Committee, said he did not agree with Chan's view, but that Chan's role as
International Goodwill Ambassador for the Games will not be affected.</P>
      <P>"Politics should be separated from sports, and Jackie Chan will not be replaced
for the time being," Sheng said.</P>
      <P>"If we really removed Chan from the role just because of some comments he made,
it would in turn damage Taiwan's democratic image in the international area," he
argued.</P>
      <P>Sheng refused to answer whether Chan would be invited to take part in the games
in Taipei, but he said the city government will let Chan know through the
Organizing Committee that it felt Chan's comments were imprudent.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia summit meeting on China's Hainan Island last
Saturday, Chan opined that "Chinese need to be controlled" and that "freedom in
Taiwan and Hong Kong is chaotic."</P>
      <P>His comments drew a backlash from people in Taiwan and his native Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference earlier Monday, Cheng Wen-tsang, head of the
public relations department of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
, urged the government to list Chan as "persona non grata."</P>
      <P>It is not the first time that Chan has trampled on Taiwan's democracy, he said.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Gao Jyh-peng said that if the city continued to use Chan as a
spokesman for the 2009 Deaflympics, the DPP caucus would not rule out submitting
a proposal to have the Executive Yuan cut off its funding for the event.</P>
      <P>"Chan does not deserve the honor because he did not respect universally
recognized democratic values," Gao said.</P>
      <P>A group of DPP Taipei City councilors also handed a protest letter to the city
government asking that Chan be replaced.</P>
      <P>Later Monday, Minister without Portfolio Ovid J. L. Tseng said the Executive
Yuan will not meddle in the controversy even though it is providing financial
support to the city for the Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>"Freedom of speech is respected in Taiwan's society, and I believe that Taipei
City will carefully assess the issue, " he said.</P>
      <P>The 21st Summer Deaflympics Taipei 2009 will be held Sept. 5-15.</P>

boy their very best when they bring Hsiao Cheng back to their homeland.</P>
      <P>Wu Wen-hui, the head of the orphanage, recalled that Hsiao Cheng was sent to the
orphanage five days after his birth at a local hospital.</P>
      <P>His blood father was never identified, and his blood mother left soon after
giving birth without leaving any forwarding address, Wu said.</P>

      <P>The central government approved a revised budget Monday for the planned Taichung
Mass Rapid Transit system in central Taiwan, increasing funding for the project
to NT$51.39 billion (US$1.52 billion) from the previous NT$28.79 billion.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development gave the green light Monday to
the 16.71-kilometer public transit project, which will link Taichung City's
Beitun district to Taichung County's Wuri based on an amended plan.</P>
      <P>The project was originally approved in 2004 with a budget of NT$28.79 billion
but was not launched because the city never received the final go-ahead to begin
the system's construction, according to Taichung City Transportation Bureau
Director Wen Tai-hsin.</P>
      <P>Five years later, Wen said, the cost has risen considerably even though the
system's length remains the same because of the addition of three stations --
bringing the total to 18 -- a revision to the system's anti-vibration features,
and building material inflation.</P>
      <P>Construction of the project will begin in October this year, and its completion
is slated for 2015, Wen said. It will be central Taiwan's first metro line.</P>

      <P>He observed,  however,  that the closeness of cross-strait exchanges was

      <P>The state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) indicated Monday that it will take
at least six months before referendums can be held to determine if two Taiwanese
townships will become low-level radioactive waste dumping sites.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taipower have
received a total of 138 letters raising various questions since March 16, when
the ministry proposed in a bulletin that Daren Township in Taitung County in
southeastern Taiwan and Wang-an Township in Penghu County off the west coast of
Taiwan be designated as the radioactive waste storage sites.</P>
      <P>According to regulations governing the selection of a nuclear waste dumping
ground, the government must allow one month's time after the bulletin is
released for the public to express their views on the issue and ask related
questions.</P>
      <P>Government authorities must gather all the views and answer all the questions
before the voters in the two counties where the potential  sites are located can
determine  the issue through referendum.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials estimated that it will be at least six months before the two
referendums take place.</P>
      <P>Taipower has maintained a dumping site at the southeastern tip of Lanyu, also
known as Orchid Island, off southeastern Taiwan for the low-level waste from its
three nuclear power plants.</P>
      <P>The dump was completed in 1982 without the knowledge and consent of the
residents of Lanyu. Subsequent legislation requires that local residents in a
particular county be consulted first and given the right to vote on whether they
would agree to the construction of a dumping site in their area.</P>

prevent the occurrence of domestic violence-related cases, Interior Minister
Liao Liou-yi said Monday.</P>
      <P>Liao made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting at which lawmakers
from across the political spectrum expressed concern about the country's social
relief network in the wake of several heart-wrenching abuse cases, including the
dumping of a 10-month-old baby girl by her father into a pot of boiling water
last Saturday.</P>
      <P>Stressing that his heart ached upon learning of the baby girl's tragedy, Liao
said his ministry immediately directed its office in central Taiwan's Changhua
County to keep tabs on the case and offer all necessary assistance.</P>
      <P>The baby girl was still in critical condition as of Monday evening.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Liao said, the ministry keeps data on and tracks families with
young children where the parents are alcoholic or addicted to drugs and are
known to fight frequently.</P>
      <P>In the future, Liao said more high-risk families, including those without young
children, will be entered into the ministry's databank.</P>

      <P>According to the official, the government's top economic planning agency, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development, has approved the RDEC-proposed
plan to upgrade the English ability of Taiwan's residents.</P>
      <P>The program will include the establishment of several English villages  and  the
replacement  of bilingual  (Chinese-English) signboards at various government

      <P>From 2010 through 2012, the official said, the government will set aside a

services to foreign expatriates.</P>
      <P>The official also said the number of planned "English Villages" -- a real

public infrastructure construction.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the "English Village" project will be able to enroll 3,000
people, or 1,000 per year, who eventually obtain certificates proving they are
proficient in English.</P>
      <P>The government will also conduct annual surveys among foreign expatriates living
in Taiwan to get their opinions on the country's English environment and hope to
improve the average level of satisfaction by 1 percent a year to 68 percent in

cornerstone of cross-Taiwan Strait peace and the mutually beneficial ties that
are developing among Taiwan, China and the United States.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a meeting at the Presidential Office with members of
the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) ,
including CSIS President and CEO and former U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense
John Hamre as well as other academics familiar with Asian and China affairs.</P>
      <P>"The TRA is the key to preserving peace in the strait and has served as a
pillar, supporting mutually beneficial relations between Taiwan and mainland
China over the past 30 years, " the president said.</P>
      <P>Since assuming office in May 2008, Ma said, he has actively sought to improve
Taiwan's links with China and the United States, which had soured during the
2000-2008 period under the former Democratic Progressive Party administration.</P>
      <P>With improved China ties, there have also been initial signs of progress in
Taiwan's relations with the United States and Japan as well as in other
diplomatic relations, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma has been invited to give a keynote speech by teleconference from Taiwan at a
seminar to be organized by the CSIS in Washington, D.C. April 22 to examine the
role of the TRA in Taipei-Beijing- Washington ties 30 years after its enactment.</P>
      <P>It will be Ma's first exchange with U.S. academics in such a forum since he took
office.</P>
      <P>Ma will be introduced by Richard Armitage, a former U.S. deputy secretary of
state, according to the host.</P>
      <P>Almost all major U.S. think tanks have sponsored seminars to mark the 30th

      <P>The percentage of junk e-mails originating from Taiwan fell to 10 percent of the
global total in 2008, while China remained the Asia-Pacific  region's biggest
proliferator, Internet security company Symantec Corp. said Monday.</P>
      <P>Junk e-mails from Taiwan constituted 19 percent of global spam in 2007, but fell
to 10 percent of the 119.6 billion junk e-mails sent in 2008, according to the
Cupertino, California-based company.</P>
      <P>The declining number sent Taiwan's ranking in the Asia-Pacific region as a
proliferator of spam tumbling to fifth from second in 2007. China remained the
No. 1 source of Internet mayhem in 2008 in the area, Symantec said.</P>
      <P>According to the producer of Norton anti-virus software, 90 percent of global
junk e-mail was sent from bots and botnets -- one of the most sophisticated and
popular types of cybercrime today.</P>
      <P>They allow hackers to take control of many computers at a time, and turn them
into "zombie" computers, which operate as part of a powerful "botnet" to spread
viruses, generate spam, and commit other types of online crime and fraud.</P>
      <P>Of the junk e-mail, 24 percent was Internet-related junk, 19 percent was
commerce-related spam, and about 16 percent was junk e-mail related to personal
finances.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Lawmaker proposes ban on children-targeted life insurance</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the economic recession causing an increasing unemployment rate, the ethical
risks created by selling life insurance policies targeting minors has inspired a
call for a ban on the sale of life insurance policies for children aged under
14.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kao Jyh-peng of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party proposed
an amendment to the Insurance Law last week at the Legislative Yuan to make the
ban possible and his proposal has received sufficient endorsement by lawmakers
for it to be put on the legislative agenda.</P>
      <P>Under the existing law, life insurance policies for children aged 14 or under,
or those who are diagnosed as suffering from a mental disorder, pay out funeral
benefits to a maximum of NT$2 million (US$59,000).</P>
      <P>Although there is no provision  of death benefits to the beneficiary of the
policy in the event of the death of the insured child, the funeral payout can
still be an attractive enough incentive for parents to murder their children,
according to Chen Charng-ven, a well-known local attorney and president of the
Republic of China Red Cross Society who recently published his opinions in a
local newspaper.</P>
      <P>In response to the call, Cabinet-level Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC)
Chairman Sean Chen said he supports the proposed ban and that the commission has
moved to review the law.</P>
      <P>According to data provided by police authorities and insurance businesses, the
latest attempted murder for the purpose of claiming insurance benefits was
reported in Taoyuan County last year when a 43-year-old truck driver tried to
drown his 11-year-old daughter in a river so that he could claim the NT$2
million funeral benefit.</P>
      <P>The attempt failed and the father, who had credit card debts in excess of
NT$600,000, was arrested, convicted of attempted murder and given a 12-year
prison term.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1997, the law had prohibited insurers from marketing life policies for
children aged under 14, but the legislature amended the law to allow parents to
insure their children with no ceiling on the death benefits.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the legislature revised the law again according to a proposal by Hsieh
Chi-ta, at the time a legislator of the opposition New Party, to set a ceiling
of NT$1 million for funeral compensation, which was later raised again to NT$2
million following demands of insurance businesses.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the issue, Chiang Chao-kuo, a law professor at National Taipei
University, suggested that parents should be allowed to purchase medical or
annuity insurance policies for their children that "are only payable as long as
the insured is still alive."</P>
      <P>According to statistics of the Life Insurance Association, as of the end of
2008, the total population of children aged under 14 stood at just over 3.9
million, more than 2.5 million of whom had private insurance -- mostly medical
insurance -- packages.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Law being amended to weed out sex offenders from schools</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two Legislative Yuan committees adopted an amendment Monday, paving the way for
legislation to weed out teachers in Taiwan's schools who are found to have
molested their students.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers serving on the Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee
and the Education and Culture Committee held a joint meeting and adopted the
amendment to the Statute Governing the Appointment of Educators.</P>
      <P>The amendment would require teachers accused of sexual assaults against their
students be suspended from their posts. If the school's Gender  Equity Education
Committee  has established  that the allegations are true, they will be laid off
immediately and will never be allowed to work for any schools again.</P>
      <P>The KMT legislators who introduced the amendment said the amendment is necessary
because under the existing law, teachers who are suspended pending investigation
into their alleged sexual assaults can still receive half of their salaries, and
after the period of suspension is over, they can return to their teaching posts,
placing students in peril.</P>
      <P>Many of the teachers in Taiwan's schools who molested their students are repeat
offenders, Feng Chiao-lan, director-general of the Humanistic Education
Foundation, pointed out at a public hearing held at the legislature before the
legislators began to screen the amendment.</P>
      <P>Feng deplored that school principals usually play down the incidents and allow
teachers to continue to serve in their teaching posts.</P>
      <P>From 2006 to 2008, a total of 288 sexual assault cases occurred in Taiwan's
schools at all levels, according to statistics compiled by the Domestic Violence
and Sexual Assault Prevention Committee under the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that nearly all the victims were students, with 68
percent of the them being underage.</P>
      <P>The amendment was introduced by legislators of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT),
including Huang Chao-shun and Chao Li-yun. It will be submitted to the
legislature to undergo a floor debate and the second and third readings before
becoming law.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, senior education officials said the Ministry of Education will
establish a sex offenders registry, which will allow the personnel offices of
all schools to find out easily whether an applicant for a teaching job is a sex
offender.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the database will include the ID numbers of all the
teachers fired because of their sexual offenses against students, and that even
if they have changed their names, they can still be identified easily.</P>

      <P>The soon-to-be-inaugurated DHL operational center in Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport is being regarded as a powerful magnet to help attract
investors to invest in a project to build an "aviation city" surrounding the
airport near Taipei.</P>
      <P>The new DHL operational center, located in the Farglory Free Trade Zone, will be
inaugurated April 24. It will help raise shipment management efficiency of the
international express and logistic service provider in Taiwan by three times,
according to a DHL Taiwan executive.</P>
      <P>The higher efficiency in handling cargo shipment is expected to attract
companies to set up their operational base in the planned aviation city.</P>
      <P>The construction of the new facility worth NT$210 million (US$6.16 million)
began in August 2007.</P>
      <P>An aviation city, also known as an aerotropolis, is a new type of mini-city

      <P>Hong Kong action movie star Jackie Chan will stay on as an International
Goodwill Ambassador for Deaflympics Taipei 2009 despite controversial comments
he recently made about Taiwan's democracy, a Taipei City government official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Emile Chih-jen  Sheng,  director  of the city's  Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission and CEO of the 2009 Taipei Deaflympics Organizing
Committee, said he did not agree with Chan's view, but that Chan's role as
International Goodwill Ambassador for the Games will not be affected.</P>
      <P>"Politics should be separated from sports, and Jackie Chan will not be replaced
for the time being," Sheng said.</P>
      <P>"If we really removed Chan from the role just because of some comments he made,
it would in turn damage Taiwan's democratic image in the international area," he
argued.</P>
      <P>Sheng refused to answer whether Chan would be invited to take part in the games
in Taipei, but he said the city government will let Chan know through the
Organizing Committee that it felt Chan's comments were imprudent.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Boao Forum for Asia summit meeting on China's Hainan Island last
Saturday, Chan opined that "Chinese need to be controlled" and that "freedom in
Taiwan and Hong Kong is chaotic."</P>
      <P>His comments drew a backlash from people in Taiwan and his native Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference earlier Monday, Cheng Wen-tsang, head of the
public relations department of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
, urged the government to list Chan as "persona non grata."</P>
      <P>It is not the first time that Chan has trampled on Taiwan's democracy, he said.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker Gao Jyh-peng said that if the city continued to use Chan as a
spokesman for the 2009 Deaflympics, the DPP caucus would not rule out submitting
a proposal to have the Executive Yuan cut off its funding for the event.</P>
      <P>"Chan does not deserve the honor because he did not respect universally
recognized democratic values," Gao said.</P>
      <P>A group of DPP Taipei City councilors also handed a protest letter to the city
government asking that Chan be replaced.</P>
      <P>Later Monday, Minister without Portfolio Ovid J. L. Tseng said the Executive
Yuan will not meddle in the controversy even though it is providing financial
support to the city for the Deaflympics.</P>
      <P>"Freedom of speech is respected in Taiwan's society, and I believe that Taipei
City will carefully assess the issue, " he said.</P>

to NT$51.39 billion (US$1.52 billion) from the previous NT$28.79 billion.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development gave the green light Monday to
the 16.71-kilometer public transit project, which will link Taichung City's
Beitun district to Taichung County's Wuri based on an amended plan.</P>
      <P>The project was originally approved in 2004 with a budget of NT$28.79 billion

the system's construction, according to Taichung City Transportation Bureau
Director Wen Tai-hsin.</P>
      <P>Five years later, Wen said, the cost has risen considerably even though the
system's length remains the same because of the addition of three stations --
bringing the total to 18 -- a revision to the system's anti-vibration features,

      <P>Construction of the project will begin in October this year, and its completion

      <P>The state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) indicated Monday that it will take
at least six months before referendums can be held to determine if two Taiwanese
townships will become low-level radioactive waste dumping sites.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taipower have
received a total of 138 letters raising various questions since March 16, when
the ministry proposed in a bulletin that Daren Township in Taitung County in
southeastern Taiwan and Wang-an Township in Penghu County off the west coast of
Taiwan be designated as the radioactive waste storage sites.</P>
      <P>According to regulations governing the selection of a nuclear waste dumping
ground, the government must allow one month's time after the bulletin is
released for the public to express their views on the issue and ask related
questions.</P>
      <P>Government authorities must gather all the views and answer all the questions
before the voters in the two counties where the potential  sites are located can
determine  the issue through referendum.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials estimated that it will be at least six months before the two
referendums take place.</P>
      <P>Taipower has maintained a dumping site at the southeastern tip of Lanyu, also
known as Orchid Island, off southeastern Taiwan for the low-level waste from its
three nuclear power plants.</P>
      <P>The dump was completed in 1982 without the knowledge and consent of the
residents of Lanyu. Subsequent legislation requires that local residents in a
particular county be consulted first and given the right to vote on whether they
would agree to the construction of a dumping site in their area.</P>

      <P>The government will invest NT$600 million (US$17.66 million) over the next three
years to enhance English proficiency among the local population,  an official
from the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the government's top economic planning agency, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development, has approved the RDEC-proposed
plan to upgrade the English ability of Taiwan's residents.</P>
      <P>The program will include the establishment of several English villages  and  the
replacement  of bilingual  (Chinese-English) signboards at various government
agencies.</P>
      <P>From 2010 through 2012, the official said, the government will set aside a
budget of NT$200 million per year for the program, which will also include
cultivating manpower, upgrading major local cities' international
competitiveness,  building  an  English-friendly environment and strengthening
services to foreign expatriates.</P>
      <P>The official also said the number of planned "English Villages" -- a real
English-speaking community that immerses its students in all-English environment
to provide an alternative for those who cannot afford private tutoring or
overseas study programs -- will be more than one or two as reported by the local
media.</P>
      <P>"Schools  around the country  that have unused or vacated classrooms are wlecome
to apply to establish an 'English Village, '" the official said, adding that
private groups can also apply for the construction of an "English Village" in
line with the existing statute  encouraging  private  investors  to invest  in
public infrastructure construction.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the "English Village" project will be able to enroll 3,000
people, or 1,000 per year, who eventually obtain certificates proving they are
proficient in English.</P>

      <P>The government will invest NT$600 million (US$17.66 million) over the next three
years to enhance English proficiency among the local population,  an official
from the Cabinet-level Research, Development and Evaluation Commission (RDEC)
said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the government's top economic planning agency, the
Council for Economic Planning and Development, has approved the RDEC-proposed
plan to upgrade the English ability of Taiwan's residents.</P>
      <P>The program will include the establishment of several English villages  and  the
replacement  of bilingual  (Chinese-English) signboards at various government
agencies.</P>
      <P>From 2010 through 2012, the official said, the government will set aside a
budget of NT$200 million per year for the program, which will also include
cultivating manpower, upgrading major local cities' international
competitiveness,  building  an  English-friendly environment and strengthening
services to foreign expatriates.</P>
      <P>The official also said the number of planned "English Villages" -- a real
English-speaking community that immerses its students in all-English environment
to provide an alternative for those who cannot afford private tutoring or
overseas study programs -- will be more than one or two as reported by the local
media.</P>
      <P>"Schools  around the country  that have unused or vacated classrooms are wlecome
to apply to establish an 'English Village, '" the official said, adding that
private groups can also apply for the construction of an "English Village" in
line with the existing statute  encouraging  private  investors  to invest  in
public infrastructure construction.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the "English Village" project will be able to enroll 3,000
people, or 1,000 per year, who eventually obtain certificates proving they are
proficient in English.</P>
      <P>The government will also conduct annual surveys among foreign expatriates living
in Taiwan to get their opinions on the country's English environment and hope to
improve the average level of satisfaction by 1 percent a year to 68 percent in
2012.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) will expand its high-risk family databank to
prevent the occurrence of domestic violence-related cases, Interior Minister
Liao Liou-yi said Monday.</P>
      <P>Liao made the remarks at a Legislative Yuan committee meeting at which lawmakers
from across the political spectrum expressed concern about the country's social
relief network in the wake of several heart-wrenching abuse cases, including the
dumping of a 10-month-old baby girl by her father into a pot of boiling water
last Saturday.</P>
      <P>Stressing that his heart ached upon learning of the baby girl's tragedy, Liao
said his ministry immediately directed its office in central Taiwan's Changhua
County to keep tabs on the case and offer all necessary assistance.</P>
      <P>The baby girl was still in critical condition as of Monday evening.</P>
      <P>At the moment, Liao said, the ministry keeps data on and tracks families with
young children where the parents are alcoholic or addicted to drugs and are
known to fight frequently.</P>
      <P>In the future, Liao said more high-risk families, including those without young
children, will be entered into the ministry's databank.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers also suggested that the ministry reinforce contacts with borough
chiefs to get first-hand information about domestic violence cases.</P>
      <P>Liao pledged that his agency will devote more funding and manpower to improve
its grassroots community information network to help stem domestic violence or
child abuse cases.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Referendums on nuclear waste dumping sites at least six months away</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-owned Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) indicated Monday that it will take
at least six months before referendums can be held to determine if two Taiwanese
townships will become low-level radioactive waste dumping sites.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Taipower have
received a total of 138 letters raising various questions since March 16, when
the ministry proposed in a bulletin that Daren Township in Taitung County in
southeastern Taiwan and Wang-an Township in Penghu County off the west coast of
Taiwan be designated as the radioactive waste storage sites.</P>
      <P>According to regulations governing the selection of a nuclear waste dumping
ground, the government must allow one month's time after the bulletin is
released for the public to express their views on the issue and ask related
questions.</P>
      <P>Government authorities must gather all the views and answer all the questions
before the voters in the two counties where the potential  sites are located can
determine  the issue through referendum.</P>
      <P>Taipower officials estimated that it will be at least six months before the two
referendums take place.</P>
      <P>Taipower has maintained a dumping site at the southeastern tip of Lanyu, also
known as Orchid Island, off southeastern Taiwan for the low-level waste from its
three nuclear power plants.</P>
      <P>The dump was completed in 1982 without the knowledge and consent of the
residents of Lanyu. Subsequent legislation requires that local residents in a
particular county be consulted first and given the right to vote on whether they
would agree to the construction of a dumping site in their area.</P>

      <P>The central government approved a revised budget Monday for the planned Taichung
Mass Rapid Transit system in central Taiwan, increasing funding for the project
to NT$51.39 billion (US$1.52 billion) from the previous NT$28.79 billion.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development gave the green light Monday to
the 16.71-kilometer public transit project, which will link Taichung City's
Beitun district to Taichung County's Wuri based on an amended plan.</P>
      <P>The project was originally approved in 2004 with a budget of NT$28.79 billion
but was not launched because the city never received the final go-ahead to begin
the system's construction, according to Taichung City Transportation Bureau
Director Wen Tai-hsin.</P>
      <P>Five years later, Wen said, the cost has risen considerably even though the
system's length remains the same because of the addition of three stations --
bringing the total to 18 -- a revision to the system's anti-vibration features,
and building material inflation.</P>
      <P>Construction of the project will begin in October this year, and its completion
is slated for 2015, Wen said. It will be central Taiwan's first metro line.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA to release first white paper on foreign aid policy in May</HEADLINE>

      <P>A long-awaited "white paper" on foreign aid, which will outline the country's
new thinking on "professional and effective" overseas assistance, will be
released next month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Now that the statistics of our foreign aid programs have been compiled according
to the standards of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) , the white paper is scheduled to be released in early May, said Weber
Shih, director-general of the MOFA's Department of Economic and Trade Affairs.</P>
      <P>The main goal for issuing a foreign aid white paper is to bring Taiwan's
overseas aid program in line with international trends, " Shih said of the
initiative, which will be the first white paper Taiwan has ever issued on the
subject.</P>
      <P>The ministry first broached the idea of a white paper last September and had
initially planned to release the study late last year, but efforts to bring the
project's methodology in line with international standards resulted in delays.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the paper will use theParis Declaration on Aid
Effectivenessand the United NationsMillennium Development Goals as references
and stress "transparency and professionalism" as the future direction of
Taiwan's overseas assistance.</P>
      <P>The  goal  ofprogressive  partnerships  and  sustainable developmentwill be
clearly indicated in the white paper, " Shih said, adding that Taiwan will help
its diplomatic allies achieve long-term development through the transfer of its
expertise in various fields.</P>
      <P>Besides bilateral aid programs, Taiwan will also provide aid through
multilateral channels by strengthening its cooperation with international
organizations such as the World Trade Organization's Aid for Trade program, Shih
said.</P>
      <P>A special exhibition will be held later in May to demonstrate Taiwan's foreign
aid achievements over the years and help the public better understand the
functions of the country's International Cooperation and Development Fund, he
added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign aid program has been criticized in the past by the
international community for its use as a tool to solicit the recognition of
countries in a diplomatic tug-of-war with China.</P>
      <P>After President Ma Ying-jeou took office last May, the government has considered
overhauling its foreign aid program based on a "diplomatic truce" in which
Taiwan and China tacitly agree not to vie for each other's allies.</P>

      <P>The small knives made by Yang Ming-shan, a member of the Taroko tribe in Hualien
County, have recently gained popularity with tourists to the area, but he admits
that he never would have had the idea if it had not been for his son.</P>
      <P>"Because my son kept asking for toys, I tried to make him an miniature
aboriginal machete," the 40-year-old Yang recalls.</P>
      <P>Yang had been a motorcycle repair technician since he graduated from junior high
school and set up a motorcycle repair shop in Wenlan Village in the eastern
county's Sioulin Township in 1992. His wife operates a betel nut shop at a
tourist service center in nearby Dongmen village.</P>
      <P>"One day, my son saw a knife I took along with me and asked for one as a kind of
toy. I had no choice but to make a miniature version for him, " Yang remembers.</P>
      <P>The episode fueled his interest in making traditional aboriginal knives. He
began crafting a series of small knives, ranging from 5.5 centimeters to 12
centimeters in length, that are based on real Taroko tribal machetes of 58 cm in
length.</P>
      <P>Yang attributed his success in producing the knives to the "skills I obtained
working as a motorcycle repair technician and indigenous people's talent for
handicrafts."</P>
      <P>Yang's creation has become popular among tourists visiting Hualien after knife
sheaths he made with juniper wood, which can be used as key rings and mobile
phone and bag pendant straps, were put on sale at his wife's store.</P>
      <P>Knives play an important role in many aspects of aboriginal life, being widely
used for hunting, farming, working and preparing food and were once used as a
betrothal gift given to the bride's family by the groom's family.</P>
      <P>With the growing popularity of the knives, producing them has become Yang's main
job while repairing motorcycles has been relegated to a sideline occupation. His
wife and his brother-in-law are sometimes called on to lend a hand to meet
increasing demand.</P>
      <P>The popularity of the knives has not been without a significant downside,
however, as a number of low-priced copies of his products made in China have
swarmed into the local market hoping to piggyback on Yang's success.</P>
      <P>The knife marker hopes to use innovation and new products to stay ahead of the
competition created by the cheap knock-offs from China.</P>
      <P>Yang said that the Taroko tribe is the only one of Taiwan's 14 indigenous tribes
to make knives, and he vowed to stick with the industry and develop more
products to protect and promote his tribe's unique culture.</P>

Hospital in Taitung City after learning of its financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The hospital,  long dedicated to providing health care to underprivileged people
in southeastern Taiwan,  hopes to raise NT$31.42 million by November and
transform itself into a nonprofit health care provider, which would allow it to
survive.</P>
      <P>The hospital, set up by foreign missionaries 48 years ago, is facing closure
because of heavy operating deficits in recent years, and becoming a nonprofit
entity would enable it to cushion losses with private donations and other public
funding contributions.</P>

NT$50,000 to St. Mary's Hospital and called for greater public attention and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) assured the public Tuesday that the
unemployment rate for March would post only a slight increase from the previous
month as the country's worsening jobless situation has shown signs of
moderation.</P>
      <P>CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan noted that since the global financial storm hit last
September, Taiwan's unemployment rate has been rising by 0.3 percentage points
per month on average, reaching 5.75 percent in February.</P>
      <P>However, the recent influx of rush orders for Taiwan's industrial sector has
helped moderate the situation, Wang said.</P>
      <P>She predicted that the official unemployment rate for March -- set to be
released Wednesday -- "won't exceed 6 percent, though it will be slightly higher
than in February."</P>
      <P>She said the improvement in the unemployment situation is also reflected in the
declining number of first-time applicants for unemployment benefits.</P>
      <P>From December to February, an average over 30,000 people per month applied for
the benefits for the first time after becoming unemployed, but the number
dropped to 28,000 in March, Wang said.</P>
      <P>During the first 20 days of April, there were just 14,000 such applications, she
added.</P>
      <P>Wang warned, however, that the unemployment rate could rise again in August and
September, when many of this year's graduates are expected to enter the job
market.</P>
      <P>The CLA also announced Tuesday the introduction of a program aimed  at providing
psychological  support  for the country's unemployed.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's largest bicycle manufacturer, Giant Inc., and the country's largest air
carrier, China Airlines (CAL), signed an agreement Monday to jointly promote
bicycle tourism in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement signed by Giant Chairman King Liu and CAL Chairman Wei
Hsing-hsiung,  the two companies will pool their resources to promote Taiwan
globally as a cycling mecca. They will seek to lure more visitors from abroad by
selling bike tours as a way to experience the island's beauty and local people's
hospitality.</P>
      <P>Wei said that CAL, in collaboration with a Taiwan travel agency, launched a
cycling tour of Okinawa in Japan in February which drew an enthusiastic response
from tourists.</P>
      <P>In the future, more cycling travel packages will be offered at CAL and Giant's
domestic and overseas operating centers and outlets, he added.</P>
      <P>Liu said the agreement is also aimed at arranging local and foreign bike tours
for Taiwan residents and boosting public interest in that type of eco-friendly
tourism.</P>
      <P>According to the Giant chairman, Taiwan is well-suited to the development of
bicycle tourism, given that its bicycle production standards are among the
highest in the world and that Giant has vast experience in providing bicycle
rental and maintenance services.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the strategic alliance between the CAL and Giant is expected to
benefit their respective customers and boost Taiwan's tourism industry.</P>
      <P>He also disclosed that Giant has applied to the Ministry of Transportation and
Communication for permission to open a travel agency in June to offer bike tour
packages in Taiwan and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The travel agency is likely to create a business worth hundreds of millions of
New Taiwan dollars, Liu forecast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economics ministry launches energy saving campaign</HEADLINE>

(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) launched an energy-saving campaign
Tuesday, on the eve of Earth Day, calling on the public to turn off electric
appliances when they are not in use and thus save an estimated 3.5 billion units
of energy per year.</P>
      <P>Huang Jung-chiou, vice minister of the MOEA, said at a news conference, held
under the theme "Love the Earth, it's our business to switch off," that turning
off electric appliances is the easiest way to start saving energy and that it
requires everyone's participation to save the Earth.</P>
      <P>"A simple action such as switching off electric appliances can help people to
shape a completely different attitude in life," Huang said.</P>
      <P>"Each little effort can add up to make a major difference to the Earth," he
added.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA's Bureau of Energy and the Cabinet-level Directorate-
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, switching off the six most
commonly used home and office appliances -- copy machines, printers, office
water dispensers, drinking fountains, home electric thermos and computers -- can
save 3.5 billion units of energy per year. This is equivalent to the amount of
energy used annually by 950,000 households and can reduce carbon dioxide
emissions by 2.26 million tons per year, he said.</P>
      <P>Most startlingly, Huang added, the statistics show that 85.2 percent of the
country's 6 million office water dispensers are usually left on around the
clock, seven days a week.</P>
      <P>If these machines are switched off after office hours, this could easily save
1.34 billion energy units annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by
854,000 tons per year, he said.</P>
      <P>As part of the "switch off campaign," the public should use electric timers with
an automatic on-off switches to conserve energy, the MOEA suggested.</P>
      <P>In response to the government's call, representatives from 28 companies and
industrial groups joined Tuesday's news conference, pledging to take the lead in
switching off electric appliances after office hours and to help raise awareness
among their customers of the importance of saving energy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two crew members of the Panama-registered tanker TOSA have been barred from
leaving Taiwan for the time being to assist prosecutors in the investigation
into the sinking of a Taiwanese fishing boat last Friday, prosecutors said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The TOSA was suspected of having hit the 99-ton Hsing Tong Chuan No.86 fishing
vessel that sank near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands early last Friday.</P>
      <P>Eleven of the 13 crew members of the sunken ship, based in Suao in the
northeastern county of Yilan, were rescued, but the ship's captain Ho Si-chuan
and chief engineer Hsu Tsung-wen remain missing.</P>
      <P>The 160,000-ton TOSA was escorted to Hualien Harbor by a Taiwanese coast guard
vessel on the eastern Taiwan coast Saturday pending investigation into the
matter.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-chun, a Hualien chief prosecutor, said that both navigation and track
maps as well as the results of detective police work show that the Panamanian
tanker was passing the disaster site when the fishing boat was sinking.</P>
      <P>During the interrogations, Huang said, neither the tanker's first mate, second
mate nor its night-watch sailor admitted that the tanker had hit the fishing
boat. But they did not deny that the tanker was passing the site as the boat was
sinking, the prosecutor added.</P>
      <P>Huang said if the two Taiwanese crewmen aboard the sunken ship have indeed died,
certain tanker crew members may be indicted on charges of involuntary
manslaughter.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Huang said, the tanker's second mate and night-duty
sailor have been barred from leaving Taiwan pending further investigations into
the cause of the fishing vessel's sinking.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the tanker's owner is willing to pay damages if there is
sufficient evidence to prove that the tanker was liable in the fishing boat's
sinking.</P>
      <P>The Hsing Tong Chuan crew members who were rescued include one Taiwanese
fisherman, two Chinese, six Indonesians and two Filipinos.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Baby girl thrown into pot of boiling water dies (Update)</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 10-month old girl who suffered severe burns after her father threw her in a
pot of boiling water in a case that shocked Taiwan, died Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>Her father, who was arrested following the incident on Saturday, could face the
death penalty, a prosecutor said later.</P>
      <P>Despite intensive efforts by doctors to try to save the girl, who suffered
second and third-degree burns over 84 percent of her body, she died of multiple
organ failure, according to doctors at Changhua Christian Hospital in central
Taiwan's Changhua City.</P>
      <P>With consent of her mother, who did not want her daughter to continue to suffer
the immense pain, the girl was pronounced dead after doctors took her off a
life-support system at 10:05 a.m.</P>
      <P>The baby had been in critical condition since being rushed to the hospital by
her mother after her father, surnamed Huang, did the unimaginable act during an
argument with her mother.</P>
      <P>The infant's mother, identified only by her family name of Lin, immediately
scooped the baby out of the pot in the noodle shop they owned and rushed to a
nearby police station for help, whereupon officers immediately sent the baby to
the hospital's burn center.</P>
      <P>The father, 47, is being held on a homicide charge, and would face either the
death penalty, life imprisonment or a jail term of over 15 years, Chang Hui-
chung, a prosecutor at the Changhua Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>"The punishment will be 50 percent more severe because the victim is a small
child," said Chang.</P>
      <P>The case has ignited anger from people across the country who questioned how
someone could harm a child in such a way. Many people prayed for the girl, with
some religious people maintaining a vigil at the hospital. Nurses were in tears
as they changed the baby's bandages, seeing the pain she was going through.</P>
      <P>The incident has also raised concerns about the increase in violence against
children in Taiwan since the economic downturn began to be widely felt last year
on the island, which is suffering from record unemployment and a sharp decline
in GDP and exports.</P>
      <P>The nonprofit Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (TFCF) said earlier this
month that as the economy has worsened, it has observed a growing rate of
domestic violence against children, triggered primarily by a lack of parenting
skills, unemployment, and poverty.</P>
      <P>As of March, 46 cases of domestic violence involving 73 children, including
eight who died, have been reported this year in the local media. The TFCF urged
parents who are on edge to seek professional help or take some time away from
their children.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the incident, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) on Monday
announced it will expand its databank of high-risk families and increase funding
and manpower to prevent domestic violence from occurring.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi said more families considered at risk will be
entered into an MOI databank and be tracked. These are families with young
children where the parents are alcoholic or addicted to drugs or are known to
fight frequently.</P>
      <P>It is reported that the parents of the little girl had a fierce argument after
the woman blasted Huang for being lazy.</P>
      <P>The baby's father has a history of drunkenness and neighbors said the couple,
who are not married but have lived together for 12 years, often argued.</P>
      <P>The couple have another older daughter besides the baby girl. That daughter, a
fifth grader, was placed with a foster family by county social welfare officials
following the incident.</P>
      <P>The baby's mother, on Tuesday, thanked all walks of life for their care,
encouragement and support over the past four days, but some people believe she
also has responsibility because she allegedly taunted the father into carrying
out the act.</P>

      <P>Prosecutors at the Taitung District Court's Public Prosecutors' Office in
southeastern Taiwan arrested one of their own early Tuesday on charges of
bribery.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Justice Huang Shih-ming  confirmed that prosecutor Lin Sheng-
lin was taken into custody for questioning after an internal investigation found
that he had accepted bribes in at least two cases.</P>
      <P>Members of the anti-corruption division at the Taitung Public Prosecutors'
Office and agents from the Investigation Bureau, armed with a search warrant
from the court, raided Lin's residence and arrested him.</P>
      <P>In August last year, Lin was reassigned from the Shihlin Public Prosecutors'
Office in Taipei to the Taitung Public Prosecutors' Office because he had left
too many criminal cases unhandled, according to the Taitung prosecutors' office.</P>
      <P>Ethics officers in the Taitung prosecutors' office placed Lin under surveillance
after noting that he continued to allow the accumulation of many cases, and that
he had dismissed quite a few cases that he obviously should have prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Further investigation led to the admission by suspects in two criminal cases
that Lin had offered not to indict them if they would pay him bribes.</P>
      <P>The Taitung prosecutors' office was investigating whether Lin was involved in
bribery in other criminal cases that he failed to prosecute.</P>

      <P>Two of three gray-faced buzzards that were released last year in southern Taiwan
in a satellite tracking project of the birds' migration journey have been
recorded as having arrived in China, a project researcher said Monday.</P>
      <P>One of the birds, named Cape No. 1, which was implanted with satellite tracers
and released Oct. 12 last year in Kenting township, was discovered the next day
to have traveled to the Philippines, where it remained for some time before
moving to the coast of China's Guangdong Province, according to Lin Wun-hong,
secretary-general of the Raptor Research Group of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another released buzzard named Cape No. 2 spent more than five months of the
winter in the Philippines and returned to central Taiwan March 21 after flying
through Pingtung, Kaohsiung, Tainan, and Chiayi counties in southern Taiwan. The
bird was later recorded as having arrived Zhejiang Province in eastern China
March 25, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said the research team had lost contact with the third of the birds, named
Cape No. 3, probably because the bird either died or the satellite tracker was
dislodged.</P>
      <P>The satellite tracking project is being conducted by the Forestry Bureau in
collaboration with Taiwan's top academic institution Academia Sinica and the
non-government Raptor Research Group of Taiwan in attempt to establish the
migration patterns of the buzzards, Lin said, adding that the research team also
released another two -- Cape No. 4 and Cape No. 5 -- in late March in the
central county of Changhua.</P>
      <P>After moving north, the two birds left Taiwan mid-April and are presently in
China's southeastern province of Anhui, having used a migration route similar to
that of Cape No. 2.</P>
      <P>Every October, numerous gray-faced buzzards migrate through the Hengchun
peninsula  in the southern county of Pingtung before continuing their migration
to destinations of which the researchers were previously unaware, although a
Forestry Bureau official said the migration areas of the species are limited to
eastern and southern Asia.</P>
      <P>In summer, the species breeds in eastern Asia,  including northeastern China,
the Korean peninsula, southeastern areas of Russia and Japan.</P>
      <P>In autumn, the birds migrate south to southern China, the Indochina area of
Southeast Asia, the Philippines, Indonesia and New Guinea to spend the winter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Possible end to test exemption for foreign medical school graduates</HEADLINE>

04/21/09  21:21:46

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH) is considering rescinding regulations
exempting graduates of overseas medical schools who want to practice in Taiwan
from tough educational background certification tests.</P>
      <P>Under the current regulations, graduates from the United States, Canada, South
Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Singapore, Japan and Hong
Kong are allowed to bypass the tests and directly enter the second stage of
qualification examinations.</P>
      <P>If the DOH's plan goes through, graduates from the nine countries and areas will
have to take the tests, which are the first of three sets of tests that also
include the national physician license examination and practical physician
license examination.</P>
      <P>Only then can they be allowed to practice in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The move was sparked  by recent  public  debate over the controversial
regulation. Critics said the regulation provided a shortcut for Taiwanese
graduates of overseas medical schools which adopt a shorter and looser
curriculum than that of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over past years after Poland joined the EU, more and more Taiwanese students
have gone to that eastern European country to study medicine because the schools
of medicine there adopt a four-year, or six-year curriculum system, shorter than
the system followed in Taiwanese medical schools.</P>
      <P>Students in Taiwan's medical schools must complete a seven-year course of study,
which includes a two-year internship, before qualifying for the national
physician license examination. The physician candidates cannot move any further
toward the position of resident at hospital without passing the test.</P>
      <P>However, some criticized the DOH's acceptance rate of the educational background
certification tests as so low -- between 3 percent and 5 percent - that it would
be hard for overseas medical students to pass.</P>
      <P>"It may take over 50 years to pass the tests, " a mother whose daughter is
studying medicine in Poland was seen saying on TV.</P>
      <P>Her daughter is among over 200 Taiwanese students who are studying medicine in
Poland. If the law is revised, these students will be affected.</P>
      <P>The issue has triggered discussions in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan over the past
few days, with relevant authorities asked to brief lawmakers on their concerning
policies and opinions.</P>
      <P>During the legislative briefings, DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan stressed that
revising the law to demand graduates of overseas medical colleges pass the three
qualification challenges before they are allowed to practice in Taiwan is the
best way to ensure a high standard of medical care in the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education indicated it will follow the DOH's decision
on the issue.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Coming on the heels of a warning to the public about a potential outbreak of
enterovirus 71 (EV71) that mainly affects young children, the results of a study
released Tuesday show that eating seaweed might help prevent infection.</P>
      <P>The study conducted by Wu Chang-jer, an associate professor at the Department of
Food Science at National Taiwan Ocean University, found that the polysaccharides
in seaweed can protect against EV71 infection, with the best result seen in
those containing chlorella, a species of green freshwater algae.</P>
      <P>The second-best result was seen in polysaccharides from brown algae, followed by
those from red algae and marine green algae, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"While eating the plants directly can be a way to obtain seaweed
polysaccharides, extracts can produce even better results as they contain a
higher concentration of the polysaccharides," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Laboratory experiments have found that an extract amount as little as 10
micrograms is sufficient to produce the protective effect, he said.</P>
      <P>The researchers found that the polysaccharides absorb the virus, inhibiting it
from invading the cells, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>"This means that after the polysaccharides are consumed, they provide protection
in the oral cavity or the intestinal system that can capture the virus," he
explained.</P>
      <P>Enteroviruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can be deadly,
especially in young children. EV71 -- the deadliest type of enterovirus -- is
one of the major causative agents of hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome and is
sometimes associated with severe central nervous system diseases.</P>
      <P>Taiwan experienced a serious outbreak of EV71 in 1998, with 405 severe
infections recorded, 78 of which were fatal.</P>
      <P>So far this year, 13 enterovirus cases have been reported in which severe
complications have developed, one of which has resulted in death. The majority
of the cases were linked to EV71, according to statistics released Tuesday by
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>According  to CDC  Deputy  Director-General  Shih  Wen-yih, drowsiness, muscle
spasms, rapid breathing or heartbeat, as well as increased intracranial pressure
with continued vomiting are the four major signs of severe enterovirus
infection, and any children displaying any of these symptoms should be taken
immediately to hospital.</P>
      <P>The results of a survey conducted recently by the CDC among 1,100 child
caregivers indicate that the public's awareness of enterovirus may still be
insufficient, with 30 percent of respondents saying they would take a sick child
to a clinic rather than a hospital even if they displayed symptoms of severe
enterovirus infection, Shih said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has the world's third-highest density in terms of the number of household
solar-powered water heaters in relation to the size of its territory, the Bureau
of Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to data provided by the Executive Yuan, 433,000 households in Taiwan
have taken advantage of government subsidies to install solar-powered water
heaters, giving the country the world's third-largest installation rate per
kilometer of its territory, behind only Israel and Cyprus.</P>
      <P>To date, 1.78 million square meters of solar energy panels are being used by the
433,000 households, according to the data.</P>
      <P>The bureau estimated that this is reducing Taiwan's carbon dioxide emissions by
about 350,000 tons per year -- equivalent to some 5.3 million 20-kilo cylinders
of liquefied petroleum gas for household use.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials attributed the solar power uptake to the subsidies offered by
central and local governments.</P>
      <P>Although the central government finances 20 percent of the installation fee,
they said, some city and counties also provide additional monetary incentives to
encourage residents to use solar power.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, they went on, the bureau has increased its
subsides to NT$2,250 (US$67) per square meter, up from the previous NT$1,500 per
square meter.</P>
      <P>The officials added that 80 percent of Taiwan's solar-powered water heaters are
installed in central and southern parts of the country due to the sunny weather
in those regions.</P>
      <P>They forecast that by 2012, 570,000 Taiwanese families will have a solar water
heater, with the total amount of solar energy panels increasing to 2.29 million
square meters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipower plans to purchase more coal from China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) is considering purchasing more
coal from China amid the thawing relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, company spokeswoman Tu Yueh-yuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tu said that as a government-operated business, Taipower was heavily restricted
in the amount of coal it could buy from China in the past, when cross-strait
relations were tense.</P>
      <P>The ratio at that time could not account for more than 20 percent of all the
fuel it purchased from overseas, Tu said, noting that the ceiling was raised to
30 percent after the Ma Ying-jeou government took office last May as part of the
administration's efforts to broaden relations with China.</P>
      <P>Most of Taipower's coal comes from Indonesia, accounting for around 60 percent
of the total, and if Taiwan buys more from China, it will result in major
transport cost savings, a Taipower executive told CNA.</P>
      <P>According to a Taipower assessment, Chinese coal is also high quality, so a
decision to increase purchases would make sound economic sense, especially at
this time of economic recession.</P>

      <P>The chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) announced Tuesday that he has named
the magistrate of Taoyuan County, who is also a KMT vice chairman, as the
party's chief delegate to the first cross-Taiwan Strait civic forum, to be held
May 15-22 in the city of Xiamen in China's Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung made the announcement at a regular meeting of the KMT. He said he
chose Eric Lilun Chu to represent the KMT at the forum because in addition to
promoting cross-strait exchanges, Chu, as Taoyuan magistrate, is in a good
position to introduce the county's aerotropolis project to the other
participants and try to attract Chinese investment to the massive plan.</P>
      <P>The project to be built around the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport is one
of the country's major development projects and is expected to attract NT$1
trillion (US$29.6 billion) in foreign investment. It is scheduled for completion
by the end of 2020.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait forum is a platform for exchanges between the private sectors
of the two sides and is in addition to an annual forum between the KMT and the
Communist Party of China. It is sponsored by the Taiwan Affairs Office of
China's State Council and the Fujian provincial government.</P>
      <P>The forum, along with various related activities, will take place in four Fujian
cities -- Xiamen, Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Putian. Participants from all walks of
life will discuss exchanges between the two sides in various areas, including
economy and trade, tourism, culture, education, folk arts, women and youth.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Seeking connecting flight rights from China difficult: air official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>It will be difficult to seek connecting flight rights from China owing to
political considerations and the unequal benefits it would yield to Taiwan and
China, an aviation chief said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee  Lung-wen,  director-general  of the Civil  Aeronautics Administration, said
the issue of connection flight freedom, which is also called the fifth freedom
of the air and refers to the right of carriers to take passengers from their own
country to a second country and from that country to a third country, should be
reserved for future talks with China.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks against the background that Taiwan is set to wrap up an
aviation agreement with China in talks scheduled for April 26 to enhance the
existing cross-strait charter flights with regular flights.</P>
      <P>However, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng urged the government a day earlier to
also seek connecting flight rights from China.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said the issue is politically charged, as the third country served
by the connecting flight would be entitled to use the same route, which would be
inconsistent with the understanding between Taipei and Beijing that the cross-
strait flight routes are not intended to be used by other countries.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Lee went on, Taiwan would gain greater benefit from such an
arrangement than would China, as Taiwanese carriers are eager to fly to many
European cities via China, while Chinese carriers would be able fly to only a
few cities in Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand via Taiwan, none of
which attract heavy passenger loads.</P>
      <P>Therefore, China is reluctant to negotiate with Taiwan on the fifth freedom for
the time being, Lee concluded.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou donated NT$100,000 (US$3,000) Monday to St. Mary's
Hospital in Taitung City after learning of its financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>The hospital,  long dedicated to providing health care to underprivileged people
in southeastern Taiwan,  hopes to raise NT$31.42 million by November and
transform itself into a nonprofit health care provider, which would allow it to
survive.</P>
      <P>The hospital, set up by foreign missionaries 48 years ago, is facing closure
because of heavy operating deficits in recent years, and becoming a nonprofit
entity would enable it to cushion losses with private donations and other public
funding contributions.</P>
      <P>Earlier the same day, Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-chen also donated
NT$50,000 to St. Mary's Hospital and called for greater public attention and
assistance to the establishment.</P>
      <P>The hospital  recently  launched a campaign  to reach its fund-raising target in
which it is soliciting NT$10,000 donations from 3,000 donors to help it survive,
but it remains a long way from its goal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Growth in jobless rate slowing down: CLA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) assured the public Tuesday that the
unemployment rate for March would post only a slight increase from the previous
month as the country's worsening jobless situation has shown signs of
moderation.</P>
      <P>CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan noted that since the global financial storm hit last
September, Taiwan's unemployment rate has been rising by 0.3 percentage points
per month on average, reaching 5.75 percent in February.</P>
      <P>However, the recent influx of rush orders for Taiwan's industrial sector has
helped moderate the situation, Wang said.</P>
      <P>She predicted that the official unemployment rate for March -- set to be
released Wednesday -- "won't exceed 6 percent, though it will be slightly higher
than in February."</P>
      <P>She said the improvement in the unemployment situation is also reflected in the
declining number of first-time applicants for unemployment benefits.</P>
      <P>From December to February, an average over 30,000 people per month applied for
the benefits for the first time after becoming unemployed, but the number
dropped to 28,000 in March, Wang said.</P>
      <P>During the first 20 days of April, there were just 14,000 such applications, she
added.</P>
      <P>Wang warned, however, that the unemployment rate could rise again in August and
September, when many of this year's graduates are expected to enter the job
market.</P>
      <P>The CLA also announced Tuesday the introduction of a program aimed  at providing
psychological  support  for the country's unemployed.</P>
      <P>One main element of the program is free psychological counseling offered  by a
team of more than 70 experts  and therapists. Appointments for the service can
be made through any government-run employment service station or by the workers
themselves by calling (02) 2557-6841.</P>
      <P>In addition,  a regular  radio program  on labor law and psychological issues
will be launched April 28 in cooperation with the Taiwan-based Broadcasting
Corporation of China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, various resources will be made available to the public on the CLA's
Web site and employment service stations around the country.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's largest bicycle manufacturer, Giant Inc., and the country's largest air
carrier, China Airlines (CAL), signed an agreement Monday to jointly promote
bicycle tourism in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement signed by Giant Chairman King Liu and CAL Chairman Wei
Hsing-hsiung,  the two companies will pool their resources to promote Taiwan
globally as a cycling mecca. They will seek to lure more visitors from abroad by
selling bike tours as a way to experience the island's beauty and local people's
hospitality.</P>
      <P>Wei said that CAL, in collaboration with a Taiwan travel agency, launched a
cycling tour of Okinawa in Japan in February which drew an enthusiastic response
from tourists.</P>
      <P>In the future, more cycling travel packages will be offered at CAL and Giant's
domestic and overseas operating centers and outlets, he added.</P>
      <P>Liu said the agreement is also aimed at arranging local and foreign bike tours
for Taiwan residents and boosting public interest in that type of eco-friendly
tourism.</P>
      <P>According to the Giant chairman, Taiwan is well-suited to the development of
bicycle tourism, given that its bicycle production standards are among the
highest in the world and that Giant has vast experience in providing bicycle
rental and maintenance services.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the strategic alliance between the CAL and Giant is expected to
benefit their respective customers and boost Taiwan's tourism industry.</P>
      <P>He also disclosed that Giant has applied to the Ministry of Transportation and
Communication for permission to open a travel agency in June to offer bike tour
packages in Taiwan and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The travel agency is likely to create a business worth hundreds of millions of
New Taiwan dollars, Liu forecast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economics ministry launches energy saving campaign</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
04/21/09  18:02:33
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) launched an energy-saving campaign
Tuesday, on the eve of Earth Day, calling on the public to turn off electric
appliances when they are not in use and thus save an estimated 3.5 billion units
of energy per year.</P>
      <P>Huang Jung-chiou, vice minister of the MOEA, said at a news conference, held
under the theme "Love the Earth, it's our business to switch off," that turning
off electric appliances is the easiest way to start saving energy and that it
requires everyone's participation to save the Earth.</P>
      <P>"A simple action such as switching off electric appliances can help people to
shape a completely different attitude in life," Huang said.</P>
      <P>"Each little effort can add up to make a major difference to the Earth," he
added.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA's Bureau of Energy and the Cabinet-level Directorate-
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, switching off the six most
commonly used home and office appliances -- copy machines, printers, office
water dispensers, drinking fountains, home electric thermos and computers -- can
save 3.5 billion units of energy per year. This is equivalent to the amount of
energy used annually by 950,000 households and can reduce carbon dioxide
emissions by 2.26 million tons per year, he said.</P>
      <P>Most startlingly, Huang added, the statistics show that 85.2 percent of the
country's 6 million office water dispensers are usually left on around the
clock, seven days a week.</P>
      <P>If these machines are switched off after office hours, this could easily save
1.34 billion energy units annually and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by
854,000 tons per year, he said.</P>
      <P>As part of the "switch off campaign," the public should use electric timers with
an automatic on-off switches to conserve energy, the MOEA suggested.</P>
      <P>In response to the government's call, representatives from 28 companies and
industrial groups joined Tuesday's news conference, pledging to take the lead in
switching off electric appliances after office hours and to help raise awareness
among their customers of the importance of saving energy.</P>

      <P>Two crew members of the Panama-registered tanker TOSA have been barred from
leaving Taiwan for the time being to assist prosecutors in the investigation
into the sinking of a Taiwanese fishing boat last Friday, prosecutors said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The TOSA was suspected of having hit the 99-ton Hsing Tong Chuan No.86 fishing
vessel that sank near the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands early last Friday.</P>
      <P>Eleven of the 13 crew members of the sunken ship, based in Suao in the
northeastern county of Yilan, were rescued, but the ship's captain Ho Si-chuan
and chief engineer Hsu Tsung-wen remain missing.</P>
      <P>The 160,000-ton TOSA was escorted to Hualien Harbor by a Taiwanese coast guard
vessel on the eastern Taiwan coast Saturday pending investigation into the
matter.</P>
      <P>Huang Yi-chun, a Hualien chief prosecutor, said that both navigation and track
maps as well as the results of detective police work show that the Panamanian
tanker was passing the disaster site when the fishing boat was sinking.</P>
      <P>During the interrogations, Huang said, neither the tanker's first mate, second
mate nor its night-watch sailor admitted that the tanker had hit the fishing
boat. But they did not deny that the tanker was passing the site as the boat was
sinking, the prosecutor added.</P>
      <P>Huang said if the two Taiwanese crewmen aboard the sunken ship have indeed died,
certain tanker crew members may be indicted on charges of involuntary
manslaughter.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Huang said, the tanker's second mate and night-duty
sailor have been barred from leaving Taiwan pending further investigations into
the cause of the fishing vessel's sinking.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the tanker's owner is willing to pay damages if there is
sufficient evidence to prove that the tanker was liable in the fishing boat's
sinking.</P>
      <P>The Hsing Tong Chuan crew members who were rescued include one Taiwanese
fisherman, two Chinese, six Indonesians and two Filipinos.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 10-month old girl who suffered severe burns after her father threw her in a
pot of boiling water in a case that shocked Taiwan, died Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>Her father, who was arrested following the incident on Saturday, could face the
death penalty, a prosecutor said later.</P>
      <P>Despite intensive efforts by doctors to try to save the girl, who suffered
second and third-degree burns over 84 percent of her body, she died of multiple
organ failure, according to doctors at Changhua Christian Hospital in central
Taiwan's Changhua City.</P>
      <P>With consent of her mother, who did not want her daughter to continue to suffer
the immense pain, the girl was pronounced dead after doctors took her off a
life-support system at 10:05 a.m.</P>
      <P>The baby had been in critical condition since being rushed to the hospital by
her mother after her father, surnamed Huang, did the unimaginable act during an
argument with her mother.</P>
      <P>The infant's mother, identified only by her family name of Lin, immediately
scooped the baby out of the pot in the noodle shop they owned and rushed to a
nearby police station for help, whereupon officers immediately sent the baby to
the hospital's burn center.</P>
      <P>The father, 47, is being held on a homicide charge, and would face either the
death penalty, life imprisonment or a jail term of over 15 years, Chang Hui-
chung, a prosecutor at the Changhua Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>"The punishment will be 50 percent more severe because the victim is a small
child," said Chang.</P>
      <P>The case has ignited anger from people across the country who questioned how
someone could harm a child in such a way. Many people prayed for the girl, with
some religious people maintaining a vigil at the hospital. Nurses were in tears
as they changed the baby's bandages, seeing the pain she was going through.</P>
      <P>The incident has also raised concerns about the increase in violence against
children in Taiwan since the economic downturn began to be widely felt last year
on the island, which is suffering from record unemployment and a sharp decline
in GDP and exports.</P>
      <P>The nonprofit Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (TFCF) said earlier this
month that as the economy has worsened, it has observed a growing rate of
domestic violence against children, triggered primarily by a lack of parenting
skills, unemployment, and poverty.</P>
      <P>As of March, 46 cases of domestic violence involving 73 children, including
eight who died, have been reported this year in the local media. The TFCF urged
parents who are on edge to seek professional help or take some time away from
their children.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the incident, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) on Monday
announced it will expand its databank of high-risk families and increase funding
and manpower to prevent domestic violence from occurring.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Liao Liou-yi said more families considered at risk will be
entered into an MOI databank and be tracked. These are families with young
children where the parents are alcoholic or addicted to drugs or are known to
fight frequently.</P>
      <P>It is reported that the parents of the little girl had a fierce argument after
the woman blasted Huang for being lazy.</P>
      <P>The baby's father has a history of drunkenness and neighbors said the couple,
who are not married but have lived together for 12 years, often argued.</P>
      <P>The couple have another older daughter besides the baby girl. That daughter, a
fifth grader, was placed with a foster family by county social welfare officials
following the incident.</P>
      <P>The baby's mother, on Tuesday, thanked all walks of life for their care,
encouragement and support over the past four days, but some people believe she
also has responsibility because she allegedly taunted the father into carrying
out the act.</P>

      <P>Prosecutors at the Taitung District Court's Public Prosecutors' Office in
southeastern Taiwan arrested one of their own early Tuesday on charges of
bribery.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Justice Huang Shih-ming  confirmed that prosecutor Lin Sheng-
lin was taken into custody for questioning after an internal investigation found
that he had accepted bribes in at least two cases.</P>
      <P>Members of the anti-corruption division at the Taitung Public Prosecutors'
Office and agents from the Investigation Bureau, armed with a search warrant
from the court, raided Lin's residence and arrested him.</P>
      <P>In August last year, Lin was reassigned from the Shihlin Public Prosecutors'

too many criminal cases unhandled, according to the Taitung prosecutors' office.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Bird tracking shows migration routes: researcher</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two of three gray-faced buzzards that were released last year in southern Taiwan
in a satellite tracking project of the birds' migration journey have been
recorded as having arrived in China, a project researcher said Monday.</P>
      <P>One of the birds, named Cape No. 1, which was implanted with satellite tracers
and released Oct. 12 last year in Kenting township, was discovered the next day
to have traveled to the Philippines, where it remained for some time before
moving to the coast of China's Guangdong Province, according to Lin Wun-hong,
secretary-general of the Raptor Research Group of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another released buzzard named Cape No. 2 spent more than five months of the
winter in the Philippines and returned to central Taiwan March 21 after flying
through Pingtung, Kaohsiung, Tainan, and Chiayi counties in southern Taiwan. The
bird was later recorded as having arrived Zhejiang Province in eastern China
March 25, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said the research team had lost contact with the third of the birds, named
Cape No. 3, probably because the bird either died or the satellite tracker was
dislodged.</P>
      <P>The satellite tracking project is being conducted by the Forestry Bureau in
collaboration with Taiwan's top academic institution Academia Sinica and the
non-government Raptor Research Group of Taiwan in attempt to establish the
migration patterns of the buzzards, Lin said, adding that the research team also
released another two -- Cape No. 4 and Cape No. 5 -- in late March in the
central county of Changhua.</P>
      <P>After moving north, the two birds left Taiwan mid-April and are presently in
China's southeastern province of Anhui, having used a migration route similar to
that of Cape No. 2.</P>
      <P>Every October, numerous gray-faced buzzards migrate through the Hengchun
peninsula  in the southern county of Pingtung before continuing their migration
to destinations of which the researchers were previously unaware, although a
Forestry Bureau official said the migration areas of the species are limited to
eastern and southern Asia.</P>
      <P>In summer, the species breeds in eastern Asia,  including northeastern China,
the Korean peninsula, southeastern areas of Russia and Japan.</P>
      <P>In autumn, the birds migrate south to southern China, the Indochina area of
Southeast Asia, the Philippines, Indonesia and New Guinea to spend the winter.</P>
      <P>A few of them also winter on Japan's Ishigaki Island, the official added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Possible end to test exemption for foreign medical school graduates</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
04/21/09  21:21:46
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Department of Health (DOH) is considering rescinding regulations
exempting graduates of overseas medical schools who want to practice in Taiwan
from tough educational background certification tests.</P>
      <P>Under the current regulations, graduates from the United States, Canada, South
Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Singapore, Japan and Hong
Kong are allowed to bypass the tests and directly enter the second stage of
qualification examinations.</P>
      <P>If the DOH's plan goes through, graduates from the nine countries and areas will
have to take the tests, which are the first of three sets of tests that also
include the national physician license examination and practical physician
license examination.</P>
      <P>Only then can they be allowed to practice in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The move was sparked  by recent  public  debate over the controversial
regulation. Critics said the regulation provided a shortcut for Taiwanese
graduates of overseas medical schools which adopt a shorter and looser
curriculum than that of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over past years after Poland joined the EU, more and more Taiwanese students
have gone to that eastern European country to study medicine because the schools
of medicine there adopt a four-year, or six-year curriculum system, shorter than
the system followed in Taiwanese medical schools.</P>
      <P>Students in Taiwan's medical schools must complete a seven-year course of study,
which includes a two-year internship, before qualifying for the national
physician license examination. The physician candidates cannot move any further
toward the position of resident at hospital without passing the test.</P>
      <P>However, some criticized the DOH's acceptance rate of the educational background
certification tests as so low -- between 3 percent and 5 percent - that it would
be hard for overseas medical students to pass.</P>
      <P>"It may take over 50 years to pass the tests, " a mother whose daughter is
studying medicine in Poland was seen saying on TV.</P>
      <P>Her daughter is among over 200 Taiwanese students who are studying medicine in
Poland. If the law is revised, these students will be affected.</P>
      <P>The issue has triggered discussions in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan over the past
few days, with relevant authorities asked to brief lawmakers on their concerning
policies and opinions.</P>
      <P>During the legislative briefings, DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan stressed that
revising the law to demand graduates of overseas medical colleges pass the three
qualification challenges before they are allowed to practice in Taiwan is the
best way to ensure a high standard of medical care in the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education indicated it will follow the DOH's decision
on the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Seaweed polysaccharides can prevent enterovirus 71 infection: study</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
04/21/09  21:28:25

    <TEXT>
      <P>Coming on the heels of a warning to the public about a potential outbreak of
enterovirus 71 (EV71) that mainly affects young children, the results of a study
released Tuesday show that eating seaweed might help prevent infection.</P>
      <P>The study conducted by Wu Chang-jer, an associate professor at the Department of
Food Science at National Taiwan Ocean University, found that the polysaccharides
in seaweed can protect against EV71 infection, with the best result seen in
those containing chlorella, a species of green freshwater algae.</P>
      <P>The second-best result was seen in polysaccharides from brown algae, followed by
those from red algae and marine green algae, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"While eating the plants directly can be a way to obtain seaweed
polysaccharides, extracts can produce even better results as they contain a
higher concentration of the polysaccharides," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Laboratory experiments have found that an extract amount as little as 10
micrograms is sufficient to produce the protective effect, he said.</P>
      <P>The researchers found that the polysaccharides absorb the virus, inhibiting it
from invading the cells, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>"This means that after the polysaccharides are consumed, they provide protection
in the oral cavity or the intestinal system that can capture the virus," he
explained.</P>
      <P>Enteroviruses are the most common cause of aseptic meningitis and can be deadly,
especially in young children. EV71 -- the deadliest type of enterovirus -- is
one of the major causative agents of hand-foot-and-mouth syndrome and is
sometimes associated with severe central nervous system diseases.</P>
      <P>Taiwan experienced a serious outbreak of EV71 in 1998, with 405 severe
infections recorded, 78 of which were fatal.</P>
      <P>So far this year, 13 enterovirus cases have been reported in which severe
complications have developed, one of which has resulted in death. The majority
of the cases were linked to EV71, according to statistics released Tuesday by
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>According  to CDC  Deputy  Director-General  Shih  Wen-yih, drowsiness, muscle
spasms, rapid breathing or heartbeat, as well as increased intracranial pressure
with continued vomiting are the four major signs of severe enterovirus
infection, and any children displaying any of these symptoms should be taken
immediately to hospital.</P>
      <P>The results of a survey conducted recently by the CDC among 1,100 child
caregivers indicate that the public's awareness of enterovirus may still be
insufficient, with 30 percent of respondents saying they would take a sick child
to a clinic rather than a hospital even if they displayed symptoms of severe
enterovirus infection, Shih said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan has 3rd-highest density of solar water heaters</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has the world's third-highest density in terms of the number of household
solar-powered water heaters in relation to the size of its territory, the Bureau
of Energy under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to data provided by the Executive Yuan, 433,000 households in Taiwan
have taken advantage of government subsidies to install solar-powered water
heaters, giving the country the world's third-largest installation rate per
kilometer of its territory, behind only Israel and Cyprus.</P>
      <P>To date, 1.78 million square meters of solar energy panels are being used by the
433,000 households, according to the data.</P>
      <P>The bureau estimated that this is reducing Taiwan's carbon dioxide emissions by
about 350,000 tons per year -- equivalent to some 5.3 million 20-kilo cylinders
of liquefied petroleum gas for household use.</P>
      <P>Bureau officials attributed the solar power uptake to the subsidies offered by
central and local governments.</P>
      <P>Although the central government finances 20 percent of the installation fee,
they said, some city and counties also provide additional monetary incentives to
encourage residents to use solar power.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, they went on, the bureau has increased its
subsides to NT$2,250 (US$67) per square meter, up from the previous NT$1,500 per
square meter.</P>
      <P>The officials added that 80 percent of Taiwan's solar-powered water heaters are
installed in central and southern parts of the country due to the sunny weather
in those regions.</P>
      <P>They forecast that by 2012, 570,000 Taiwanese families will have a solar water
heater, with the total amount of solar energy panels increasing to 2.29 million
square meters.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The state-run Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) is considering purchasing more
coal from China amid the thawing relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, company spokeswoman Tu Yueh-yuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Tu said that as a government-operated business, Taipower was heavily restricted
in the amount of coal it could buy from China in the past, when cross-strait
relations were tense.</P>
      <P>The ratio at that time could not account for more than 20 percent of all the
fuel it purchased from overseas, Tu said, noting that the ceiling was raised to
30 percent after the Ma Ying-jeou government took office last May as part of the
administration's efforts to broaden relations with China.</P>
      <P>Most of Taipower's coal comes from Indonesia, accounting for around 60 percent
of the total, and if Taiwan buys more from China, it will result in major
transport cost savings, a Taipower executive told CNA.</P>
      <P>According to a Taipower assessment, Chinese coal is also high quality, so a
decision to increase purchases would make sound economic sense, especially at
this time of economic recession.</P>

      <P>The chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) announced Tuesday that he has named
the magistrate of Taoyuan County, who is also a KMT vice chairman, as the
party's chief delegate to the first cross-Taiwan Strait civic forum, to be held
May 15-22 in the city of Xiamen in China's Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung made the announcement at a regular meeting of the KMT. He said he
chose Eric Lilun Chu to represent the KMT at the forum because in addition to
promoting cross-strait exchanges, Chu, as Taoyuan magistrate, is in a good
position to introduce the county's aerotropolis project to the other
participants and try to attract Chinese investment to the massive plan.</P>
      <P>The project to be built around the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport is one
of the country's major development projects and is expected to attract NT$1
trillion (US$29.6 billion) in foreign investment. It is scheduled for completion
by the end of 2020.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait forum is a platform for exchanges between the private sectors
of the two sides and is in addition to an annual forum between the KMT and the
Communist Party of China. It is sponsored by the Taiwan Affairs Office of
China's State Council and the Fujian provincial government.</P>
      <P>The forum, along with various related activities, will take place in four Fujian
cities -- Xiamen, Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Putian. Participants from all walks of
life will discuss exchanges between the two sides in various areas, including

    <HEADLINE>Seeking connecting flight rights from China difficult: air official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>It will be difficult to seek connecting flight rights from China owing to
political considerations and the unequal benefits it would yield to Taiwan and
China, an aviation chief said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee  Lung-wen,  director-general  of the Civil  Aeronautics Administration, said
the issue of connection flight freedom, which is also called the fifth freedom
of the air and refers to the right of carriers to take passengers from their own
country to a second country and from that country to a third country, should be
reserved for future talks with China.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks against the background that Taiwan is set to wrap up an
aviation agreement with China in talks scheduled for April 26 to enhance the
existing cross-strait charter flights with regular flights.</P>
      <P>However, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng urged the government a day earlier to
also seek connecting flight rights from China.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said the issue is politically charged, as the third country served
by the connecting flight would be entitled to use the same route, which would be
inconsistent with the understanding between Taipei and Beijing that the cross-
strait flight routes are not intended to be used by other countries.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Lee went on, Taiwan would gain greater benefit from such an
arrangement than would China, as Taiwanese carriers are eager to fly to many
European cities via China, while Chinese carriers would be able fly to only a
few cities in Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand via Taiwan, none of
which attract heavy passenger loads.</P>
      <P>Therefore, China is reluctant to negotiate with Taiwan on the fifth freedom for
the time being, Lee concluded.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's National Central University (NCU) urged university and graduate
students Wednesday to sign up for its summer astronomy camp, aimed at increasing
interest in the field in the International Year of Astronomy (IYA) 2009.</P>
      <P>The summer camp, called Asia-Pacific Youth Astronomy Camp, is part of the
university's efforts to promote astronomy in Taiwan and to provide a platform
for graduate and undergraduate students in the country to interact with other
enthusiasts in the Asia-Pacific region, according to NCU.</P>
      <P>Chou Yi, a professor in the university's Graduate Institute of Astronomy, said
in a press release that IYA 2009 not only marks the 400th anniversary of the
first observation of space through a telescope by Galileo Galilei, but also the
200th anniversary of the birth of evolutionist Charles Darwin.</P>
      <P>"'Evolution' will be the theme of the summer camp, which will introduce the
formation and development of planets, the solar system, galaxies and the
universe,Chou said.</P>
      <P>While we are trying to increase research capabilities in local universities, it
is also our obligation to pass on knowledge to a younger generation,he added.</P>
      <P>According to Chou, similar summer astronomy camps have been held in the past by
NCU, National Taiwan University and National Tsing Hua University, but they were
much smaller in scale.</P>
      <P>Funded by the Cabinet-level  National  Science Council and sponsored by the
Astronomical Society of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the local chapter of
the IYA activity planning panel, the Asia-Pacific Youth Astronomy Camp will have
120 openings for graduates and undergraduates in the Asia Pacific region,
according to NCU.</P>
      <P>Participants  are preferred to have taken general physics, astronomy, or
introduction to astrophysics courses and have good command of English, it added.</P>
      <P>Scheduled to be held in Sitou in central Taiwan July 6-10, the event will invite
noted astronomers from home and abroad to lecture on the latest astronomical
developments.</P>
      <P>Among them will be Dina Prialnik, a planetary scientist and the author ofAn
Introduction to the Theory of Stellar Structure and Evolution, and radio

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese identify Japan as favorite foreign country: survey</HEADLINE>

      <P>Japan is the foreign country enjoying the highest popularity among Taiwanese,
most of whom are fascinated by the country's culture and natural environment,
according to the results  of a survey released  Tuesday by Japan's Interchange
Association.</P>
      <P>The survey found that when asked to name their favorite foreign country, 38
percent of respondents mentioned Japan.</P>
      <P>Coming a distant second was the United States, named by 5 percent of
respondents, followed by Switzerland, named by 3 percent.</P>
      <P>The results showed that although only 2 percent of respondents picked China as
their favorite foreign country, 34 percent said China was the country that
Taiwan should grow closest to.</P>
      <P>Another 31 percent thought Taiwan should move more closely toward Japan, and 20
percent supported moving closer to the United States.</P>
      <P>Sixty-nine percent of respondents said they have a feeling of closeness for
Japan, and 90 percent described Japan as a charming country that people would
want to travel to, with many attracted to Japan's natural landscape, hot
springs, festive culture and cuisine.</P>
      <P>Seventy-nine  percent  of respondents  thought Japan is an economically
powerful  country,  while 44 percent said it is trustworthy. The sense of trust,
according to 65 percent of respondents, derives from the cultural connection
between Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>On current Taiwan-Japan relations, 64 percent of respondents described them as
average, while 29 percent said they are good. Only 7 percent said relations are
poor.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, 55 percent of respondents believed relations between the two
sides will continue to improve, while 7 percent thought they will worsen.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted between Nov. 17 and Dec. 12, 2008 among 1,040 people by
the Nielsen Company for the Interchange Association. It had a margin of error of
3.1 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Seeking connecting flight rights from China difficult: air official</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>It will be difficult to seek connecting flight rights from China owing to
political considerations and the unequal benefits it would yield to Taiwan and
China, an aviation chief said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee  Lung-wen,  director-general  of the Civil  Aeronautics Administration, said
the issue of connection flight freedom, which is also called the fifth freedom
of the air and refers to the right of carriers to take passengers from their own
country to a second country and from that country to a third country, should be
reserved for future talks with China.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks against the background that Taiwan is set to wrap up an
aviation agreement with China in talks scheduled for April 26 to enhance the
existing cross-strait charter flights with regular flights.</P>
      <P>However, Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng urged the government a day earlier to
also seek connecting flight rights from China.</P>
      <P>However, Lee said the issue is politically charged, as the third country served
by the connecting flight would be entitled to use the same route, which would be
inconsistent with the understanding between Taipei and Beijing that the cross-
strait flight routes are not intended to be used by other countries.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Lee went on, Taiwan would gain greater benefit from such an
arrangement than would China, as Taiwanese carriers are eager to fly to many
European cities via China, while Chinese carriers would be able fly to only a
few cities in Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand via Taiwan, none of
which attract heavy passenger loads.</P>
      <P>Therefore, China is reluctant to negotiate with Taiwan on the fifth freedom for
the time being, Lee concluded.</P>

      <P>The chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) announced Tuesday that he has named
the magistrate of Taoyuan County, who is also a KMT vice chairman, as the
party's chief delegate to the first cross-Taiwan Strait civic forum, to be held
May 15-22 in the city of Xiamen in China's Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Wu Poh-hsiung made the announcement at a regular meeting of the KMT. He said he
chose Eric Lilun Chu to represent the KMT at the forum because in addition to
promoting cross-strait exchanges, Chu, as Taoyuan magistrate, is in a good
position to introduce the county's aerotropolis project to the other
participants and try to attract Chinese investment to the massive plan.</P>
      <P>The project to be built around the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport is one
of the country's major development projects and is expected to attract NT$1
trillion (US$29.6 billion) in foreign investment. It is scheduled for completion
by the end of 2020.</P>
      <P>The cross-strait forum is a platform for exchanges between the private sectors
of the two sides and is in addition to an annual forum between the KMT and the
Communist Party of China. It is sponsored by the Taiwan Affairs Office of
China's State Council and the Fujian provincial government.</P>
      <P>The forum, along with various related activities, will take place in four Fujian
cities -- Xiamen, Fuzhou, Quanzhou and Putian. Participants from all walks of
life will discuss exchanges between the two sides in various areas, including
economy and trade, tourism, culture, education, folk arts, women and youth.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An elderly woman in central Taiwan, who together with her husband set up a
charitable recycling operation nearly 10 years ago, has finally gained
recognition for the green life she leads and for helping others do the same.</P>
      <P>Sixty-eight year-old Chang Su-mei from Daya Township in Taichung County was
cited Wednesday by neighbors of her community on World Earth Day as an
environmental protection role model, in recognition of her continued dedication
to protecting the earth and recycling.</P>
      <P>For the better part of the past 10 years, Chang has devoted herself to a
recycling center built on land owned by her husband's family after an earthquake
in September 1999 devastated much of central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chang said she and her husband donated the land after being inspired by the
rebuilding efforts of the Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation in the
aftermath of the temblor, which left nearly 2,400 people dead and some 11,000
injured islandwide.</P>
      <P>Following in the footsteps of Tzu Chi -- which has long operated major recycling
centers in Taiwan -- Chang has managed the recycling center since it was
established. The center sorts, recovers and sells recyclable materials, and
turns over the proceeds to charity.</P>
      <P>It has gradually made a name for itself in the community, as many Daya residents
now send Chang their reusable cans and containers, knowing any benefits will go
to the needy.</P>
      <P>Of all the garbage that Chang has handled, plastic bags are the biggest
headache, she says. She urged consumers to use as few plastic bags as possible
since plastic is not biodegradable, and creates a great burden on the earth and
the environment.</P>
      <P>Chang's recycling center also processes kitchen leftovers, which she layers with
bran to produce organic compost. The compost is then used as a fertilizer on the
land adjacent to the recycling center.</P>
      <P>She said her adult children harvest safe, organic vegetables from her garden
every week and take them home to consume. The children then donate the money
that would have otherwise been spent on groceries to public welfare
organizations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Bureau of Energy urged local households Wednesday to install timers on
their hot water dispensers and hot water bottles to save electricity, one of a
number of suggestions the agency made to conserve energy on World Earth Day.</P>
      <P>By using a timer on water heating devices, local households could still have
access to hot drinking water at any time while saving the country nearly 1.6
billion kilowatt-hours per year, or about 0.8 percent of Taiwan's total
electricity consumption, bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>The estimate was based on the results of a survey conducted by the nonprofit
Industrial Technology Research Institute, which found that 85.2 percent of
Taiwan's households keep their hot water dispensers running 24 hours a day and
81 percent keep their electrical thermal bottles running around the clock.</P>
      <P>The bureau suggested that households equip these devices with automatic timers
to regulate the amount of time they are turned on.</P>
      <P>It estimated that if timers were used across the country, some 1.3 billion kwh
would be saved on the operation of hot water dispensers and nearly 290 million
kwh would be saved on the use of hot water bottles.</P>
      <P>State-run utility Taiwan Power Company generated and bought a total of 200
billion kwh of electricity in 2008.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Energy also urged private offices to turn off their lights and
switch off electrical equipment when not in use, or alternatively install timers
on energy-consuming equipment,  to further conserve energy.</P>

      <P>A 26-year-old Japanese man began a three-month walk around Taiwan Wednesday in
southern Taiwan's Tainan City, in a bid to raise environmental awareness.</P>
      <P>Yuji Miyata attended World Earth Day activities sponsored by the Tainan city
government that day before embarking on his walk.</P>
      <P>He arrived in Tainan a day earlier, having completed walks over the course of a
little over a year in Hong Kong, Beijing, South Korea and Okinawa.</P>
      <P>Miyata, who has a master's degree from a university in South Korea, said he
became concerned about environmental protection issues at the age of 6 after
watching a television report on ozone holes caused by pollutants in the
atmosphere.</P>
      <P>He said he was greatly inspired by Paul Colemen -- earthwalker, tree planter,
environmentalist -- in late 2007 and has become a vegetarian as well as starting
on a global journey to deliver his message on the environment.</P>
      <P>He said he has walked 4,400 km through three nations over the past 14 months.
Without much money in his pocket, he said, he is often provided with shelter and
given food and water by strangers.</P>
      <P>"It's a wonderful feeling camping in the wild for the night after having nothing
but water for two or three days," Miyata said.</P>
      <P>A determined Miyata said even his parents' worry cannot change his decision to
walk around the globe.</P>
      <P>"I'll keep walking around the globe until the Earth takes a turn for the better
environmentally," he vowed.</P>
      <P>After the Taiwan walk, he went on, he will proceed to other Asian countries
before heading for the Middle East and Europe.</P>
      <P>He said he got to know Chang Huang-chen, director of Tainan city's Environmental
Protection Bureau, via a U.S. World Earth Day Web site, prompting him to
organize the Taiwan leg of his walk.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chang said, he will write letters to the local governments of all
the country's cities and counties asking them to provide hospitality to Miyata
and to cheer him along on his quest.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, Coleman, a British citizen, has walked 47,500 km through 39 nations,
planting trees and encouraging people to preserve the natural environment,
delivering the environmental message to all aspects of society, from the jungles
of the Amazon to the highlands of Zimbabwe, and even into war zones.</P>
      <P>In 2000, Coleman began a campaign to plant 100,000,000 trees, one for every man,
woman and child killed in the last century of war. Thanks to the support of
people around the world, he says, at least 11,350,000 trees have been planted so
far.</P>

      <P>The Taitung  District  Court in southeastern Taiwan allowed a public prosecutor
charged with taking bribes to be released on bail of NT$500,000 (US$14,760)
early Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Sheng-lin, a prosecutor at the district court's public prosecutors' office,
was taken into custody a day earlier for questioning after an investigation by
the anti-corruption division of the office and agents from the Investigation
Bureau found that he had accepted bribes in at least two cases.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that there is no need to detain Lin, even though he could face
at least five years in prison if convicted.</P>
      <P>The court also set bail at NT$200,000 for Wu Dong-sheng, a broker who
prosecutors said assisted Lin in taking bribes.</P>
      <P>The court also ruled that both Lin and Wu are not allowed to leave the country.</P>
      <P>According to the Taitung Public Prosecutors' Office, Lin was reassigned from the
Shihlin Public Prosecutors' Office in Taipei to work in Taitung because he left
too many criminal cases unhandled.</P>
      <P>Ethics officers at the Taitung prosecutors' office placed Lin under surveillance
after noting that he continued to allow the accumulation of many cases, and that
he had dismissed quite a few cases that he should have prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Further investigation led to the admission by suspects in two criminal cases
that Lin had offered not to indict them in return for bribes.</P>
      <P>The Taitung prosecutors' office is investigating whether Lin was also involved
in bribery in other criminal cases that he failed to prosecute.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Internet has become an important form of entertainment for Taiwanese
children in addition to watching television, as children's access to the
Internet continues to increase, according to the results of a survey released
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, targeting children between the ages of 7 and 14 and their parents,
was conducted by the Child Welfare League Foundation (CWLF) in cooperation with
the Cartoon Network TV channel.</P>
      <P>It was found that more than 90 percent of the respondent children have frequent
access to the Internet, an increase of more than 31 percent compared with the
results of a similar survey done in 2007.</P>
      <P>Thirty-seven of the child respondents said they go online every day,  making the
Internet  the third-most  popular  source of entertainment after television and
computers, which are used every day by 90 percent and 45 percent  of the young
respondents, respectively.</P>
      <P>Among the respondents in the 13-14 age group, approximately 50 percent said they
use the Internet every day mainly to play online games, download music, receive
or send e-mail, or use instant messaging services.</P>
      <P>In addition, 42 percent of the respondents in the 13-14 age group said they own
a mobile phone, compared with just 5 percent among the 7-8 age group.</P>
      <P>The results also indicate that more than 50 percent of the parent respondents
watch television with their children every day.</P>
      <P>Approximately 60 percent said they allow their children to watch their favorite
TV programs, while nearly 40 percent said they allow them to use the Internet
freely.</P>
      <P>CWLF Executive Director Alicia Wang warned however that the high level of
freedom enjoyed by the respondents in Internet use and choice of TV program
could indicate that parents are simply too busy to pay attention to what their
children are doing -- according to the survey results, 80 percent of the
children polled complained that their parents spend too little time with them,
and 82 percent said they should be taken out more.</P>
      <P>The survey also found a wide gap between parents and children in terms of
expectations of their schoolwork performance.</P>
      <P>While most of the children said they already work very hard, 95 percent of the
parents said their children should work harder and 75 percent expressed concern
that their children are not competitive enough in terms of their academic
performance.</P>
      <P>Although nearly 20 percent of the adult respondents said they have reduced their
children's pocket money because of the economic downturn, more than 85 percent
still send their children to cram schools and will maintain or increase their
investment in their children's education.</P>
      <P>The results also show that more than 70 percent of the children surveyed enjoy
attending school.</P>
      <P>Among those who said they do not like school, 64 percent complained about the
large amount of homework and examinations, 35 percent about boring lessons and
16 percent about being tired.</P>
      <P>Around 20 percent of the respondents said they had been feeling unhappy lately,
either because they had been scolded by their parents, had experienced heavy
pressure from schoolwork or were not getting along well with their classmates.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, approximately half of the children polled said they experience peer
pressure and feel unhappy if their parents do not buy them the things that their
friends have.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted via street interviews between Feb. 24 and March 23
among 1,001 children and 1,001 parents in the Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung
areas. It had a margin of error of 3.16 percent.</P>

      <P>Chiayi Magistrate Chen Ming-wen led a brigade of around 500 people in a cleanup
of a section of the southern county's beaches Wednesday to mark World Earth Day.</P>
      <P>Chen and a number of other people, including Chiayi-based Legislator Chang Hua-
kuan and volunteers from the Dalin branch of the Buddhist Tzu Chi General
Hospital, cleaned the beaches along the wetlands in the county's Dongshi
township and formed a human chain to shift around 60 tons of garbage to a pickup
location for disposal or recycling.</P>
      <P>The garbage included almost everything  from driftwood and discarded oyster-
farming equipment to EPS foam containers, PE bottles and aluminum beer cans.</P>
      <P>Other people who pitched in to clean up the beaches included members of a
Chiayi-based air force jet fighter group, officials from the Chiayi section of
the Coast Guard Administration, Chiayi-based Taiwan Sugar Corp. employees,
officials from the Chiayi county government and conscripts serving their
alternative national service in the southern county.</P>

      <P>The volume of cross-Taiwan Strait containers handled by the port of Kaohsiung
has increased by 4.6 times since the launch of direct shipping links between
Taiwan and China last December, according to statistics released Wednesday by
the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that while there were just 38 cross-strait voyages that
included a stop at Kaohsiung in December 2008, the number more than tripled to
118 in March.</P>
      <P>The volume of cross-strait containers handled by the port, which stood at 16,000
twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in December, soared to 74,000 TEUs in March,
the statistics indicated.</P>
      <P>Harbor Master Tsai Ting-yi noted that the direct cross-strait shipping links
inaugurated on Dec. 15 has helped businesses cut transportation costs by 15
percent to 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Ships previously had to take long detours through waters near Japan or Hong Kong
because direct routes were banned.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  exports  to  China  are  mainly  machinery  and capital-intensive
goods, while imports from China are mostly raw commodities and textiles, Tsai
said.</P>

      <P>Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Minister Stephen Shen presided
over a ceremony Wednesday in which groups and individuals from around the
country were awarded for their efforts to protect the environment.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the World Earth Day ceremony at National Taiwan University Hospital,
Shen urged the public to change their lifestyles by using green energy and
consuming green products to save the earth for future generations.</P>
      <P>One river protection team from southern Taiwan's Tainan County was among the
groups highly recognized at the award ceremony for their efforts.</P>
      <P>The team helped clean up the county's Er Jen Stream -- once Taiwan's most
polluted river -- and now patrols the river regularly to monitor whether there
is waste water being discharged from factories along the riverbanks.</P>
      <P>World Earth Day was marked worldwide in various other ways that day, with Taipei
Mayor Hau Lung-bin traveling to work by bicycle.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by more than 10 city government officials, Hau used a bike he rented
from the city's U-bike service center after getting off the metro from his home
in Shihlin district.</P>
      <P>He encouraged the public to use more public transport as a way to help the
campaign to make the globe greener and cleaner.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa also led a group of county officials
and environmental protection activists on a bike ride to work in the offshore
county, in a gesture to remind the public of the seriousness of global warming.
He urged Penghu residents to walk more or use car-pooling.</P>
      <P>Shops in downtown Makung City, Penghu's capital, turned off their lights for one
hour later in the day in response to the government's energy-saving campaign,
while in central Taiwan's Nantou County, public agencies and schools also
switched off their lights for one hour at noon in line with the government's
drive to make Taiwan into a low-carbon society.</P>
      <P>During a keynote speech given at Tatung University in Taipei later that day,
former EPA Minister Winston Dang said Taiwanese products might be banned by
other highly environmentally conscious countries if it fails to slash its
emissions of greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's population accounts for only 0.3 percent of the world's total but
produces nearly 1 percent of the globe's carbon dioxide, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's citizens must realize that they are entitled to demand that the
government pay full heed to Taiwan's natural environment every day instead of
just during a "one-day" activity, he said.</P>
      <P>The former EPA chief, however, hailed Taiwan's outstanding performance in
recycling.</P>
      <P>Around 50,000 Taiwanese people recycle every day -- some 30,000 scavengers and
about 20,000 private individuals -- creating an annual production value of more
than NT$100 billion (US$3 billion).</P>
      <P>As many as 4.5 billion PET bottles can be recycled in Taiwan per year, which
helps save the energy equivalent to a month's worth of electricity for 40,000
households.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA regrets Taiwan's barring from digital library inauguration</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) expressed regret Wednesday over a
Taiwanese representative being prevented from entering the venue of a ceremony
to mark the inauguration of the World Digital Library (WDL) , an international
cooperation project that involves Taiwan's participation.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen expressed the regret in response to media inquiries
over the absence of Karl Min Ku, director-general of the National Central
Library of Taiwan, at the event that took place a day earlier at United Nations
Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) headquarters in Paris.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ministry will instruct its representative office in France to
lodge a protest at UNESCO and to seek fair treatment for Taiwan in non-political
international activities.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ministry found out that Ku was blocked from entering UNESCO
headquarters because of his Republic of China passport, which he said was
probably because Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>He said the official MOFA view is that the UNESCO move of not allowing an ROC
passport-holder to enter its building was "not only unreasonable but also
unfair, " as well as violating international practice, because the passport is
recognized by most nations around the world as a valid travel document.</P>
      <P>He further said the ministry deeply regrets that Taiwanese citizens  are
discriminated  against  even  in  non-political international activities.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will continue to make Taiwan's stance known to the U.N. through the
various channels at its disposal, seeking respect for the people of Taiwan and
protection of their rights to participate in international activities, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's national library is one of 32 libraries in 19 countries that are
participating in the WDL project, which was formed based on the idea of a joint
establishment for the sharing of resources that was first put forward by U.S.
Librarian of Congress James H. Billington in 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Issue of extradition must be in upcoming cross-strait talks: DPP</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The issue of extradition of major economic criminals must be included on the
agenda of the third round of negotiations between Taiwan and China, and if it is
not, talks between the two sides about cooperating in combating crime will be
"meaningless, " a spokesman for the opposition Democratic Progressive Party said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>There are 85 Taiwanese fugitives who are wanted in connection with major
economic crimes currently living in China, including former Tuntex Group
Chairman Chen You-hao, who was listed in 2003 as one of Taiwan's 10 most wanted
criminals after he fled the country leaving behind over NT$60 billion in unpaid
bank debts.</P>
      <P>The DPP has for long wanted the criminals' repatriation back to Taiwan to face
prosecution or stand trial.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP Department of Culture and
Information, reiterated the party's stance on the issue, saying if China is
sincere about forming a joint frontline to combat crime with Taiwan, it should
repatriate major Taiwanese fugitives as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks as he released the results of a telephone survey
conducted by the DPP from April 20-21 on a planned joint cross-strait crime
fighting agreement.</P>
      <P>In the survey, 88.4 percent of the respondents said the issue of extradition of
major economic criminals should be included in a proposed cross-strait agreement
on crime control.</P>
      <P>The agreement on crime fighting is expected to be signed by Chiang Pin-kung,
chairman of Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, and his Chinese
counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, when they meet on April 25-26 in Nanjing,
China.</P>
      <P>Only 4.4 percent of the respondents in the poll, who were drawn from people over
age 19, expressed opposition to the extradition idea.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council and Straits Exchange Foundation have not clearly
stated whether the issue of extradition of major criminals will be included in
the upcoming talks or any crime fighting agreement that will be signed.</P>
      <P>The poll also gauged the level of public satisfaction with the performance of
President Ma Ying-jeou, who will have served as president for one year on May
20.</P>
      <P>In terms of President Ma's performance, 34.7 percent of the survey's respondents
gave him a positive rating, while 57.1 percent gave him a thumbs down.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,062 valid samples were collected in the poll, which had a margin of
error of plus or minus 3.06 percent.</P>
      <P>Since the institutionalized talks between Taiwan and China resumed last June,
the issue of joint crime-fighting efforts has been high on the Taiwan
government's agenda, as mainland China is known to be the main haven for
criminals fleeing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However,  the two sides have not yet formalized any such arrangement.  What
exists at the moment is a non-governmental agreement that was signed in the
Taiwan-controlled island of Kinmen in 1992 by the Red Cross societies of the two
sides to facilitate repatriation of stowaways and some relatively lesser-known
criminals across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based Spanish Chamber of Commerce (CCE) held a tourism fair
Wednesday, inviting 200 local travel agents to explore the diversity of Spain's
tourism with the aim of increasing the number of visitors from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CCE Director-General Jose Luis Lamas said at a news conference that the fair was
designed not only to promote Spain as a tourist destination for Taiwanese people
but also to increase their awareness and knowledge of the country.</P>
      <P>Ignacio Ducasse, director of the Spanish Tourism Office in Tokyo -- which covers
Spain's tourism business in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea -- said that while 90
percent of Spain's tourists come from Europe, the country wants to increase the
presence of people from more distant countries.</P>
      <P>"We believe that in Taiwan we have strong potential  for attracting visitors to
Spain. For that reason, Taiwan is a very important market for us," Ducasse told
CNA.</P>
      <P>He noted that compared with other Asian countries, Taiwan has one of the highest
numbers of travelers to Spain, with an average of 30,000 per year, a number that
has been growing steadily over the past decade.</P>
      <P>While Taiwanese people are familiar with Spain for its art, sports, fashion and
food, Ducasse said, Spain has much more to offer as it is a very diverse and
rich country.</P>
      <P>Maria Luisa Fernandez, deputy director of new markets for Spain's Institute of
Tourism, said at the news conference that Spain is unique because it is a
"green, sunny and modern tourist destination."</P>
      <P>The country also has a rich cultural legacy with some 40 historic sites and 13
cities declared as UNESCO world heritage sites, she added.</P>
      <P>The tourism fair provided local travel agents with the latest tourist
information and will help them organize various kinds of tourist itineraries for
their Taiwanese customers, Fernandez added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2-year-old girl dies after being severely beaten by father</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 2-year-old girl has died after being severely beaten by her father with a
broom, according to prosecutors in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County, who have
detained the father.</P>
      <P>The case is the second in less than a week involving deaths of children from
domestic violence.</P>
      <P>The 2-year-old girl's father beat her on Tuesday for playing with water in the
bathroom while he was trying to take a nap during a break from work, and then
tied her to a bed before going back to work, according to police.</P>
      <P>The girl's mother who was taking a nap at the time told police she did not think
much of the beating and continued sleeping. When she awoke, she untied the girl,
but after doing house chores, noticed the child had fallen unconscious. She
rushed the girl to a hospital, but doctors could not save her. The child died
Tuesday evening. Doctors discovered that the girl's arms, legs and buttocks were
covered with bruises.</P>
      <P>The father, 40, was in tears when he saw his unconscious daughter at the
hospital. He expressed regret and said he really loved his daughter, but that
she was naughty and he was just trying to discipline her.  He is being held on a
charge of assault causing death.</P>
      <P>Chung Chu-sheng,  a prosecutor  of the Kaohsiung  District Prosecutor's Office,
said the crime is severe and that the lightest punishment the father could face
is seven years imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The case was widely reported in Taiwan's media Wednesday, with some TV stations
showing a broom which had broken into several pieces. Local media reports said
the father's beating caused the broom to break.</P>
      <P>The girl's exact cause of death remains under investigation.</P>
      <P>The incident is the second this month involving child abuse leading to death. On
Saturday, a father in central Taiwan's Changhua City threw his 10-month-old
daughter into a pot of boiling water, causing her to die from severe burns.</P>
      <P>The two cases have ignited public concerns about the rising incidences of child
abuse in Taiwan, with child welfare groups urging parents not to take out their
anger on children and the Ministry of the Interior pledging to devote more
funding and resources to identifying at-risk families to prevent further
violence against children.</P>

      <P>The monthly nominal salary for office workers in Taiwan during the January-
February  period averaged NT$55,131 (US$1,630), marking a record drop of 12.13
percent year on year, a government agency said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It was the largest  ever decrease  since  1980 when  the Cabinet-level
Directorate  General of Budget,  Accounting  and Statistics  (DGBAS)  started
compiling  such data,  said Hung Chien-chung, a DGBAS official.</P>
      <P>Per capita actual income also fell 12.18 percent during the same period compared
to a year ago, which was also a record plunge since 1980, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He attributed the decrease mainly to a noticeable shrinkage in year-end bonuses
last year as a result of the global financial crisis which broke in September
2008.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a survey found that 53 percent of Taiwan's white-collar
workers are now required to work longer every day, while 28 percent of blue-
collar workers have shorter work hours.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the survey released Wednesday, around 60 percent of
the respondents said their wealth has contracted and their economic burdens have
increased. Only 5 percent said they felt no financial pressure, compared to the
52 percent who said they were under heavy financial strain.</P>
      <P>Some 64 percent said they are not satisfied with their current living standards,
compared to six months ago, the poll showed.</P>
      <P>In terms of outlook, 16 percent said that they did not think their living
standards would recover in three years, and 7 percent felt that it never would.</P>
      <P>The poll, commissioned by Business Today Magazine, was conducted April 2-7, and
collected 1,640 valid questionnaires from office workers aged 25-44. It had a
margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in another survey conducted by Yes123, an online head hunting
network, 70 percent of the respondents said they were concerned about losing
their jobs and that they only had enough money to get though 6.6 months.</P>
      <P>Nearly 50 percent of jobless workers said they spent two hours every day playing
video games to kill time, while 40 percent admitted to watching pornographic
movies at least once every five days, the Yes123  survey  showed.  Close to 10
percent  said they take anti-depressants to try to relax.</P>
      <P>Some 20 percent of the unemployed workers who responded to the poll said that
they would have no chance of finding a new job if they remain out of work for
more than two years, while 30 percent said they will seek assistance from
fortune tellers, and 36 percent plan to visit to temples to ask for divine
intervention. Another 10 percent said they will seek help from doctors or
professional counselors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two major social welfare groups urged the government Wednesday to push for a law
revision that would require grassroots community leaders to report child abuse
cases to the relevant government agencies and thus better protect children's
well-being.</P>
      <P>The Child Welfare League Foundation (CWLF) and the Taipei Women's Rescue
Foundation (TWRF) made the appeal after two heart-wrenching cases of child abuse
were reported in the past few days.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, a 2-year-old girl in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County was beaten
to death by her father, and a day earlier, a 10-month-old baby girl died in a
hospital in central Taiwan's Changhua County after she was dumped into a pot of
boiling water over the weekend.</P>
      <P>CWLF Chief Executive Wang Yu-min said neither of the two families were included
in the Ministry of the Interior's at-risk families databank, which indicates
that there are holes in Taiwan's current community security networks.</P>
      <P>Wang said grassroots community leaders, such as borough and neighborhood chiefs,
better known locally as lichang and linchang in Chinese, have not been included
on the list of personnel who are obligated to report child abuse cases to the
relevant public agencies.</P>
      <P>Under the current Children's Welfare Law, medical professionals, social workers,
education personnel, caregivers, police, judicial personnel and other
professionals who deal with child and juvenile welfare services are mandated to
report cases of child abuse to the relevant city and county government
departments.</P>
      <P>"Regretfully, this stipulation is not comprehensive and effective enough to
expose child abuse cases in time," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the foundation has recorded a total of 141 cases of child abuse
since 2005, Wang said the gravity of those cases and the death rate have
escalated.</P>
      <P>The two latest cases also signaled a decline in the family's function of
protecting the safety of children, Wang said. An analysis of major cases of
child abuse indicated that 67 percent of them were related to martial problems
in the home that had spilled over to the children, she added.</P>
      <P>The situation becomes even worse if the parents are alcoholics or drug addicts,
Wang said.</P>
      <P>TRWF head Liao Ying-chih shared Wang's views, saying that the grassroots
community information system should be reinforced to better protect young
children from maltreatment.</P>
      <P>If necessary, Liao said, residential apartment building managers or guards may
also be mandated to report cases of child abuse.</P>
      <P>As many of the parents who are most likely to maltreat or abuse their children
tend to be drug addicts or alcoholics, the Ministry of the Interior and the
Department of Health should collaborate more closely to prevent child abuse,
Liao suggested.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on the United States Wednesday to sell more arms
to Taiwan, saying that such a request is justified and the arms sales will help
Taiwan to maintain a military balance against China.</P>
      <P>"The delicate balance of the status quo is being shaken by the gross military
imbalances across the (Taiwan) Strait. Therefore, I urge the United States to
not hesitate to provide Taiwan with the necessary defensive arms as stipulated
in the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) , " Ma said via teleconferencing from Taiwan
in a forum on the TRA.</P>
      <P>Ma's comment in the forum, titled "U.S.-Taiwan Relations in a New Era: Looking
Forward 30 Years After the Taiwan Relations Act, " was his first major public
statement to U.S. political and academic sectors since he took office last May.</P>
      <P>He promised that Taiwan will not "free-ride" on the U.S. for its own security,
as it has taken several steps to show its intention to build its military
strength.</P>
      <P>Those steps, he explained, included publishing a quadrennial defense review last
month, making plans to create an all volunteer force to enhance the
professionalism of the military and increasing the defense budget to at least
three percent of the country's GDP.</P>
      <P>During a Q&amp;A session, Ma urged the U.S. to approve Taiwan's requests to
acquire submarines and high performance jet fighters such as the F-16 C/D
because they are for defensive purposes.</P>
      <P>"In view of the sharp changes in the military balance across the Taiwan Strait,
I think it is fully justified for the U.S. to seriously consider selling them
(to Taiwan),"the president said.</P>
      <P>Given the warming cross-strait ties, he said, Washington should not be worried
that such arms sales would jeopardize its relations with China.</P>
      <P>"Even China understands very well that at the moment we want to improve
relations with the mainland. But we also, as a government, have to maintain a
military balance across the Taiwan Strait, " he said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has long been Taiwan's major weapons supplier, despite the fact that
this has been an irritant in U.S.-China relations.</P>
      <P>In the latest arms deal between Taiwan and the U.S., the administration of
former President George W. Bush approved in October 2008 the sale of a weapons
package that includes 30 Apache attack helicopters, 330 advanced capability
Patriot missiles, 32 Harpoon sub-launched missiles, 182 Javelin guided missiles,
and four E-2T system upgrades.</P>
      <P>Asked about confidence building measures with China, Ma said it is a rather
"difficult and sensitive" issue at the moment, and that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait should focus only on economic issues because they are more urgent and
more closely related to the livelihood of the people on both sides.</P>
      <P>As to bilateral relations between Taiwan and the U.S., Ma said in the future the
focus will be less on politics and more on pragmatism.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will work closely with the U.S. on issues such as opening Taiwan's market
to U.S. agricultural products, promoting e-commerce, exploring ways to reform
Taiwan's investment  environment  and improving the protection of intellectual
property rights,  he explained.</P>
      <P>On top of that, Taiwan would also like to conclude an extradition agreement with
the U.S., to participate in America's visa-waiver program and to sign a free
trade agreement with the U.S., the president said.</P>
      <P>The forum, hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) , also included panelists such as noted China affairs experts
Bonnie Glaser, Douglas Paal, Alan Romberg, Randy Schriver and Kerry Dumbaugh.</P>

nostalgic lyrics.</P>
      <P>The exhibit followed the release of a CD last weekend by the Taipei's
Department  of Cultural  Affairs featuring  digitally remastered original
recordings of popular Taiwanese songs from the 1930s.</P>
      <P>Nine of the 23 tracks on the CD were written by Lee, who was born in 1909 in
Taipei while Taiwan was under Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>The songs, including Spring Breeze, Fixing Broken Fishing Nets and Four Seasons,
were written before Japan launched its "Kominka Movement" (Japanization
Movement) in Taiwan in the early 1940s.</P>
      <P>Lee, along with many other Taiwanese musicians, such as composer Teng Yu-hsien
and lyricists Chen Chun-yu and Chen Ta-ju, created songs that reflected the
daily lives of ordinary Taiwanese people in that era.</P>
      <P>"One major motivation behind the creation of those songs was the concern that
Taiwanese culture and the originality of Taiwanese music would disappear, as
most people were listening to popular Japanese songs during that period, " said
Chuang Yung-ming, a noted Taiwanese cultural history expert.</P>
      <P>According to Chuang, the attempt to develop "Taiwan's own popular music" was
successful, as many people today consider the 1930s the first golden age of
Taiwanese popular music.</P>
      <P>However, only about 200 of the 500-plus songs created during that period have
survived.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an April 18 news conference to introduce the new CD, Lee Yong-ping,
director of the Taipei City Department of Cultural Affairs, said it was a tough
task to find the original recordings and to digitize the music for release on
CD.</P>
      <P>For one thing, she recalled,  many record collectors were reluctant to loan the
more than half-a-century-old records that still had good sound quality.</P>
      <P>It was also no easy task to get the copyright issues straightened out as most of
the musicians have passed away, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Japanese man begins round-Taiwan walk</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A 26-year-old Japanese man began a three-month walk around Taiwan Wednesday in
southern Taiwan's Tainan City, in a bid to raise environmental awareness.</P>
      <P>Yuji Miyata attended World Earth Day activities sponsored by the Tainan city
government that day before embarking on his walk.</P>
      <P>He arrived in Tainan a day earlier, having completed walks over the course of a
little over a year in Hong Kong, Beijing, South Korea and Okinawa.</P>
      <P>Miyata, who has a master's degree from a university in South Korea, said he
became concerned about environmental protection issues at the age of 6 after
watching a television report on ozone holes caused by pollutants in the
atmosphere.</P>
      <P>He said he was greatly inspired by Paul Colemen -- earthwalker, tree planter,
environmentalist -- in late 2007 and has become a vegetarian as well as starting
on a global journey to deliver his message on the environment.</P>
      <P>He said he has walked 4,400 km through three nations over the past 14 months.
Without much money in his pocket, he said, he is often provided with shelter and
given food and water by strangers.</P>
      <P>"It's a wonderful feeling camping in the wild for the night after having nothing
but water for two or three days," Miyata said.</P>
      <P>A determined Miyata said even his parents' worry cannot change his decision to
walk around the globe.</P>
      <P>"I'll keep walking around the globe until the Earth takes a turn for the better
environmentally," he vowed.</P>
      <P>After the Taiwan walk, he went on, he will proceed to other Asian countries
before heading for the Middle East and Europe.</P>
      <P>He said he got to know Chang Huang-chen, director of Tainan city's Environmental
Protection Bureau, via a U.S. World Earth Day Web site, prompting him to
organize the Taiwan leg of his walk.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chang said, he will write letters to the local governments of all
the country's cities and counties asking them to provide hospitality to Miyata
and to cheer him along on his quest.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, Coleman, a British citizen, has walked 47,500 km through 39 nations,
planting trees and encouraging people to preserve the natural environment,
delivering the environmental message to all aspects of society, from the jungles
of the Amazon to the highlands of Zimbabwe, and even into war zones.</P>
      <P>In 2000, Coleman began a campaign to plant 100,000,000 trees, one for every man,
woman and child killed in the last century of war. Thanks to the support of
people around the world, he says, at least 11,350,000 trees have been planted so
far.</P>

      <P>The Taitung  District  Court in southeastern Taiwan allowed a public prosecutor
charged with taking bribes to be released on bail of NT$500,000 (US$14,760)
early Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Sheng-lin, a prosecutor at the district court's public prosecutors' office,
was taken into custody a day earlier for questioning after an investigation by
the anti-corruption division of the office and agents from the Investigation
Bureau found that he had accepted bribes in at least two cases.</P>
      <P>The court ruled that there is no need to detain Lin, even though he could face
at least five years in prison if convicted.</P>
      <P>The court also set bail at NT$200,000 for Wu Dong-sheng, a broker who
prosecutors said assisted Lin in taking bribes.</P>
      <P>The court also ruled that both Lin and Wu are not allowed to leave the country.</P>
      <P>According to the Taitung Public Prosecutors' Office, Lin was reassigned from the
Shihlin Public Prosecutors' Office in Taipei to work in Taitung because he left
too many criminal cases unhandled.</P>
      <P>Ethics officers at the Taitung prosecutors' office placed Lin under surveillance
after noting that he continued to allow the accumulation of many cases, and that
he had dismissed quite a few cases that he should have prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Further investigation led to the admission by suspects in two criminal cases
that Lin had offered not to indict them in return for bribes.</P>
      <P>The Taitung prosecutors' office is investigating whether Lin was also involved
in bribery in other criminal cases that he failed to prosecute.</P>

      <P>The Internet has become an important form of entertainment for Taiwanese
children in addition to watching television, as children's access to the
Internet continues to increase, according to the results of a survey released
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey, targeting children between the ages of 7 and 14 and their parents,
was conducted by the Child Welfare League Foundation (CWLF) in cooperation with
the Cartoon Network TV channel.</P>
      <P>It was found that more than 90 percent of the respondent children have frequent
access to the Internet, an increase of more than 31 percent compared with the
results of a similar survey done in 2007.</P>
      <P>Thirty-seven of the child respondents said they go online every day,  making the
Internet  the third-most  popular  source of entertainment after television and
computers, which are used every day by 90 percent and 45 percent  of the young
respondents, respectively.</P>
      <P>Among the respondents in the 13-14 age group, approximately 50 percent said they
use the Internet every day mainly to play online games, download music, receive
or send e-mail, or use instant messaging services.</P>
      <P>In addition, 42 percent of the respondents in the 13-14 age group said they own
a mobile phone, compared with just 5 percent among the 7-8 age group.</P>
      <P>The results also indicate that more than 50 percent of the parent respondents
watch television with their children every day.</P>
      <P>Approximately 60 percent said they allow their children to watch their favorite
TV programs, while nearly 40 percent said they allow them to use the Internet
freely.</P>
      <P>CWLF Executive Director Alicia Wang warned however that the high level of
freedom enjoyed by the respondents in Internet use and choice of TV program
could indicate that parents are simply too busy to pay attention to what their
children are doing -- according to the survey results, 80 percent of the
children polled complained that their parents spend too little time with them,
and 82 percent said they should be taken out more.</P>
      <P>The survey also found a wide gap between parents and children in terms of
expectations of their schoolwork performance.</P>
      <P>While most of the children said they already work very hard, 95 percent of the
parents said their children should work harder and 75 percent expressed concern
that their children are not competitive enough in terms of their academic
performance.</P>
      <P>Although nearly 20 percent of the adult respondents said they have reduced their
children's pocket money because of the economic downturn, more than 85 percent
still send their children to cram schools and will maintain or increase their
investment in their children's education.</P>
      <P>The results also show that more than 70 percent of the children surveyed enjoy
attending school.</P>
      <P>Among those who said they do not like school, 64 percent complained about the
large amount of homework and examinations, 35 percent about boring lessons and
16 percent about being tired.</P>
      <P>Around 20 percent of the respondents said they had been feeling unhappy lately,
either because they had been scolded by their parents, had experienced heavy
pressure from schoolwork or were not getting along well with their classmates.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, approximately half of the children polled said they experience peer
pressure and feel unhappy if their parents do not buy them the things that their
friends have.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted via street interviews between Feb. 24 and March 23
among 1,001 children and 1,001 parents in the Taipei, Taichung and Kaohsiung
areas. It had a margin of error of 3.16 percent.</P>

      <P>The volume of cross-Taiwan Strait containers handled by the port of Kaohsiung
has increased by 4.6 times since the launch of direct shipping links between
Taiwan and China last December, according to statistics released Wednesday by
the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau.</P>
      <P>The statistics showed that while there were just 38 cross-strait voyages that
included a stop at Kaohsiung in December 2008, the number more than tripled to
118 in March.</P>
      <P>The volume of cross-strait containers handled by the port, which stood at 16,000
twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in December, soared to 74,000 TEUs in March,

      <P>Harbor Master Tsai Ting-yi noted that the direct cross-strait shipping links
inaugurated on Dec. 15 has helped businesses cut transportation costs by 15

      <P>Ships previously had to take long detours through waters near Japan or Hong Kong

      <P>Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Minister Stephen Shen presided
over a ceremony Wednesday in which groups and individuals from around the
country were awarded for their efforts to protect the environment.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the World Earth Day ceremony at National Taiwan University Hospital,
Shen urged the public to change their lifestyles by using green energy and
consuming green products to save the earth for future generations.</P>
      <P>One river protection team from southern Taiwan's Tainan County was among the
groups highly recognized at the award ceremony for their efforts.</P>
      <P>The team helped clean up the county's Er Jen Stream -- once Taiwan's most
polluted river -- and now patrols the river regularly to monitor whether there
is waste water being discharged from factories along the riverbanks.</P>
      <P>World Earth Day was marked worldwide in various other ways that day, with Taipei
Mayor Hau Lung-bin traveling to work by bicycle.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by more than 10 city government officials, Hau used a bike he rented
from the city's U-bike service center after getting off the metro from his home
in Shihlin district.</P>
      <P>He encouraged the public to use more public transport as a way to help the
campaign to make the globe greener and cleaner.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Penghu Magistrate Wang Chien-fa also led a group of county officials
and environmental protection activists on a bike ride to work in the offshore
county, in a gesture to remind the public of the seriousness of global warming.
He urged Penghu residents to walk more or use car-pooling.</P>
      <P>Shops in downtown Makung City, Penghu's capital, turned off their lights for one
hour later in the day in response to the government's energy-saving campaign,
while in central Taiwan's Nantou County, public agencies and schools also
switched off their lights for one hour at noon in line with the government's
drive to make Taiwan into a low-carbon society.</P>
      <P>During a keynote speech given at Tatung University in Taipei later that day,
former EPA Minister Winston Dang said Taiwanese products might be banned by
other highly environmentally conscious countries if it fails to slash its
emissions of greenhouse gases.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's population accounts for only 0.3 percent of the world's total but
produces nearly 1 percent of the globe's carbon dioxide, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's citizens must realize that they are entitled to demand that the
government pay full heed to Taiwan's natural environment every day instead of
just during a "one-day" activity, he said.</P>
      <P>The former EPA chief, however, hailed Taiwan's outstanding performance in
recycling.</P>
      <P>Around 50,000 Taiwanese people recycle every day -- some 30,000 scavengers and
about 20,000 private individuals -- creating an annual production value of more
than NT$100 billion (US$3 billion).</P>
      <P>As many as 4.5 billion PET bottles can be recycled in Taiwan per year, which
helps save the energy equivalent to a month's worth of electricity for 40,000
households.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) expressed regret Wednesday over a
Taiwanese representative being prevented from entering the venue of a ceremony
to mark the inauguration of the World Digital Library (WDL) , an international
cooperation project that involves Taiwan's participation.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Henry Chen expressed the regret in response to media inquiries
over the absence of Karl Min Ku, director-general of the National Central
Library of Taiwan, at the event that took place a day earlier at United Nations
Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) headquarters in Paris.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ministry will instruct its representative office in France to
lodge a protest at UNESCO and to seek fair treatment for Taiwan in non-political
international activities.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ministry found out that Ku was blocked from entering UNESCO
headquarters because of his Republic of China passport, which he said was
probably because Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>He said the official MOFA view is that the UNESCO move of not allowing an ROC
passport-holder to enter its building was "not only unreasonable but also
unfair, " as well as violating international practice, because the passport is
recognized by most nations around the world as a valid travel document.</P>
      <P>He further said the ministry deeply regrets that Taiwanese citizens  are
discriminated  against  even  in  non-political international activities.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will continue to make Taiwan's stance known to the U.N. through the
various channels at its disposal, seeking respect for the people of Taiwan and
protection of their rights to participate in international activities, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's national library is one of 32 libraries in 19 countries that are
participating in the WDL project, which was formed based on the idea of a joint
establishment for the sharing of resources that was first put forward by U.S.
Librarian of Congress James H. Billington in 2005.</P>

      <P>The issue of extradition of major economic criminals must be included on the
agenda of the third round of negotiations between Taiwan and China, and if it is
not, talks between the two sides about cooperating in combating crime will be
"meaningless, " a spokesman for the opposition Democratic Progressive Party said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>There are 85 Taiwanese fugitives who are wanted in connection with major
economic crimes currently living in China, including former Tuntex Group
Chairman Chen You-hao, who was listed in 2003 as one of Taiwan's 10 most wanted
criminals after he fled the country leaving behind over NT$60 billion in unpaid
bank debts.</P>
      <P>The DPP has for long wanted the criminals' repatriation back to Taiwan to face
prosecution or stand trial.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, Cheng Wen-tsang, director of the DPP Department of Culture and
Information, reiterated the party's stance on the issue, saying if China is
sincere about forming a joint frontline to combat crime with Taiwan, it should
repatriate major Taiwanese fugitives as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks as he released the results of a telephone survey
conducted by the DPP from April 20-21 on a planned joint cross-strait crime
fighting agreement.</P>
      <P>In the survey, 88.4 percent of the respondents said the issue of extradition of
major economic criminals should be included in a proposed cross-strait agreement
on crime control.</P>
      <P>The agreement on crime fighting is expected to be signed by Chiang Pin-kung,
chairman of Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, and his Chinese
counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, when they meet on April 25-26 in Nanjing,
China.</P>
      <P>Only 4.4 percent of the respondents in the poll, who were drawn from people over
age 19, expressed opposition to the extradition idea.</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council and Straits Exchange Foundation have not clearly
stated whether the issue of extradition of major criminals will be included in
the upcoming talks or any crime fighting agreement that will be signed.</P>
      <P>The poll also gauged the level of public satisfaction with the performance of
President Ma Ying-jeou, who will have served as president for one year on May
20.</P>
      <P>In terms of President Ma's performance, 34.7 percent of the survey's respondents
gave him a positive rating, while 57.1 percent gave him a thumbs down.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,062 valid samples were collected in the poll, which had a margin of
error of plus or minus 3.06 percent.</P>
      <P>Since the institutionalized talks between Taiwan and China resumed last June,
the issue of joint crime-fighting efforts has been high on the Taiwan
government's agenda, as mainland China is known to be the main haven for
criminals fleeing Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However,  the two sides have not yet formalized any such arrangement.  What
exists at the moment is a non-governmental agreement that was signed in the
Taiwan-controlled island of Kinmen in 1992 by the Red Cross societies of the two
sides to facilitate repatriation of stowaways and some relatively lesser-known
criminals across the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based Spanish Chamber of Commerce (CCE) held a tourism fair
Wednesday, inviting 200 local travel agents to explore the diversity of Spain's
tourism with the aim of increasing the number of visitors from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CCE Director-General Jose Luis Lamas said at a news conference that the fair was
designed not only to promote Spain as a tourist destination for Taiwanese people
but also to increase their awareness and knowledge of the country.</P>
      <P>Ignacio Ducasse, director of the Spanish Tourism Office in Tokyo -- which covers
Spain's tourism business in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea -- said that while 90
percent of Spain's tourists come from Europe, the country wants to increase the
presence of people from more distant countries.</P>
      <P>"We believe that in Taiwan we have strong potential  for attracting visitors to
Spain. For that reason, Taiwan is a very important market for us," Ducasse told
CNA.</P>
      <P>He noted that compared with other Asian countries, Taiwan has one of the highest
numbers of travelers to Spain, with an average of 30,000 per year, a number that
has been growing steadily over the past decade.</P>
      <P>While Taiwanese people are familiar with Spain for its art, sports, fashion and
food, Ducasse said, Spain has much more to offer as it is a very diverse and
rich country.</P>
      <P>Maria Luisa Fernandez, deputy director of new markets for Spain's Institute of
Tourism, said at the news conference that Spain is unique because it is a
"green, sunny and modern tourist destination."</P>
      <P>The country also has a rich cultural legacy with some 40 historic sites and 13
cities declared as UNESCO world heritage sites, she added.</P>
      <P>The tourism fair provided local travel agents with the latest tourist
information and will help them organize various kinds of tourist itineraries for
their Taiwanese customers, Fernandez added.</P>

      <P>A 2-year-old girl has died after being severely beaten by her father with a
broom, according to prosecutors in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County, who have
detained the father.</P>
      <P>The case is the second in less than a week involving deaths of children from
domestic violence.</P>
      <P>The 2-year-old girl's father beat her on Tuesday for playing with water in the
bathroom while he was trying to take a nap during a break from work, and then
tied her to a bed before going back to work, according to police.</P>
      <P>The girl's mother who was taking a nap at the time told police she did not think
much of the beating and continued sleeping. When she awoke, she untied the girl,
but after doing house chores, noticed the child had fallen unconscious. She
rushed the girl to a hospital, but doctors could not save her. The child died
Tuesday evening. Doctors discovered that the girl's arms, legs and buttocks were
covered with bruises.</P>
      <P>The father, 40, was in tears when he saw his unconscious daughter at the
hospital. He expressed regret and said he really loved his daughter, but that
she was naughty and he was just trying to discipline her.  He is being held on a
charge of assault causing death.</P>
      <P>Chung Chu-sheng,  a prosecutor  of the Kaohsiung  District Prosecutor's Office,
said the crime is severe and that the lightest punishment the father could face
is seven years imprisonment.</P>
      <P>The case was widely reported in Taiwan's media Wednesday, with some TV stations
showing a broom which had broken into several pieces. Local media reports said
the father's beating caused the broom to break.</P>
      <P>The girl's exact cause of death remains under investigation.</P>
      <P>The incident is the second this month involving child abuse leading to death. On
Saturday, a father in central Taiwan's Changhua City threw his 10-month-old
daughter into a pot of boiling water, causing her to die from severe burns.</P>
      <P>The two cases have ignited public concerns about the rising incidences of child
abuse in Taiwan, with child welfare groups urging parents not to take out their
anger on children and the Ministry of the Interior pledging to devote more
funding and resources to identifying at-risk families to prevent further
violence against children.</P>

      <P>The monthly nominal salary for office workers in Taiwan during the January-
February  period averaged NT$55,131 (US$1,630), marking a record drop of 12.13
percent year on year, a government agency said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It was the largest  ever decrease  since  1980 when  the Cabinet-level
Directorate  General of Budget,  Accounting  and Statistics  (DGBAS)  started
compiling  such data,  said Hung Chien-chung, a DGBAS official.</P>
      <P>Per capita actual income also fell 12.18 percent during the same period compared
to a year ago, which was also a record plunge since 1980, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He attributed the decrease mainly to a noticeable shrinkage in year-end bonuses
last year as a result of the global financial crisis which broke in September
2008.</P>
      <P>At the same time, a survey found that 53 percent of Taiwan's white-collar
workers are now required to work longer every day, while 28 percent of blue-
collar workers have shorter work hours.</P>
      <P>According to the results of the survey released Wednesday, around 60 percent of
the respondents said their wealth has contracted and their economic burdens have
increased. Only 5 percent said they felt no financial pressure, compared to the
52 percent who said they were under heavy financial strain.</P>
      <P>Some 64 percent said they are not satisfied with their current living standards,
compared to six months ago, the poll showed.</P>
      <P>In terms of outlook, 16 percent said that they did not think their living
standards would recover in three years, and 7 percent felt that it never would.</P>
      <P>The poll, commissioned by Business Today Magazine, was conducted April 2-7, and
collected 1,640 valid questionnaires from office workers aged 25-44. It had a
margin of error of 2.5 percentage points.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in another survey conducted by Yes123, an online head hunting
network, 70 percent of the respondents said they were concerned about losing
their jobs and that they only had enough money to get though 6.6 months.</P>
      <P>Nearly 50 percent of jobless workers said they spent two hours every day playing
video games to kill time, while 40 percent admitted to watching pornographic
movies at least once every five days, the Yes123  survey  showed.  Close to 10
percent  said they take anti-depressants to try to relax.</P>
      <P>Some 20 percent of the unemployed workers who responded to the poll said that
they would have no chance of finding a new job if they remain out of work for
more than two years, while 30 percent said they will seek assistance from
fortune tellers, and 36 percent plan to visit to temples to ask for divine
intervention. Another 10 percent said they will seek help from doctors or

      <P>The Child Welfare League Foundation (CWLF) and the Taipei Women's Rescue
Foundation (TWRF) made the appeal after two heart-wrenching cases of child abuse
were reported in the past few days.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, a 2-year-old girl in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung County was beaten
to death by her father, and a day earlier, a 10-month-old baby girl died in a
hospital in central Taiwan's Changhua County after she was dumped into a pot of
boiling water over the weekend.</P>
      <P>CWLF Chief Executive Wang Yu-min said neither of the two families were included
in the Ministry of the Interior's at-risk families databank, which indicates
that there are holes in Taiwan's current community security networks.</P>
      <P>Wang said grassroots community leaders, such as borough and neighborhood chiefs,
better known locally as lichang and linchang in Chinese, have not been included
on the list of personnel who are obligated to report child abuse cases to the
relevant public agencies.</P>
      <P>Under the current Children's Welfare Law, medical professionals, social workers,
education personnel, caregivers, police, judicial personnel and other
professionals who deal with child and juvenile welfare services are mandated to
report cases of child abuse to the relevant city and county government
departments.</P>
      <P>"Regretfully, this stipulation is not comprehensive and effective enough to
expose child abuse cases in time," Wang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the foundation has recorded a total of 141 cases of child abuse
since 2005, Wang said the gravity of those cases and the death rate have
escalated.</P>
      <P>The two latest cases also signaled a decline in the family's function of
protecting the safety of children, Wang said. An analysis of major cases of
child abuse indicated that 67 percent of them were related to martial problems

      <P>The situation becomes even worse if the parents are alcoholics or drug addicts,
Wang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President Ma urges U.S. to sell Taiwan more arms</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22 (CNA)
04/22/09  23:17:03
(By Rachel Chan)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on the United States Wednesday to sell more arms
to Taiwan, saying that such a request is justified and the arms sales will help
Taiwan to maintain a military balance against China.</P>
      <P>"The delicate balance of the status quo is being shaken by the gross military
imbalances across the (Taiwan) Strait. Therefore, I urge the United States to
not hesitate to provide Taiwan with the necessary defensive arms as stipulated
in the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) , " Ma said via teleconferencing from Taiwan
in a forum on the TRA.</P>
      <P>Ma's comment in the forum, titled "U.S.-Taiwan Relations in a New Era: Looking
Forward 30 Years After the Taiwan Relations Act, " was his first major public
statement to U.S. political and academic sectors since he took office last May.</P>
      <P>He promised that Taiwan will not "free-ride" on the U.S. for its own security,
as it has taken several steps to show its intention to build its military
strength.</P>
      <P>Those steps, he explained, included publishing a quadrennial defense review last
month, making plans to create an all volunteer force to enhance the
professionalism of the military and increasing the defense budget to at least
three percent of the country's GDP.</P>
      <P>During a Q&amp;A session, Ma urged the U.S. to approve Taiwan's requests to
acquire submarines and high performance jet fighters such as the F-16 C/D
because they are for defensive purposes.</P>
      <P>"In view of the sharp changes in the military balance across the Taiwan Strait,
I think it is fully justified for the U.S. to seriously consider selling them
(to Taiwan),"the president said.</P>
      <P>Given the warming cross-strait ties, he said, Washington should not be worried
that such arms sales would jeopardize its relations with China.</P>
      <P>"Even China understands very well that at the moment we want to improve
relations with the mainland. But we also, as a government, have to maintain a
military balance across the Taiwan Strait, " he said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has long been Taiwan's major weapons supplier, despite the fact that
this has been an irritant in U.S.-China relations.</P>
      <P>In the latest arms deal between Taiwan and the U.S., the administration of
former President George W. Bush approved in October 2008 the sale of a weapons
package that includes 30 Apache attack helicopters, 330 advanced capability
Patriot missiles, 32 Harpoon sub-launched missiles, 182 Javelin guided missiles,
and four E-2T system upgrades.</P>
      <P>Asked about confidence building measures with China, Ma said it is a rather
"difficult and sensitive" issue at the moment, and that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait should focus only on economic issues because they are more urgent and
more closely related to the livelihood of the people on both sides.</P>
      <P>As to bilateral relations between Taiwan and the U.S., Ma said in the future the
focus will be less on politics and more on pragmatism.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will work closely with the U.S. on issues such as opening Taiwan's market
to U.S. agricultural products, promoting e-commerce, exploring ways to reform
Taiwan's investment  environment  and improving the protection of intellectual
property rights,  he explained.</P>
      <P>On top of that, Taiwan would also like to conclude an extradition agreement with
the U.S., to participate in America's visa-waiver program and to sign a free
trade agreement with the U.S., the president said.</P>
      <P>The forum, hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) , also included panelists such as noted China affairs experts
Bonnie Glaser, Douglas Paal, Alan Romberg, Randy Schriver and Kerry Dumbaugh.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A special  exhibition  featuring out-of-print albums, manuscripts and other
objects related to Lee Lin-chiu, a famous Taiwanese lyricist, opened Wednesday
to mark the centenary anniversary of his birth.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin said Lee's lyrics
gave expression to the heartfelt aspirations and thoughts of the Taiwanese
people of his time and enriched Taiwan's cultural legacies.</P>
      <P>Many pop singers, young and old, attended the opening ceremony of the exhibition
at the preparatory office of the Taiwan New Culture Movement Memorial Hall in
Taipei to pay tribute to Lee.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-pin, a pop singer of mainland Chinese origin who rose to fame by
writing and singing romantic Taiwanese songs, said he likes Lee's emotional and
nostalgic lyrics.</P>
      <P>The exhibit followed the release of a CD last weekend by the Taipei's
Department  of Cultural  Affairs featuring  digitally remastered original
recordings of popular Taiwanese songs from the 1930s.</P>
      <P>Nine of the 23 tracks on the CD were written by Lee, who was born in 1909 in
Taipei while Taiwan was under Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>The songs, including Spring Breeze, Fixing Broken Fishing Nets and Four Seasons,
were written before Japan launched its "Kominka Movement" (Japanization
Movement) in Taiwan in the early 1940s.</P>
      <P>Lee, along with many other Taiwanese musicians, such as composer Teng Yu-hsien
and lyricists Chen Chun-yu and Chen Ta-ju, created songs that reflected the
daily lives of ordinary Taiwanese people in that era.</P>
      <P>"One major motivation behind the creation of those songs was the concern that
Taiwanese culture and the originality of Taiwanese music would disappear, as
most people were listening to popular Japanese songs during that period, " said
Chuang Yung-ming, a noted Taiwanese cultural history expert.</P>
      <P>According to Chuang, the attempt to develop "Taiwan's own popular music" was
successful, as many people today consider the 1930s the first golden age of
Taiwanese popular music.</P>
      <P>However, only about 200 of the 500-plus songs created during that period have
survived.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an April 18 news conference to introduce the new CD, Lee Yong-ping,
director of the Taipei City Department of Cultural Affairs, said it was a tough
task to find the original recordings and to digitize the music for release on
CD.</P>
      <P>For one thing, she recalled,  many record collectors were reluctant to loan the
more than half-a-century-old records that still had good sound quality.</P>
      <P>It was also no easy task to get the copyright issues straightened out as most of
the musicians have passed away, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Growth in jobless rate slowing down: DGBAS</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan's jobless rate rose to a record high of 5.81 percent in March,
the growth in joblessness is slowing down, a spokesman for the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Had the government not taken measures to create job openings, the jobless rate
in March would probably have surged past 6.21 percent, said Huang Chien-chung,
deputy director of the DGBAS fourth bureau.</P>
      <P>The March jobless rate of 5.81 percent represented a 0.06 percentage point
increase from the 5.75 percent recorded in February, and a 1.95 percentage point
growth compared to same month in 2008, according to the DGBAS statistics.</P>
      <P>The data indicated a rise in the unemployment rate for 11 consecutive months,
Huang said.</P>
      <P>Even when seasonal changes were taken into consideration, Huang said, the
unemployment rate in March remained as high as 5.72 percent, which represented a
0.09 percentage point increase from the previous month and a rise for the 12th
month in a row.</P>
      <P>Huang said both unadjusted and seasonally adjusted jobless rates for March were
the highest since 1978.</P>
      <P>However, although unemployment is still rising, the growth rate is slowing,
Huang said, citing as an indicator the growth rate for March job losses -- 4.55
percent -- due to business contraction or closure, which he said was the lowest
in the past seven months.</P>
      <P>Other signs include an increase of 89,000 in the number of government employees
from last October to nearly 1.05 million in March, he added.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS report, the unemployment figure rose to 630,000  in
March,  which was a record high since the first unemployment survey was
conducted in 1978.</P>
      <P>The number of jobless people has increased by nearly 213,000 over the past seven
months, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Also in March, a record 344,000 people lost their jobs because of business
contraction or closure, he added.</P>
      <P>The average jobless rate in the first three months of the year was 5.62 percent,
up 1.75 percentage points year-on-year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President Ma urges U.S. to sell Taiwan more arms</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou called on the United States Wednesday to sell more arms
to Taiwan, saying that such a request is justified and the arms sales will help
Taiwan to maintain a military balance against China.</P>
      <P>"The delicate balance of the status quo is being shaken by the gross military
imbalances across the (Taiwan) Strait. Therefore, I urge the United States to
not hesitate to provide Taiwan with the necessary defensive arms as stipulated
in the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) , " Ma said via teleconferencing from Taiwan
in a forum on the TRA.</P>
      <P>Ma's comment in the forum, titled "U.S.-Taiwan Relations in a New Era: Looking
Forward 30 Years After the Taiwan Relations Act, " was his first major public
statement to U.S. political and academic sectors since he took office last May.</P>
      <P>He promised that Taiwan will not "free-ride" on the U.S. for its own security,
as it has taken several steps to show its intention to build its military
strength.</P>
      <P>Those steps, he explained, included publishing a quadrennial defense review last
month, making plans to create an all volunteer force to enhance the
professionalism of the military and increasing the defense budget to at least
three percent of the country's GDP.</P>
      <P>During a Q&amp;A session, Ma urged the U.S. to approve Taiwan's requests to
acquire submarines and high performance jet fighters such as the F-16 C/D
because they are for defensive purposes.</P>
      <P>"In view of the sharp changes in the military balance across the Taiwan Strait,
I think it is fully justified for the U.S. to seriously consider selling them
(to Taiwan),"the president said.</P>
      <P>Given the warming cross-strait ties, he said, Washington should not be worried
that such arms sales would jeopardize its relations with China.</P>
      <P>"Even China understands very well that at the moment we want to improve
relations with the mainland. But we also, as a government, have to maintain a
military balance across the Taiwan Strait, " he said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has long been Taiwan's major weapons supplier, despite the fact that
this has been an irritant in U.S.-China relations.</P>
      <P>In the latest arms deal between Taiwan and the U.S., the administration of
former President George W. Bush approved in October 2008 the sale of a weapons
package that includes 30 Apache attack helicopters, 330 advanced capability
Patriot missiles, 32 Harpoon sub-launched missiles, 182 Javelin guided missiles,
and four E-2T system upgrades.</P>
      <P>Asked about confidence building measures with China, Ma said it is a rather
"difficult and sensitive" issue at the moment, and that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait should focus only on economic issues because they are more urgent and
more closely related to the livelihood of the people on both sides.</P>
      <P>As to bilateral relations between Taiwan and the U.S., Ma said in the future the
focus will be less on politics and more on pragmatism.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will work closely with the U.S. on issues such as opening Taiwan's market
to U.S. agricultural products, promoting e-commerce, exploring ways to reform
Taiwan's investment  environment  and improving the protection of intellectual
property rights,  he explained.</P>
      <P>On top of that, Taiwan would also like to conclude an extradition agreement with
the U.S., to participate in America's visa-waiver program and to sign a free
trade agreement with the U.S., the president said.</P>
      <P>The forum, hosted by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) , also included panelists such as noted China affairs experts
Bonnie Glaser, Douglas Paal, Alan Romberg, Randy Schriver and Kerry Dumbaugh.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Decorated painter transcends gaps in East-West artistic traditions</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/23/09  13:09:10</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"East is East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet." Rudyard
Kipling's famous line best described the world Liu Kuo-Sung found himself in
when he enrolled in the fine arts department of National Taiwan Normal
University (NTNU) in Taipei in 1951.</P>
      <P>The university's fine arts department was considered the best in Taiwan at the
time, with many well-known painters counted among its faculty.</P>
      <P>The department, however, could not transcend the divide seen in the art world at
the time. A clear schism existed between professors teaching Oriental, or
Chinese, painting styles and those emphasizing Western painting techniques.</P>
      <P>Teachers of each school would stick to the norms, techniques and traditions of
their own camps and would not venture out of the own worlds, much less borrow
ideas or skills from the opposing school.</P>
      <P>It was this fractured environment that inspired Liu to narrow the art world's
boundaries by transcending  them and to modernize traditional Chinese ink
painting with revolutionary materials over a 60-year career that culminated with
his winning the National Award for Arts in 2008.</P>
      <P>His use of unprecedented techniques, such as manipulating natural fibers
embedded in grainy paper or exposing paper to ink-colored water, were the
product of his willingness to experiment following his university years.</P>
      <P>Curious about how to erase the gap between East and West, Liu and four other
like-minded painters formed a group in 1956 after graduating called the Salon de
May to bring Chinese painting into the 20th century.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Central News Agency in 2009, Liu recalled his
dissatisfaction at the time with traditional Chinese painting, also known as ink
and wash painting because it uses the same ink and brushes as those used in
Chinese calligraphy.</P>
      <P>He said Chinese painting came a long way before the Yuan dynasty (1206-1368) as
painters had moved from "realism, " reproducing nature in their works, to
"expressionism, " in which they expressed their perception of the world in their
paintings.</P>
      <P>But development stalled after the Yuan dynasty because Chinese painting from
that time was taught mainly through imitation, with students patterning their
works on those of their teachers or other well-known painters.</P>
      <P>"New techniques were not encouraged if not repressed, and the creativity of the
students waned during this process of meticulous imitation." Liu said.</P>
      <P>As a result, he said, Chinese painting was trapped in a rigid mold,  evident  by
the minimal difference  between modern and centuries-old works in terms of their
subjects or the techniques used to create them.</P>
      <P>Liu's criticism echoes the views of some early 20th century Chinese thinkers,
such as Kang Youwei (1858-1927) and Chen Duxiu (1879-1942), who believed Chinese
painting was doomed to be replaced by western art because it no longer reflected
the modern world and did not resonate on an emotional level with modern people.</P>
      <P>Liu believed Chinese painters' overemphasis  on traditional technique,
especially the use of the tip of fine brushes, had contributed to the lack of
innovation in the art form.</P>
      <P>"'If you cannot use the tip of the brush as dexterously as a calligrapher, you
can never be a good painter.' That is what the traditional painters would tell
their students, and that is what I opposed the most." Liu said.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Chun-rei, a professor of fine arts history at National Cheng Kung
University in Tainan, said Liu's advocacy of modernizing Chinese painting was
not surprising, considering it came at a time when there was a vacuum in the
field in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"In the 1950s, Taiwan had been weaned away from the influence of Japan, which
left Taiwan after the end of World War II. It was also separated politically
from China at the end of the Chinese civil war and thereby was sheltered from
the influence of China," Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>This provided the young Liu and his fellow artists in the Salon De May an
opportunity to allow their imaginations to run wild and create their own
innovative style.</P>
      <P>To break new ground in Chinese ink painting, Liu began to explore new
techniques. He first replaced the delicate brushes and brush pens with a big
brush used by artillery troops to clean cannons.</P>
      <P>The big brush gave Liu's landscape paintings simple yet dynamic slashes that
contrasted sharply with the fine, delicate strokes seen in traditional works.</P>
      <P>Another of his innovations,  and one that has become his trademark, was to paint
on coarse paper embedded with randomly scatter natural fibers and then rip the
fiber from the paper to create irregular white lines uncovered by ink.</P>
      <P>By manipulating these lines of various width, Liu created unusual and beautiful
shapes that cannot be produced by a painting brush.</P>
      <P>Yuan Chin-ta, a professor at National Taiwan Normal University, describes Liu's
innovation as "a stroke of genius, " as there had never been any white lines in
Chinese painting.</P>
      <P>"Liu produced it by removing ink rather than using white paint and created a new
form of expression. It was unprecedented, " Yuan said.</P>
      <P>Liu also explored what he called the "water print method, " in which he would
let colored ink be absorbed in water and then lay the paper on the water to
absorb the ink.</P>
      <P>To create an even more exotic pattern using the technique, Liu would stack
sheets of the water-soaked paper, leaving tiny air pockets between them.</P>
      <P>He would then apply ink along the edges of the paper where bubbles would form,
leaving the ink to migrate with the bubbles to create unexpected lines, shapes
and grains.</P>
      <P>By employing these techniques skillfully, Liu created many strange abstract
paintings which look like mountains, streams, rocks and clouds but are quite
different from those seen in traditional Chinese paintings.</P>
      <P>Poet Yu Kuang-chung described Liu's paintings as "floating between the real and
unreal, " as depicting things that look like something without clearly defining
what it is.</P>
      <P>In another deviation from tradition, Liu incorporates the modern world in his
art. Inspired by the launch of Apollo 8 in 1969, Liu unveiled a series of
paintings that year representing the Earth and the moon.</P>
      <P>His painting "Which is Earth" not only earned him the top prize at the
Mainstream '69 exhibition in the United States and praise as "the most sensitive
modern painter, " it also "took Chinese landscape painting from the Earth to the
universe, " says National Cheng Kung University's Hsiao.</P>
      <P>Liu's contributions to the arts were formally recognized in 2008 when he won the
National Award for Arts, the highest honor conferred to artists in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In honoring  Liu,  the award organizer  hailed him as "a traditionalist with a
revolutionary spirit."</P>
      <P>Liu took the honor in stride, saying he believed modernizing Chinese painting
was the only chance for this type of art to survive, and that he made every
effort to push this innovative style to its limit and enhance the glory of
Chinese painting.</P>
      <P>But he refuses to say if he succeeded.</P>
      <P>"Did I realize my goal? That will be up to the people following me to
determine."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOFA looking to revise rules pertaining to international NGOs</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that it is reviewing a set
of regulations, in collaboration with other governmental agencies, with the aim
of creating a more friendly environment for international non-governmental
organizations (INGOs) to set up chapters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We are looking at relaxing the current regulations to make it easier for INGOs
to set up offices in Taiwan, " said David C.K. Wu, deputy head of the MOFA's NGO
Affairs Committee, at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>"If INGOs can set up their offices  here,  it will help significantly to boost
the connections and cooperation between local NGOs and their international
counterparts, which is also vital to Taiwan's globalization," he added.</P>
      <P>The issues of resident and work permits and taxation are the most crucial for
INGOs planning to set up headquarters, secretariats or local chapters in Taiwan,
Wu said. The two sets of regulations governing these matters were introduced
more than two decades ago and are now outdated, he added.</P>
      <P>Some INGOs have even complained that Taiwan's regulations are "unfriendly," Wu
said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, his committee held an inter-governmental agency meeting March
24 to review the regulations and suggested that the Ministry of Interior work
with the relevant agencies to relax the rules.</P>
      <P>Representatives from several INGOs also attended the meeting, including the Asia
Foundation, the Democratic Pacific Union, the International Commission on
Irrigation and the Drainage and International Association for Volunteer Effort
Taiwan, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Among them, the San Francisco-based Asia Foundation showed the greatest interest
in setting up a branch in Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that Singapore and Bangkok are the two most favored locations for INGOs
seeking to gain a footing in Asia, Wu said the MOFA has also asked its
representatives offices in those countries to study the regulations there for
reference.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's largest trade promotion agency opened its first Taiwan-themed boutique
and souvenir shop at the Taipei World Trade Center (TWTC) Thursday with the aim
of advertising Taiwan's culture among the millions of foreign exhibitors and
buyers that come to the country every year.</P>
      <P>Walter  M.S.  Yeh,  executive  vice  president  of  the semi-governmental Taiwan
External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), said at the formal opening of the
shop that the TWTC, one of the landmarks in Taipei, each year attracts three to
four million visitors who come to Taiwan for various types of conventions.</P>
      <P>Seeking to maximize the advantages of this influx of visitors, the TAITRA
started planning last year to open a Taiwan-themed souvenir shop at the TWTC to
promote Taiwan's culture and its innovative industries, he added.</P>
      <P>"We hope that visitors from home and abroad will be able to sample the richness
and creativity of Taiwan's diverse culture at the souvenir shop and boutique,"
Yeh said.</P>
      <P>"We also hope that visitors who see the souvenirs from different parts of Taiwan
will decide to stay longer to further explore the city and the country," he
added.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the shop, called "taiwanlook, " will not only sell cultural
and creative souvenirs, but will also occasionally launch limited edition
products on different convention themes.</P>
      <P>In addition to souvenirs, the work of local artists and museum pieces will be
showcased at the shop, Yeh said, adding that the first exhibit was co-hosted by
National Taiwan Museum and the National Culture and Arts Foundation.</P>
      <P>TAITRA was founded in 1970 to help promote foreign trade and is sponsored by the

    <HEADLINE>Shopping voucher program helps slow consumption decline: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
04/23/09  14:23:46
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The decline in private consumption showed signs of slowdown in the first
quarter, thanks partly to the shopping voucher program introduced by the
government in January to stimulate consumption, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>This positive development is evident in the performance of the country's retail
trade and the food and beverage services where the revenue contraction has
slowed despite the economic downturn, said Huang Chi-shih, chief of the MOEA's
Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>The latest MOEA statistics show that these sectors' revenue amounted to NT$877.6
billion (US$25.9 billion) in the first quarter, up marginally by 0.28 percent
from the previous quarter but down by 4.46 percent from the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the year-on-year decline was obviously smaller compared with the
year-on-year contraction of 6.47 percent recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008,
the statistics indicate.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of 2009, the revenue of general merchandise retailers --
including department stores,  supermarkets,  chain convenience stores and
hypermarkets -- totaled NT$213.7 billion, a slight increase of 0.88 percent from
the previous quarter.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, from Jan 18. when the shopping vouchers were issued to the
public until the end of March, the wholesale trade, retail trade and food and
beverage service sectors received vouchers amounting to NT$66.7 billion.</P>
      <P>Of this amount, NT$30.4 billion, or 46 percent, went to general merchandise
retailers, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The vouchers are being given out until April 30 as part of an economic stimulus
package to boost consumer spending and economic growth in light of the current
economic downturn.</P>
      <P>All Taiwanese citizens -- with the exception of those living abroad without
identity cards, household registration or residency rights -- and their foreign
spouses are eligible to each receive NT$3,600 in vouchers, which must be
exchanged for goods or services by Sept. 30, 2009.</P>
      <P>Data from the Ministry of Finance show that as of April 20, more than NT$65.53
billion, or 78.26 percent, of the total of NT$83.73 billion vouchers issued had
been used by consumers and cashed by the businesses that received them.</P>
      <P>The largest amount of vouchers cashed on a single day -- NT$8.16 billion -- was
recorded Feb. 3, the second working day after the Chinese New Year holiday,
according to Bank of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The daily amount that was being cashed stood at between NT$2 billion and NT$3
billion on the other working days during the week after the new year holiday,
the bank said.</P>
      <P>However, the daily amount has decreased significantly to between NT$200 million
and NT$500 million in recent days, probably because most consumers have already
spent their vouchers, the bank said.</P>
      <P>While the shopping voucher program might have helped slow down the decline  in
private consumption,  its effect in terms of encouraging consumers to spend more
than the NT$3,600 in vouchers remains doubtful.</P>
      <P>Most department stores and hypermarkets complained that although their sales
soared during the two weeks leading up to the Chinese New Year holiday, revenue
has since dropped as the vouchers are gradually being used up by consumers.</P>
      <P>During the holiday period, shopping voucher payments accounted for 20 percent to
30 percent of the total revenue received by department stores, and contributed
to 40 percent to 50 percent of the revenue of hypermarkets and supermarkets,
according to statistics from the businesses.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that Taiwan and Japan will
be in charge of launching an international disaster relief and rescue platform
to coordinate humanitarian aid efforts by non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
in the Southeast Asian region.</P>
      <P>"The initiative aims at increasing connections and exchanges between Taiwan's
NGOs with their counterparts in the region to better facilitate and coordinate
their humanitarian aid efforts," said David C.K. Wu, deputy head of the MOFAs
NGO Affairs Committee, at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, under the leadership of Taiwan and Japan, a memorandum was
signed by nine NGOs from Taiwan, six from Japan and one each from the U.S. and
Indonesia at the 5th Southeast Asian NGO Forum that took place in Japan last
week.</P>
      <P>the agreement provides a platform for the signatory NGOs to launch a mechanism
in four years to coordinate humanitarian aid in the event of any natural
disasters in the region, he added.</P>
      <P>As to other NGO-related programs, Wu said his committee will work with the
Taiwan Nurses Association to dispatch nursing personnel to Afghanistan June 1 to
run a three-month training program for Afghan nurses.</P>
      <P>This initiative is being carried out in recognition of the work of Afghan human
rights activist Sima Samar, who won the third Asia Democracy and Human Rights
Award (ADHRA) last November, he said.</P>
      <P>The award was created in 2006 by the government-funded Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy to honor individuals or groups dedicated to democratic development,
the advancement of human rights and the building of democracy.</P>
      <P>Samar, who is a doctor and the chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights
Commission, in 1989 established the Shuhada Organization, which operates 12
clinics and 4 hospitals in Afghanistan and Pakistan, all dedicated to the

      <P>The Institute for Information Industry (III) recently developed the world's
first Android-based notebook, which is expected to help create enormous business
opportunities for Taiwan's information and communication technology (ICT)
industry, according to an industry report released Thursday.</P>
      <P>Android is a software platform and operating system developed by Google and
later the Open Handset Alliance, which enables developers to create compelling
mobile applications. It is built on the open source Linux Kernel.</P>
      <P>The successful development  of the Android notebook is an important milestone
for the notebook market, and the products are likely to take a slice of the
market, according to the report released by the III's Market Intelligence &amp;
Consulting Institute (MIC).</P>
      <P>This year, the output of Taiwan-made notebooks is expected to increase to 23
million units, the MIC forecast.</P>
      <P>Following the development  of Android-based  handsets,  the government-backed
III also successfully  developed several key software technologies based on
Android, including a whiteboard equipped with a handwriting  recognition program

      <P>The 38 Chinese visitors who were repatriated upon arrival in Taiwan last week
because they lacked entry permits, are returning to Taiwan Thursday after having
their travel documents prepared this time around, according to a travel agency
source.</P>
      <P>The group from China's northeastern city of Shenyang, comprising of 37 tourists
and one tour guide, are traveling to Taiwan from the Chinese southeastern port
city of Xiamen via ship, with a transit flight from Taiwan's outlying island of
Kinmen, said Lin Chin-jung, chairman of Taiwan's Travel Quality Assurance
Association.</P>
      <P>They are expected to arrive in Taipei's Songshan Airport later in the day.</P>
      <P>The tourists, mostly retirees from Liaoning Province, where Shenyang is located,
had stayed in Xiamen City since April 18 after they were repatriated, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"They were innocent visitors as they didn't know that the travel agency in
charge of their Taiwan tour had not applied for entry permits for them in
advance," Lin added.</P>
      <P>After being repatriated, the group stayed in Xiamen, waiting for their travel
documents to be arranged by Beijing's quasi-official Cross Strait Tourism
Exchange Association and Taipei-based Taiwan Strait Tourism Association, Lin
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Airport worker investigated for money smuggling</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport police have launched a probe into
allegations that a female security officer was providing cover for a traveler
who was smuggling gold and foreign currency to the tune of NT$2 billion
(US$59.17 million) out of Taiwan over a three-year period.</P>
      <P>Airport police authorities said they are investigating a security officer
surnamed Wu and a traveler identified as Pu.</P>
      <P>The case broke last week when airport police officers caught Pu as he was
attempting to fly out of Taiwan with more than 10 kilograms of gold bars in his
luggage.</P>
      <P>In a long-term tracking operation, airport police discovered that Pu had been
traveling to Hong Kong three or four times a week for the past three years.</P>
      <P>They found that all of Pu's flights to Hong Kong coincided with Wu's shifts at
the airport near Taipei and the police suspect that Wu and others may have been
in cahoots with Pu for a long time.</P>
      <P>On every trip to Hong Kong, Pu carried gold and foreign currency worth more than
NT$30 million, which he sometimes declared and sometimes did not, the police
suspect.</P>
      <P>According to the video footage from the airport's X-ray machines, even when Pu
declared the gold or foreign currency he was carrying, Wu did not
comprehensively check the declared items. And it was obvious that Pu was not
declaring all the valuables and money he was carrying, the police said.</P>
      <P>Based on the amount that Pu declared on two consecutive one-day trips to Hong
Kong late last year, it is estimated that he was actually carrying 74 million
Japanese yen, 860,000 Singapore dollars, 27,000 Swiss francs, 18,000 euros and
US$800, airport police said.</P>
      <P>The police estimated that Pu smuggled out at least NT$30 million worth of gold
and foreign currency on each trip, which they said means he probably took more
than NT$2 billion in money and gold out of Taiwan illegally over a period of
three years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan law stipulates that travelers are not allowed to take more than US$10,000
worth of foreign currency or gold out of the country and are required to declare
any amounts in excess of this figure to airport customs authorities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved a project Thursday to further develop the country's
renewable energy industries and to attract private investment in the sector.</P>
      <P>Under the project proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs over he next five
years in the development of renewable energy and will subsidize the general
installation of energy saving devices.</P>
      <P>It will also provide NT$20 billion for research and development of green energy
technologies, which is expected in turn to draw NT$200 billion in private
investment in the industry.</P>
      <P>The project will target industries that focus on solar energy, light emitting
diode (LED) lighting, wind power, biomass fuel, hydrogen power, fuel cells,
electric vehicles, energy information and communication technology.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan told reporters after a Cabinet meeting that building
Taiwan into a low-carbon society is one of the administration's priority
policies.</P>
      <P>He referred again to his pledge earlier in the month at a national energy
conference that the government will spare no effort to advance its goal of
building a "low carbon-emission homeland."</P>
      <P>The premier said he was confident that the MOEA project will help to stimulate
Taiwan's renewable energy industry and create more job opportunities in that
sector.</P>
      <P>Liu added his voice to President Ma Ying-jeou's call for the legislature to
quickly pass a renewable energy bill that has been stalled for a long time,
saying that the MOEA should push for the legislation's passage as it will
provide a legal basis for the development of the energy sector.</P>
      <P>Under a NT$500 billion four-year economic stimulus plan proposed by the Cabinet
last November, the government will spend 10 percent of the total to promote
green energy industries and to fund engineering work on renewable energy, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOEA should set up a task force to examine the difficulties that
green energy industries are facing and help them clear technical bottlenecks and
deal with investment and operating problems, the premier suggested.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Defense investigators probing a scandal involving senior
military officers allegedly buying their way to the posts of generals, will
forsake holidays to get to the bottom of the case, Deputy Minister of National
Defense Chang Liang-jen said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"It would be a round-the-clock, all-year-round task to proceed with the
investigations into the bribery scandal involving a group of generals who were
promoted en masse when former President Chen Shui-bian was in office," Chang
said at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of National Defense is resolved not to leave any stone unturned to
crack the scandal, " Chang said in response to an inquiry by Legislator Lee
Chia-chin from the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>According to the local media reports this week, prosecutors will first focus on
around 30 generals promoted by Chen, who left office last May after serving two
terms from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Chen Chao-min told lawmakers recently that he hopes the Defense
Ministry will come up with investigative reports in three months.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Legislator Lee criticized the military over a recent spate of
scandals, deriding that "the ROC (Republic of China) Armed Forces could put
themselves to rout from within, without China's military invasion."</P>
      <P>Chang responded to Lee by saying that it would be unfair to vilify the ROC Armed
Forces as undisciplined or lacking combative capability simply because of a few
scandals.</P>
      <P>Marine Corps Commander Lt. Gen. Hsu Shang-wen was questioned by prosecutors the
day before on suspicion of taking bribes from private suppliers.</P>
      <P>According to newspaper reports published Tuesday, prosecutors said they will
also investigate several hundred lieutenants and major generals promoted under
Chen's presidency.</P>
      <P>The investigation follows the recent indictment of a retired lieutenant general
on charges of bribery, blackmail and leaking secrets. He allegedly tried to
bribe his superiors for a promotion.</P>
      <P>In a separate case, three colonels have been indicted on corruption charges.</P>

      <P>Business at Taiwan's theme parks and resorts grew significantly in the first
quarter of this year compared to Q1 last year, the Tourism Bureau said Thursday,
attributing the growth to the government's shopping voucher program and other
promotion efforts.</P>
      <P>The latest statistics provided by 24 amusement parks and resorts in Taiwan
showed that the number of visitors in the first quarter grew by 26.21 percent
compared to the same period last year, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Some 2.23 million people visited these venues in Q1 this year, generating
revenues of NT$1.34 billion (US$39.66 million) , which represented an increase
of 12.19 percent over the same period last year, the data showed.</P>
      <P>The Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village in Nantou County, LeoFoo Village Theme
Park in Hsinchu County, Janfusun Fancy World in Yunlin County, Window on China
Theme Park in Taoyuan County and Hualien Farglory Ocean Park are the five most
popular amusement parks in Taiwan, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>"The government's shopping voucher program and related promotion programs during
the winter vacation contributed to the growth in first quarter of 2009," the
bureau stated in a press release.</P>
      <P>Some 91 percent of eligible Taiwan citizens had picked up their NT$3,600 worth
of vouchers as of Jan. 18 to pay for goods and services. The vouchers are the
business end of an NT$85.7 billion program that is part of a government economic
stimulus package.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau said that the publication of a magazine and the establishment
of a Web site to provide comprehensive information about theme parks and resorts
in Taiwan helped fuel the public's interest in these places, with some amusement
parks seeing growth of 40 percent both in the number of visitors and in revenue.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) announced Wednesday that it will recruit
1,427 social workers from 2010-2015 to set up a more comprehensive social
service network for the country.</P>
      <P>The announcement came amid sharp criticism from society for Taiwan's  lack of a
sufficient  social service mechanism  and professional social workers to help
troubled families, after two girls were abused to death by their fathers in the
past week.</P>
      <P>The two girls died on two consecutive days, shocking the entire country. One was
a 10-month-old baby who suffered severe burns after her father threw her into a
pot of boiling water during an argument with her mother. She died Tuesday
morning. The other was a 2-year-old who died Tuesday evening after her father
beat her severely with a broom for playing with water while he was trying to
take a nap.</P>
      <P>Since the first death occurred, the MOI has pledged to devote more funding and
resources to identifying more high-risk families, including those with parents
who abuse drugs or alcohol or frequently fight.</P>
      <P>To help prevent recurrence of such tragedies, the MOI said in a statement that
it will hire another 1,427 social workers to serve communities throughout Taiwan
during the six-year period.</P>
      <P>Before that aim is achieved, the MOI said it will continue helping local
governments fill the gap by adding new members to their current lineup of social
workers.</P>
      <P>To date,  320 child  protection  social  workers  and 190 anti-domestic violence
and sexual assault workers have been stationed in localities across the country
in the past year.</P>
      <P>The ministry also uses a portion of earnings from the state lotteries to help
promote programs directed at helping women, the elderly, the physically and
mentally challenged, as well as 29,000 children in high-risk families.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, 193 social workers have been dispatched  to
local governments  across the country with the lotteries' earnings, and 265 for
the whole of 2008, it said.</P>
      <P>But this is widely believed to be insufficient given Taiwan's population of 23
million people.</P>

      <P>Have you ever had the experience of seeing your mobile phone flying out of its
holder when you turn your car around? If you do, a "sticker phone" may be your
solution.</P>
      <P>The design by Liu Hsiang-ling, a student from National Taiwan University of
Science and Technology (NTUST) , is one of the winners of the iF concept award
2009 announced recently by the Hanover-based International Forum Design GmbH
(iF).</P>
      <P>The mobile phone made of polysiloxane and installed with solar panels on the
back was born exactly out of Liu's own driving experience. The device, which can
be stuck to a window, will stay put when you drive, and even better, it can be
recharged by absorbing sunlight.</P>
      <P>"I drive everyday to school, and I have always had the idea of having my mobile
phone stick to the window glass, just like a doll," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The iF concept award, which has been held for the second year since 2008, is an
international competition for new talent that is open to students in the fields
of design and architecture.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,221 concepts and ideas were submitted by students from 39 countries
this year.</P>
      <P>Nine of the concepts and ideas contributed by Taiwanese students are included in
the list of the "Best 100" announced last month by iF, making the country one of
the biggest winners of the annual event.</P>
      <P>Of these nine designs, three are by students from NTUST. The university has been
rated second by the "iF University Ranking" that is based on the performance of
contestants in the iF concept award over a period of three years.</P>
      <P>The other two NTUST winners, besides the "sticker phone", are "eat clean"
tableware by Yeh Ming-hong and Lai Chung-ping, as well as "rocking chair" by Kuo
Tsu-jung.</P>
      <P>The "eat clean" design is intended as a solution for people who feel
uncomfortable about using cutlery which has been in contact with the table top.
The design, which combines the special shape and weight principle of a seesaw,
enables the parts of the cutlery in contact with the mouth to always stay away
from the table top whichever way the cutlery is placed.</P>
      <P>The "rocking chair, " meanwhile, enables users to adjust their sitting positions
to increase fun and comfort.</P>
      <P>Another of this year's winner is "braille scanner" by Wang Fu-hua from Tainan
National University of the Arts.</P>
      <P>The design, a mobile phone intended for the visually impaired which can convert
braille into audible speech, is listed among the first 28 of the "Best 100" that
shared 30,000 euros in prize money.</P>
      <P>Others Taiwanese designs on the "Best 100" list also include the "so sweet"
clinical thermometer jointly contributed by Hsu Chun-chia from National Chiao
Tung University in Hsinchu City, Liu Rong-cheng and Chang Chia-wei from Ming-Chi
University of Technology (MCUT) in Taipei County, and Chen You-ren from National
Taipei University of Technology.</P>
      <P>The design turns clinical thermometers into lollipops, whose sweet coating melts
on contact with saliva, giving users a pleasant experience while having their
temperature taken.</P>
      <P>The "rabbit hanger" by Yeh Hsin-hua from Shu-Te University in Kaohsiung County
is not only a unique clothes hanger but also a useful tool for putting on
clothes and shoes. On one end of the hanger is a hole for doing up a zipper and
on the other, a shoe puller.</P>
      <P>The "freedle" by Mao Chia-lin, Huang Cheng-jia and Li Pei-sin from National
Kaohsiung Normal University is a needle equipped with an eye made of soft
flexible nylon, allowing the thread to be threaded more easily. Also, the
needle's fluorescent material makes it easier to find if it gets dropped on the
floor or somewhere dark.</P>
      <P>The "plug for visually" by Lin Chia-hsiang from Taichung-based Chaoyang
University of Technology involves the creation of tracks leading into the plug
socket to allow the visually impaired to insert the plug into the socket more
easily.</P>
      <P>The "so water" by Lin Yang-an and Liao Ching-chan from MCUT and Tzeng Jiuan-mau
from NTUST is shower fittings with a new style of faucet that can help users
avoid being splashed with water as a result of forgetting to switch the shower
over before using the tap.</P>
      <P>When using the apparatus, users need to pull the pipe down when they want to use
the tap, and then pull it up again to connect with the pipe of the shower nozzle
when they want to take a shower.</P>

      <P>All Taiwan's traffic lights, numbering about 700,000, are expected to be energy-
saving LED installations by 2011 when a comprehensive project to develop green
energy industries is implemented,  the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>If the plan to install light emitting diode (LED) traffic lights is fully
carried out by 2011, Taiwan will be the first country in the world to have LED
traffic lights installed nationwide, said Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin
Chii-ming at a Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>The plan will be part of the government's ambitious green energy industries
development project to be implemented by 2015.</P>
      <P>The project is expected to turn the green energy sector into the country's new
NT$1 trillion (US$29.59 billion) industrial sector, following in the footsteps
of Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing industry, which took off in the 1980s
and optoelectronic industry, which was launched in the 1990s, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>"By 2015, the green energy sector is expected to create 110,000 jobs in Taiwan
each year," the minister said.</P>
      <P>Earlier Thursday, the Executive Yuan approved the project to further develop the
country's green energy manufacturing industry, or environmentally-friendly and
energy-saving products and technologies.</P>
      <P>Under the project proposed by the MOEA, the administration will invest NT$25
billion over the next five years to develop renewable energy and will subsidize

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin read the story of a 12-year-old boy's brave fight
against cancer to an audience of 90 elementary school students at the Red
Theater in Taipei Thursday to mark World Reading Day.</P>
      <P>The story, titled "The Thing of Which I am Most Proud, " describes how Yuan
Chao-tung, a six-grader at the city's Huai Sheng Elementary School, is battling
cancer.</P>
      <P>Yuan, who has undergone surgery three times, was present at the event and said
he believes that some day he will eventually recover from the disease.</P>
      <P>"After getting through these hard times, the situation will get better," Yuan
said optimistically.</P>
      <P>Yuan said that every time he feels fear, he prays and tries to remember words of
encouragement offered to him by others or remind himself to be brave by
emulating other people who have successfully beaten cancer.</P>
      <P>Hau noted that he himself has twice undergone surgery and admitted that he also

      <P>A Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) official who had traveled to
Beijing with five colleagues to attend meetings on cross-Taiwan Strait
cooperation in fighting drug crime died suddenly early Thursday at his hotel in
the Chinese capital.</P>
      <P>Preliminary investigations attributed the death of 55-year-old Huang Chien-
cheng, who had worked at the MJIB for 29 years, to a massive heart attack.</P>
      <P>The MJIB has arranged for Huang's family to travel to Beijing to handle the
aftermath of his death.</P>
      <P>According to the MJIB, Huang and his five colleagues from the bureau's Drug
Crime Prevention Department  traveled to China's southeastern port city of
Xiamen April 20 at the invitation of the Xiamen city government for a meeting on
joint efforts to crack down on cross-strait drug crime.</P>
      <P>The group proceeded to Beijing two days later for a meeting with their Beijing-
based counterparts on the same topic. They were scheduled to return to Taiwan
April 25.</P>
      <P>Huang, described by his colleagues as a workaholic, had been nicknamed the
"ascetic monk" for his devotion to his work.</P>
      <P>He was injured in the line of duty in 1986 when he was stabbed with a chisel by
a drug mule during an operation, according to the MJIB.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan researchers extract brain-boosting nutrient from squid skin</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local research team has successfully extracted a brain-boosting nutrient from
cheap squid skin that can improve memory and enhance learning ability, a
fisheries official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Researchers at the Fisheries Research Institute under the Council of Agriculture
have been able to extract PL-DHA (phospholipid docosahexaenoic acid), a memory
enhancing substance, from the skin of squid, the official explained.</P>
      <P>According to the official, PL-DHA is better than TG-DHA, another form of
docosahexaenoic acid that is commonly found in deep-sea fish oil, in inhibiting
degradation of the intellect because it can cross the blood brain barrier and be
absorbed directly into the brain.</P>
      <P>The researchers have also discovered that the PL-DHA squid extract is effective
in reviving neural cells and enhancing the content of three oxidation-resistant
enzymes -- GSH, CAT and SOD -- as well as moderating free radical-induced
oxidative damage to neural cells, thus slowing down the accumulation of plaque
and tangles in brain cells.</P>
      <P>Quoting medical reports, the official said Alzheimer's and other senile dementia
diseases are associated with the accumulation of plaque and tangles in brain.</P>
      <P>At present, the official went on, more than 24 million people suffer from senile
dementia, with the rate of new cases growing at 4.6 million every year.</P>
      <P>"This means that one person in the world falls victim to Alzheimer's every six
minutes, " the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan boasts abundant squid catches, with annual output reaching between
150,000 tons and 200,000 tons, the official continued, adding that by-products
from squid processing accounts for 35 percent of the total catch, with squid
skins making up about 15 percent of the by-products.</P>
      <P>As squid skins are tough and unpalatable, they are usually processed into powder
that is used as an additive to animal and livestock feed.</P>
      <P>Following the discovery of PL-DHA in squid skins, the official said, the
Fisheries Research Institute will step up the development of squid skin-based
health products to enhance its market value.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Cash donations have continued to pour in to cash-strapped St. Mary's Hospital in
Taitung City, eastern Taiwan over the past 10 days, with the cash far exceeding
the amount needed to keep it from closing down, a hospital source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Since it launched a fundraising drive just 10 days ago to help it reorganize
from a general hospital to a non-profit health institution to allow it to
survive, the hospital had received donations exceeding NT$82 million (US$2.43
million)  as of Thursday,  including a NT$100,000 donation from President Ma
Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>St. Mary's Hospital, which for many years has been dedicated to providing health
care to the underprivileged in eastern Taiwan, had been hoping to raise by
November the NT$31.42 million it needs by law to transform itself into a non-
profit health care provider, which would allow it to raise funds from donations
and continue operating.</P>
      <P>Although the hospital has received six individual  medical contribution awards
in its five decades of operation and was the only health institution in the
country to receive the prestigious national Group Medical Contribution Award
last year, St. Mary's has always struggled financially and its economic straits
had worsened even further since last year, prompting it to seek to transfer its
legal status to that of a non-profit health institution.</P>
      <P>Becoming a non-profit entity would allow the hospital, set up by foreign
missionaries 48 years ago, to cushion its losses with private donations and
other public funding contributions.</P>
      <P>Department of Health Minister Yeh Chin-chuan visited St. Mary's that same day to
tell the hospital authorities that his department wants to help solve the
hospital's problems pertaining to the land value increment tax, and to tell them
that the NT$31.4 million legal requirement for the establishment of a non-profit
health care institution could be met by using the value of the hospital's
buildings and properties as collateral.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will visit Central America twice between late May and
July to attend presidential inaugurations in two of Taiwan's allies in the
region, political sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the president's travel plan, he will depart for a week-long Central
America visit in late May that will take him to El Salvador to attend the
inauguration of President-elect Mauricio Funes and to several of Taiwan's other
allies in the region.</P>
      <P>In July, the sources said, Ma is scheduled to visit Panama for three to four
days, mainly to attend the inauguration of that country's next president.</P>
      <P>Ma made his first overseas tour as Taiwan's head of state last August when he
visited the Dominican Republic and Paraguay. For that trip, Ma used a regularly
scheduled commercial flight to the United States, from where he flew to Central
America via chartered plane.</P>
      <P>For the forthcoming two visits, the sources said, the president will fly on
chartered flights on the entire journeys, with no decision yet made on which
carrier will be contracted to provide the flights.</P>
      <P>On customary transit stops in the United States, the sources went on, safety,
convenience and comfort will remain the top guiding principles in all relevant
arrangements.</P>
      <P>Central and South America and the Caribbean  are Taiwan's diplomatic stronghold,
with many of its 23 diplomatic allies located there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sources went on, Ma is also likely to attend a summit meeting
between the leaders of Taiwan and its South Pacific allies to be held in August
or September in the Solomon Islands.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Shopping voucher program helps slow consumption decline: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
04/23/09  14:23:46
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The decline in private consumption showed signs of slowdown in the first
quarter, thanks partly to the shopping voucher program introduced by the
government in January to stimulate consumption, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>This positive development is evident in the performance of the country's retail
trade and the food and beverage services where the revenue contraction has
slowed despite the economic downturn, said Huang Chi-shih, chief of the MOEA's
Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>The latest MOEA statistics show that these sectors' revenue amounted to NT$877.6
billion (US$25.9 billion) in the first quarter, up marginally by 0.28 percent
from the previous quarter but down by 4.46 percent from the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the year-on-year decline was obviously smaller compared with the
year-on-year contraction of 6.47 percent recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008,
the statistics indicate.</P>
      <P>In the first quarter of 2009, the revenue of general merchandise retailers --
including department stores,  supermarkets,  chain convenience stores and
hypermarkets -- totaled NT$213.7 billion, a slight increase of 0.88 percent from
the previous quarter.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, from Jan 18. when the shopping vouchers were issued to the
public until the end of March, the wholesale trade, retail trade and food and
beverage service sectors received vouchers amounting to NT$66.7 billion.</P>
      <P>Of this amount, NT$30.4 billion, or 46 percent, went to general merchandise
retailers, Huang said.</P>
      <P>The vouchers are being given out until April 30 as part of an economic stimulus
package to boost consumer spending and economic growth in light of the current
economic downturn.</P>
      <P>All Taiwanese citizens -- with the exception of those living abroad without
identity cards, household registration or residency rights -- and their foreign
spouses are eligible to each receive NT$3,600 in vouchers, which must be
exchanged for goods or services by Sept. 30, 2009.</P>
      <P>Data from the Ministry of Finance show that as of April 20, more than NT$65.53
billion, or 78.26 percent, of the total of NT$83.73 billion vouchers issued had
been used by consumers and cashed by the businesses that received them.</P>
      <P>The largest amount of vouchers cashed on a single day -- NT$8.16 billion -- was
recorded Feb. 3, the second working day after the Chinese New Year holiday,
according to Bank of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The daily amount that was being cashed stood at between NT$2 billion and NT$3
billion on the other working days during the week after the new year holiday,
the bank said.</P>
      <P>However, the daily amount has decreased significantly to between NT$200 million
and NT$500 million in recent days, probably because most consumers have already
spent their vouchers, the bank said.</P>
      <P>While the shopping voucher program might have helped slow down the decline  in
private consumption,  its effect in terms of encouraging consumers to spend more
than the NT$3,600 in vouchers remains doubtful.</P>
      <P>Most department stores and hypermarkets complained that although their sales
soared during the two weeks leading up to the Chinese New Year holiday, revenue
has since dropped as the vouchers are gradually being used up by consumers.</P>
      <P>During the holiday period, shopping voucher payments accounted for 20 percent to
30 percent of the total revenue received by department stores, and contributed
to 40 percent to 50 percent of the revenue of hypermarkets and supermarkets,
according to statistics from the businesses.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Thursday that Taiwan and Japan will
be in charge of launching an international disaster relief and rescue platform
to coordinate humanitarian aid efforts by non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
in the Southeast Asian region.</P>
      <P>"The initiative aims at increasing connections and exchanges between Taiwan's
NGOs with their counterparts in the region to better facilitate and coordinate
their humanitarian aid efforts," said David C.K. Wu, deputy head of the MOFAs
NGO Affairs Committee, at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, under the leadership of Taiwan and Japan, a memorandum was
signed by nine NGOs from Taiwan, six from Japan and one each from the U.S. and
Indonesia at the 5th Southeast Asian NGO Forum that took place in Japan last
week.</P>
      <P>the agreement provides a platform for the signatory NGOs to launch a mechanism
in four years to coordinate humanitarian aid in the event of any natural
disasters in the region, he added.</P>
      <P>As to other NGO-related programs, Wu said his committee will work with the
Taiwan Nurses Association to dispatch nursing personnel to Afghanistan June 1 to
run a three-month training program for Afghan nurses.</P>
      <P>This initiative is being carried out in recognition of the work of Afghan human
rights activist Sima Samar, who won the third Asia Democracy and Human Rights
Award (ADHRA) last November, he said.</P>
      <P>The award was created in 2006 by the government-funded Taiwan Foundation for
Democracy to honor individuals or groups dedicated to democratic development,
the advancement of human rights and the building of democracy.</P>
      <P>Samar, who is a doctor and the chair of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights
Commission, in 1989 established the Shuhada Organization, which operates 12
clinics and 4 hospitals in Afghanistan and Pakistan, all dedicated to the
provision of health care to Afghan women and girls.</P>

      <P>The Institute for Information Industry (III) recently developed the world's
first Android-based notebook, which is expected to help create enormous business
opportunities for Taiwan's information and communication technology (ICT)
industry, according to an industry report released Thursday.</P>
      <P>Android is a software platform and operating system developed by Google and
later the Open Handset Alliance, which enables developers to create compelling
mobile applications. It is built on the open source Linux Kernel.</P>
      <P>The successful development  of the Android notebook is an important milestone
for the notebook market, and the products are likely to take a slice of the
market, according to the report released by the III's Market Intelligence &amp;
Consulting Institute (MIC).</P>
      <P>This year, the output of Taiwan-made notebooks is expected to increase to 23
million units, the MIC forecast.</P>
      <P>Following the development  of Android-based  handsets,  the government-backed
III also successfully  developed several key software technologies based on
Android, including a whiteboard equipped with a handwriting  recognition program
for real-time communications. The whiteboard has a touch screen that allows
users to send handwritten messages during long distance teleconferencing.</P>
      <P>In addition, the company has developed a mobility-assisted device equipped with
handwriting input and map marking functions that enable users to compile a
travelog at any time during a trip.</P>
      <P>In view of the great business potential in the applications of the Android
operating system, the III will help domestic ICT manufacturers  to grab the
opportunities  to produce more new Android-based products in order to better
meet consumer demand, the report concluded.</P>

      <P>The 38 Chinese visitors who were repatriated upon arrival in Taiwan last week
because they lacked entry permits, are returning to Taiwan Thursday after having
their travel documents prepared this time around, according to a travel agency
source.</P>
      <P>The group from China's northeastern city of Shenyang, comprising of 37 tourists
and one tour guide, are traveling to Taiwan from the Chinese southeastern port
city of Xiamen via ship, with a transit flight from Taiwan's outlying island of
Kinmen, said Lin Chin-jung, chairman of Taiwan's Travel Quality Assurance

      <P>They are expected to arrive in Taipei's Songshan Airport later in the day.</P>

      <P>"They were innocent visitors as they didn't know that the travel agency in
charge of their Taiwan tour had not applied for entry permits for them in

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport police have launched a probe into
allegations that a female security officer was providing cover for a traveler
who was smuggling gold and foreign currency to the tune of NT$2 billion
(US$59.17 million) out of Taiwan over a three-year period.</P>
      <P>Airport police authorities said they are investigating a security officer
surnamed Wu and a traveler identified as Pu.</P>
      <P>The case broke last week when airport police officers caught Pu as he was
attempting to fly out of Taiwan with more than 10 kilograms of gold bars in his
luggage.</P>
      <P>In a long-term tracking operation, airport police discovered that Pu had been
traveling to Hong Kong three or four times a week for the past three years.</P>
      <P>They found that all of Pu's flights to Hong Kong coincided with Wu's shifts at
the airport near Taipei and the police suspect that Wu and others may have been
in cahoots with Pu for a long time.</P>
      <P>On every trip to Hong Kong, Pu carried gold and foreign currency worth more than
NT$30 million, which he sometimes declared and sometimes did not, the police
suspect.</P>
      <P>According to the video footage from the airport's X-ray machines, even when Pu
declared the gold or foreign currency he was carrying, Wu did not
comprehensively check the declared items. And it was obvious that Pu was not
declaring all the valuables and money he was carrying, the police said.</P>
      <P>Based on the amount that Pu declared on two consecutive one-day trips to Hong
Kong late last year, it is estimated that he was actually carrying 74 million
Japanese yen, 860,000 Singapore dollars, 27,000 Swiss francs, 18,000 euros and
US$800, airport police said.</P>
      <P>The police estimated that Pu smuggled out at least NT$30 million worth of gold
and foreign currency on each trip, which they said means he probably took more
than NT$2 billion in money and gold out of Taiwan illegally over a period of
three years.</P>
      <P>Taiwan law stipulates that travelers are not allowed to take more than US$10,000
worth of foreign currency or gold out of the country and are required to declare
any amounts in excess of this figure to airport customs authorities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved a project Thursday to further develop the country's
renewable energy industries and to attract private investment in the sector.</P>
      <P>Under the project proposed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs over he next five
years in the development of renewable energy and will subsidize the general
installation of energy saving devices.</P>
      <P>It will also provide NT$20 billion for research and development of green energy
technologies, which is expected in turn to draw NT$200 billion in private
investment in the industry.</P>
      <P>The project will target industries that focus on solar energy, light emitting
diode (LED) lighting, wind power, biomass fuel, hydrogen power, fuel cells,
electric vehicles, energy information and communication technology.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan told reporters after a Cabinet meeting that building
Taiwan into a low-carbon society is one of the administration's priority
policies.</P>
      <P>He referred again to his pledge earlier in the month at a national energy
conference that the government will spare no effort to advance its goal of
building a "low carbon-emission homeland."</P>
      <P>The premier said he was confident that the MOEA project will help to stimulate
Taiwan's renewable energy industry and create more job opportunities in that
sector.</P>
      <P>Liu added his voice to President Ma Ying-jeou's call for the legislature to
quickly pass a renewable energy bill that has been stalled for a long time,
saying that the MOEA should push for the legislation's passage as it will
provide a legal basis for the development of the energy sector.</P>
      <P>Under a NT$500 billion four-year economic stimulus plan proposed by the Cabinet
last November, the government will spend 10 percent of the total to promote
green energy industries and to fund engineering work on renewable energy, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOEA should set up a task force to examine the difficulties that
green energy industries are facing and help them clear technical bottlenecks and
deal with investment and operating problems, the premier suggested.</P>

      <P>"It would be a round-the-clock, all-year-round task to proceed with the
investigations into the bribery scandal involving a group of generals who were
promoted en masse when former President Chen Shui-bian was in office," Chang
said at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of National Defense is resolved not to leave any stone unturned to
crack the scandal, " Chang said in response to an inquiry by Legislator Lee
Chia-chin from the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>According to the local media reports this week, prosecutors will first focus on
around 30 generals promoted by Chen, who left office last May after serving two
terms from 2000 to 2008.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Chen Chao-min told lawmakers recently that he hopes the Defense
Ministry will come up with investigative reports in three months.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, Legislator Lee criticized the military over a recent spate of
scandals, deriding that "the ROC (Republic of China) Armed Forces could put
themselves to rout from within, without China's military invasion."</P>
      <P>Chang responded to Lee by saying that it would be unfair to vilify the ROC Armed
Forces as undisciplined or lacking combative capability simply because of a few
scandals.</P>
      <P>Marine Corps Commander Lt. Gen. Hsu Shang-wen was questioned by prosecutors the
day before on suspicion of taking bribes from private suppliers.</P>
      <P>According to newspaper reports published Tuesday, prosecutors said they will
also investigate several hundred lieutenants and major generals promoted under
Chen's presidency.</P>
      <P>The investigation follows the recent indictment of a retired lieutenant general
on charges of bribery, blackmail and leaking secrets. He allegedly tried to
bribe his superiors for a promotion.</P>
      <P>In a separate case, three colonels have been indicted on corruption charges.</P>

      <P>Business at Taiwan's theme parks and resorts grew significantly in the first
quarter of this year compared to Q1 last year, the Tourism Bureau said Thursday,
attributing the growth to the government's shopping voucher program and other
promotion efforts.</P>
      <P>The latest statistics provided by 24 amusement parks and resorts in Taiwan
showed that the number of visitors in the first quarter grew by 26.21 percent
compared to the same period last year, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Some 2.23 million people visited these venues in Q1 this year, generating
revenues of NT$1.34 billion (US$39.66 million) , which represented an increase
of 12.19 percent over the same period last year, the data showed.</P>
      <P>The Formosan Aboriginal Culture Village in Nantou County, LeoFoo Village Theme
Park in Hsinchu County, Janfusun Fancy World in Yunlin County, Window on China
Theme Park in Taoyuan County and Hualien Farglory Ocean Park are the five most
popular amusement parks in Taiwan, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>"The government's shopping voucher program and related promotion programs during
the winter vacation contributed to the growth in first quarter of 2009," the
bureau stated in a press release.</P>
      <P>Some 91 percent of eligible Taiwan citizens had picked up their NT$3,600 worth
of vouchers as of Jan. 18 to pay for goods and services. The vouchers are the
business end of an NT$85.7 billion program that is part of a government economic
stimulus package.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau said that the publication of a magazine and the establishment
of a Web site to provide comprehensive information about theme parks and resorts
in Taiwan helped fuel the public's interest in these places, with some amusement
parks seeing growth of 40 percent both in the number of visitors and in revenue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't will recruit over 1,400 social workers by 2015</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) announced Wednesday that it will recruit
1,427 social workers from 2010-2015 to set up a more comprehensive social
service network for the country.</P>
      <P>The announcement came amid sharp criticism from society for Taiwan's  lack of a
sufficient  social service mechanism  and professional social workers to help
troubled families, after two girls were abused to death by their fathers in the
past week.</P>
      <P>The two girls died on two consecutive days, shocking the entire country. One was
a 10-month-old baby who suffered severe burns after her father threw her into a
pot of boiling water during an argument with her mother. She died Tuesday
morning. The other was a 2-year-old who died Tuesday evening after her father
beat her severely with a broom for playing with water while he was trying to
take a nap.</P>
      <P>Since the first death occurred, the MOI has pledged to devote more funding and
resources to identifying more high-risk families, including those with parents
who abuse drugs or alcohol or frequently fight.</P>
      <P>To help prevent recurrence of such tragedies, the MOI said in a statement that
it will hire another 1,427 social workers to serve communities throughout Taiwan
during the six-year period.</P>
      <P>Before that aim is achieved, the MOI said it will continue helping local
governments fill the gap by adding new members to their current lineup of social
workers.</P>
      <P>To date,  320 child  protection  social  workers  and 190 anti-domestic violence
and sexual assault workers have been stationed in localities across the country
in the past year.</P>
      <P>The ministry also uses a portion of earnings from the state lotteries to help
promote programs directed at helping women, the elderly, the physically and
mentally challenged, as well as 29,000 children in high-risk families.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, 193 social workers have been dispatched  to
local governments  across the country with the lotteries' earnings, and 265 for
the whole of 2008, it said.</P>
      <P>But this is widely believed to be insufficient given Taiwan's population of 23
million people.</P>

      <P>Have you ever had the experience of seeing your mobile phone flying out of its
holder when you turn your car around? If you do, a "sticker phone" may be your
solution.</P>
      <P>The design by Liu Hsiang-ling, a student from National Taiwan University of
Science and Technology (NTUST) , is one of the winners of the iF concept award
2009 announced recently by the Hanover-based International Forum Design GmbH
(iF).</P>
      <P>The mobile phone made of polysiloxane and installed with solar panels on the
back was born exactly out of Liu's own driving experience. The device, which can
be stuck to a window, will stay put when you drive, and even better, it can be
recharged by absorbing sunlight.</P>
      <P>"I drive everyday to school, and I have always had the idea of having my mobile
phone stick to the window glass, just like a doll," Liu said.</P>
      <P>The iF concept award, which has been held for the second year since 2008, is an
international competition for new talent that is open to students in the fields
of design and architecture.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,221 concepts and ideas were submitted by students from 39 countries
this year.</P>
      <P>Nine of the concepts and ideas contributed by Taiwanese students are included in
the list of the "Best 100" announced last month by iF, making the country one of
the biggest winners of the annual event.</P>
      <P>Of these nine designs, three are by students from NTUST. The university has been
rated second by the "iF University Ranking" that is based on the performance of
contestants in the iF concept award over a period of three years.</P>
      <P>The other two NTUST winners, besides the "sticker phone", are "eat clean"
tableware by Yeh Ming-hong and Lai Chung-ping, as well as "rocking chair" by Kuo
Tsu-jung.</P>
      <P>The "eat clean" design is intended as a solution for people who feel
uncomfortable about using cutlery which has been in contact with the table top.
The design, which combines the special shape and weight principle of a seesaw,
enables the parts of the cutlery in contact with the mouth to always stay away
from the table top whichever way the cutlery is placed.</P>
      <P>The "rocking chair, " meanwhile, enables users to adjust their sitting positions
to increase fun and comfort.</P>
      <P>Another of this year's winner is "braille scanner" by Wang Fu-hua from Tainan
National University of the Arts.</P>
      <P>The design, a mobile phone intended for the visually impaired which can convert
braille into audible speech, is listed among the first 28 of the "Best 100" that
shared 30,000 euros in prize money.</P>
      <P>Others Taiwanese designs on the "Best 100" list also include the "so sweet"
clinical thermometer jointly contributed by Hsu Chun-chia from National Chiao
Tung University in Hsinchu City, Liu Rong-cheng and Chang Chia-wei from Ming-Chi
University of Technology (MCUT) in Taipei County, and Chen You-ren from National
Taipei University of Technology.</P>
      <P>The design turns clinical thermometers into lollipops, whose sweet coating melts
on contact with saliva, giving users a pleasant experience while having their
temperature taken.</P>
      <P>The "rabbit hanger" by Yeh Hsin-hua from Shu-Te University in Kaohsiung County
is not only a unique clothes hanger but also a useful tool for putting on
clothes and shoes. On one end of the hanger is a hole for doing up a zipper and
on the other, a shoe puller.</P>
      <P>The "freedle" by Mao Chia-lin, Huang Cheng-jia and Li Pei-sin from National
Kaohsiung Normal University is a needle equipped with an eye made of soft
flexible nylon, allowing the thread to be threaded more easily. Also, the
needle's fluorescent material makes it easier to find if it gets dropped on the
floor or somewhere dark.</P>
      <P>The "plug for visually" by Lin Chia-hsiang from Taichung-based Chaoyang
University of Technology involves the creation of tracks leading into the plug
socket to allow the visually impaired to insert the plug into the socket more
easily.</P>
      <P>The "so water" by Lin Yang-an and Liao Ching-chan from MCUT and Tzeng Jiuan-mau
from NTUST is shower fittings with a new style of faucet that can help users
avoid being splashed with water as a result of forgetting to switch the shower
over before using the tap.</P>
      <P>When using the apparatus, users need to pull the pipe down when they want to use
the tap, and then pull it up again to connect with the pipe of the shower nozzle
when they want to take a shower.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>All Taiwan's traffic lights, numbering about 700,000, are expected to be energy-
saving LED installations by 2011 when a comprehensive project to develop green
energy industries is implemented,  the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>If the plan to install light emitting diode (LED) traffic lights is fully
carried out by 2011, Taiwan will be the first country in the world to have LED
traffic lights installed nationwide, said Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin
Chii-ming at a Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>The plan will be part of the government's ambitious green energy industries
development project to be implemented by 2015.</P>
      <P>The project is expected to turn the green energy sector into the country's new
NT$1 trillion (US$29.59 billion) industrial sector, following in the footsteps
of Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturing industry, which took off in the 1980s
and optoelectronic industry, which was launched in the 1990s, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>"By 2015, the green energy sector is expected to create 110,000 jobs in Taiwan
each year," the minister said.</P>
      <P>Earlier Thursday, the Executive Yuan approved the project to further develop the
country's green energy manufacturing industry, or environmentally-friendly and
energy-saving products and technologies.</P>
      <P>Under the project proposed by the MOEA, the administration will invest NT$25
billion over the next five years to develop renewable energy and will subsidize
the general installation of energy-saving devices in government offices,
business and private homes.</P>
      <P>It will also provide NT$20 billion for research and development of green energy
technologies, which is expected to in turn draw NT$200 billion in private
investment in the industry.</P>
      <P>The project will focus on solar energy, LED lighting, wind power, biomass fuel,
hydrogen power, fuel cells, electric vehicles, energy information and
communication technology.</P>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said at the Cabinet meeting that building Taiwan  into
a low-carbon  emitting  society  is one of the administration's priorities.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin read the story of a 12-year-old boy's brave fight
against cancer to an audience of 90 elementary school students at the Red
Theater in Taipei Thursday to mark World Reading Day.</P>
      <P>The story, titled "The Thing of Which I am Most Proud, " describes how Yuan
Chao-tung, a six-grader at the city's Huai Sheng Elementary School, is battling
cancer.</P>
      <P>Yuan, who has undergone surgery three times, was present at the event and said
he believes that some day he will eventually recover from the disease.</P>
      <P>"After getting through these hard times, the situation will get better," Yuan
said optimistically.</P>
      <P>Yuan said that every time he feels fear, he prays and tries to remember words of
encouragement offered to him by others or remind himself to be brave by
emulating other people who have successfully beaten cancer.</P>
      <P>Hau noted that he himself has twice undergone surgery and admitted that he also
felt fear at the time. He expressed his admiration at the way Yuan is keeping up
his brave fight against his illness despite his young age.</P>
      <P>The mayor also praised Yuan as an influential writer with the capacity to
clearly and fully describe episodes from his daily life, and asked him whether
that is because he reads regularly.</P>
      <P>Yuan replied that he reads on a broad range of subject matter and recalled that
after his last bout of surgery he could not wait to buy the long-anticipated
historical novel "The Conqueror's Story."</P>
      <P>In a show of encouragement, Hau presented Yuan with the historic novel "The
Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and a set of baseball cards.</P>

      <P>A Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) official who had traveled to
Beijing with five colleagues to attend meetings on cross-Taiwan Strait
cooperation in fighting drug crime died suddenly early Thursday at his hotel in
the Chinese capital.</P>
      <P>Preliminary investigations attributed the death of 55-year-old Huang Chien-

      <P>The MJIB has arranged for Huang's family to travel to Beijing to handle the

Xiamen April 20 at the invitation of the Xiamen city government for a meeting on
joint efforts to crack down on cross-strait drug crime.</P>
      <P>The group proceeded to Beijing two days later for a meeting with their Beijing-

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan researchers extract brain-boosting nutrient from squid skin</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local research team has successfully extracted a brain-boosting nutrient from
cheap squid skin that can improve memory and enhance learning ability, a
fisheries official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Researchers at the Fisheries Research Institute under the Council of Agriculture
have been able to extract PL-DHA (phospholipid docosahexaenoic acid), a memory
enhancing substance, from the skin of squid, the official explained.</P>
      <P>According to the official, PL-DHA is better than TG-DHA, another form of
docosahexaenoic acid that is commonly found in deep-sea fish oil, in inhibiting
degradation of the intellect because it can cross the blood brain barrier and be
absorbed directly into the brain.</P>
      <P>The researchers have also discovered that the PL-DHA squid extract is effective
in reviving neural cells and enhancing the content of three oxidation-resistant
enzymes -- GSH, CAT and SOD -- as well as moderating free radical-induced
oxidative damage to neural cells, thus slowing down the accumulation of plaque
and tangles in brain cells.</P>
      <P>Quoting medical reports, the official said Alzheimer's and other senile dementia
diseases are associated with the accumulation of plaque and tangles in brain.</P>
      <P>At present, the official went on, more than 24 million people suffer from senile
dementia, with the rate of new cases growing at 4.6 million every year.</P>
      <P>"This means that one person in the world falls victim to Alzheimer's every six
minutes, " the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan boasts abundant squid catches, with annual output reaching between
150,000 tons and 200,000 tons, the official continued, adding that by-products
from squid processing accounts for 35 percent of the total catch, with squid
skins making up about 15 percent of the by-products.</P>
      <P>As squid skins are tough and unpalatable, they are usually processed into powder
that is used as an additive to animal and livestock feed.</P>
      <P>Following the discovery of PL-DHA in squid skins, the official said, the
Fisheries Research Institute will step up the development of squid skin-based
health products to enhance its market value.</P>

      <P>Cash donations have continued to pour in to cash-strapped St. Mary's Hospital in
Taitung City, eastern Taiwan over the past 10 days, with the cash far exceeding
the amount needed to keep it from closing down, a hospital source said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Since it launched a fundraising drive just 10 days ago to help it reorganize
from a general hospital to a non-profit health institution to allow it to
survive, the hospital had received donations exceeding NT$82 million (US$2.43
million)  as of Thursday,  including a NT$100,000 donation from President Ma
Ying-jeou.</P>
      <P>St. Mary's Hospital, which for many years has been dedicated to providing health
care to the underprivileged in eastern Taiwan, had been hoping to raise by
November the NT$31.42 million it needs by law to transform itself into a non-
profit health care provider, which would allow it to raise funds from donations
and continue operating.</P>
      <P>Although the hospital has received six individual  medical contribution awards
in its five decades of operation and was the only health institution in the
country to receive the prestigious national Group Medical Contribution Award
last year, St. Mary's has always struggled financially and its economic straits
had worsened even further since last year, prompting it to seek to transfer its
legal status to that of a non-profit health institution.</P>
      <P>Becoming a non-profit entity would allow the hospital, set up by foreign
missionaries 48 years ago, to cushion its losses with private donations and
other public funding contributions.</P>
      <P>Department of Health Minister Yeh Chin-chuan visited St. Mary's that same day to
tell the hospital authorities that his department wants to help solve the
hospital's problems pertaining to the land value increment tax, and to tell them
that the NT$31.4 million legal requirement for the establishment of a non-profit
health care institution could be met by using the value of the hospital's
buildings and properties as collateral.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will visit Central America twice between late May and
July to attend presidential inaugurations in two of Taiwan's allies in the
region, political sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the president's travel plan, he will depart for a week-long Central
America visit in late May that will take him to El Salvador to attend the
inauguration of President-elect Mauricio Funes and to several of Taiwan's other
allies in the region.</P>
      <P>In July, the sources said, Ma is scheduled to visit Panama for three to four
days, mainly to attend the inauguration of that country's next president.</P>
      <P>Ma made his first overseas tour as Taiwan's head of state last August when he
visited the Dominican Republic and Paraguay. For that trip, Ma used a regularly
scheduled commercial flight to the United States, from where he flew to Central
America via chartered plane.</P>
      <P>For the forthcoming two visits, the sources said, the president will fly on
chartered flights on the entire journeys, with no decision yet made on which
carrier will be contracted to provide the flights.</P>
      <P>On customary transit stops in the United States, the sources went on, safety,
convenience and comfort will remain the top guiding principles in all relevant
arrangements.</P>
      <P>Central and South America and the Caribbean  are Taiwan's diplomatic stronghold,
with many of its 23 diplomatic allies located there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sources went on, Ma is also likely to attend a summit meeting

or September in the Solomon Islands.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan researchers extract brain-boosting nutrient from squid skin</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>A local research team has successfully extracted a brain-boosting nutrient from
cheap squid skin that can improve memory and enhance learning ability, a
fisheries official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Researchers at the Fisheries Research Institute under the Council of Agriculture
have been able to extract PL-DHA (phospholipid docosahexaenoic acid), a memory
enhancing substance, from the skin of squid, the official explained.</P>
      <P>According to the official, PL-DHA is better than TG-DHA, another form of
docosahexaenoic acid that is commonly found in deep-sea fish oil, in inhibiting
degradation of the intellect because it can cross the blood brain barrier and be
absorbed directly into the brain.</P>
      <P>The researchers have also discovered that the PL-DHA squid extract is effective
in reviving neural cells and enhancing the content of three oxidation-resistant
enzymes -- GSH, CAT and SOD -- as well as moderating free radical-induced
oxidative damage to neural cells, thus slowing down the accumulation of plaque
and tangles in brain cells.</P>
      <P>Quoting medical reports, the official said Alzheimer's and other senile dementia
diseases are associated with the accumulation of plaque and tangles in brain.</P>
      <P>At present, the official went on, more than 24 million people suffer from senile
dementia, with the rate of new cases growing at 4.6 million every year.</P>
      <P>"This means that one person in the world falls victim to Alzheimer's every six
minutes, " the official said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan boasts abundant squid catches, with annual output reaching between
150,000 tons and 200,000 tons, the official continued, adding that by-products
from squid processing accounts for 35 percent of the total catch, with squid
skins making up about 15 percent of the by-products.</P>
      <P>As squid skins are tough and unpalatable, they are usually processed into powder
that is used as an additive to animal and livestock feed.</P>
      <P>Following the discovery of PL-DHA in squid skins, the official said, the
Fisheries Research Institute will step up the development of squid skin-based
health products to enhance its market value.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will visit Central America twice between late May and
July to attend presidential inaugurations in two of Taiwan's allies in the
region, political sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to the president's travel plan, he will depart for a week-long Central
America visit in late May that will take him to El Salvador to attend the
inauguration of President-elect Mauricio Funes and to several of Taiwan's other
allies in the region.</P>
      <P>In July, the sources said, Ma is scheduled to visit Panama for three to four
days, mainly to attend the inauguration of that country's next president.</P>
      <P>Ma made his first overseas tour as Taiwan's head of state last August when he
visited the Dominican Republic and Paraguay. For that trip, Ma used a regularly
scheduled commercial flight to the United States, from where he flew to Central
America via chartered plane.</P>
      <P>For the forthcoming two visits, the sources said, the president will fly on
chartered flights on the entire journeys, with no decision yet made on which
carrier will be contracted to provide the flights.</P>
      <P>On customary transit stops in the United States, the sources went on, safety,
convenience and comfort will remain the top guiding principles in all relevant
arrangements.</P>
      <P>Central and South America and the Caribbean  are Taiwan's diplomatic stronghold,
with many of its 23 diplomatic allies located there.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sources went on, Ma is also likely to attend a summit meeting
between the leaders of Taiwan and its South Pacific allies to be held in August
or September in the Solomon Islands.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's export sector revitalizing: MOEA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The decline in Taiwan's export orders has not worsened further since hitting
bottom in January, indicating that the export sector is gradually revitalizing,
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The latest MOEA statistics show that export orders amounted to US$23.94 billion
in March, representing an increase of 18.99 percent from the previous month and
a decrease of 24.29 percent from the same month of last year.</P>
      <P>The year-on-year decline marks a slight increase compared with February, when
the year-on-year decline was 22.27 percent, but was noticeably narrower compared
with January, when a year-on-year plunge of 41.67 percent was recorded,
according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>Huang Chi-shih, chief of the MOEA's Department of Statistics, said the
development might be a sign of the revitalization of the export sector and is
thanks mainly to the restoration of demand from China -- one of Taiwan's major
export markets.</P>
      <P>In March, orders from China accounted for 25.7 percent of the total orders
received, putting China back into position as Taiwan's top export market for the
first time since October 2008, when the position was replaced by the United
States, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>According to Lin Chu-chia, an economics professor at National Chengchi
University, China's latest economic stimulus measures to encourage home
appliance purchases by rural consumers have played an important role in
reinvigorating Taiwan's export sector.</P>
      <P>Lin said that during a recent visit to China when he met with Taiwanese
businessmen based in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing, most of them shared the
view that the economic situation has been showing slight improvement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the MOEA-compiled index for industrial production outlook stood at
51.26 in March, the first time since June 2008 it has exceeded 50, which signals
a revival in demand, Huang said.</P>
      <P>An index of over 50 is considered an indication that production will increase in
the coming month.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, many manufacturers of computer and electronic parts and
components are expecting their restored production capacity utilization to
continue into June and July, thanks to a recent influx of rush orders and short-
term orders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New routes for regular cross-strait flights will be worked out: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>New routes for regularly scheduled flights across the Taiwan Strait will be
discussed during the upcoming round of cross-strait talks scheduled for April
26, Lai Shin-yuan, the head of the Cabinet-level Mainland Council Affairs (MAC)
said Friday.</P>
      <P>"Both northern and southern routes must be finalized during the talks between
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Chen Yunlin,
president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS),
slated to open in Nanjing Sunday," Lai said.</P>
      <P>The MAC coordinates Taiwan's policy toward China and oversees SEF operations.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a radio interview, Lai said that as far as Taiwan is concerned,
the greater the number of regularly  scheduled cross-strait flights set up the
better, but added that it will be difficult to increase the number of cross-
strait flights further on the existing flight routes.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Taiwanese negotiators hope that during the upcoming talks they
will achieve a target of increasing the number of flights from the existing 180
weekly flights to 375, Lai said an eventual 500 flights per week is their
minimum demand.</P>
      <P>"The SEF negotiators will try their utmost to push back the boundaries," she
continued.</P>
      <P>The third round of Chiang-Chen talks will discuss four issues -- regularly
scheduled cross-strait flights, financial cooperation, tackling cross-strait
crime and providing legal assistance, and opening Taiwan to investment from
China.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's opening to Chinese capital and investment, Lai said the Ministry of
Economic Affairs will adopt a "positive list, " although the opening will be
gradual and categories involving national security will not be included on the
list.</P>
      <P>"The list, as well as opening procedures, will be made known after the talks,
followed by fact-finding trips to Taiwan by Chinese investors," she announced.</P>
      <P>Relevant regulations should be worked out by the third quarter of this year, Lai
added, although she pointed out that it is still not known exactly when Chinese
capital will be allowed to enter Taiwan, as this "will depend on how Beijing's
policy unfolds. "</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier demands strengthened social welfare network</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan directed relevant government agencies Thursday to form a
task force to map out a project to strengthen the social welfare network in
light of a recent increase in the number of deaths caused by child abuse,
according to a press release issued by the Government Information Office later
that day.</P>
      <P>Liu was quoted as saying at a Cabinet meeting that although the establishment of
a social security network by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has attained
initial positive results from the Chinese New Year holiday until now, there are
still some blind spots in the network, given the increased number of child abuse
cases reported in recent days.</P>
      <P>The premier demanded that social workers should single out violent families and
set up a database on such families. He also said health education, covering
methods to relieve stress, deal with drug and alcohol abuse problems, and
maintain mental health, should be included in the network.</P>
      <P>Touching on social education, Liu said teachers and social workers should keep
in close contact with community leaders and security guards and conduct frequent
family visits.</P>
      <P>In addition, providing guidance for newlywed couples and new parents, as well as
strengthening reporting systems for child abuse cases and campus bullying,
should be included among the high priority tasks, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>Liu cited statistics showing that over the past five years, 56 children have
died from abuse, 66 percent of whom died at the hands of their parents, 17
percent of whom were killed by a cohabiting partner of one of the child's
parents, and 9 percent of whom lost their lives at the hands of babysitters.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 101 children died when their parents committed suicide and killed
their children at the same time during the five-year period, according to Liu,
who said the biggest threat to children's lives normally comes from those
closest to them.</P>
      <P>He further said the government should make every effort to encourage people to
pay attention to or report child abuse cases.</P>
      <P>MOI Deputy Minister Lin Chung-sun said Thursday after the Cabinet meeting that
"the act of child abuse or domestic violence is not merely a domestic affair but
actually a crime, " while calling on the public to call the 24-hour hotlines 113
and 1957 when they discover cases of child abuse.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the MOI, in an effort to help those in need, has stepped up
promotion of the 113 hotline for the protection of women and children and the
1957 national welfare hotline, as well as the reporting systems used by local
governments around the country.</P>
      <P>According to MOI official Chien Hui-chuan, the number of calls made to the 113
hotline reporting child abuse has been on the rise over the past few years. She
said 13,703 children and juveniles have been rescued, provided with emergency
relief or taken into care after government intervention.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that he wants the Taiwanese negotiators at
the upcoming round of cross-Taiwan Strait talks to seek solutions to issues
related to the people's livelihoods before tackling more difficult questions.</P>
      <P>"Try to solve the easier ones first, in the same way that elementary school
students solve math questions, " Ma exhorted the delegation to the talks slated
to open in Nanjing Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a brief meeting at the Presidential Office with
members of the delegation under the leadership of Chiang Pin-kung,  chairman of
the quasi-official  intermediary Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), before its
departure for China slated for the following day.</P>
      <P>The upcoming talks between Chiang and his Chinese counterpart, Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin, are expected
to focus on four issues -- regularly scheduled cross-strait flights, financial
cooperation,  tackling cross-strait crime and providing legal assistance, and
opening Taiwan to investment from China.</P>
      <P>"We should first seek to settle these issues and should not rush our pace, " Ma
said, adding that once technical issues pertaining to the livelihoods and
wellbeing of the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are solved, a new,
more trusting atmosphere will be created across the strait.</P>
      <P>"Increasing mutual trust between the two sides is the greatest harvest that this
administration has achieved over the past year, " Ma added.</P>
      <P>This newly achieved mutual trust exists not only in cross-strait relations but
has also been demonstrated in relations with Japan and the United States, Ma
went on.</P>
      <P>He expressed his appreciation to both the SEF and ARATS for their agreement to
jointly tackle crime-fighting issues, saying that the pragmatism displayed by
the two groups on technical affairs is worthy of praise.</P>
      <P>He also praised Chiang for his strenuous efforts to build mutual trust across
the strait.</P>
      <P>In related news, Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman Sean Chen said a day
earlier that talks on the signing of a loose, wide-ranging agreement on banking,
securities, futures and insurance will be high on the agenda of the upcoming
talks.</P>
      <P>Chen said such an agreement is expected to be forged by the negotiators from the
two sides, but will not take the form of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) as
had been widely speculated.</P>
      <P>"A cross-strait financial MOU will be struck later, after an agreement has been
signed first upon which an MOU can be based," Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, on the topic of the government's plans to allow Chinese investment in
Taiwan, Minister of Economic Affairs Yiin Chii-ming said the two sides have
agreed to include the issue on the agenda but will not make any resolution on it
due to the complexity of the subject.</P>
      <P>Yiin said the Ministry of Economic Affairs will adopt a "positive list" to the
liberalization of Chinese investment, but will implement it in a gradual, step-
by-step manner.</P>
      <P>"There will still be caps on each category of the industries opened to Chinese
capital initially, and further opening will be adopted only once the initial
plan is found to be proceeding satisfactorily," he said.</P>
      <P>Fu Dong-cheng, a vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Council Affairs
(MAC) which coordinates Taiwan's China policy and oversees SEF operations, said
there has been consensus reached by the administration that the cap on Chinese
investment in Taiwanese companies will be 30 percent of their total investment
capital.</P>

key barometer, advancing 5.53 points, or 0.09 percent, to close at 5,880.77.</P>
      <P>Buoyed by Wall Street's rise overnight and hopes that the third round of talks
between Taiwan and China this weekend will help the economy, the local bourse
opened higher at 5,913.13 and rose to a high of 5,987.23 early in the session
before falling back to as low as 5,824.42.</P>
      <P>A total of 6.52 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of NT$144.46
billion (US$3.91 billion).</P>
      <P>Taiwan's stock market added 125.39 points, or 2.18 percent, this week and has
risen sharply from a low of 4,242.61 points recorded on January 20. It is the
world's second best-performing market this year, trailing only the Shanghai
market.</P>
      <P>Four of the eight major stock categories gained ground, with paper and pulp
stocks moving up the most at 4.0 percent. Construction shares advanced 1.9
percent, banking and financial issues gained 1.1 percent, and textile shares
rose 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Four other major stock categories lost ground, with cement stocks moving down
the most at 1.9 percent. Foodstuff shares fell 0.6 percent, and machinery and
electronics shares and plastics and chemicals stocks dropped 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Gainers outnumbered losers 1,154 to 968,  with 170 stocks remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth NT$1.64 billion.</P>
      <P>One institutional investor told the Central News Agency that the weekend's talks
between Taiwan and China have already been factored into share prices, and
without further positive news to buoy the market next week, the Taiex could fall
to 5,600 on profit taking.</P>
      <P>If, however, turnover falls to below NT$100 billion per session but the market
stays firm, and margin trading does not noticeably increase, it could mark the
start of a new rally, the analyst said.</P>

in critical condition, and two others injured, according to the city's fire
department.</P>
      <P>One passenger, 46-year-old Li Fuqing, was cut in half and killed immediately
when the boom smashed through the back of the bus as it was heading toward
Taipei 101 in Taipei's upscale Xinyi shopping district.</P>
      <P>Another tourist, 57-year-old Wang Bingkun, died after being taken to the
Zhongxiao branch of Taipei Municipal Hospital. Zhang Shiguang, 63, suffered out-
of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) before arriving at Taipei Medical University
and is in critical condition.</P>
      <P>The bus was carrying a total of 27 people at the time, including 25 Chinese
tourists, and a Taiwanese tour guide and driver.</P>
      <P>Police cordoned off the area where the accident occurred, and Taipei prosecutors
are on the scene to investigate.</P>
      <P>A preliminary investigation  found that a small crane was operating a mid-sized

    <HEADLINE>President instructs SEF to talk about ECFA with China: negotiator</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
04/24/09  18:17:32
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou instructed the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) to
discuss with China the signing of a cross-Taiwan Strait economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) in upcoming talks, SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who will be leading the SEF delegation to the third round of cross-
strait talks slated to open in Nanjing, China Sunday, made the remarks at news
conference held after meeting with President Ma, before the delegation's
departure for China Saturday.</P>
      <P>The upcoming talks between Chiang and his Chinese counterpart, Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin, are expected
to focus on expanding cross-strait flight services,  paving the way for
financial cooperation,  tackling cross-strait crime and providing legal
assistance, as well as opening Taiwan to investment from China.</P>
      <P>The talks are a continuation of a significant warming of relations between the
two former rivals since Taiwan in 2008 elected new President Ma Ying-jeou, whose
administration has made it a priority to ease tensions and improve relations
with China.</P>
      <P>Although the controversial ECFA - which Ma's administration has said is similar
to a free trade agreement with no political strings attached - is not on the
agenda of the talks, it is an issue that the president feels strongly about.</P>
      <P>Ma has argued that if Taiwan does not sign such an agreement with China, it
risks being marginalized and losing its competitiveness as China and neighboring
countries are about to sign FTAs and as Beijing continues to block Taiwan's
efforts to reach FTA agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>Critics, however, warned that the agreement jeopardize Taiwan's sovereignty,
make Taiwan too economically dependent and linked to China, and lead to an
influx of Chinese capital and goods.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, the President said that currently there are still some problems
that are unhelpful to the already improved cross-strait air links, including
ticket fares for direct charter flights being too high and the number of flights
being insufficient to meet the demand, according to Chiang.</P>
      <P>"The President also wants me to relay his greetings to the people on the Chinese
mainland," Chiang added.</P>
      <P>A number of trailblazing principles have been reached in the last two rounds of
SEF-ARATS talks, held last year, and the preparatory meeting on the third round
of talks, said Chiang. These include consensus that both sides should be
pragmatic on cross-strait relations and build relations in a gradual, step-by-
step manner.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS have also agreed that China and Taiwan will first engage in talks
on economic issues and temporarily shelve political issues,  beginning with the
easier problems,  rather than the challenging ones, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The two intermediary bodies agreed during previous talks that SEF and ARATS will
meet regularly twice a year, with each side playing host to one meeting
alternately.</P>
      <P>On Chiang's  entourage  will  be SEF  Vice  Chairman  and Secretary-General Kao
Koong-lian and Fu Dong-chen, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level  Mainland
Affairs Council,  which coordinates Taiwan's policy toward China and oversees
SEF operations.</P>
      <P>Other officials on the 22-member delegation will also include Deputy Justice
Minister Huang Shih-ming and Financial Supervisory Commission Deputy Chairwoman
Lee Chi-chu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Dependence on National Health Insurance increasing</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  24  (CNA)
04/24/09  18:25:51

    <TEXT>
      <P>Individuals  enrolled in Taiwan's compulsory National Health Insurance system
averaged 15 outpatient visits in 2008, a record high since the program was
launched in 1995, according to statistics released Friday by the Bureau of
National Health Insurance (BNHI).</P>
      <P>The bureau said the public's use of National Health Insurance resources has
increased over the years due to the rapid graying of the country's population.</P>
      <P>Of all types of outpatient visits, those made to treat kidney disease have
recorded the fastest growth, having risen 13.9 percent over the past 10 years,
said BHNI Vice President Lee Cheng-hua during a bureau meeting.</P>
      <P>Sharp growth in outpatient visits for breast cancer (10.09 percent) and
hypertension and diabetes (6 percent) was also seen, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the demand for outpatient visits for chronic diseases will
further increase as Taiwan's population continues to age.</P>
      <P>Teng Hsi-hua, a spokesman for a civic group monitoring the National Health
Insurance program, suspected, however, that the increase in the number of
outpatient visits reflected an abuse of medical resources.</P>
      <P>For example, Teng said, patients who want to get a checkup are usually required
to make a total of three outpatient visits -- one to schedule the examination,
one to undergo the checkup, and a third one to get the results of tests
performed.</P>
      <P>To avoid wasting medical resources, Teng suggested that hospitals should only
require patients showing abnormalities in their tests to return for further
diagnosis while notifying those with normal results by telephone, e-mail or
postcard.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TMC project will not fall through: economics minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Yiin Chii-ming said Friday that the government is determined
to revamp the country's struggling dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chip
industry, despite rumors that the head of a proposed takeover company has
decided to quit.</P>
      <P>Yiin told reporters he has not heard from John Hsuan, appointed convener of the
government-proposed DRAM company Taiwan Memory Co. (TMC) , about his alleged
attempt to quit his job, but that he will meet with Hsuan first thing Saturday
to cheer him up.</P>
      <P>Yiin said despite negative rumors and remarks, he is confident that Hsuan will
go ahead with his mission of heading a team to establish TMC in collaboration
with Japanese chipmaker Elpida Memory Inc. so that the government can
consolidate selected technology providers and domestic memory chip makers and
revamp the industry.</P>
      <P>"The TMC project will not fall through and the government is resolved to carry
it on," Yiin said.</P>
      <P>He said Hsuan, honorary vice chairman of United Microelectronics Corp. who is
authorized by the administration to oversee TMC's launch, has laid a sound
foundation for TMC so far, marking a good beginning for the ambitious DRAM
revitalization plan.</P>
      <P>Yiin called for the Taiwanese  public to give Hsuan more encouragement than
criticism and allow him more room to maneuver.</P>
      <P>Elpida Memory Inc. of Japan agreed on April 1 to join the soon-to-be-established
TMC as a major strategic cooperation partner.</P>
      <P>Welcoming Elpida's commitment, Hsuan said back then that progress made in
negotiations on the content and terms of cooperation had been smooth.</P>
      <P>At that time, Yiin also said that Elpida's involvement does not preclude the
participation of another global DRAM giant, United States-based Micron Co., as a
key partner.</P>
      <P>Micron Co., however, announced on April 9 that it will not cooperate with TMC,
but looks forward to more support from Taiwan's government.  Micron Co., a
leading DRAM technology provider, which has long been a key technology provider
for Nanya and Inotera, both of which are affiliates of Taiwan's giant Formosa
Plastics Group., said it has decided instead to further reinforce its long-term
cooperation with Nanya Technology and Inotera Memories in research and
development of advanced DRAM technology.</P>
      <P>When Yiin projected the new company's role on March 5, he suggested it would
develop its own core technologies to boost the local DRAM sector's
competitiveness and said it would also set up a research and development center,
develop a capacity-consolidation platform and centralize sales functions.</P>
      <P>The TMC-Elpida tie-up has been seen as a positive step forward in consolidating
the local DRAM chip industry, which has long taken a back seat technologically
to South Korea's DRAM sector.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan-based DRAMeXchange Technology Inc., Asia's biggest spot
market for memory chips, local makers held a 23.2 percent share of the global
market in terms of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2008.</P>
      <P>South Korea led the industry worldwide as Samsung Electronics Co. controlled
24.5 percent and Hynix Semiconductor Inc. 20.4 percent of the global market.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan reaffirmed the government's determination Friday to push
three draft "green bills, " seen as crucial to developing Taiwan's renewable
energy industry, through the Legislative Yuan by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Liu repeated the pledge during his visit to Motech Industrial Inc., Taiwan's
largest solar cell manufacturer, in Tainan County, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also stressed that the Cabinet will make every effort to get the legislature
to pass a long-stalled renewable energy bill -- one of the three green bills --
in its current session to secure the future development of alternative energy
development in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The other two measures the government hopes to pass by the end of the year
include energy tax and greenhouse gas reduction bills.</P>
      <P>The passage of the renewable energy bill, the administration's top priority,
will provide a legal basis for establishing a mechanism encouraging the
procurement and production of renewable energy, establishing  viable market
prices,  and removing  hurdles  to alternative energy development.</P>
      <P>Lin and others in the government have repeatedly urged the legislature recently
to pass the legislation.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet has made solar energy the cornerstone of its green energy plan
approved Thursday and will develop the solar industry by encouraging technology
breakthroughs, forging a better environment for solar energy, making crucial
investments, and promoting exports and domestic demand, Liu said.</P>
      <P>During Liu's visit, Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-jhih urged him and the
Executive Yuan to make more farmland available to the photovoltaic industry on
which they can build facilities.</P>
      <P>Liu responded cautiously, saying the problem is complicated and that the
government needs more time to figure out how to deal with it. He promised,
however, that the issue would be dealt with.</P>
      <P>The government is "dead serious this time" he said.</P>
      <P>At Motech, Liu and the company's chairman, Simon Tsuo, exchanged views on the
solar cell industry's fundamentals, current bottlenecks in the industry, and
government incentives for the emerging sector.</P>
      <P>Tsuo suggested the government establish a national certification mechanism for
solar generation systems and help integrate domestic photovoltaic operators to
make inroads into the international market, reflecting his concern that the
industry was dangerously concentrated on solar cell production.</P>
      <P>At a cross-Taiwan Strait forum on solar technology in Taipei last month, Tsuo
said Taiwanese solar firms were running a risk by focusing primarily on cell and
wafer manufacturing with a limited presence in both the upstream raw material
market and the downstream application market.</P>
      <P>Liu responded that the government will provide assistance to the sector,
including establishing a green industry service team to help tackle problems
challenging local solar companies.</P>
      <P>According  to Motech,  the company was the eighth largest manufacturer of solar
cells in the world in 2008, with an output of 272 MW of crystalline silicon
solar cells.</P>

      <P>International express courier service DHL inaugurated  its  new  operational
center  in Taiwan  Taoyuan International Airport during a ceremony Friday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the inauguration ceremony, Vice Premier Chiu Cheng- hsiung said that
the center's opening is expected to facilitate trans-national cooperation in
express delivery services from Taiwan to all over the world and benefit Taiwan's
export sector.</P>
      <P>Citing as an example, Chiu said many German people love luxury sedans made in
Sweden, while many Swedish people like Germany's BMW automobiles, and only
through transactions between the two countries, could their people obtain what
they want at a low cost.</P>
      <P>Likewise, Chiu said that Taiwan, as an export-oriented country because of its
small domestic market, relies on cooperation with international companies, like
DHL, to efficiently deliver goods to other countries around the globe.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the vice premier added that he hopes DHL can further expand its
investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jerry Hsu, president of DHL Greater China, said that DHL has great
confidence in Taiwan's market and therefore decided to invest an additional
NT$210 million (US$6.2 million)  for the construction of the new Taiwan
logistics center aimed at providing Taiwanese  enterprises  with  complete
solutions for  goods transportation to the global market via the DHL network.</P>
      <P>DHL handled some 3.3 million pieces of cargo in Taiwan last year. The new center
is expected to handle three times the previous capacity, according to Stephen
Fenwick, senior vice president of operations for DHL Express Asia Pacific.</P>
      <P>The new center covers 13,515 square meters, about four times the floor space of
its old one. With the center's opening, DHL will be able to handle 11,000 pieces
per hour, three times the previous capacity of 3,600 pieces per hour, Fenwick
added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan WiMAX licensee Global Mobile Corp. announced  Friday it has signed a
cooperative  agreement with U.S.-based Clearwire Corp. to strengthen the WiMAX
network it is preparing to install in the Hsinchu area in northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Global Mobile Chairwoman Rosemary W. Ho said after signing the pact with
Clearwire Chairman Barry West that her company looks forward to attracting more
than 1 million customers to its WiMAX service over the next five years.</P>
      <P>Ho believes that the partnership with Clearwire, a leading provider of wireless
broadband services for homes and businesses, will help Global Mobile maximize
the potential of its network, which will be tested in the Hsinchu area in
September and begin operating commercially next year.</P>
      <P>"We expect to catch up with the global technological trends through exchanges of
experience and cooperation with Clearwire, " Ho said, adding that the
cooperation pact will cover international roaming services, technological
development and digital content.</P>
      <P>According to company sources, Global Mobile looks forward to learning from
Clearwire's experience in providing fast, easy and reliable wireless broadband
services, particularly its expertise in interconnecting WiMAX base stations and
other technology testing and applications.</P>
      <P>Ho said Clearwire may assess the possibility of acquiring a stake in Global
Mobile, an investment that would require the approval of relevant authorities.</P>
      <P>While Global Mobile does not have any plan to increase its capital this year,
the issue will be revisited next year, Ho indicated.</P>
      <P>Global Mobile was one of six local telecommunications companies that won

      <P>Family members of Chinese nationals killed in a deadly crane accident in a
bustling commercial district in Taipei City Friday will be able to come to
Taiwan starting Saturday, a Tourism Bureau official said.</P>
      <P>In coordination with the National Immigration Agency, the bureau is assisting
the Chinese family members in getting visas to Taiwan, said Chen Mei-hsiu, the
head of the bureau's Hotel, Travel and Training Division.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Immigration Agency announced that it has opened a special counter
to manage the visits of the family members of the victims, who were from
Guangdong province in southern China.</P>
      <P>The accident occurred just before 2 p.m. Friday when a section of a crane's
lattice boom fell 37 stories onto a moving tour bus carrying 25 Chinese tourists
in the upscale Xinyi shopping district.</P>
      <P>As of 10 p.m., two passengers had died, another remains in critical condition,
and three others were injured.</P>
      <P>One passenger, 46-year-old Li Fuqing, was cut in half and killed immediately
when the boom smashed through the back of the bus as it was heading toward
Taipei 101, the second highest skyscraper in the world.</P>
      <P>Another tourist, 57-year-old Wang Bingkun, died after being taken to the
Zhongxiao branch of Taipei Municipal Hospital. Zhang Shiguang, 63, suffered out-
of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) before arriving at Taipei Medical University
and remains in critical condition.</P>
      <P>The bus was carrying a total of 27 people at the time, including 25 Chinese
tourists, and a Taiwanese tour guide and driver.</P>
      <P>According to police data, each of the Chinese tourists was covered by travel
safety insurance provided by Taipei-based Fubon Insurance Co. The beneficiaries
of the two dead passengers will receive a maximum of NT$3 million (US$89,000) in
compensation for the accident.</P>
      <P>Those injured are also entitled to compensation of up to NT$3 million if they
were disabled in the accident and can also claim NT$200,000 each to cover
medical expenses.</P>
      <P>The family members of each victim will also receive NT$100,000 to cover travel
costs and follow-up expenses, according to police sources.</P>
      <P>A preliminary investigation  found that a small crane was operating a mid-sized
boom on the 37th floor of a planned MRT transit hub when the boom broke off and
fell to the street below.</P>
      <P>The building is a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project planned by the city
government and contracted to Uni-President Development Corp., a subsidiary of
the Uni-President Group, one of Taiwan's biggest conglomerates.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin ordered the construction company to halt  work  at the
site  soon after  the accident  occurred.</P>
      <P>Investigators said that the crane was hauling a weight of 3.1 tons at the time
of the accident, within its 3.2-ton capacity. They suggested that weather
conditions might have played a role in the boom's collapse but had yet to
pinpoint its cause.</P>
      <P>According to municipal authorities, the city's Department of Labor has launched

      <P>A Catholic hospital in eastern Taiwan's Taitung might have to return nearly
NT$100 million in donations it has collected because of possible violations of
the law, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said Friday.</P>
      <P>An official from the MOI's Department of Social Affairs said that according to
the Medical Treatment Act, medical institutions are not allowed to solicit
donations.</P>
      <P>"If the donation account is designated as a hospital, then the money will have
to be returned," the official said.</P>
      <P>If the hospital  is soliciting  the money as a nonprofit organization, it will
have to apply to the ministry to gain permission to ask for donations and alert
donors of the name change. If donors do not agree with the name change, the
money also will have to be returned.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks after St. Mary's Hospital in Taitung City launched
a campaign to collect "NT$10,000 donations from 3,000 donors" and raise the more
than NT$31 million it needs to transform itself into a nonprofit organization by
November.</P>
      <P>The hospital said it would have to shut down if it failed to reach the target,
but it collected NT$98 million in just 10 days from donors that included
President Ma Ying-jeou and Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-cheng.</P>
      <P>St. Mary's Hospital, built by the Catholic Church Hualien diocese half a century
ago, was the first hospital in Taitung with a 30-bed professional maternity
ward. In the past, half of the county's children were born in the hospital.</P>
      <P>But the establishment of Mackay Hospital, Taitung Christian Hospital and Taitung
Hospital under the Department of Health has put pressure on St. Mary's
operations.</P>
      <P>The hospital closed its well-known maternity department in 2002, and was mulling
whether to shut down permanently. But then it was transformed into the first
hospice hospital in Taitung in 2004 with public support.</P>
      <P>Under the Medical Treatment Act, which classifies hospitals as private,
nonprofit or government institutions, St. Mary's Hospital has to be transformed
into a nonprofit organization by November as requested by the Taitung County
Health Department.</P>

      <P>Seven of 25 samples of aquatic products examined in March were found to contain
small amounts of a banned fungicide residue, the Cabinet-level Department of
Health (DOH) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The samples of tilapia, grouper and threadfin fish that were contaminated with
malachite green had residue amounts of around 0.002 ppm -- the maximum level
acceptable in the European Union.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's food safety law bans the presence of residues of malachite green in
aquatic products sold locally. The toxic chemical, used to treat external fungal
and parasitic infections on fish and shellfish, has been found to harm the
livers of animals in laboratory tests.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ching-hsin, a DOH food safety official, said the contaminated aquatic
samples were collected from seven places, including a supermarket operated by a
farmers' association in eastern Taiwan's Taitung County, a marine food
restaurant in Kaohsiung County, a fish market in Chiayi City, a Carrefour shop
in Taipei City's Wanhua District, a department store in Taichung County, a
seafood restaurant in Taichung City and a coastal fish market in Keelung City.</P>
      <P>Even though the contaminated fish might have been consumed, Hsu said, the DOH
will track all related suppliers, who could be slapped with fines ranging
between NT$60,000 and NT$300,000 if they are found to have illegally used the
fungicide in disinfection.</P>
      <P>Hsu said local public health and fishery administration officials will be
required to cooperate with the DOH in tracking down suppliers of contaminated
fishery products.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials from the Fisheries Administration said the banned substance
might come from groundwater used in fish farming or from residues of
contamination incidents reported in 2004 and 2005.</P>
      <P>Officials said, however, that it's premature to speculate on the cause of the
contamination before relevant aquaculture farms are identified.</P>
      <P>As to whether the incident could affect Taiwan's fish exports, the officials
said among the three contaminated fish species, only grouper is on the export
list, with Hong Kong as a major market. Hong Kong does not have any regulations
governing malachite green residues.</P>

      <P>Family members of Chinese nationals killed in a deadly crane accident in a
bustling commercial district in Taipei City Friday will be able to come to
Taiwan starting Saturday, a Tourism Bureau official said.</P>
      <P>In coordination with the National Immigration Agency, the bureau is assisting
the Chinese family members in getting visas to Taiwan, said Chen Mei-hsiu, the
head of the bureau's Hotel, Travel and Training Division.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Immigration Agency announced that it has opened a special counter
to manage the visits of the family members of the victims, who were from
Guangdong province in southern China.</P>
      <P>The accident occurred just before 2 p.m. Friday when a section of a crane's
lattice boom fell 37 stories onto a moving tour bus carrying 25 Chinese tourists
in the upscale Xinyi shopping district.</P>
      <P>As of 10 p.m., two passengers had died, another remains in critical condition,
and three others were injured.</P>
      <P>One passenger, 46-year-old Li Fuqing, was cut in half and killed immediately
when the boom smashed through the back of the bus as it was heading toward
Taipei 101, the second highest skyscraper in the world.</P>
      <P>Another tourist, 57-year-old Wang Bingkun, died after being taken to the
Zhongxiao branch of Taipei Municipal Hospital. Zhang Shiguang, 63, suffered out-
of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) before arriving at Taipei Medical University
and remains in critical condition.</P>
      <P>The bus was carrying a total of 27 people at the time, including 25 Chinese
tourists, and a Taiwanese tour guide and driver.</P>
      <P>According to police data, each of the Chinese tourists was covered by travel
safety insurance provided by Taipei-based Fubon Insurance Co. The beneficiaries
of the two dead passengers will receive a maximum of NT$3 million (US$89,000) in
compensation for the accident.</P>
      <P>Those injured are also entitled to compensation of up to NT$3 million if they
were disabled in the accident and can also claim NT$200,000 each to cover
medical expenses.</P>
      <P>The family members of each victim will also receive NT$100,000 to cover travel
costs and follow-up expenses, according to police sources.</P>
      <P>A preliminary investigation  found that a small crane was operating a mid-sized
boom on the 37th floor of a planned MRT transit hub when the boom broke off and
fell to the street below.</P>
      <P>The building is a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project planned by the city
government and contracted to Uni-President Development Corp., a subsidiary of
the Uni-President Group, one of Taiwan's biggest conglomerates.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin ordered the construction company to halt  work  at the
site  soon after  the accident  occurred.</P>
      <P>Investigators said that the crane was hauling a weight of 3.1 tons at the time
of the accident, within its 3.2-ton capacity. They suggested that weather
conditions might have played a role in the boom's collapse but had yet to
pinpoint its cause.</P>
      <P>According to municipal authorities, the city's Department of Labor has launched
a probe into whether human error or professional negligence on the part of the
crane company had anything to do with the tragedy.</P>
      <P>The tour group, from Guangdong, China, arrived in Taiwan via Hong Kong April 20

      <P>A Catholic hospital in eastern Taiwan's Taitung might have to return nearly
NT$100 million in donations it has collected because of possible violations of
the law, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) said Friday.</P>
      <P>An official from the MOI's Department of Social Affairs said that according to
the Medical Treatment Act, medical institutions are not allowed to solicit
donations.</P>
      <P>"If the donation account is designated as a hospital, then the money will have
to be returned," the official said.</P>
      <P>If the hospital  is soliciting  the money as a nonprofit organization, it will
have to apply to the ministry to gain permission to ask for donations and alert
donors of the name change. If donors do not agree with the name change, the
money also will have to be returned.</P>
      <P>The official made the remarks after St. Mary's Hospital in Taitung City launched
a campaign to collect "NT$10,000 donations from 3,000 donors" and raise the more
than NT$31 million it needs to transform itself into a nonprofit organization by
November.</P>
      <P>The hospital said it would have to shut down if it failed to reach the target,
but it collected NT$98 million in just 10 days from donors that included
President Ma Ying-jeou and Taitung County Magistrate Kuang Li-cheng.</P>
      <P>St. Mary's Hospital, built by the Catholic Church Hualien diocese half a century
ago, was the first hospital in Taitung with a 30-bed professional maternity
ward. In the past, half of the county's children were born in the hospital.</P>
      <P>But the establishment of Mackay Hospital, Taitung Christian Hospital and Taitung
Hospital under the Department of Health has put pressure on St. Mary's
operations.</P>
      <P>The hospital closed its well-known maternity department in 2002, and was mulling
whether to shut down permanently. But then it was transformed into the first
hospice hospital in Taitung in 2004 with public support.</P>
      <P>Under the Medical Treatment Act, which classifies hospitals as private,
nonprofit or government institutions, St. Mary's Hospital has to be transformed
into a nonprofit organization by November as requested by the Taitung County
Health Department.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan chief negotiator arrives in Nanjing for talks with China</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's chief negotiator with China, Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Chiang Pin-kung, arrived in Nanjing Saturday morning on a mission to seal three
agreements and one joint statement with China.</P>
      <P>The highlight of Chiang's visit will be a meeting with his Chinese counterpart,
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) President Chen
Yunlin, slated for Sunday in the Chinese city.</P>
      <P>The two sides are expected to sign agreements on the launch of regular cross-
strait passenger flights, cross-strait cooperation to fight crime, mutual
judicial assistance, and financial cooperation.</P>
      <P>A joint statement on a proposal to open Taiwan to Chinese investment will also
be released at that time.</P>
      <P>Representatives  of the SEF and ARATS are set to hold a preparatory meeting
later Saturday to finalize the texts of the agreements and the joint statement.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan, who was at Taiwan
Taoyuan Airport to see off Chiang and his delegation, promised that the SEF's
negotiations with ARATS will be conducted in accordance with the principles of
equality and dignity, and will prioritize the interests of Taiwan and its
people.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, a survey conducted recently by the MAC found that more than 60
percent of respondents think the Chiang-Chen meeting will be helpful to the
normalization of cross-strait trade and economic ties.</P>
      <P>"With the support of the public,  I believe the upcoming Chiang-Chen meeting
will produce very fruitful results and help create a mutually beneficial win-win
situation across the strait, " she said.</P>
      <P>During his talks with Chen, Chiang is also likely to officially raise a proposal
for Taiwan and China to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are intermediary bodies set up by Taiwan and China,
respectively, to handle cross-strait affairs in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>The upcoming Chiang-Chen meeting will be the third of its kind since the
resumption of cross-strait dialogue less than one year ago following a nine-year
hiatus. It signifies continued warming of relations between the two former
rivals since the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou, whose administration
has made it a priority to ease tensions and improve relations with China.</P>
      <P>In their first meeting held in June 2008 in Beijing, Chiang and Chen signed
agreements  on the launch of weekend cross-strait passenger charter flights and
the admission of larger numbers of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Their second meeting took place in November in Taipei, during which they signed
agreements on expanding the weekend passenger charter services to become daily
services, opening cargo charter services, direct cross-strait shipping and
postal services, and improving food safety.</P>
      <P>During this latest China trip, Chiang will also visit Taiwanese businesses in
Yangzhou, Suzhou and Shanghai before returning to Taiwan April 29.</P>

      <P>A Chinese tourist, who was injured Friday when a crane boom fell onto a moving
bus in which he traveling, remained in critical condition Saturday, according to
a surgeon at the hospital where he is being treated.</P>
      <P>Tzao Neil-wen, chief of the cardiac surgery department at Taipei Medical
University, said that the tourist, Zhang Shiguang, 63, suffered severe damage to
his head, including leakage of his brain fluid.</P>
      <P>Zhang also sustained multiple bone fractures all over his body and is suffering
from neurogenic and hemorrhagic shock, Tzao said. The patient is in a state of
deep unconsciousness, which measured 3 on a 15-point coma scale, he added.</P>
      <P>Zhang is now receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and hemodialysis and
has been transfused with more than 30,000 cc of blood, the doctor said.</P>
      <P>Zhang and 24 other visitors from Guandong, China were traveling on a tour bus in
the upscale Xinyi shopping district in Taipei Friday around 2 p.m. when a
lattice boom from a crane fell 31 stories from a building under construction and
smashed the back part of the bus. Two of the passengers were killed and several
others injured.</P>
      <P>Two of the moderately injured tourists are showing signs of improvement,
according to the staff at the Zhongxiao branch of the Taipei Municipal Hospital
where they are being treated.</P>
      <P>Wang Peiling, 53, and Yeh Zhitang, 29, who both sustained bone fractures and
contusions, were transferred to the general ward for further observation
Saturday morning as their condition had became stable, the hospital staff said.</P>
      <P>However, the doctors cannot yet say when the two patients will be discharged,
the hospital said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei District Prosecutors Office and police released six crane
operators in the wee hours of Saturday on bail of between NT$100,000 (US$2,965)
and NT$500,000 each after eight hours of interrogation over the accident.</P>
      <P>Two representatives of two construction companies that are involved in the
building project were also questioned, but were later freed without bail.</P>
      <P>Chief Prosecutor Lai Cheng-sheng said that there will be no further probe into
criminal liability until the municipal authorities complete their investigation
report.</P>
      <P>When the boom fell Friday, it smashed through the back of the bus, immediately
killing one passenger, 46-year-old Li Fuqing, who was cut in half.</P>
      <P>Another tourist, 57-year-old Wang Bingkun, died after being taken to the
Zhongxiao branch of Taipei Municipal Hospital.</P>
      <P>The bus was carrying a total of 27 people -- 25 Chinese tourists, and a
Taiwanese tour guide and driver. It was heading toward Taipei 101, the tallest
occupied skyscraper in the world.</P>
      <P>A preliminary investigation  found that a small crane was operating a mid-sized
boom on the 31st floor of a planned MRT transit hub when the boom broke off and
fell to the street below.</P>
      <P>Investigators said that the crane was hauling a weight of 3.1 tons at the time
of the accident, within its 3.2-ton capacity. They suggested that weather
conditions might have played a role in the boom's collapse, but had yet to
pinpoint the cause.</P>
      <P>The city's Department of Labor has launched a probe into whether human error or
professional negligence on the part of the crane company had anything to do with
the tragedy.</P>
      <P>The tour group, from Guangdong, China, arrived in Taiwan via Hong Kong April 20
for a six-day sightseeing trip. They were scheduled to return home Saturday,
according to the Tourism Bureau.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Group urges intellectual property rights protection in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan chapter of the Washington-based Business Software Alliance (BSA) -- a
non-profit organization that promotes intellectual property rights (IPR)  --
called on the government, enterprises and the public to work together against
software piracy and to create a safe and legal digital world.</P>
      <P>Sung Hong-ti, co-chair of BSA Taiwan, made the call at an event hosted by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs' Intellectual Property Office to celebrate World
Intellectual Property Day (World IP Day) on April 26.</P>
      <P>Established by the World Intellectual Property Organization in 2001, World IP
Day aims at raising awareness of the role of IPR in daily life and celebrating
the contribution made by innovators and artists to the development of societies
across the globe.</P>
      <P>"Public awareness of the need to protect intellectual property rights has been
getting better and better over the years. However, there is still a lot of room
for improvement," Sung told CNA.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's efforts to combat commercial piracy and to strengthen IPR have achieved
concrete results, as the country's IPR infringement rate fell from 43 percent in
2006 to 40 percent in 2008, the third lowest in Asia after Japan's 23 percent
and Singapore's 37 percent, according to Sung.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representatives on Jan. 16 removed
Taiwan from the Special 301 Watch list, in recognition of the country's progress
on IPR protection, Sung noted.</P>
      <P>However, IPR infringements remain serious in small and medium sized enterprise
(SMEs) in Taiwan where licensed software is not provided for all users, Sung
noted.</P>
      <P>"The concept of 'the user pays' is important and we hope that the government,
enterprises and the general public can all work together to support licensed
software," Sung said.</P>
      <P>According to Sung, BSA Taiwan has launched a "333 campaign" aimed at combining
the efforts of the government, companies and the public to reduce Taiwan's
piracy rate by 3 percent in three years.</P>
      <P>Many studies have shown that economic growth is linked to the reduction of
software piracy, Sung said, adding that if Taiwan can reduce software piracy to
31 percent by 2012, it would add an estimated US$414 million to the country's
GDP.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan pledges to normalize economic ties with China</HEADLINE>

      <P>The issues to be addressed in the upcoming round of high-level meetings between
Taiwan and China will help pave the way for the normalization of trade and
economic relations and improve order in the civic exchanges between the two
sides, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Lai made the comment during an interview with a radio station based in the
central city of Taichung, in reference to a meeting scheduled for Sunday in
Nanjing between Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-
kung and Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Chiang and Chen are expected to sign three agreements on the
launch of regular cross-Taiwan Strait passenger flights, financial cooperation,
and mutual judicial assistance and cross-strait cooperation to fight crime.
Meanwhile, any consensus reached on opening Taiwan to Chinese investment will be
covered in a joint statement.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, opening up to investment from China will be an important step
in normalizing trade and economic ties across the strait, because the one-way
movement of investment from Taiwan to China over the past 20 years has tilted
the balance of cross-strait capital flows.</P>
      <P>On the possible negative impact on Taiwan's industrial sector, Lai said the
government will make sure the liberalization process is gradual and will set
limits on the scope of the opening.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the opening will target fields that would diffuse national
benefits as a result of Chinese investments and in which Chinese investors are
interested, she said. She named as examples industries such as light-emitting
diode (LED) lighting, wind energy, photovoltaics and logistic services.</P>
      <P>Chinese investment will still be prohibited in fields where Taiwan enjoys a
crucial technological edge and where there are national  security  concerns,
such as flat panel display and semiconductor manufacturing, she said.</P>
      <P>Regarding the launch of regular passenger flights, Lai noted that there is an
urgent need for such services now, as the current daily charter services do not
have the capacity to meet the high market demand.</P>
      <P>Lai, however, said the upcoming air services agreement will not cover the
complex issue of allowing air carriers on the cross-strait route to operate
connecting flights to a third country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  an agreement on mutual judicial assistance and cooperation to fight
crime will allow for the repatriation of Taiwanese fugitives in China to face
justice, she said.</P>
      <P>Of the 85 major Taiwanese economic criminals who fled to China over the past 10
years, only one has been returned to Taiwan, which makes it obvious that China
is a haven for Taiwanese fugitives, she said.</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's proposal to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China, Lai said Chiang will seek to discuss the issue with Chen
during their upcoming talks, in the hope that it could be placed on the agenda
of their fourth meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the proposed agreement will address the issues of free trade
and reducing cross-strait tariffs, which are essential to the normalization of
economic ties between the two sides.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou has expressed strong support for the establishment of the
ECFA, stressing that it is similar to a free trade agreement (FTA) with no
political strings attached.</P>
      <P>Ma has argued that if Taiwan does not sign such an agreement with China, it
risks being marginalized and losing its competitiveness, as China and
neighboring countries are about to sign FTAs and as Beijing continues to block
Taiwan's efforts to reach FTA agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>Critics, however, warned that the agreement could jeopardize Taiwan's
sovereignty, make Taiwan too economically dependent on China, and lead to an
influx of Chinese capital and goods.</P>

      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM) in suburban Taipei will take steps to better
manage crowds, as the recent influx of Chinese tourists has seriously affected
the quality of its service to visitors, a senior curator said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The museum, home to the cream of ancient Chinese art, is usually a must-see
tourist attraction for visitors from China. This has resulted in frequent
overcrowding in its major display rooms or galleries since the number of Chinese
visitors began to increase substantially in March, NPM Deputy Director Feng
Ming-chu said.</P>
      <P>In the past, Feng said, the daily number of visitors to the museum would exceed
8,000, or even 10,000 only on holidays. "But nowadays, the number tends to
surpass the 8,000 mark every day," she added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the number of Chinese visitors is expected to increase further
following the launch of regularly scheduled flights across the Taiwan Strait in
the near future, Feng said the museum is studying measures to control
overcrowding.</P>
      <P>According to Feng, the museum is contacting local travel agencies and tour
guides to seek their cooperation on crowd management through a reservation
system that may be introduced on an experimental basis, Feng said.</P>
      <P>Better crowd management can result in improved service quality and thus allow
visitors to appreciate the museum's art treasures in an orderly and quiet
atmosphere, she added.</P>
      <P>At present, the display area for the museum's Jadeite Cabbage with Insects --
the piece most beloved among Chinese visitors -- is always chaotic and noisy
because of overcrowding, Feng said.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the museum has been receiving an increasing number of
complaints, Feng said it is giving top priority to improving crowd control in
the area.</P>
      <P>Among others measures, she said, the museum will advise tour guides to introduce
to Chinese visitors special aspects of the Jadeite Cabbage in the museum's front
hall where there are light boxes that feature the item. Visitors will therefore
be able to better appreciate the piece in a quieter ambience when they actually
see it, Feng added.</P>

      <P>The upcoming financial cooperation agreement between Taiwan and China will pave
the way for Taiwan's financial sector to gain access to the Chinese market,
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Sean Chen said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The agreement is one of three accords expected to be signed Sunday in Nanjing
during the third meeting between the two top cross-strait negotiators from both
sides -- Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation, and Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>The FSC's Chen explained that the agreement will provide a framework for future
negotiations between the two sides on the establishment of three separate
memorandums of understanding on cooperation on financial supervision and
regulation in the banking, securities and futures, and insurance industries.</P>
      <P>After the signing of the MOUs, the two sides will officially enter talks on
market access, he said.</P>
      <P>"To Taiwan's financial sector, this would be like obtaining an admission ticket
to the Chinese market," he said.</P>
      <P>Norman Yin, a professor of financial studies at National Chengchi University,
said the MOUs will serve as a platform from which Taiwan's financial sector
could make inroads to the Chinese market, which he said is very important to the
sector's development.</P>
      <P>According to Yin, Taiwan's financial market has in recent years showed signs of
saturation as a result of excess banking capacity, which gives urgency to the
exploration of new markets.</P>
      <P>He said the vast market in China holds very good opportunities for Taiwan and
will help enhance the competitiveness of the financial sector.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's tourism authorities have ordered a Taipei-based travel agency to
suspend operations for three months with effect from May 1, after it failed to
book ground transportation for Chinese tour groups in Taiwan as promised, a
Tourism Bureau official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"It is mean to stand up travelers, " said Chen Mei-hsiu, the head of the
bureau's Hotel, Travel and Training Division.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to the Sun Hua Travel Service which she said left four groups
of Chinese tourists stranded either at the airport or in hotels after they
arrived in Taiwan Thursday.</P>
      <P>A similar situation arose again the following day with four other tour groups
from China that were to be hosted by Sun Hua, she said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Tourism Bureau has suspended the operations of Sun Hua Travel
Service for three months and has asked that it present a concrete plan within
that time to improve its services, Chen said.</P>
      <P>If there is no improvement by then, the bureau will revoke the agency's business
license, she added.</P>
      <P>However,  the bureau is allowing  Sun Hua to fulfill its obligations to other
previously booked tours groups until May 1, but has warned the agency to deal
with its clients based on the principles of honesty and sincerity.</P>
      <P>If it does not follow the rules, the bureau will revoke its business license,
Chen said, suggesting the travel agency cancel the upcoming tours if it cannot
secure buses to transport the visitors.</P>
      <P>The eight groups of Chinese tourists that Sun Hua was supposed to host began
their scheduled tour of the island Saturday after the Taipei-based Travel
Quality Assurance Association stepped in with an emergency tour bus arrangement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, other tour groups from China that were contracted to Sun Hua were
expected to arrive in Taiwan Saturday and Sunday as scheduled, as Sun Hua gave
the assurance that it had made all the necessary ground transportation
arrangements.</P>
      <P>At this time of year when many students usually take graduation trips and local
people go on religious pilgrimages, the shortage of tour buses in Taiwan has

      <P>The number of Chinese tourists visiting Taipei 101, the world's tallest occupied
skyscraper, has risen sharply with the influx of sightseers from China, a Taipei
101 official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taipei 101 Acting Chairman and President Harace Lin said that in mid-April
alone, Chinese tourists made 17,000 visits per week to the landmark building in
Taipei, about seven times more than in the past.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Tourism Bureau, Chinese travelers made
87,002 visits to Taiwan in March, up 362.5 percent from the same month last
year. Of that number, 45,739 were for sightseeing purposes, which represented a
whopping 1,526.56 percent increase from the same period last year, the figures
showed.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau said that since Taiwan's opening to larger numbers of Chinese
tourists and the launch of direct cross-strait charter flights in July 2008,
there has been double digit growth in total number of visitors and sightseers
from China.</P>
      <P>Lin said that prior to July 2008, the number of Chinese visitors to Taipei 101
was several thousand per month, but the number began to climb in October 2008.</P>
      <P>Last week, Chinese travelers made 17,000 visits to Taipei 101, averaging 2,500
per day, compared with fewer than 2,500 per week previously, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that seven out of 10 Chinese visitors usually want to go to the
Observatory on the 89th floor to get an aerial view of the metropolis.</P>
      <P>In view of the sharp increase in the number of Chinese visitors to Taipei 101,
Lin said, he is making some changes to maximize the business opportunities.</P>
      <P>This includes offering brand name items preferred by Chinese tourists and
changing the location of certain counters to areas frequented by Chinese tourist
groups.</P>
      <P>For example, the cosmetic section will be adjusted, and priority will be given
to those counters that carry brands favored by both Chinese and Taiwanese
visitors, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, as it has been observed that Chinese tourists like to buy watches,
a watch section opened in the tower in early April, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He noted that while China has a luxury item tax of between 20 and 30 percent,
there is no such tax in Taiwan and visitors are also entitled to a five percent
duty free concession on certain items.</P>
      <P>This means that Chinese tourists can obtain luxury goods in Taiwan at 25 percent
less than in China, he said.</P>

arrived here earlier in the day to handle the aftermath of the accident that

      <P>Two Chinese tourists were killed and several others injured when a section of a

      <P>Office Director Chang Chi-yu said the operators of the crane failed to take into

      <P>Top negotiators from Taiwan and China will meet in the central Chinese city of
Nanjing Sunday to seal three pacts and issue a joint statement, which are
expected to deliver new breakthroughs in relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure for Nanjing Saturday morning, Taiwan's chief delegate,
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, said the agreements
will increase economic and financial cooperation amid President Ma Ying-jeou's
efforts to enhance Taiwan's competitiveness in the global market and will ensure
the peaceful development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan also said Saturday in an
interview that the financial cooperation agreement to be signed Sunday and a
joint statement on opening Taiwan to Chinese investment to be issued
simultaneously will pave the way for normalization of trade and economic
relations and improve order in the civic exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, opening up to investment from China will be an important step
in normalizing trade and economic ties across the strait, because the one-way
movement of investment from Taiwan to China over the past 20 years has tilted
the balance of cross-strait capital flows.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese companies are believed to have invested more than US$100 billion in
China and business leaders often compalin they are hurt by restrictions on
finance and trade.</P>
      <P>Lai said any investment agreement with China will bar Chinese access to sectors
deemed critical to Taiwan's national security and economic well-being.</P>
      <P>The agreement on mutual judicial assistance and cooperation in fighting crime
will mark yet another step forward in cross-strait engagements and in Taiwan's
quest to bring to justice many of its notorious fugitives in China, SEF Vice
Chairman Kao Koong-lian said in Nanjing Saturday after wrapping up a preparatory
session for Sunday's meeting.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Kao added, the agreement on the launch of regular cross-strait
flights will facilitate cross-strait tourism development and boost mutual
understanding and trust through increased civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>Referring to the significance of the four documents to be signed by Chiang and
his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , Kao stressed that cross-strait
relations will enter a new stage following the Chiang-Chen talks Sunday.</P>
      <P>More than 260 reporters from Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and many other countries
have registered to cover Sunday's event, which will be held at a hillside resort
on the outskirts of Nanjing.</P>
      <P>During his talks with Chen, Chiang is also likely to officially raise a proposal
for Taiwan and China to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>President Ma has expressed strong support for the establishment of the ECFA,
stressing that it is similar to a free trade agreement (FTA) with no political
strings attached.</P>
      <P>He has argued that if Taiwan does not sign such an agreement with China, it
risks being marginalized and losing its competitiveness, as China and
neighboring countries are about to sign FTAs and as Beijing continues to block
Taiwan's efforts to reach FTA agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are intermediary bodies set up by Taiwan and China,
respectively, to handle cross-strait affairs in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>The Chiang-Chen meeting Sunday will be the third of its kind since the
resumption of regular cross-strait dialogue less than one year ago after a nine-
year hiatus.</P>
      <P>The meeting signifies continued warming of relations between the two former
rivals since the inauguration of Ma, whose administration has made it a priority
to ease tensions and improve relations with China.</P>
      <P>In their earlier rounds of talks, the two sides agreed to begin daily charter
flights and direct sea and postal service and to increase the number of Chinese
tourists visiting Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM) in suburban Taipei will take steps to better
manage crowds, as the recent influx of Chinese tourists has seriously affected
the quality of its service to visitors, a senior curator said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The museum, home to the cream of ancient Chinese art, is usually a must-see
tourist attraction for visitors from China. This has resulted in frequent
overcrowding in its major display rooms or galleries since the number of Chinese
visitors began to increase substantially in March, NPM Deputy Director Feng
Ming-chu said.</P>
      <P>In the past, Feng said, the daily number of visitors to the museum would exceed
8,000, or even 10,000 only on holidays. "But nowadays, the number tends to
surpass the 8,000 mark every day," she added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the number of Chinese visitors is expected to increase further
following the launch of regularly scheduled flights across the Taiwan Strait in
the near future, Feng said the museum is studying measures to control
overcrowding.</P>
      <P>According to Feng, the museum is contacting local travel agencies and tour
guides to seek their cooperation on crowd management through a reservation
system that may be introduced on an experimental basis, Feng said.</P>
      <P>Better crowd management can result in improved service quality and thus allow
visitors to appreciate the museum's art treasures in an orderly and quiet
atmosphere, she added.</P>
      <P>At present, the display area for the museum's Jadeite Cabbage with Insects --
the piece most beloved among Chinese visitors -- is always chaotic and noisy
because of overcrowding, Feng said.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the museum has been receiving an increasing number of
complaints, Feng said it is giving top priority to improving crowd control in
the area.</P>
      <P>Among others measures, she said, the museum will advise tour guides to introduce
to Chinese visitors special aspects of the Jadeite Cabbage in the museum's front
hall where there are light boxes that feature the item. Visitors will therefore
be able to better appreciate the piece in a quieter ambience when they actually
see it, Feng added.</P>

      <P>The upcoming financial cooperation agreement between Taiwan and China will pave
the way for Taiwan's financial sector to gain access to the Chinese market,
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Sean Chen said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The agreement is one of three accords expected to be signed Sunday in Nanjing
during the third meeting between the two top cross-strait negotiators from both
sides -- Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange
Foundation, and Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>
      <P>The FSC's Chen explained that the agreement will provide a framework for future
negotiations between the two sides on the establishment of three separate
memorandums of understanding on cooperation on financial supervision and
regulation in the banking, securities and futures, and insurance industries.</P>
      <P>After the signing of the MOUs, the two sides will officially enter talks on
market access, he said.</P>
      <P>"To Taiwan's financial sector, this would be like obtaining an admission ticket
to the Chinese market," he said.</P>
      <P>Norman Yin, a professor of financial studies at National Chengchi University,
said the MOUs will serve as a platform from which Taiwan's financial sector
could make inroads to the Chinese market, which he said is very important to the
sector's development.</P>
      <P>According to Yin, Taiwan's financial market has in recent years showed signs of
saturation as a result of excess banking capacity, which gives urgency to the
exploration of new markets.</P>
      <P>He said the vast market in China holds very good opportunities for Taiwan and
will help enhance the competitiveness of the financial sector.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's tourism authorities have ordered a Taipei-based travel agency to
suspend operations for three months with effect from May 1, after it failed to
book ground transportation for Chinese tour groups in Taiwan as promised, a
Tourism Bureau official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"It is mean to stand up travelers, " said Chen Mei-hsiu, the head of the
bureau's Hotel, Travel and Training Division.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to the Sun Hua Travel Service which she said left four groups
of Chinese tourists stranded either at the airport or in hotels after they
arrived in Taiwan Thursday.</P>
      <P>A similar situation arose again the following day with four other tour groups
from China that were to be hosted by Sun Hua, she said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the Tourism Bureau has suspended the operations of Sun Hua Travel
Service for three months and has asked that it present a concrete plan within
that time to improve its services, Chen said.</P>
      <P>If there is no improvement by then, the bureau will revoke the agency's business
license, she added.</P>
      <P>However,  the bureau is allowing  Sun Hua to fulfill its obligations to other
previously booked tours groups until May 1, but has warned the agency to deal
with its clients based on the principles of honesty and sincerity.</P>
      <P>If it does not follow the rules, the bureau will revoke its business license,
Chen said, suggesting the travel agency cancel the upcoming tours if it cannot
secure buses to transport the visitors.</P>
      <P>The eight groups of Chinese tourists that Sun Hua was supposed to host began
their scheduled tour of the island Saturday after the Taipei-based Travel
Quality Assurance Association stepped in with an emergency tour bus arrangement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, other tour groups from China that were contracted to Sun Hua were
expected to arrive in Taiwan Saturday and Sunday as scheduled, as Sun Hua gave
the assurance that it had made all the necessary ground transportation
arrangements.</P>
      <P>At this time of year when many students usually take graduation trips and local
people go on religious pilgrimages, the shortage of tour buses in Taiwan has
been exacerbated by a steep increase in the number of sightseers from China.</P>

      <P>The number of Chinese tourists visiting Taipei 101, the world's tallest occupied
skyscraper, has risen sharply with the influx of sightseers from China, a Taipei
101 official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taipei 101 Acting Chairman and President Harace Lin said that in mid-April
alone, Chinese tourists made 17,000 visits per week to the landmark building in
Taipei, about seven times more than in the past.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Tourism Bureau, Chinese travelers made
87,002 visits to Taiwan in March, up 362.5 percent from the same month last
year. Of that number, 45,739 were for sightseeing purposes, which represented a
whopping 1,526.56 percent increase from the same period last year, the figures
showed.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau said that since Taiwan's opening to larger numbers of Chinese
tourists and the launch of direct cross-strait charter flights in July 2008,
there has been double digit growth in total number of visitors and sightseers
from China.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, Kao added, the agreement on the launch of regular cross-strait
flights will facilitate cross-strait tourism development and boost mutual
understanding and trust through increased civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>Referring to the significance of the four documents to be signed by Chiang and
his Chinese counterpart, Chen Yunlin, president of the Beijing-based Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) , Kao stressed that cross-strait
relations will enter a new stage following the Chiang-Chen talks Sunday.</P>
      <P>More than 260 reporters from Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and many other countries
have registered to cover Sunday's event, which will be held at a hillside resort
on the outskirts of Nanjing.</P>
      <P>During his talks with Chen, Chiang is also likely to officially raise a proposal
for Taiwan and China to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>President Ma has expressed strong support for the establishment of the ECFA,
stressing that it is similar to a free trade agreement (FTA) with no political
strings attached.</P>
      <P>He has argued that if Taiwan does not sign such an agreement with China, it
risks being marginalized and losing its competitiveness, as China and
neighboring countries are about to sign FTAs and as Beijing continues to block
Taiwan's efforts to reach FTA agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are intermediary bodies set up by Taiwan and China,
respectively, to handle cross-strait affairs in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>The Chiang-Chen meeting Sunday will be the third of its kind since the
resumption of regular cross-strait dialogue less than one year ago after a nine-
year hiatus.</P>
      <P>The meeting signifies continued warming of relations between the two former
rivals since the inauguration of Ma, whose administration has made it a priority
to ease tensions and improve relations with China.</P>
      <P>In their earlier rounds of talks, the two sides agreed to begin daily charter
flights and direct sea and postal service and to increase the number of Chinese
tourists visiting Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Cross-strait talks set to deliver new breakthrough (roundup)</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Top negotiators from Taiwan and China will meet in the central Chinese city of
Nanjing Sunday to seal three pacts and issue a joint statement, which are
expected to deliver new breakthroughs in relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure for Nanjing Saturday morning, Taiwan's chief delegate,
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Chiang Pin-kung, said the agreements
will increase economic and financial cooperation amid President Ma Ying-jeou's
efforts to enhance Taiwan's competitiveness in the global market and will ensure
the peaceful development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan also said Saturday in an
interview that the financial cooperation agreement to be signed Sunday and a
joint statement on opening Taiwan to Chinese investment to be issued
simultaneously will pave the way for normalization of trade and economic
relations and improve order in the civic exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, opening up to investment from China will be an important step
in normalizing trade and economic ties across the strait, because the one-way
movement of investment from Taiwan to China over the past 20 years has tilted
the balance of cross-strait capital flows.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese companies are believed to have invested more than US$100 billion in
China and business leaders often compalin they are hurt by restrictions on
finance and trade.</P>
      <P>Lai said any investment agreement with China will bar Chinese access to sectors
deemed critical to Taiwan's national security and economic well-being.</P>
      <P>The agreement on mutual judicial assistance and cooperation in fighting crime
will mark yet another step forward in cross-strait engagements and in Taiwan's
quest to bring to justice many of its notorious fugitives in China, SEF Vice
Chairman Kao Koong-lian said in Nanjing Saturday after wrapping up a preparatory
session for Sunday's meeting.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Kao added, the agreement on the launch of regular cross-strait
flights will facilitate cross-strait tourism development and boost mutual
understanding and trust through increased civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>Referring to the significance of the four documents to be signed by Chiang and

    <HEADLINE>China proposes cross-strait economic cooperation mechanism</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Nanjing, China, April 26 (CNA)
04/26/09  15:52:14
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's top negotiator with Taiwan proposed Sunday that both sides work to
establish an economic cooperation  mechanism as the basis for the normalization
of cross-strait economic ties and enhanced competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of a new round of cross-strait talks, Chen Yunlin,
president of the Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) , said that in order to meet economic challenges at home and
abroad, the two sides should seek to build a cooperation mechanism or framework
that would reflect their respective economic characteristics and at the same
time allow both sides to develop economically.</P>
      <P>Echoing Chinese President Hu Jintao's recent comment during a tour of Shandong
Province that "those who who can weather the current economic difficulties will
see great development in the future," Chen urged that the people on both sides
of the Taiwan Strait cooperate to ride out the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the mainland will push Chinese businesses to make investments in
Taiwan and buy more Taiwan-made products. As a result, Chinese companies will
make lots of shopping sprees in Taiwan, Taiwan businesses will be enticed to
explore the Chinese market, and more Chinese tourists will be encouraged to
travel to Taiwan, all of which will help "balance the development of the
markets," he said.</P>
      <P>He was most likely alluding to remarks made Saturday by Lai Shin-yuan,
chairwoman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, that Taiwanese companies are
believed to have invested more than US$100 billion in China and the one-way
movement of investment from Taiwan to China over the past 20 years has tilted
the balance  of cross-strait capital flows.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
, is leading the Taiwan delegation to the one-day SEF-ARATS meeting -- the third
in less than a year -- in the central Chinese city of Nanjing.</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that the two sides have signed six agreements since last June on
weekend charter flights, tourism, direct shipping, air transport, postal
services, and food safety. Sunday's talks will mainly focus on reviews of the
progress made in these six areas, he added.</P>
      <P>Negotiators from the two sides will hold their final discussions before sealing
three pacts on regular scheduled flights, mutual judicial assistance and
cooperation in fighting crime, and financial cooperation. They will also issue a
joint statement on Chinese investment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The three agreements, along with the joint statement, are expected to deliver
new breakthroughs in relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>During his talks with Chen, Chiang will also officially raise a proposal for
Taiwan and China to sign an economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) . He
said he was authorized by the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou to put
forth the proposal during the current round of talks.</P>
      <P>President Ma has argued that if Taiwan does not sign such an agreement with
China, it risks being marginalized and losing its competitiveness, as China and
neighboring countries are about to sign FTAs and as Beijing continues to block
Taiwan's efforts to reach FTA agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>The two sides will also exchange views on the agenda for the fourth round of
SEF-ARATS talks, Chiang added.</P>
      <P>Negotiators of the two intermediary bodies, founded in 1990 and 1991
respectively to handle cross-strait affairs in the absence of official ties, are
expected to hold separate news conferences soon after the Nanjing talks.</P>
      <P>The two organizations agreed to meet twice a year on the mainland and Taiwan
alternately after negotiations resumed last June following a nine-year hiatus.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Sailing junk on quest for record sinks off Suao, all crew safe</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
04/26/09  17:53:46
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Hong Kong-registered Chinese sailing junk, Princess Taiping, sank off the
northeastern Taiwan fishing port of Suao early Sunday morning after it was
struck by an unknown foreign freighter, the Coast Guard Administration (CGA)
reported.</P>
      <P>The Princess Taiping is a rebuilt Ming Dynasty sailing junk that set sail from
the northeastern Taiwan harbor of Keelung last June on an ambitious, engineless
cross-Pacific voyage.</P>
      <P>When it sank, it was only a few hours, or roughly 42 nautical miles, from
completing the 10-month round trip challenge, as it was scheduled to pull into
Keelung's Bisha Fishing Port later in the day.</P>
      <P>All 11 crew members aboard the sailing junk -- Taiwanese Captain Liu Ning-sheng,
six Americans, two Japanese, one Taiwanese and one mainland Chinese -- were
rescued in a Taiwan joint rescue operation after they sent out an S-O-S call
around 3: 40 a.m. Sunday. Shortly after the distress call was sent, the vessel
sank at a location about 30 nautical miles off Suao.</P>
      <P>The crew members were rescued by two helicopters dispatched by the National
Rescue Center, and 10 of them were taken to two military hospitals in Taipei
City for treatment at around 8 a.m. Liu, who sustained slight head injuries, was
taken to Veterans General Hospital in Suao.</P>
      <P>Two of the crew members had serious injuries to the head and neck, respectively,
while the others were receiving treatment for hypothermia, according to CGA
officials.</P>
      <P>Some of the crew said that during the chaos after the junk was hit at around 2:
40 a.m., they spotted the name of the freighter as Champion Express.</P>
      <P>A check of the maritime charts by the Suao-based CGA found that a vessel named
Champion Express was indeed in the area at that time. Radar records showed that
the freighter, which was heading north before it rammed into the Princess
Taiping, made an abrupt turn in a westerly direction after the sailing junk
broke in two. The ship then turned northward and fled, the records showed.</P>
      <P>The Princess Taiping put out from Keelung's Bisha Fishing Port on June 26, 2008
and had made port calls in Japan, the west coast of the United States, Hawaii
and Saipan over the past 10 months.</P>
      <P>It departed from Naha, Okinawa Saturday for Taiwan and was scheduled to return
to Bisha later Sunday to complete a cross-Pacific voyage that would have set a
record as the first by a rebuilt Ming Dynasty sailing junk without mechanical
power.</P>
      <P>Liu, 62, a local yacht skipper, became the first Taiwanese to accomplish a
round-the-world voyage by yacht in 2001, completing the feat in 877 days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Stainless steel producers expect market recovery</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Leading stainless producers in Taiwan on Sunday reported substantially improved
sales in April, kindling hopes that the market has at least touched the bottom,
if not yet started to rebound.</P>
      <P>Yieh United Steel Corp. in Kaohsiung County -- the largest integrated stainless
steel mill in Southeast Asia with an annual capacity of 1 million metric tons --
indicated that thanks to rising international nickel prices, its stainless steel
supply in April is expected to reach 70,000 metric tons.</P>
      <P>The estimated volume for April is a significant increase from the historical
monthly lows of 40,000 tons in January and February and around 60,000 tons in
March, the mill said.</P>
      <P>Tang Eng Iron Works Co. in Kaohsiung, a specialized producer of stainless steel
with an annual capacity is 260,000 metric tons, also reported that its capacity
utilization rate has increased from 20 percent in February to 80 percent in
April, with total production in April estimated to triple to 24,000 metric tons
from the monthly average of the first quarter.</P>
      <P>Both Yieh United and Tang Eng hiked their stainless steel prices in mid-April,
prompting a wave of price increases by downstream producers, including Yeun
Chyang Industrial Co., Froch Enterprise Co., Chien Shing Stainless Steel Co.,
Yeou Yih Steel Co., Sinkang Industries Co., Ta Chen Stainless Pipe Co., and
Rodex Fasteners Corp.</P>
      <P>Most producers said they believe that as long as nickel prices remain above
US$10,000 per metric ton in May and June, their monthly revenues in the second
quarter will continue to recover.</P>
      <P>Stainless-steel producers use about two-thirds of global nickel supplies, as the
alloy contains up to 9 percent nickel, which accounts for about half of total
stainless-steel production costs.</P>
      <P>Nickel traded at an average price of US$9,686 per ton in January on the London
Metal Exchange and rose 15 percent to slightly above US$10,000 per ton in
February and mid-March before dipping below US$10,000 per ton again in late
March.</P>
      <P>The prices soared again in April and broke US$12,000 per ton a week ago, setting
a new high for this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's public health authorities on Sunday heightened preventive measures
against the threat of swine influenza, in light of outbreaks of human infections
with swine flu in Mexico and the United States.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Cabinet-level Department of
Health announced that it has raised its travel advisory for Mexico to a
"regional pandemic" alert against swine flu.</P>
      <P>CDC officials  said Taiwan  travelers  should  take strong precautionary
measures against swine flu before and after visits to Mexico.</P>
      <P>They said Taiwan visitors to California and Texas in the U.S. should also be on
high alert against the disease.</P>
      <P>The CDC said it is keeping in close contact with the World Health Organization
(WHO) to obtain updates on the spread and control of swine flu. This information
is being obtained under the International Health Regulations (IHR) framework, to
which Taiwan gained entry in early April.</P>
      <P>CDC officials said they will advise Taiwan citizens against making any
unnecessary trips to Mexico and the two U.S. states if the situation in the
affected areas worsens.</P>
      <P>According to the WHO,  the Swine Influenza A/H1N1 viruses characterized in this
outbreak had not been previously detected in pigs or humans.</P>
      <P>The world health regulatory body on Saturday declared the swine flu outbreak in
Mexico and the United States a "public health emergency of international
concern" and urged countries to be on the alert.</P>
      <P>Based on the advice of a WHO emergency committee, Director- general Margaret
Chan recommended that all countries intensify surveillance for unusual outbreaks
of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia, a WHO statement said.</P>
      <P>Through its accession to the IHR -- a framework under the WHO devised to control
the spread of infectious diseases around the globe -- Taiwan is now able for the
first time to directly contact WHO authorities and get first-hand information
about avian flu prevention and control, food security, and the spread and
control of other epidemic diseases.</P>
      <P>Because of China's opposition,  Taiwan had previously been excluded from the
IHR, even though a "universal application" phrase was introduced in the
regulations in 2005 with the firm support of the United  States and Taiwan's
diplomatic  allies,  and the encouragement of the EU and Japan.</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan was only able to obtain information on outbreaks of
communicable diseases or emergencies in the region, including in China and Hong
Kong, on a secondhand basis.</P>
      <P>Under the IHR framework, the WHO will dispatch specialists to Taiwan or invite
Taiwan representatives to meetings called by the WHO in the event of any public
health emergencies  in Taiwan of international concern.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is also allowed to recommend candidates to be included in the IHR group
of specialists.</P>
      <P>The IHR was adopted in May 2005 by the WHA and took effect in June 2007. It
requires all member states to report and address any public health emergencies
of international concern.</P>

      <P>The National Palace Museum (NPM) in suburban Taipei will launch a new "night
feast" program, utilizing its cultural resources to promote creative industry in
line with a government policy.</P>
      <P>Chu Hui-liang, deputy director of the NPM's education promotion department, said
Saturday that the program will be introduced on a trial basis over the next six
months and will target corporate clients and government agencies, offering them
the opportunity to rent the entire venue at NT$220,000 (US$6,510) per night for
an all-inclusive "night feast."</P>
      <P>Each session, once a month, will accommodate groups of up to 100 guests who will
be given a one-hour guided tour of the museum's masterpieces, with in-depth
commentary by art experts, she said.</P>
      <P>After viewing the exhibits, the guests will be offered a wide variety of refined
tea deserts at the museum's tea house on its top floor.</P>
      <P>The evening will climax with a magnificent "night feast" at which three
different types of meals will be served, she said. These will feature health
foods, Chinese herbal medicine and seafood. After the feast, a one-hour concert
of traditional nanguan music and dance will bring the night to a close, Chu
added.</P>
      <P>On Saturday night, the museum staged a trial session, inviting the media and
members of the business community to get the first taste of the event.</P>
      <P>According to Chu, the Government Information Office and the MiTAC Group has each
booked a session.</P>
      <P>The "night feast" program is the second activity of that kind to be launched by
the National Palace Museum since last November when it came up with a "Saturday
Night at NPM" to lure young adults, she said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China signed three pacts and one joint statement  here Sunday through
their top negotiators, with the aim of strengthening cooperation between the two
former civil war rivals.</P>
      <P>During the third round of negotiation between the two sides, Chiang Pin-kung,
chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin,
president of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits,
inked the documents on behalf of Taiwan and China, respectively.</P>
      <P>Notable among the three pacts was one aimed at increasing the current 108 direct
passenger charter flights per week between the two sides to 270.</P>
      <P>Some of these flights would be regular scheduled flights that would take off and
land at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Kaohsiung airport.</P>
      <P>China agreed to open six more destinations for such flights, in addition to the
current 21 cities.</P>
      <P>The number of cargo flights, which now stands at 30 per month, will be increased
to 112.</P>
      <P>In order to accommodate the increased number of flights, the two sides agreed to
set up a new southern route through the flight information region between Taipei
and Guangzhou, and a new northern route through the flight information region
between Taipei and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had proposed that the number of flights be increased to 300 per week
because the load factor of the charter flights had increased from 70.3 percent
when they were launched on Dec. 15, 2008 to 90.6 percent early this month.</P>
      <P>In the second pact, both sides agreed to work together to maintain financial
stability. They agreed to cooperate on the supervision of financial and monetary
management and to begin negotiations on access to their respective markets by
banks, stock brokers and futures companies on each side.</P>
      <P>Analysts believe this agreement will pave the way for a memorandum of
understanding on financial regulatory cooperation between Taiwan and China,
which will in turn lead to the opening of their markets to each other's
financial institutions.</P>
      <P>The third pact concerned cooperation in fighting crime, with both sides agreeing
to help each other in serving judicial documents, and probing and collecting
evidence, and to confirm each other's civil judgments and arbitration awards.</P>
      <P>Most significantly, the two sides agreed to repatriate criminals and suspected
criminals. This aspect of the pact was hailed as a milestone because China has
long been considered a haven for Taiwan criminals, mainly because of the absence
of a repatriation agreement.</P>
      <P>In the joint statement on investment, Taiwan said it would sincerely welcome
Chinese investment, and promised to formulate regulations to facilitate this
process.</P>
      <P>On its part, China agreed to support private investment in Taiwan, and
encouraged eligible Chinese enterprises to make fact-finding tours of Taiwan to
explore investment opportunities there.</P>
      <P>The negotiations began Sunday morning and continued into the afternoon.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, the two sides reviewed the execution of six previous pacts
between them, and explored the possibility of entering into a trade agreement.</P>
      <P>According to SEF Deputy Secretary-General Ma Shaochang, who participated in
Sunday's meeting, both sides agreed to begin negotiations on the proposed trade
agreement at a yet unspecified time.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition parties, notably the Democratic Progressive Party, have
opposed this idea out of concerns that it will compromise the country's
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Sunday's meeting also decided the next round negotiations should take place the
second half of this year in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou hailed the results of the meeting between Chiang
and Chen, during on a visit to Taiwan's southern county of Pingdong Sunday
afternoon.</P>
      <P>He said although Beijing did not agree to the full number of cross-strait
flights proposed by Taipei, and the number of flights between some destinations
would be inadequate,"these issues will be addressed in future negotiations."</P>

      <P>Supermarket chains in China will dispatch a joint procurement mission to Taiwan
next month to buy Taiwan-made food products, the head of an amity organization
of the supermarket chains disclosed Sunday.</P>
      <P>Gu Guojian, secretary-general of the organization, told the Central News Agency
that the organization has asked the City Shop supermarket  chain in Shanghai  to
help its members with the procurement plan.</P>
      <P>Gu said the organization's members are located in Beijing and in other major
cities in different provinces, including Henan, Sichuan, Hubei, Shandong and
Liaoning.</P>
      <P>Cui Yixiong, general manager of City Shop, said he was getting price quotations
from Taiwanese suppliers about various food items the Chinese supermarkets plan
to buy, and that the joint procurement plan is expected to be completed within
one month.</P>
      <P>Cui said that City Shop will send a procurement mission of its own to Taiwan
every two months, starting from June, to meet Shanghai's demand for Taiwan-made
food products.</P>
      <P>Gu and Cui made the disclosure after Chen Yunlin, chairman of the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits --a semi-official body in Beijing that
manages relations  with Taiwan --  told participants in the third meeting
between him and the head of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation in Nanjing that
China will expand its procurement from Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Putting words into action is more important than signing agreements, said two
local academics Sunday, commenting on a pact signed earlier in the day between
Taiwan and China on mutual judicial assistance and cooperation in fighting
crime.</P>
      <P>Prof. Lo Chih-cheng, director of the Department of Political Science of Soochow
University in Taipei City, said the signing of the judicial cooperation and
crime fighting pact was just a formality.</P>
      <P>"What is more important is how the two sides will actually cooperate in this
area," Lo said. "No pact is useful unless there is solid action."</P>
      <P>Lo suggested that China begin by repatriating major Taiwanese fugitives there
and helping Taiwan to return illegal Chinese immigrants who have been detained
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yang Yung-nien, a professor at National Cheng Kung University in Tainan City,
southern Taiwan, said that in his view the pact only deals with principles and
does not detail any concrete plans on how to solve cross-strait criminal cases.</P>
      <P>Yang said currently, there are huge gaps in the judicial and crime investigation
systems between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Noting that judicial
personnel in Taiwan and China have widely differing powers, he said that
implementing the agreement will expose even greater differences.</P>
      <P>"These gaps could only be narrowed if there are more exchanges between the two
sides in actual crime fighting," he added.</P>
      <P>He suggested that in order to achieve long-term benefits, first-line law
enforcement authorities from Taiwan and China should first build a direct
communication channel to facilitate action against crime.</P>
      <P>The agreement was one of three signed in the Chinese city of Nanjing earlier in
the day between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung
and his counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Foreign ministry releases position paper on Taiwan's WHA bid</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has completed a multi-language position
paper to seek global support for Taiwan's bid to gain observer status in the
World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the highest decision-making body of the World
Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>The MOFA is presenting its position paper on the issue in Chinese, English,
Spanish and French to explain to the international community the importance of
Taiwan joining the WHA.</P>
      <P>With the 62nd WHA scheduled for May 18-27 in Geneva, Taiwan is preparing  to
make its 13th consecutive  bid since  1997 for participation in the body. Its
previous attempts have been blocked due to obstruction from China.</P>
      <P>In the position paper, the MOFA said that Taiwan was pleased to be included in
the International Health Regulations (IHR) in January, but added that this is
not enough because the IHR mechanism is limited to the monitoring and control of
infectious diseases.</P>
      <P>Only by taking part in WHO-led exchanges and activities can Taiwan fully engage
with other member states to provide or obtain the latest technology and
information relating to other human health issues such as food safety,  tobacco
hazard control and fake medication eradication, the MOFA said.</P>
      <P>For instance, it added, Taiwan may not be able to share with WHO member states
an anti-H5N1 virus bird flue vaccination that it has been developing since 2005,
even if it begins commercial production, because Taiwan is not yet a WHO member.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan can become an observer in the WHA and further participate in WHO
policy coordination meetings, the country will be able to offer the anti-H5N1
vaccinations to combate avian flu and can make a greater contribution to the
international community, the ministry stated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China signed three pacts and one joint statement  here Sunday through
their top negotiators, with the aim of strengthening cooperation between the two
former civil war rivals.</P>
      <P>During the third round of negotiation between the two sides, Chiang Pin-kung,
chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and Chen Yunlin,
president of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits,
inked the documents on behalf of Taiwan and China, respectively.</P>
      <P>Notable among the three pacts was one aimed at increasing the current 108 direct
passenger charter flights per week between the two sides to 270.</P>
      <P>Some of these flights would be regular scheduled flights that would take off and
land at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and Kaohsiung airport.</P>
      <P>China agreed to open six more destinations for such flights, in addition to the
current 21 cities.</P>
      <P>The number of cargo flights, which now stands at 30 per month, will be increased
to 112.</P>
      <P>In order to accommodate the increased number of flights, the two sides agreed to
set up a new southern route through the flight information region between Taipei
and Guangzhou, and a new northern route through the flight information region
between Taipei and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had proposed that the number of flights be increased to 300 per week
because the load factor of the charter flights had increased from 70.3 percent
when they were launched on Dec. 15, 2008 to 90.6 percent early this month.</P>

      <P>During the meeting, the two sides reviewed the execution of six previous pacts
between them, and explored the possibility of entering into a trade agreement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator Chiang Pin-kung said after the meeting that his Chinese
counterpart Chen Yunlin didn't rule out the possibility for talks on the
proposed trade agreement.</P>
      <P>However Chiang quoted Chen as saying that bilateral economical exchanges should
begin from easy things such as those issues raised in previous bilateral
negotiations but had not yet been addressed.</P>
      <P>Taipei authorities are eager to talk with China on such a pact out of concerns
that it might be excluded from a regional economic bloc to be formed between
China and Association of Southeast Asian Nations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's opposition parties, notably the Democratic Progressive Party, have
opposed this idea, claiming that it will compromise the country's sovereignty.</P>

do not speak out, you lose your opportunity; but when you meet one who is not a
proper person to speak to and you speak to him, you waste your words. A man of
intelligence never loses his opportunity, neither does he waste his words."</TEXT>

      <P>Taiwan hopes to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on financial
supervisory cooperation with China in 60 days, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng said in Nanjing Sunday.</P>
      <P>"An MOU can further facilitate the implementation of the content of the
agreement on financial cooperation that Taiwan and China signed today, " Fu said
after Taiwan and China signed three pacts and one joint statement in the central
Chinese city Sunday.</P>
      <P>In the deal on financial cooperation, Taiwan and China agreed to cooperate  on
financial  institution  supervision  and currency management, set up a cross-
strait currency clearance and settlement mechanism, permit commercial banks to
exchange currency and work together on developing technologies to spot
counterfeit notes, and allow financial institutions to establish branches in
each other's market.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that the MOU and the cross-strait financial cooperaton pact will
take effect simultaneously, " said Fu, who was one of 22 Taiwan officials taking
part in the third round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and
Chen Yunlin, president of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits, signed the documents on behalf of Taiwan and China, respectively.</P>
      <P>Fu said local banks are allowed to exchange, supply, and recirculate the Chinese
currency but are not allowed to have banking links with Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>But with increased bilateral trade between Taiwan and China spurring a growing
flow of money across the Taiwan Strait, Fu hoped a comprehensive currency
clearance and settlement mechanism would be negotiated.</P>
      <P>He said the plan at present is to designate one or two banks from either side as
currency and settlement banks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs John Deng said Monday he welcomed
the joint statement on investment made at the talks in Nanjing, saying that
increased Chinese investment in Taiwan will help facilitate Taiwan's
liberalization policy toward China.</P>
      <P>"Once the policy is put into practice, representatives from Chinese business
sectors will visit Taiwan to understand the local investment climate," Deng
said.</P>
      <P>The administration can exchange views with the Chinese business leaders at that
time and gather their opinions as a reference in adjusting Taiwan's investment
policies, he added.</P>
      <P>China agreed to support private investment in Taiwan, and encouraged eligible
Chinese enterprises to make fact-finding tours of Taiwan to explore investment
opportunities there.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level  National Youth Commission  (NYC) ,  in  collaboration  with
local  nonprofit organizations, launched a program Monday to encourage people
aged 15-30 to take an educational journey around Taiwan and explore their roots.</P>
      <P>"Given that many young people in Taiwan do not have in-depth knowledge about the
country, we hope this program will provide them a whole new way of exploring
Taiwan," said NYC minister Wang Yu-ting at a news conference to promote the
"Youth Travel Spots in Taiwan -- Grand Tour" program.</P>
      <P>The program also aims at boosting the competitiveness of people in the age group
because they can learn as much from society as in the classroom, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"The youngsters should begin their grand tour of life by learning about their
homeland before heading to other parts of the world," she said.</P>
      <P>The Grand Tour program, which lists 29 destinations in Taiwan that one must

      <P>The man who threw his 10-month-old baby girl into boiling water April 18 was
indicted Monday on murder charges, with Changhua prosecutors recommending he be
sentenced to life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>If convicted, the 47-year-old man surnamed Huang could spend the rest of his
life in jail and have his political rights severed for his action, which shook
up Taiwanese society for its sheer cruelty and raised concerns over increasing
violence against children.</P>
      <P>The girl, who suffered second and third-degree burns over 84 percent of her
body, was pronounced dead after doctors, with the consent of her mother, took
her off a life-support system at 10: 05 a.m.. last Tuesday, according to
Changhua Christian Hospital in central Taiwan's Changhua City.</P>
      <P>Huang has been detained by the Changhua District Prosecutors Office since April
18, when the incident occurred. During a fierce argument between the couple,
prompted when the girl's mother criticized Huang for being lazy, the mother
dared Huang to throw the girl into a pot of boiling water, and he complied.</P>
      <P>The infant's mother, identified only by her family name of Lin, immediately got
the baby out of the pot in the noodle shop they owned and rushed the girl to a
nearby police station for help. The police immediately transferred the baby to
the hospital's burn center.</P>
      <P>The couple, who were not married but had lived together for 12 years, also have
an older daughter, who is in the fifth grade. County social welfare officials
placed the fifth grader with a foster family following the incident.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Flights between Taipei, Shanghai city airports to be discussed</HEADLINE>

      <P>The opening of direct charter flights between Taipei's Songshan Airport and
Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport will be discussed in the next round of cross-Taiwan
Strait aviation negotiations, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Potential travelers were disappointed that Songshan Airport was only allocated
21 direct cross-strait flights a week in an agreement reached at the latest
round of negotiations between Taiwan and China in Nanjing Sunday, even though
the number of direct flights was increased from 108 to 270 per week.</P>
      <P>Songshan Airport, in the northeastern part of Taipei, served as the country's
international airport until 1979. It has exclusively handled domestic flights
since then but was opened to direct charter flights from China last year when
air links between the two countries were liberalized.</P>
      <P>Located a short drive away from most of Taipei's commercial centers, compared to
the 50-minute drive between the city and Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport,
the airport is favored by business travelers for its convenience.</P>
      <P>Explaining the small number of flights to and from China allocated to the
airport, CAA officials said they wanted to reserve the airport's capacity for
potential flights from other city airports in Asia, such as Shanghai's Hongqiao
Airport,  Tokyo's Haneda International Airport and Seoul's Kimpo Internatinal
Airport.</P>
      <P>Songshan Airport was also not included in the agreement among airports allowed
to handle regularly scheduled flights.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said Songshan Airport is only allowed to operate direct cross-
strait charter flights because regular scheduled flights can transport cargo,
but Songshan Airport's facilities are not capable of handling cargo at present.</P>
      <P>Aside from increasing flight numbers, the avaiation agreement -- one of the
three agreements and one joint statement concluded by Taiwan and China to
further strengthen bilateral cooperation -- established regularly scheduled
flights and opened six more Chinese destinations, bringing the total to 27.</P>
      <P>The number of cargo flights, which now stands at 30 per month, will be increased
to 112.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had proposed that the number of flights be increased to 300 per week
because the load factor of the charter flights had increased from 70.3 percent
when they were launched on Dec. 15, 2008 to 90.6 percent early this month.</P>

      <P>A new pact signed between Taiwan and China Sunday on mutual judicial  assistance
paves the way for the extradition of at least 84 Taiwanese fugitives hiding in
China, according to information provided by the Investigation Bureau under the
Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement -- one of three signed in the Chinese city of Nanjing
between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his
counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits -- the two sides will assist each other on judicial matters
and cooperate in fighting crime.</P>

Business Bank in 1998 to broker an illegal NT$1.5 billion (US$44.22 million)
loan to the Kuangsan Group in exchange for an NT$150 million bribe.</P>
      <P>--Tycoon Tseng Cheng-jen, who fled to China in June 2004 a week after he was
sentenced to 11 years in prison in the same illegal loan case that implicated
Liu.</P>
      <P>--Chen Yu-hao, former head of the Tuntex Group, wanted for questioning on
charges that he stole NT$800 million from a group subsidiary in 1995 to invest
in his own name in China. He and his wife fled Taiwan in 2002 and are believed
to be living in China.</P>
      <P>--Former Kaohsiung Mayor Wang Yu-yun, indicted in June 2000 for an illegal NT$8

      <P>Chinese companies will soon be allowed to apply to register businesses in
Taiwan, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs John Deng said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan Economics Committee, Deng said that a bill
governing Chinese businesses establishing affiliates or branches in Taiwan has
been drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and submitted to the
Executive Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>"Several rounds of inter-division meetings have been convened on the matter and
the regulations are expected to be formally publicized by the administration for
implementation as soon as final procedures are completed," Deng told lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Deng was responding to a question raised by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Ting
Shou-chung concerning Taiwan's plans to open the country to Chinese capital and
investment.</P>
      <P>Ting criticized the government for planning to allow Chinese citizens to invest
but not having come up with regulations to govern Chinese people establishing
businesses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"How can Chinese capital enter Taiwan if Chinese citizens are not even allowed
to establish a company here in the first place? " Ting questioned.</P>
      <P>Ting said China Eastern Airlines had planned to lease a Cathay Life building to
be used as its Taiwan headquarters, but the plan was aborted because the two
companies could not find any domestic legal basis to use in finalizing the
transaction.</P>
      <P>Ting said the failed deal cost Taiwan 40 to 50 jobs and attributed it to the
negligence of relevant administrative agencies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan urged the public Monday to remain calm despite
outbreaks of human infections of swine flu in Mexico and the United States,
saying that so far, no-one in Taiwan is known to be infected and that the
Department of Health (DOH) is watching developments closely.</P>
      <P>The DOH also declared the viruses characterized in the swine flu outbreak as new
subtypes of the H1N1 virus, a level-one legal infectious disease that requires
immediate reporting by hospitals when they encounter such cases, according to
Yeh.</P>
      <P>His remarks were quoted by Government Information Office Minister Su Jun-bin
after attending an inter-government agency meeting hosted by Vice Premier Chiu
Cheng-hsiung on coordinating information and preventive measures against the
threat of swine flu.</P>
      <P>"So far there have been no human infections in Taiwan. People should not panic
about the outbreak but should stay alert," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>He added that under the framework of the International Health Regulations, to
which Taiwan gained entry in early April, the DOH is maintaining close contact
with the World Health Organization (WHO) to obtain updates on the spread and
control of swine flu.</P>
      <P>The DOH will take countermeasures in accordance with the WHO after as soon as it
updates the latest situation, expected the following day, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the DOH raised a
travel advisory for Mexico to a "regional pandemic" alert against swine flu.</P>
      <P>CDC officials said Taiwanese travelers  should take strong precautionary
measures against swine flu before and after visits to Mexico.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) also issued a yellow travel alert for
Mexico that same day, the third-highest travel advisory that warns travelers to
exercise caution.</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry is collecting relevant information and watching closely
the development of the swine flu outbreaks in Mexico. Necessary measures will be
taken after the WHO meeting scheduled for tomorrow," MOFA spokesman Henry Chen
told CNA.</P>
      <P>As to concerns about eating pork, Lee Chao-chuan, head of the Tainan City Animal
Health Inspection Institute, said there is no safety concern, as long as the
pork is properly cooked at over 70 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>Given that there have been no swine flu cases reported in Taiwan, Lee said the
first and most important step is to contain the disease abroad. All pig farms
should boost quarantine measures, including disinfection and personnel controls,
he added.</P>
      <P>The outbraeks of swine flu in Mexico have spread to other parts of the world,
raising concerns that it could turn into a global pandemic. The U.S. has
declared a "public health emergency" with 20 confirmed cases, while Mexico has
more than 100 deaths and 1,600 illnesses attributed to the virus.</P>
      <P>Canada and New Zealand have also reported human infections while suspected cases
have been identified in Israel, Spain and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The WHO has declared the flu a "public health emergency of international
concern."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Museum of History said in a newsletter released Monday that it is
scheduled to launch an exhibition in May on Taiwan's coffee culture, which took
root during the 1896-1945 Japanese colonial period.</P>
      <P>"The aim of this exhibition is to reconstruct this unique aspect of Taiwan's
cultural space and to present the influences and underlying meanings of coffee
houses in the early years of Japanese rule," the newsletter said.</P>
      <P>Although the coffee house is mainly considered to be a product of Western
culture, the formation of Taiwan's coffee culture is closely connected to Japan.
In the early years of Japanese rule, coffee houses in Taiwan were mostly run by
Japanese people and were mostly located in an area of Taipei known at the time
as the Sakaemachi, around what is known today as Heng Yang Road, according to
the National Museum of History.</P>
      <P>Later, when local students would return to Taiwan after studying overseas,
bringing with them their greater understanding of Western culture, Taiwanese
people began to run coffee houses on their own, including names that became
famous, such as Werther, Tianma Teahouse and Bolero, it added.</P>
      <P>"Despite being called coffee houses, they were in fact more like restaurants and
cabarets -- places catering to Western forms of recreation," the museum said,
adding that it will also introduce the coffee growing area of Gukeng township in
Central Taiwan's Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, titled "Early Taiwanese Coffee Culture," will run May 27- June
14 from 10 a.m-6 p.m. every day except Monday.</P>
      <P>Other museum draws to open in May will include an exhibition on the transition
of Buddhist statuary featuring gold and bronze statuettes and an exhibition of
ancient Chinese jade, the museum added.</P>

      <P>Should the swine influenza outbreak in Mexico spread around the world, it could
cause much more significant harm to human society than avian flu ever could, a
Taiwanese stock disease expert warned Monday.</P>
      <P>In response to media inquiries over recent outbreaks of swine flu in the United
States and Mexico, Lai Shiow-suey, a former veterinary medicine professor at
National Taiwan University, expressed concern about the recombination of
different strains of flu virus in pigs.</P>
      <P>Describing a pig's body as a big factory, Lai stated that if three different
virus strains recombine with each other in pigs, they will transform into a new,
more virulent strain.</P>
      <P>Lai said that since pigs share similar physical functions and heredity with
humans, they can easily pass on the new strain of flu virus to humans, from
which the virus can be further spread through human-to-human transmission.</P>
      <P>"It is dreadful; it seems the worst senario has happened, " he said, referring
to the recent swine flu outbreaks in Mexico where over 100 people are believed
to have died and more than 1,600 have been sickened by the virus, a recombinant
of the H1N1 flu strain.</P>
      <P>Lai recalled an earlier outbreak of H1N1 swine flu reported in the U.S. state of
New Jersey in 1976 that infected 230 new military recruits, killing one of them.
That outbreak prompted the U.S. government to administer vaccinations, but the
outbreak still lasted for more than two months, he said.</P>
      <P>The latest outbreak in Mexico will likely cause greater harm than the one in
1976 because "the strain of virus is much more vicious, " Lai said.</P>
      <P>He warned people who have recently returned from the United States and Mexico to
stay away from pig farms, and that people in the hog-raising industry should be
on their guard against an outbreak.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's public health authorities heightened preventive measures against the
threat of swine flu Sunday, with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) raising
its travel advisory for Mexico to the level of a"regional pandemic" alert
against the flu.</P>
      <P>Symptoms of the disease include fever, aches, coughing, sore throat, respiratory
congestion and in some cases vomiting and diarrhea.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire services,  the virus is usually contracted through
direct contact with pigs, but Joseph Domenech, chief of animal health services
at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Agency in Rome, said all indications so far are
that the virus is being spread through human-to-human transmission.</P>
      <P>There is no vaccine that protects specifically against swine flu and it is
unclear how much protection the current human flu vaccines can offer.</P>

      <P>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office donated NT$7.5 million (US$221,890) of
public funds Monday to the Taichung City government to provide meals for
impoverished students during the summer vacation period.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu thanked the prosecutors for their generosity and strong
support for his proposal that the office use the funds -- recovered from petty
offenders in return for deferred prosecution -- to help the cash-strapped city
government launch the program.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, the city government plans to use the money to issue lunch
vouchers to students from the city's impoverished families during the coming
summer vacation.</P>
      <P>It will be the second program of its kind carried out by the city following
initial success with a similar program implemented over the last winter
vacation, Hu noted.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chang Dou-hui said that under the instruction of the Ministry of
Justice, the Taichung District Prosecutors Office has made cash donations of the
public funds to some 40 welfare groups in the Taichung area and he voiced hope
that more enterprises and groups will collaborate with the city government in
efforts to aid students in need.</P>
      <P>The city's education department estimated that there are about 7,000 needy
elementary and junior high students in the city, and said it plans to distribute
about 408,000 lunch vouchers during the summer vacation.</P>
      <P>In a similar move, the Chiayi District Prosecutors Office in southern Taiwan had
as of April 16 granted scholarships to 150 local students from the area from the
beginning of the year using money collected in the same way.</P>
      <P>The scholarships ranged from NT$2,000 (US$60) for each junior high school
student to NT$1,000 for each elementary school student per semester.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi Prosecutors Office has NT$10 million (US$298,000) at its disposal
this year raised from deferred prosecution payments, a spokesman for the office
said in early January when the office sponsored an activity to help impoverished
families celebrate the Lunar New Year.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi Prosecutors Office has been funding local charitable groups to help
them pay for social services for local residents since 2006, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutor detained for second time on suspicion of bribery</HEADLINE>

      <P>A public prosecutor in Taitung, southeastern Taiwan, who was released on bail
five days ago pending further investigation into his alleged acceptance of
bribes, was detained again Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taitung Public Prosecutors' Office took Lin Sheng-lin into custody Sunday
night for questioning on the strength of new evidence implicating him in a
second bribery case and sought permission from the Taitung District Court again
to keep him in custody.</P>
      <P>The court granted the permission Monday after reviewing the arguments submitted
by the prosecutors' office that Lin tried to contact witnesses and defendants in
the bribery cases, through his father, in an apparent attempt to collude with
them.</P>
      <P>On April 22, Lin was released on bail of NT$500,000 (US$14,760) after being
taken into custody a day earlier to answer charges that he had accepted bribes
from suspects who should have been indicted in criminal cases that he handled.
At the time, the court ruled that there was no need to keep Lin in detention,
even though he could face at least five years in prison if convicted.</P>
      <P>On that day, the court also set bail at NT$200,000 for Wu Dong-sheng, a broker
whom prosecutors said assisted Lin in obtaining bribes. The court ruled that
both Lin and Wu are not allowed to leave the country.</P>
      <P>According to the Taitung Public Prosecutors' Office, Lin was reassigned from the
Shihlin Public Prosecutors' Office in Taipei to work in Taitung in August last
year because he left too many criminal cases unhandled.</P>
      <P>Ethics officers at the Taitung prosecutors' office placed Lin under surveillance
after noting that he continued to allow the accumulation of many cases, and that
he had dismissed quite a few cases that he should have prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Further investigation led to the admission by several suspects in at least two
criminal cases that Lin had offered not to indict them in return for bribes.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) raised the level of its travel alert for
Mexico City to orange Monday, urging prospective travelers to defer their plans
for the time being in light of an outbreak of human infections of swine flu
there.</P>
      <P>The ministry had originally issued a yellow travel alert for Mexico, the lowest
level advisory that warns travelers to exercise caution.</P>
      <P>However, the MOFA decided to raise the alert for Mexico's capital to orange, the
second-highest level, in view of the latest reports that the swine flu outbreak
is most serious in Mexico City and has spread to other parts of the world, MOFA
officials said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, they added, World Health Organizations (WHO) officials have warned
that there is a potential for the new swine flu virus to become a global
pandemic.</P>
      <P>On the ministry's three-color travel advisory scale, an orange alert suggests
that would-be travelers should suspend their travel plans over safety or health
concerns.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA statistics, an average of 3,000 to 4,000 Taiwanese citizens
apply for visas to Mexico annually, most of whom intend to travel to Mexico City
for business or sightseeing purposes.</P>
      <P>In support of the ongoing global campaign to contain the spread of the new H1N1
swine flu virus and out of local health concerns, residents of Taiwan are
advised to refrain from traveling to Mexico City for the time being, the
officials warned.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they said the MOFA will maintain its yellow alert for other areas and
cities of Mexico, and urged would-be travelers to exercise a high degree of
caution.</P>
      <P>As of late Sunday, the number of suspected swine flu cases in Mexico had climbed
to 1,614, including as many as 103 deaths, according to Mexican Health Secretary
Jose Angel Cordova. The United States has confirmed at least 11 cases of swine
flu, and Canada six cases.</P>
      <P>The Mexican City government has ordered suspension of all public activities and
closure of all libraries, museums, theaters and other public places. It has also
closed schools of all levels until May 6.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan stepped up its epidemic prevention efforts Monday amid reports of a
further spread of human infections of swine flu globally.</P>
      <P>An outbreak of human infections of swine flu was first reported in Mexico March
18 and the number of related deaths has exceeded 100 so far.  Several confirmed
cases were also reported  in the southwestern part of the United States and
Canada. Suspected cases were reported in Brazil, Spain and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>World Health Organization (WHO) officials have warned that there is a potential
for the new H1N1 swine virus to become a global pandemic.</P>
      <P>No cases of the disease have been reported in Taiwan, but the government is on
heightened alert, with the Executive Yuan calling a supraministerial meeting
Monday morning to coordinate preventive measures in hopes of averting any
possible outbreak of human infections of the new swine flu strain.</P>
      <P>Addressing the meeting, Vice Premiser Chiu Cheng-hsiung directed the Ministry of
the Interior and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to tighten
fever screening at airports and harbors to ward off entry of the virus from
abroad.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health (DOH) later
listed human infections of swine flu as a level-one notifiable disease in line
with the WHO's definition of the new swine flu strain.</P>
      <P>From now on,  DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said,  medical institutions are
obligated to report suspected swine flu cases to facilitate tracking and
prevention of an epidemic.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Liu Chao-hsiuan will make an inspection tour of Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport to see for himself epidemic preventive measures
there.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs raised th level of its travel
alert for Mexico City to the second-highest orange level Monday, urging
prospective travelers to defer their travel plans for the time being in light of
the wine flu outbreak there.</P>
      <P>Economics officials prdicted that the new swine flu outbreak could delay a
global economic recovery and add uncertainty if the outbreak became serious in
the United States.</P>
      <P>As Taipei will sponsor the 2009 Deaflympics in September, city councilors have
urged the city government to take precautionary measures to cope with the
situation.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, DOH Minister Yeh said local people need not overreact to the swine
flu scare because no suspected cases of swine flu or human infections of the
virus have ever been reported in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan hopes to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on financial
supervisory cooperation with China in 60 days, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Vice Chairman Fu Dong-cheng said in Nanjing Sunday.</P>
      <P>"An MOU can further facilitate the implementation of the content of the
agreement on financial cooperation that Taiwan and China signed today, " Fu said
after Taiwan and China signed three pacts and one joint statement in the central
Chinese city Sunday.</P>
      <P>In the deal on financial cooperation, Taiwan and China agreed to cooperate  on
financial  institution  supervision  and currency management, set up a cross-
strait currency clearance and settlement mechanism, permit commercial banks to
exchange currency and work together on developing technologies to spot
counterfeit notes, and allow financial institutions to establish branches in
each other's market.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that the MOU and the cross-strait financial cooperaton pact will
take effect simultaneously, " said Fu, who was one of 22 Taiwan officials taking
part in the third round of cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , and
Chen Yunlin, president of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits, signed the documents on behalf of Taiwan and China, respectively.</P>
      <P>Fu said local banks are allowed to exchange, supply, and recirculate the Chinese
currency but are not allowed to have banking links with Chinese counterparts.</P>
      <P>But with increased bilateral trade between Taiwan and China spurring a growing
flow of money across the Taiwan Strait, Fu hoped a comprehensive currency
clearance and settlement mechanism would be negotiated.</P>
      <P>He said the plan at present is to designate one or two banks from either side as
currency and settlement banks.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs John Deng said Monday he welcomed
the joint statement on investment made at the talks in Nanjing, saying that
increased Chinese investment in Taiwan will help facilitate Taiwan's
liberalization policy toward China.</P>
      <P>"Once the policy is put into practice, representatives from Chinese business
sectors will visit Taiwan to understand the local investment climate," Deng
said.</P>
      <P>The administration can exchange views with the Chinese business leaders at that
time and gather their opinions as a reference in adjusting Taiwan's investment
policies, he added.</P>
      <P>China agreed to support private investment in Taiwan, and encouraged eligible
Chinese enterprises to make fact-finding tours of Taiwan to explore investment
opportunities there.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level  National Youth Commission  (NYC) ,  in  collaboration  with
local  nonprofit organizations, launched a program Monday to encourage people
aged 15-30 to take an educational journey around Taiwan and explore their roots.</P>
      <P>"Given that many young people in Taiwan do not have in-depth knowledge about the
country, we hope this program will provide them a whole new way of exploring
Taiwan," said NYC minister Wang Yu-ting at a news conference to promote the
"Youth Travel Spots in Taiwan -- Grand Tour" program.</P>
      <P>The program also aims at boosting the competitiveness of people in the age group
because they can learn as much from society as in the classroom, Wang said.</P>
      <P>"The youngsters should begin their grand tour of life by learning about their
homeland before heading to other parts of the world," she said.</P>
      <P>The Grand Tour program, which lists 29 destinations in Taiwan that one must
visit before the age of 30, covers activities exposing travelers to local eco-
systems, indigenous cultures, humanitarian care and artistic events.</P>
      <P>Lahuy Icyeh, a member of the Atayal tribe who just finished his post-graduate
studies, said at the news conference that in his trip to Smangus Village in
Hsinchu County, he not only immersed himself in the beauty of nature but also
learned about the spirit of sharing in indigenous cultures.</P>
      <P>"Learning about multiple cultures is a mandatory course that everyone must
take," he said.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsin-wen, who joined an aboriginal hunter school and took a 20-kilometer
journey in Yilan County's Hapen forest, said that the journey taught her about
respecting all living creatures and the concept of sustainability.</P>
      <P>According to the NYC, the first group of participants in the program will
receive a10 percent discount. They can also submit their travel journals and
pictures to http: //youthtravel.tw/grandtour by Aug. 31 as part of a
competition.</P>
      <P>Underprivileged and low-income people in the 15-30 age bracket can receive as
much as NT$30,000  (US$889)  in subsidies  by participating in programs that
work with local charities.</P>

      <P>The man who threw his 10-month-old baby girl into boiling water April 18 was
indicted Monday on murder charges, with Changhua prosecutors recommending he be
sentenced to life imprisonment.</P>
      <P>If convicted, the 47-year-old man surnamed Huang could spend the rest of his
life in jail and have his political rights severed for his action, which shook
up Taiwanese society for its sheer cruelty and raised concerns over increasing
violence against children.</P>
      <P>The girl, who suffered second and third-degree burns over 84 percent of her
body, was pronounced dead after doctors, with the consent of her mother, took
her off a life-support system at 10: 05 a.m.. last Tuesday, according to
Changhua Christian Hospital in central Taiwan's Changhua City.</P>
      <P>Huang has been detained by the Changhua District Prosecutors Office since April
18, when the incident occurred. During a fierce argument between the couple,
prompted when the girl's mother criticized Huang for being lazy, the mother
dared Huang to throw the girl into a pot of boiling water, and he complied.</P>
      <P>The infant's mother, identified only by her family name of Lin, immediately got
the baby out of the pot in the noodle shop they owned and rushed the girl to a
nearby police station for help. The police immediately transferred the baby to
the hospital's burn center.</P>
      <P>The couple, who were not married but had lived together for 12 years, also have
an older daughter, who is in the fifth grade. County social welfare officials
placed the fifth grader with a foster family following the incident.</P>

the number of direct flights was increased from 108 to 270 per week.</P>
      <P>Songshan Airport, in the northeastern part of Taipei, served as the country's
international airport until 1979. It has exclusively handled domestic flights
since then but was opened to direct charter flights from China last year when
air links between the two countries were liberalized.</P>
      <P>Located a short drive away from most of Taipei's commercial centers, compared to
the 50-minute drive between the city and Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport,
the airport is favored by business travelers for its convenience.</P>
      <P>Explaining the small number of flights to and from China allocated to the
airport, CAA officials said they wanted to reserve the airport's capacity for
potential flights from other city airports in Asia, such as Shanghai's Hongqiao
Airport,  Tokyo's Haneda International Airport and Seoul's Kimpo Internatinal
Airport.</P>
      <P>Songshan Airport was also not included in the agreement among airports allowed
to handle regularly scheduled flights.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said Songshan Airport is only allowed to operate direct cross-
strait charter flights because regular scheduled flights can transport cargo,
but Songshan Airport's facilities are not capable of handling cargo at present.</P>
      <P>Aside from increasing flight numbers, the avaiation agreement -- one of the
three agreements and one joint statement concluded by Taiwan and China to
further strengthen bilateral cooperation -- established regularly scheduled
flights and opened six more Chinese destinations, bringing the total to 27.</P>
      <P>The number of cargo flights, which now stands at 30 per month, will be increased
to 112.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had proposed that the number of flights be increased to 300 per week
because the load factor of the charter flights had increased from 70.3 percent
when they were launched on Dec. 15, 2008 to 90.6 percent early this month.</P>

      <P>A new pact signed between Taiwan and China Sunday on mutual judicial  assistance
paves the way for the extradition of at least 84 Taiwanese fugitives hiding in
China, according to information provided by the Investigation Bureau under the
Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>Under the agreement -- one of three signed in the Chinese city of Nanjing
between Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and his
counterpart Chen Yunlin, president of China's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits -- the two sides will assist each other on judicial matters
and cooperate in fighting crime.</P>

and help with the repatriation of wanted criminals.</P>
      <P>According to the Investigation Bureau, many of Taiwan's most wanted fugitives
have fled to China. Its files show that at least 84 convicted criminals may be
hiding there.</P>
      <P>The most prominent among these criminals include:</P>
      <P>--Former Legislative Yuan Speaker Liu Sung-pan, who was sentenced to four years
in prison and fined NT$30 million in September 2004 for breach of trust.</P>
      <P>He was found guilty of using his status as the former chairman of Taichung
Business Bank in 1998 to broker an illegal NT$1.5 billion (US$44.22 million)
loan to the Kuangsan Group in exchange for an NT$150 million bribe.</P>
      <P>--Tycoon Tseng Cheng-jen, who fled to China in June 2004 a week after he was
sentenced to 11 years in prison in the same illegal loan case that implicated
Liu.</P>
      <P>--Chen Yu-hao, former head of the Tuntex Group, wanted for questioning on
charges that he stole NT$800 million from a group subsidiary in 1995 to invest
in his own name in China. He and his wife fled Taiwan in 2002 and are believed
to be living in China.</P>

      <P>Chinese companies will soon be allowed to apply to register businesses in
Taiwan, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs John Deng said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Legislative Yuan Economics Committee, Deng said that a bill
governing Chinese businesses establishing affiliates or branches in Taiwan has
been drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and submitted to the
Executive Yuan for approval.</P>
      <P>"Several rounds of inter-division meetings have been convened on the matter and
the regulations are expected to be formally publicized by the administration for
implementation as soon as final procedures are completed," Deng told lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Deng was responding to a question raised by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Ting
Shou-chung concerning Taiwan's plans to open the country to Chinese capital and
investment.</P>
      <P>Ting criticized the government for planning to allow Chinese citizens to invest
but not having come up with regulations to govern Chinese people establishing
businesses in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"How can Chinese capital enter Taiwan if Chinese citizens are not even allowed
to establish a company here in the first place? " Ting questioned.</P>
      <P>Ting said China Eastern Airlines had planned to lease a Cathay Life building to
be used as its Taiwan headquarters, but the plan was aborted because the two
companies could not find any domestic legal basis to use in finalizing the
transaction.</P>
      <P>Ting said the failed deal cost Taiwan 40 to 50 jobs and attributed it to the
negligence of relevant administrative agencies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan urged the public Monday to remain calm despite
outbreaks of human infections of swine flu in Mexico and the United States,
saying that so far, no-one in Taiwan is known to be infected and that the
Department of Health (DOH) is watching developments closely.</P>
      <P>The DOH also declared the viruses characterized in the swine flu outbreak as new
subtypes of the H1N1 virus, a level-one legal infectious disease that requires
immediate reporting by hospitals when they encounter such cases, according to
Yeh.</P>
      <P>His remarks were quoted by Government Information Office Minister Su Jun-bin
after attending an inter-government agency meeting hosted by Vice Premier Chiu
Cheng-hsiung on coordinating information and preventive measures against the
threat of swine flu.</P>
      <P>"So far there have been no human infections in Taiwan. People should not panic
about the outbreak but should stay alert," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>He added that under the framework of the International Health Regulations, to
which Taiwan gained entry in early April, the DOH is maintaining close contact
with the World Health Organization (WHO) to obtain updates on the spread and
control of swine flu.</P>
      <P>The DOH will take countermeasures in accordance with the WHO after as soon as it
updates the latest situation, expected the following day, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the DOH raised a
travel advisory for Mexico to a "regional pandemic" alert against swine flu.</P>
      <P>CDC officials said Taiwanese travelers  should take strong precautionary
measures against swine flu before and after visits to Mexico.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) also issued a yellow travel alert for
Mexico that same day, the third-highest travel advisory that warns travelers to
exercise caution.</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry is collecting relevant information and watching closely
the development of the swine flu outbreaks in Mexico. Necessary measures will be
taken after the WHO meeting scheduled for tomorrow," MOFA spokesman Henry Chen
told CNA.</P>
      <P>As to concerns about eating pork, Lee Chao-chuan, head of the Tainan City Animal
Health Inspection Institute, said there is no safety concern, as long as the
pork is properly cooked at over 70 degrees Celsius.</P>
      <P>Given that there have been no swine flu cases reported in Taiwan, Lee said the
first and most important step is to contain the disease abroad. All pig farms
should boost quarantine measures, including disinfection and personnel controls,
he added.</P>
      <P>The outbraeks of swine flu in Mexico have spread to other parts of the world,
raising concerns that it could turn into a global pandemic. The U.S. has
declared a "public health emergency" with 20 confirmed cases, while Mexico has
more than 100 deaths and 1,600 illnesses attributed to the virus.</P>
      <P>Canada and New Zealand have also reported human infections while suspected cases
have been identified in Israel, Spain and the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The WHO has declared the flu a "public health emergency of international
concern."</P>

    <HEADLINE>History museum to launch exhibition on Taiwan's coffee culture</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Museum of History said in a newsletter released Monday that it is
scheduled to launch an exhibition in May on Taiwan's coffee culture, which took
root during the 1896-1945 Japanese colonial period.</P>
      <P>"The aim of this exhibition is to reconstruct this unique aspect of Taiwan's
cultural space and to present the influences and underlying meanings of coffee
houses in the early years of Japanese rule," the newsletter said.</P>
      <P>Although the coffee house is mainly considered to be a product of Western
culture, the formation of Taiwan's coffee culture is closely connected to Japan.
In the early years of Japanese rule, coffee houses in Taiwan were mostly run by
Japanese people and were mostly located in an area of Taipei known at the time
as the Sakaemachi, around what is known today as Heng Yang Road, according to
the National Museum of History.</P>
      <P>Later, when local students would return to Taiwan after studying overseas,
bringing with them their greater understanding of Western culture, Taiwanese
people began to run coffee houses on their own, including names that became
famous, such as Werther, Tianma Teahouse and Bolero, it added.</P>
      <P>"Despite being called coffee houses, they were in fact more like restaurants and
cabarets -- places catering to Western forms of recreation," the museum said,
adding that it will also introduce the coffee growing area of Gukeng township in
Central Taiwan's Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>The exhibition, titled "Early Taiwanese Coffee Culture," will run May 27- June
14 from 10 a.m-6 p.m. every day except Monday.</P>
      <P>Other museum draws to open in May will include an exhibition on the transition
of Buddhist statuary featuring gold and bronze statuettes and an exhibition of
ancient Chinese jade, the museum added.</P>

      <P>Should the swine influenza outbreak in Mexico spread around the world, it could
cause much more significant harm to human society than avian flu ever could, a
Taiwanese stock disease expert warned Monday.</P>
      <P>In response to media inquiries over recent outbreaks of swine flu in the United
States and Mexico, Lai Shiow-suey, a former veterinary medicine professor at
National Taiwan University, expressed concern about the recombination of
different strains of flu virus in pigs.</P>
      <P>Describing a pig's body as a big factory, Lai stated that if three different
virus strains recombine with each other in pigs, they will transform into a new,
more virulent strain.</P>
      <P>Lai said that since pigs share similar physical functions and heredity with
humans, they can easily pass on the new strain of flu virus to humans, from
which the virus can be further spread through human-to-human transmission.</P>
      <P>"It is dreadful; it seems the worst senario has happened, " he said, referring
to the recent swine flu outbreaks in Mexico where over 100 people are believed
to have died and more than 1,600 have been sickened by the virus, a recombinant
of the H1N1 flu strain.</P>
      <P>Lai recalled an earlier outbreak of H1N1 swine flu reported in the U.S. state of
New Jersey in 1976 that infected 230 new military recruits, killing one of them.
That outbreak prompted the U.S. government to administer vaccinations, but the
outbreak still lasted for more than two months, he said.</P>
      <P>The latest outbreak in Mexico will likely cause greater harm than the one in
1976 because "the strain of virus is much more vicious, " Lai said.</P>
      <P>He warned people who have recently returned from the United States and Mexico to
stay away from pig farms, and that people in the hog-raising industry should be
on their guard against an outbreak.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's public health authorities heightened preventive measures against the
threat of swine flu Sunday, with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) raising
its travel advisory for Mexico to the level of a"regional pandemic" alert
against the flu.</P>
      <P>Symptoms of the disease include fever, aches, coughing, sore throat, respiratory
congestion and in some cases vomiting and diarrhea.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire services,  the virus is usually contracted through
direct contact with pigs, but Joseph Domenech, chief of animal health services
at the U.N. Food and Agriculture Agency in Rome, said all indications so far are
that the virus is being spread through human-to-human transmission.</P>
      <P>There is no vaccine that protects specifically against swine flu and it is
unclear how much protection the current human flu vaccines can offer.</P>

      <P>Thirty-six percent of Taiwan's unemployed want to start up their own businesses
as a way out of their financial problems, according to the results of a recent

Affairs (CLA) , of those unemployed who are interested in entrepreneurship,
17.47 percent said they want to start a business of their own because they want
to be their own boss.</P>
      <P>In addition to being unemployed or facing a bad employment situation,  other
reasons  that were cited  by the potential entrepreneurs include attempting to
realize his or her dreams (16.3 percent), the belief that running his or her own
business would make more money (10.13 percent) , desire to live the life they
want (8.66 percent) and putting his or her ability into full play (7.34
percent), the poll found.</P>

      <P>The Taichung District Prosecutors Office donated NT$7.5 million (US$221,890) of
public funds Monday to the Taichung City government to provide meals for
impoverished students during the summer vacation period.</P>
      <P>Taichung Mayor Jason Hu thanked the prosecutors for their generosity and strong
support for his proposal that the office use the funds -- recovered from petty
offenders in return for deferred prosecution -- to help the cash-strapped city
government launch the program.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, the city government plans to use the money to issue lunch
vouchers to students from the city's impoverished families during the coming
summer vacation.</P>
      <P>It will be the second program of its kind carried out by the city following
initial success with a similar program implemented over the last winter
vacation, Hu noted.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Chang Dou-hui said that under the instruction of the Ministry of
Justice, the Taichung District Prosecutors Office has made cash donations of the
public funds to some 40 welfare groups in the Taichung area and he voiced hope
that more enterprises and groups will collaborate with the city government in
efforts to aid students in need.</P>
      <P>The city's education department estimated that there are about 7,000 needy
elementary and junior high students in the city, and said it plans to distribute
about 408,000 lunch vouchers during the summer vacation.</P>
      <P>In a similar move, the Chiayi District Prosecutors Office in southern Taiwan had
as of April 16 granted scholarships to 150 local students from the area from the
beginning of the year using money collected in the same way.</P>
      <P>The scholarships ranged from NT$2,000 (US$60) for each junior high school
student to NT$1,000 for each elementary school student per semester.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi Prosecutors Office has NT$10 million (US$298,000) at its disposal
this year raised from deferred prosecution payments, a spokesman for the office
said in early January when the office sponsored an activity to help impoverished

      <P>A public prosecutor in Taitung, southeastern Taiwan, who was released on bail
five days ago pending further investigation into his alleged acceptance of
bribes, was detained again Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taitung Public Prosecutors' Office took Lin Sheng-lin into custody Sunday
night for questioning on the strength of new evidence implicating him in a
second bribery case and sought permission from the Taitung District Court again
to keep him in custody.</P>
      <P>The court granted the permission Monday after reviewing the arguments submitted
by the prosecutors' office that Lin tried to contact witnesses and defendants in
the bribery cases, through his father, in an apparent attempt to collude with
them.</P>
      <P>On April 22, Lin was released on bail of NT$500,000 (US$14,760) after being
taken into custody a day earlier to answer charges that he had accepted bribes
from suspects who should have been indicted in criminal cases that he handled.
At the time, the court ruled that there was no need to keep Lin in detention,
even though he could face at least five years in prison if convicted.</P>
      <P>On that day, the court also set bail at NT$200,000 for Wu Dong-sheng, a broker
whom prosecutors said assisted Lin in obtaining bribes. The court ruled that
both Lin and Wu are not allowed to leave the country.</P>
      <P>According to the Taitung Public Prosecutors' Office, Lin was reassigned from the
Shihlin Public Prosecutors' Office in Taipei to work in Taitung in August last
year because he left too many criminal cases unhandled.</P>
      <P>Ethics officers at the Taitung prosecutors' office placed Lin under surveillance
after noting that he continued to allow the accumulation of many cases, and that
he had dismissed quite a few cases that he should have prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Further investigation led to the admission by several suspects in at least two
criminal cases that Lin had offered not to indict them in return for bribes.</P>

      <P>The ministry had originally issued a yellow travel alert for Mexico, the lowest

      <P>However, the MOFA decided to raise the alert for Mexico's capital to orange, the

      <P>Taiwan stepped up its epidemic prevention efforts Monday amid reports of a
further spread of human infections of swine flu globally.</P>
      <P>An outbreak of human infections of swine flu was first reported in Mexico March
18 and the number of related deaths has exceeded 100 so far.  Several confirmed
cases were also reported  in the southwestern part of the United States and
Canada. Suspected cases were reported in Brazil, Spain and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>World Health Organization (WHO) officials have warned that there is a potential
for the new H1N1 swine virus to become a global pandemic.</P>
      <P>No cases of the disease have been reported in Taiwan, but the government is on
heightened alert, with the Executive Yuan calling a supraministerial meeting
Monday morning to coordinate preventive measures in hopes of averting any
possible outbreak of human infections of the new swine flu strain.</P>
      <P>Addressing the meeting, Vice Premiser Chiu Cheng-hsiung directed the Ministry of
the Interior and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to tighten
fever screening at airports and harbors to ward off entry of the virus from
abroad.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health (DOH) later
listed human infections of swine flu as a level-one notifiable disease in line
with the WHO's definition of the new swine flu strain.</P>
      <P>From now on,  DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said,  medical institutions are
obligated to report suspected swine flu cases to facilitate tracking and
prevention of an epidemic.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Liu Chao-hsiuan will make an inspection tour of Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport to see for himself epidemic preventive measures
there.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs raised th level of its travel
alert for Mexico City to the second-highest orange level Monday, urging
prospective travelers to defer their travel plans for the time being in light of
the wine flu outbreak there.</P>
      <P>Economics officials prdicted that the new swine flu outbreak could delay a
global economic recovery and add uncertainty if the outbreak became serious in
the United States.</P>
      <P>As Taipei will sponsor the 2009 Deaflympics in September, city councilors have
urged the city government to take precautionary measures to cope with the
situation.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, DOH Minister Yeh said local people need not overreact to the swine
flu scare because no suspected cases of swine flu or human infections of the
virus have ever been reported in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A public prosecutor in Taitung, southeastern Taiwan, who was released on bail
five days ago pending further investigation into his alleged acceptance of
bribes, was detained again Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taitung Public Prosecutors' Office took Lin Sheng-lin into custody Sunday
night for questioning on the strength of new evidence implicating him in a
second bribery case and sought permission from the Taitung District Court again
to keep him in custody.</P>
      <P>The court granted the permission Monday after reviewing the arguments submitted
by the prosecutors' office that Lin tried to contact witnesses and defendants in
the bribery cases, through his father, in an apparent attempt to collude with
them.</P>
      <P>On April 22, Lin was released on bail of NT$500,000 (US$14,760) after being
taken into custody a day earlier to answer charges that he had accepted bribes
from suspects who should have been indicted in criminal cases that he handled.
At the time, the court ruled that there was no need to keep Lin in detention,
even though he could face at least five years in prison if convicted.</P>
      <P>On that day, the court also set bail at NT$200,000 for Wu Dong-sheng, a broker
whom prosecutors said assisted Lin in obtaining bribes. The court ruled that
both Lin and Wu are not allowed to leave the country.</P>
      <P>According to the Taitung Public Prosecutors' Office, Lin was reassigned from the
Shihlin Public Prosecutors' Office in Taipei to work in Taitung in August last
year because he left too many criminal cases unhandled.</P>
      <P>Ethics officers at the Taitung prosecutors' office placed Lin under surveillance
after noting that he continued to allow the accumulation of many cases, and that
he had dismissed quite a few cases that he should have prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Further investigation led to the admission by several suspects in at least two
criminal cases that Lin had offered not to indict them in return for bribes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has issued a red travel alert for Mexico,
warning local travelers not to visit the country because of the spread of the
swine flu virus from Mexico to the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry has decided to issue a red travel advisory for Mexico. The
decision is based on only one concern -- the travel safety and health of our
citizens, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said Tuesday at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>The ministry also issued a yellow travel alert for the United States and Canada,
Chen added.</P>
      <P>A red alert -- the most serious travel advisory alert -- warns travelers not to
enter the area in question under any circumstances. It is followed by an orange
travel alert, which advises travelers to postpone their trips, and a yellow
alert, which serves as a reminder for travelers to exercise caution.</P>
      <P>So far, no Taiwanese expatriates or businessmen in Mexico have been reported
ill, and the ministry's representative office there will continue to collect
relevant information, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, three or four unidentified Taiwanese high school exchange students in
Nova Scotia -- Canada's second smallest province located on its southeastern
coast -- remained under isolation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA's representative office in Ottawa is trying to get more details on the
situation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) report quoted Joe Seagram, headmaster
of Nova Scotia's King's-Edgehill School as saying that as of Monday there were
four confirmed human swine flu cases at the school while 27 others with flu-like
symptoms remained in isolation.</P>
      <P>The outbreaks of swine flu in Mexico have spread to other parts of the world,
raising concerns that it could turn into a global pandemic.</P>
      <P>The U.S., with 47 confirmed cases, has declared apublic health emergency," while
in Mexico, 149 deaths have been linked to the flu while another 2,000 people
have been hospitalized.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization (WHO) said Canada has six confirmed human
infections while Spain has one and Scotland has two.</P>
      <P>The world health regulatory body raised its global pandemic flu alert from level
3 to level 4 Tuesday, indicating that there has been sustained human-to-human
transmission of the flu.</P>

      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have moved a step closer to normalizing their
trade and economic relations  after reaching understandings  on financial
cooperation and opening Taiwan to Chinese investment, Taipei's chief negotiator
with Beijing said Monday.</P>
      <P>The achievement, together with agreements reached previously on the launch of
cross-strait air, shipping and mail services, has contributed to an intial
realization of "three links" -- direct transportation, trade and postal links --
between the two sides, said Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks during a visit to Yangzhou, the second leg of his
current China visit that first took him to Nanjing, where he met with his
Chinese counterpart, Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>The two signed three agreements covering the launch of regular cross-strait
passenger  flights,  financial  cooperation,  and cross-strait cooperation to
fight crime.</P>
      <P>A joint statement on a proposal to open Taiwan to Chinese investment was also
released on the occasion.</P>
      <P>Chiang pointed out that including these three agreements, the two sides have
reached a total of nine agreements in 10 months.</P>
      <P>Among the four understandings reached Sunday, the joint statement on
liberalizing Taiwan-bound Chinese investment will facilitate a two-way flow of
investment, reversing the current one-way movement of investment from Taiwan to
China, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Issues to be addressed by the two sides in the future, such as investment
protection, dual taxation avoidance and intellectual property right protection,
are expected to help further promote direct cross-strait business links, he
said.</P>
      <P>The latest Chiang-Chen meeting was the third of its kind since the resumption of
cross-strait dialogue less than one year ago following a nine-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>It signifies the continued warming of relations between the two former rivals
since the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou, whose administration has made
it a priority to ease tensions and improve relations with China.</P>
      <P>In their first meeting held in June 2008 in Beijing, Chiang and Chen signed
agreements  on the launch of weekend cross-strait passenger charter flights and
the admission of larger numbers of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Their second meeting took place in November in Taipei, during which they signed
agreements on extending charter flights from weekends to every day of the week,
opening direct cross-strait shipping, postal, and air cargo charter services,
and improving food safety.</P>

      <P>Domestic pork prices have not been affected by outbreaks of the A/H1N1 swine flu
in Mexico, the United States, and Canada, said a senior Council of Agriculture
(COA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Tien-lai, the head of the COA's Animal Industry Division, noted that the
wholesale price for pork stood at NT$5,999 (US$176) per 100 kilograms on Monday,
the same as usual, but he said he would continue to monitor the market.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the outbreak has not affected the pork market because the new H1N1
strain has not attacked pigs. In a statement issued Monday, the World
Organization for Animal Health stressed, "the virus has not been isolated in
animals to date " and said that calling the disease "swine influenza" was not
justified, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Although the new virus contains genetic fragments of swine flu, it is regarded
as a recombinant virus formed in the human body, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President touts Taoyuan Aerotropolis as key to Taiwan's future</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that building the Taoyuan Aerotropolis is an
important key to Taiwan's future development and an essential element in
Taiwan's efforts to become more closely connected with the international
community.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is exceptionally blessed in terms of its location. I would even advise
aliens to take hold of Taiwan if they come to Earth, " said Ma at the opening
ceremony of the 2009 International Conference on Aerotropolis, hosted by Taoyuan
County and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>"It would be such a waste if we do not make good use of this advantage and
develop it well.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport is at the center of every major
Asian air route, it has more potential than other Asian airports to become a
regional hub, Ma said, stressing that the aerotropolis development program will
be vital to Taiwan's future development.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County magistrate Eric Liluan Chu agreed with the president that the
project would be of fundamental importance to Taiwan's long-term development.</P>
      <P>Chu acknowledged that the Taoyuan airport's passenger traffic and freight volume
declined  in 2008,  but he stressed  that the international gateway's future was
still bright.</P>
      <P>Chu cited Civil Aeronautics Administration forecasts that the airport's
passenger traffic will increase from 21.9 million people in 2008 to 47.5 million
people in 2035, and cargo volume will rise from 1.49 million tons in 2008 to
4.03 million tons in 2035.</P>
      <P>Chu said Taoyuan County must seize the potential for growth and work hard in
cooperation with the central government to convert the airport area into an
aerotropolis.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan Aerotropolis project -- set to be completed in 2020 -- would involve
the expansion of existing airport terminals and the establishment of an
aerospace industrial park and special zones for cargo, passenger and logistics
services.</P>
      <P>It is expected to attract NT$1.2 trillion (US$35.5 billion) in investment, while
generating NT$600 billion in revenues and creating more than 80,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>The goal of the two-day conference is to give experts affiliated with the
industrial sector, governments and academia the chance to share their experience
and views and use the knowledge gained to ensure that the aerotropolis plan best
meets Taiwan's development needs.</P>
      <P>Some 40 experts from home and abroad are attending the conference, including Tom
Leppert, mayor of Dallas, U.S., Shigemitsu Tsumura, mayor of Miyazaki, Japan,
Cedric Foo, a member of the Singaporean parliament, Peter Trautmann,
representative for international projects of Munich Airport, and Brian Joiner,
Australia aviation strategy manager of Melbourne Airport.</P>

      <P>World Vision Taiwan, the local chapter of the international Christian relief
organization, promoted its 20th 30-Hour Famine program for 2009 on Tuesday,
calling on the public to join the event to help raise funds to combat the global
food crisis.</P>
      <P>"Through the 30-hour famine program, people will be able to experience firsthand
the needs of starving people, World Vision Taiwan said in a press release. "With
more people participating in the event, more children affected by famines will
be saved."</P>
      <P>More than 20,000 people from home and abroad are expected to attend this year's
Famine Hero Rally scheduled for Aug. 15-16 at the National Taiwan Sport
University stadium in Linkou, an event World Vision Taiwan hopes will raise
NT$170 million (US$5 million).</P>
      <P>The group urged the public to sign up for the "lively and rewarding" event
starting May 1 at www.30hf.org.tw. The registration fee for adults is NT$1,000
and NT$500 for students.</P>
      <P>Separate from the event to be held in Linkou, groups and individuals  are also
welcome to register for the DIY Famine challenge, in which participants can fast
for 12 to 30 hours on their own through  educational,  emotional  and fun
activities,  the organization said.</P>
      <P>World Vision provides a planning guide, video clips and related information to
assist the planning of a DIY famine.</P>
      <P>Since the program was introduced three years ago, over 900 famine groups have
been organized, with more than 80,000 famine heroes receiving a certificate.
Some 177 groups and 28,772 individuals are already registered for this year's
program.</P>
      <P>The 30-Hour Famine program is one of World Vision Taiwan's three principal fund-
raising activities, the other two being a child sponsorship program that helps
poor children in Taiwan and abroad and a program that assists local and overseas
development projects.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan chapter of World Vision was established 43 years ago.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) set up a central command center Tuesday to
prevent a possible swine flu outbreak in Taiwan as the virus continues to spread
around the world.</P>
      <P>The DOH took the step after the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its
influenza pandemic alert to phase 4 from phase 3 earlier in the day, indicating
that there is sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus.</P>
      <P>Established at a meeting of cross-government agencies, the center will focus on
strengthening surveillance for swine flu at boundary control points and raising
travel warnings for the United States and Mexico and other areas affected by the
virus,  Minister  Yeh Ching-chuan said.</P>
      <P>Although no cases of the influenza have been reported in Taiwan, Yeh said the
virus would eventually find its way into the country and that Taiwan had to be
well prepared for the worst possible scenario.</P>
      <P>The government has also mapped out a national flu pandemic strategy in response
to the threat, which includes establishing a channel to co-ordinate the
replenishment of medication and vaccine stockpiles among various government
agencies, he indicated.</P>
      <P>The flu virus that has struck Mexico is a new strain of the H1N1, which appears
to be easily passed from person to person, and is a mixture of the swine, human
and avian flu viruses.</P>
      <P>The World Organization for Animal Health said in a statement that the virus
should not be called swine flu because it has yet to be isolated in pigs, and
Yeh reiterated that people would not get infected with the flu by eating pork.</P>
      <P>The virus is being transmitted, he said, by people coming in physical contact
with people who have the flu.</P>
      <P>Yeh assured local residents that Taiwan has a sufficient supply of surgical
masks and vaccine to deal with the flu. The DOH has 50 million to 60 million
masks in stock and local manufacturers have the capability of producing 200,000
doses of the flu vaccine a month, he said.</P>
      <P>Health care and ambulance workers and custom officials would be given top
priority for receipt of the vaccine, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also has enough stockpiled Tamiflu, the best available medicine against
the H1N1 flu, to treat up to 2.3 million people-- one-tenth of Taiwan's total
population, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>The country also has three manufacturers capable of producing Tamiflu if
necessary, he said.</P>
      <P>The government will also earmark a special budget, use TV channels and set up
commander centers in all cities and counties around the country to promote
information and measures on flu prevention, Yeh said.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese people planning to visit Mexico are suggested to equip themselves with
surgical masks before entering that country, which is in the grip of a swine flu
panic, because there is a shortage of supply there, according to a statement
released Tuesday by the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Citing Mario Tsai, the head of the TAITRA-affiliated Taiwan Trade Center in
Mexico City,  the statement  said center staff had unsuccessfully tried to
purchase masks at several local grocery stores since April 25.</P>
      <P>Tsai stated that only around 40 percent of passengers on public transport in
Mexico City were observed wearing masks that day, while fewer than 50 percent of
pedestrians and people in shopping malls were bothering to wear masks to ward
off the flu virus.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the Mexican government has begun releasing gauze masks to
people at metro stations.</P>
      <P>Tsai advised visitors to the capital, Mexico City, to refrain from using public
transport and suggested that Taiwanese visitors stay in hotels graded with at
least four stars and he also suggested avoiding hotels in the old city district
of Col Centro.</P>
      <P>According to the latest report by the World Health Organization (WHO) April 27
on swine flu outbreaks, as of that same day Mexico had reported 26 confirmed
human cases of infection with swine influenza A(H1N1), including seven deaths,
while the United States government had reported 40 laboratory confirmed human
cases, with no deaths.</P>
      <P>Canada had reported six cases, with no deaths, while Spain had reported one

    <HEADLINE>Pact offers no 'escape' for Taiwan's fugitives in China: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An agreement signed between Taiwan and China over the weekend to cooperate in
fighting crime means China must not reject Taiwan's demands that it extradite
major economic criminals wanted by the government, the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MAC made the remarks in a statement released Monday evening to refute media
speculation that an article in the crime-combating and judicial assistance pact
inked by the two sides Sunday might provide an "escape" for some major Taiwanese
economic fugitives who take shelter in China.</P>
      <P>Some local newspaper reports voiced their suspicion of the pact, pointing to the
article which stipulates that "either side receiving the plea from the other
side may decide on its own whether to repatriate  wanted fugitives  if vital
interest or exceptional circumstances are involved."</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, the two sides worked out the mutually acceptable wording
based on the main spirit of most international judicial assistance  accords,
which usually exclude political, military and religious criminals from mandatory
repatriation.</P>
      <P>Due to the sensitive relations between Taiwan and China, it is essential to
distinguish political, military or religious criminals from two-way crime-
fighting efforts, in which economic criminals are included,  particularly  those
who commit crimes  relating  to embezzlement, breach of trust, fraud and money
laundering, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>More than 50 major economic criminals from Taiwan, including those convicted or
indicted, have fled to China over the past few years, according to information
provided by the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>They include former Legislative Yuan Speaker Liu Sung-pan, former Kaohsiung
Mayor Wang Yu-yun and his son Wang Chih-hsiung, an ex- legislator, and former
Kaohsiung City Council Speaker Chu An-hsiung, as well as Chen Yu-hao, former
head of the Tuntex Group, and Tseng Cheng-jen, former owner of the Sogo
Department Store in Taichung City.</P>
      <P>But government officials said in recent days that China will no longer be a safe
haven for Taiwanese fugitives, as the Investigation Bureau and the National
Police Agency have referred a list of most-wanted Taiwanese criminals to Chinese
authorities.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice said it will soon hold work meetings with Chinese public
security, prosecution and law authorities to discuss the establishment of a
cooperation framework and related details on joint efforts in crime fighting.</P>
      <P>In the future, Taiwanese inmates serving jail terms in China can apply to
complete their sentence in Taiwan and vice versa based on humanitarian
considerations and mutual benefits in compliance with the Taiwan-China judicial
assistance accord.</P>
      <P>This accord is one of three pacts signed by Taiwan and China in the Chinese city
of Nanjing on April 26.</P>
      <P>The two other pacts concerned  financial  cooperation  and increasing regularly
scheduled flights between the two sides.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is likely to post marginal economic growth of 0.11 percent in 2009 as the
country's export momentum is battered by overall plunging demand, the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research (TIER), a local think tank, forecast Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Despite expanded demand in some Asian markets, overall demand continues  to
dwindle because of the global financial crisis, according to a monthly report
published by the think tank.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, Taiwan's exports are projected to shrink by 9.19
percent in 2009, while imports are likely to contract by 13.87 percent, the TIER
said, predicting a trade surplus of US$25.05 billion for the year.</P>
      <P>The sharp fall in international commodity prices will ease inflation
significantly, with Taiwan's inflation rate projected at 0.17 percent for 2009,
the report said.</P>
      <P>Although government investment will increase by 26.96 percent thanks to the
administration's efforts to promote public construction projects, fixed
investment by the private sector is expected to drop by 11.53 percent as
businesses delay or cut back on their capital expenditure, the report went on.</P>
      <P>In terms of private consumption, the TIER predicted that there will be a slight
growth of 0.62 percent, as the forced unpaid leave policy and workforce
reduction by local businesses are taking a heavy toll on the public's purchasing
power.</P>
      <P>Further observation is required to judge the effect of the government's shopping
voucher program and the recent influx of Chinese tourists on boosting private
consumption, according to the TIER report.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a survey conducted by the TIER in March on the business climate for
the manufacturing sector shows that 42.8 percent of manufacturers think
conditions will improve over the next six months, up from 36.6 percent recorded
in a February survey.</P>
      <P>A total of 18.6 percent of the respondents predicted that conditions worsen over
the next six months, down from 24 percent in the previous month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 38.6 percent said they think conditions will remain the same, down
from 39.4 percent in February.</P>
      <P>According to the TIER, despite weak demand from the European and U.S. markets,
shipments by Taiwan's electronics and machinery sectors are likely to pick up in
the next six months thanks to rush orders from emerging markets.</P>
      <P>The composite business climate indicator for the manufacturing sector stood at
105.59 in March, up 11.86 points compared with the previous month, the TIER
report shows.</P>
      <P>The composite business climate indicator for the service sector registered
103.26, up 9.78 points from February.</P>

      <P>Every flight from America that arrives in Taiwan from April 29 onward will be
subject to a strict on-board screening procedure in an effort to prevent the
entry of a new strain of swine influenza, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
announced in a statement Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The first flight to undergo the procedure will be EVA Airways flight BR017 from
San Francisco, which is scheduled to land at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport at 5: 10 a.m. that day, the CDC said.</P>
      <P>The statement said the CDC decided to take the unusual step under the
instruction of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and following a resolution of the
Executive Yuan's command center for prevention of A/H1N1 swine flu outbreaks
that have been reported in Mexico, the United States, Canada and several other
countries.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi said it is impossible to predict when
the procedure will be lifted.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwan, Japan has already taken the same measure for flights from
Mexico, said Shih.</P>
      <P>He continued that when an affected flight arrives at the airport, all passengers
will be asked to stay in their seats until quarantine officials board the plane
and give them a hygiene lecture and information on the new type of flu.</P>
      <P>The officials will also screen every passenger and anyone with flu-like
symptoms, including coughing and sore throat, will be kept on the plane for
further checks, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Those passengers allowed to leave the aircraft will still have to pass a
temperature reader once inside the airport.</P>
      <P>If the officials cannot eliminate the possibility of swine flu infection, those
who are suspected of being infected will be taken directly to a hospital for
further checks, Shih went on, adding that those who do not show signs of
infection at the airport but who develop symptoms after entering the country
will be requested to report to the CDC, he added.</P>
      <P>According to border surveillance statistics, around 50 flights from the U.S. and
Canada had landed over the past three days, bringing more than 15,000 travelers
into the country.</P>
      <P>Shih said five of the travelers were found to have a fever upon arrival, but all
were declared uninfected with swine flu.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau also activated  an emergency  checking
mechanism Tuesday at the country's largest seaport.</P>
      <P>The outbreaks in Mexico and the U.S. have prompted the World Health Organization
to raise its alert level to phase 4 on a scale of six, indicating a
significantly increased risk of pandemic.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan marks anniversary of Sino-Japan Peace Treaty</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 28 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China marked the 57th anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Peace
Treaty by unveiling a set of five statues Tuesday at Taipei Guest House, where
the treaty was signed in 1952.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou presided over the unveiling of the statues which depict
ROC Envoy George Yeh and his Japanese counterpart Isao Kawada inking the treaty
while three other diplomats look on.</P>
      <P>At Tuesday's ceremony, Ma stressed that the reenactment of the 1952 signing
should serve as a reminder to the public that Taiwan belongs to the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Ma, who holds a doctorate in International Law from Harvard University, said the
Sino-Japanese treaty was a followup to the Treaty of San Francisco concluded
between Japan and the allied nations in 1951.</P>
      <P>The ROC was not invited to sign the San Francisco treaty because it was engaged
in a civil war with the People's Republic of China and there was disagreement
among the allied nations over which side was the legitimate government of China.</P>
      <P>"The Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty stated only that Japan renounced all rights to
territories it had occupied by force, but did not specify that Taiwan should be
ceded to any particular state, " Ma said, adding that "this was in line with the
terms of the Treaty of San Francisco."</P>
      <P>Since the territories occupied by Japan at the time were many, the signatories
to the San Francisco treaty preferred that the territorial issues be resolved
through separate agreements between the individual states and Japan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"This gave rise to many bilateral treaties between Japan and other countries on
territorial rights," Ma said, citing as an example the treaty between Japan and
Russia.</P>
      <P>"The Sino-Japanese  Treaty was concluded against a similar backdrop, and reading
between the lines, one can easily see that the aim was to hand over Taiwan to
the Republic of China." Ma said.</P>
      <P>The treaty not only brought peace to Taiwan and Japan, but also ushered in a
period of friendly relations between the two states, he added.</P>
      <P>"The treaty is vital not only to Taiwan, but also to the whole region, " and the
statues are a reminder of its value, the president stated.</P>
      <P>"These statues will remind people who visit this house of how much we owe to
those who drafted the treaty," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma's  comments  took  direct  aim  the  argument  by many pro-independence
activists that Taiwan has not belonged to any state since Japan gave it up at
the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>These activists reject China's claim to the island and promote their Taiwan
independence cause based on the argument that Japan did not hand over Taiwan to
any other state.</P>
      <P>The issue is often a contentious one in Taiwan, especially at election time when
some politicians campaign on a platform of permanent separation between Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>Ma was obviously trying to tread a fine line between Beijing's view and that of
the proponents of independence by saying that Taiwan belongs to the "Republic of
China, " rather than "China, " which usually refers to the People's Republic of
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Daily number of Chinese tourists to be fixed below 5,000: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan should be limited to 5,000 per
day to ensure the quality of their trips, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chinese made up 1 million of the 3.7 million foreign visitors to
Taiwan last year, the premier said, however, his administration had not
anticipated that the number would grow to the current 5,000 to 6,000 Chinese
tourists per day.</P>
      <P>"This influx results in a lower quality of service -- a problem that must be
addressed urgently by the government." Liu said at a media gathering.</P>
      <P>"We should not admit more tourists than we can accommodate and we need to
improve our local tourism infrastructure," the premier said.</P>
      <P>"The exact daily cap for the number of Chinese tourists should be determined
jointly by the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, but I expect it to be below 5,000." Liu said.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage Chinese tourists to make more comprehensive tours of the
island, the premier said, his administration is mulling a revision of the
pertinent regulations to allow groups of two or three people to visit rather,
than the current minimum of five.</P>
      <P>Liu made the statements two days after President Ma Ying-jeou asked the
administration to impose a proper cap on the daily number of Chinese tourists,
after he learned that there were not enough tour buses to meet demand.</P>
      <P>When Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists took effect on July 4, 2008, the
government imposed a cap of 3,000 visitors per day, but the number has spiked in
the lead up to China's May Day holiday, and local officials have raised the
ceiling by transferring unused quotas from previous days.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan stepped up its epidemic prevention efforts Monday amid reports of a
further spread of human infections of swine flu globally.</P>
      <P>An outbreak of human infections of swine flu was first reported in Mexico March
18 and the number of related deaths has exceeded 100 so far.  Several confirmed
cases were also reported  in the southwestern part of the United States and
Canada. Suspected cases were reported in Brazil, Spain and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>World Health Organization (WHO) officials have warned that there is a potential
for the new H1N1 swine virus to become a global pandemic.</P>
      <P>No cases of the disease have been reported in Taiwan, but the government is on
heightened alert, with the Executive Yuan calling a supraministerial meeting
Monday morning to coordinate preventive measures in hopes of averting any
possible outbreak of human infections of the new swine flu strain.</P>
      <P>Addressing the meeting, Vice Premiser Chiu Cheng-hsiung directed the Ministry of
the Interior and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to tighten
fever screening at airports and harbors to ward off entry of the virus from
abroad.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) under the Department of Health (DOH) later
listed human infections of swine flu as a level-one notifiable disease in line
with the WHO's definition of the new swine flu strain.</P>
      <P>From now on,  DOH Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said,  medical institutions are
obligated to report suspected swine flu cases to facilitate tracking and
prevention of an epidemic.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Liu Chao-hsiuan will make an inspection tour of Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport to see for himself epidemic preventive measures
there.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs raised th level of its travel
alert for Mexico City to the second-highest orange level Monday, urging
prospective travelers to defer their travel plans for the time being in light of
the wine flu outbreak there.</P>
      <P>Economics officials prdicted that the new swine flu outbreak could delay a
global economic recovery and add uncertainty if the outbreak became serious in
the United States.</P>
      <P>As Taipei will sponsor the 2009 Deaflympics in September, city councilors have
urged the city government to take precautionary measures to cope with the
situation.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, DOH Minister Yeh said local people need not overreact to the swine
flu scare because no suspected cases of swine flu or human infections of the
virus have ever been reported in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Prosecutor detained for second time on suspicion of bribery</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A public prosecutor in Taitung, southeastern Taiwan, who was released on bail
five days ago pending further investigation into his alleged acceptance of
bribes, was detained again Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Taitung Public Prosecutors' Office took Lin Sheng-lin into custody Sunday
night for questioning on the strength of new evidence implicating him in a
second bribery case and sought permission from the Taitung District Court again
to keep him in custody.</P>
      <P>The court granted the permission Monday after reviewing the arguments submitted
by the prosecutors' office that Lin tried to contact witnesses and defendants in
the bribery cases, through his father, in an apparent attempt to collude with
them.</P>
      <P>On April 22, Lin was released on bail of NT$500,000 (US$14,760) after being
taken into custody a day earlier to answer charges that he had accepted bribes
from suspects who should have been indicted in criminal cases that he handled.
At the time, the court ruled that there was no need to keep Lin in detention,
even though he could face at least five years in prison if convicted.</P>
      <P>On that day, the court also set bail at NT$200,000 for Wu Dong-sheng, a broker
whom prosecutors said assisted Lin in obtaining bribes. The court ruled that
both Lin and Wu are not allowed to leave the country.</P>
      <P>According to the Taitung Public Prosecutors' Office, Lin was reassigned from the
Shihlin Public Prosecutors' Office in Taipei to work in Taitung in August last
year because he left too many criminal cases unhandled.</P>
      <P>Ethics officers at the Taitung prosecutors' office placed Lin under surveillance
after noting that he continued to allow the accumulation of many cases, and that
he had dismissed quite a few cases that he should have prosecuted.</P>
      <P>Further investigation led to the admission by several suspects in at least two
criminal cases that Lin had offered not to indict them in return for bribes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) raised the level of its travel alert for
Mexico City to orange Monday, urging prospective travelers to defer their plans
for the time being in light of an outbreak of human infections of swine flu
there.</P>
      <P>The ministry had originally issued a yellow travel alert for Mexico, the lowest
level advisory that warns travelers to exercise caution.</P>
      <P>However, the MOFA decided to raise the alert for Mexico's capital to orange, the
second-highest level, in view of the latest reports that the swine flu outbreak
is most serious in Mexico City and has spread to other parts of the world, MOFA
officials said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, they added, World Health Organizations (WHO) officials have warned
that there is a potential for the new swine flu virus to become a global
pandemic.</P>
      <P>On the ministry's three-color travel advisory scale, an orange alert suggests
that would-be travelers should suspend their travel plans over safety or health
concerns.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA statistics, an average of 3,000 to 4,000 Taiwanese citizens
apply for visas to Mexico annually, most of whom intend to travel to Mexico City
for business or sightseeing purposes.</P>
      <P>In support of the ongoing global campaign to contain the spread of the new H1N1
swine flu virus and out of local health concerns, residents of Taiwan are
advised to refrain from traveling to Mexico City for the time being, the
officials warned.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they said the MOFA will maintain its yellow alert for other areas and
cities of Mexico, and urged would-be travelers to exercise a high degree of
caution.</P>
      <P>As of late Sunday, the number of suspected swine flu cases in Mexico had climbed
to 1,614, including as many as 103 deaths, according to Mexican Health Secretary
Jose Angel Cordova. The United States has confirmed at least 11 cases of swine
flu, and Canada six cases.</P>
      <P>The Mexican City government has ordered suspension of all public activities and
closure of all libraries, museums, theaters and other public places. It has also
closed schools of all levels until May 6.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has issued a red travel alert for Mexico,
warning local travelers not to visit the country because of the spread of the
swine flu virus from Mexico to the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>"The Foreign Ministry has decided to issue a red travel advisory for Mexico. The
decision is based on only one concern -- the travel safety and health of our
citizens, MOFA spokesman Henry Chen said Tuesday at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>The ministry also issued a yellow travel alert for the United States and Canada,
Chen added.</P>
      <P>A red alert -- the most serious travel advisory alert -- warns travelers not to
enter the area in question under any circumstances. It is followed by an orange
travel alert, which advises travelers to postpone their trips, and a yellow
alert, which serves as a reminder for travelers to exercise caution.</P>
      <P>So far, no Taiwanese expatriates or businessmen in Mexico have been reported
ill, and the ministry's representative office there will continue to collect
relevant information, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, three or four unidentified Taiwanese high school exchange students in
Nova Scotia -- Canada's second smallest province located on its southeastern
coast -- remained under isolation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA's representative office in Ottawa is trying to get more details on the
situation, Chen said.</P>
      <P>A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) report quoted Joe Seagram, headmaster
of Nova Scotia's King's-Edgehill School as saying that as of Monday there were
four confirmed human swine flu cases at the school while 27 others with flu-like
symptoms remained in isolation.</P>
      <P>The outbreaks of swine flu in Mexico have spread to other parts of the world,
raising concerns that it could turn into a global pandemic.</P>
      <P>The U.S., with 47 confirmed cases, has declared apublic health emergency," while
in Mexico, 149 deaths have been linked to the flu while another 2,000 people
have been hospitalized.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization (WHO) said Canada has six confirmed human
infections while Spain has one and Scotland has two.</P>
      <P>The world health regulatory body raised its global pandemic flu alert from level
3 to level 4 Tuesday, indicating that there has been sustained human-to-human

    <TEXT>
      <P>The two sides of the Taiwan Strait have moved a step closer to normalizing their
trade and economic relations  after reaching understandings  on financial
cooperation and opening Taiwan to Chinese investment, Taipei's chief negotiator
with Beijing said Monday.</P>
      <P>The achievement, together with agreements reached previously on the launch of
cross-strait air, shipping and mail services, has contributed to an intial
realization of "three links" -- direct transportation, trade and postal links --
between the two sides, said Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Chiang made the remarks during a visit to Yangzhou, the second leg of his
current China visit that first took him to Nanjing, where he met with his
Chinese counterpart, Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) President Chen Yunlin.</P>
      <P>The two signed three agreements covering the launch of regular cross-strait
passenger  flights,  financial  cooperation,  and cross-strait cooperation to
fight crime.</P>
      <P>A joint statement on a proposal to open Taiwan to Chinese investment was also
released on the occasion.</P>
      <P>Chiang pointed out that including these three agreements, the two sides have
reached a total of nine agreements in 10 months.</P>
      <P>Among the four understandings reached Sunday, the joint statement on
liberalizing Taiwan-bound Chinese investment will facilitate a two-way flow of
investment, reversing the current one-way movement of investment from Taiwan to
China, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Issues to be addressed by the two sides in the future, such as investment
protection, dual taxation avoidance and intellectual property right protection,
are expected to help further promote direct cross-strait business links, he
said.</P>
      <P>The latest Chiang-Chen meeting was the third of its kind since the resumption of
cross-strait dialogue less than one year ago following a nine-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>It signifies the continued warming of relations between the two former rivals
since the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou, whose administration has made
it a priority to ease tensions and improve relations with China.</P>
      <P>In their first meeting held in June 2008 in Beijing, Chiang and Chen signed
agreements  on the launch of weekend cross-strait passenger charter flights and
the admission of larger numbers of Chinese tourists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Their second meeting took place in November in Taipei, during which they signed
agreements on extending charter flights from weekends to every day of the week,
opening direct cross-strait shipping, postal, and air cargo charter services,
and improving food safety.</P>

      <P>Hsu said the outbreak has not affected the pork market because the new H1N1
strain has not attacked pigs. In a statement issued Monday, the World
Organization for Animal Health stressed, "the virus has not been isolated in
animals to date " and said that calling the disease "swine influenza" was not
justified, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>Although the new virus contains genetic fragments of swine flu, it is regarded

    <HEADLINE>President touts Taoyuan Aerotropolis as key to Taiwan's future</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that building the Taoyuan Aerotropolis is an
important key to Taiwan's future development and an essential element in
Taiwan's efforts to become more closely connected with the international
community.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is exceptionally blessed in terms of its location. I would even advise
aliens to take hold of Taiwan if they come to Earth, " said Ma at the opening
ceremony of the 2009 International Conference on Aerotropolis, hosted by Taoyuan
County and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>"It would be such a waste if we do not make good use of this advantage and
develop it well.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport is at the center of every major
Asian air route, it has more potential than other Asian airports to become a
regional hub, Ma said, stressing that the aerotropolis development program will
be vital to Taiwan's future development.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County magistrate Eric Liluan Chu agreed with the president that the
project would be of fundamental importance to Taiwan's long-term development.</P>
      <P>Chu acknowledged that the Taoyuan airport's passenger traffic and freight volume
declined  in 2008,  but he stressed  that the international gateway's future was
still bright.</P>
      <P>Chu cited Civil Aeronautics Administration forecasts that the airport's
passenger traffic will increase from 21.9 million people in 2008 to 47.5 million
people in 2035, and cargo volume will rise from 1.49 million tons in 2008 to
4.03 million tons in 2035.</P>
      <P>Chu said Taoyuan County must seize the potential for growth and work hard in
cooperation with the central government to convert the airport area into an
aerotropolis.</P>
      <P>The Taoyuan Aerotropolis project -- set to be completed in 2020 -- would involve
the expansion of existing airport terminals and the establishment of an
aerospace industrial park and special zones for cargo, passenger and logistics
services.</P>
      <P>It is expected to attract NT$1.2 trillion (US$35.5 billion) in investment, while
generating NT$600 billion in revenues and creating more than 80,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>The goal of the two-day conference is to give experts affiliated with the
industrial sector, governments and academia the chance to share their experience
and views and use the knowledge gained to ensure that the aerotropolis plan best
meets Taiwan's development needs.</P>
      <P>Some 40 experts from home and abroad are attending the conference, including Tom
Leppert, mayor of Dallas, U.S., Shigemitsu Tsumura, mayor of Miyazaki, Japan,
Cedric Foo, a member of the Singaporean parliament, Peter Trautmann,
representative for international projects of Munich Airport, and Brian Joiner,
Australia aviation strategy manager of Melbourne Airport.</P>

      <P>More than 20,000 people from home and abroad are expected to attend this year's
Famine Hero Rally scheduled for Aug. 15-16 at the National Taiwan Sport
University stadium in Linkou, an event World Vision Taiwan hopes will raise
NT$170 million (US$5 million).</P>
      <P>The group urged the public to sign up for the "lively and rewarding" event
starting May 1 at www.30hf.org.tw. The registration fee for adults is NT$1,000
and NT$500 for students.</P>
      <P>Separate from the event to be held in Linkou, groups and individuals  are also
welcome to register for the DIY Famine challenge, in which participants can fast
for 12 to 30 hours on their own through  educational,  emotional  and fun
activities,  the organization said.</P>
      <P>World Vision provides a planning guide, video clips and related information to
assist the planning of a DIY famine.</P>
      <P>Since the program was introduced three years ago, over 900 famine groups have
been organized, with more than 80,000 famine heroes receiving a certificate.
Some 177 groups and 28,772 individuals are already registered for this year's
program.</P>
      <P>The 30-Hour Famine program is one of World Vision Taiwan's three principal fund-
raising activities, the other two being a child sponsorship program that helps
poor children in Taiwan and abroad and a program that assists local and overseas
development projects.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan chapter of World Vision was established 43 years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan sets up command center to counter swine flu</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) set up a central command center Tuesday to
prevent a possible swine flu outbreak in Taiwan as the virus continues to spread
around the world.</P>
      <P>The DOH took the step after the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its
influenza pandemic alert to phase 4 from phase 3 earlier in the day, indicating
that there is sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus.</P>
      <P>Established at a meeting of cross-government agencies, the center will focus on
strengthening surveillance for swine flu at boundary control points and raising
travel warnings for the United States and Mexico and other areas affected by the
virus,  Minister  Yeh Ching-chuan said.</P>
      <P>Although no cases of the influenza have been reported in Taiwan, Yeh said the
virus would eventually find its way into the country and that Taiwan had to be
well prepared for the worst possible scenario.</P>
      <P>The government has also mapped out a national flu pandemic strategy in response
to the threat, which includes establishing a channel to co-ordinate the
replenishment of medication and vaccine stockpiles among various government
agencies, he indicated.</P>
      <P>The flu virus that has struck Mexico is a new strain of the H1N1, which appears
to be easily passed from person to person, and is a mixture of the swine, human
and avian flu viruses.</P>
      <P>The World Organization for Animal Health said in a statement that the virus
should not be called swine flu because it has yet to be isolated in pigs, and
Yeh reiterated that people would not get infected with the flu by eating pork.</P>
      <P>The virus is being transmitted, he said, by people coming in physical contact
with people who have the flu.</P>
      <P>Yeh assured local residents that Taiwan has a sufficient supply of surgical
masks and vaccine to deal with the flu. The DOH has 50 million to 60 million
masks in stock and local manufacturers have the capability of producing 200,000
doses of the flu vaccine a month, he said.</P>
      <P>Health care and ambulance workers and custom officials would be given top
priority for receipt of the vaccine, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also has enough stockpiled Tamiflu, the best available medicine against
the H1N1 flu, to treat up to 2.3 million people-- one-tenth of Taiwan's total
population, Yeh added.</P>
      <P>The country also has three manufacturers capable of producing Tamiflu if
necessary, he said.</P>
      <P>The government will also earmark a special budget, use TV channels and set up
commander centers in all cities and counties around the country to promote
information and measures on flu prevention, Yeh said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's share prices closed 1.89 percent lower Tuesday amid worries that the
swine flu outbreak could spread and hinder the economic recovery.</P>
      <P>The weighted index, the market's key barometer, lost 108.32 points to close at
5,596.73. A total of 5.99 billion shares changed hands on market turnover of

      <P>Taiwanese people planning to visit Mexico are suggested to equip themselves with
surgical masks before entering that country, which is in the grip of a swine flu
panic, because there is a shortage of supply there, according to a statement
released Tuesday by the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA).</P>
      <P>Citing Mario Tsai, the head of the TAITRA-affiliated Taiwan Trade Center in
Mexico City,  the statement  said center staff had unsuccessfully tried to
purchase masks at several local grocery stores since April 25.</P>
      <P>Tsai stated that only around 40 percent of passengers on public transport in
Mexico City were observed wearing masks that day, while fewer than 50 percent of
pedestrians and people in shopping malls were bothering to wear masks to ward
off the flu virus.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the Mexican government has begun releasing gauze masks to
people at metro stations.</P>
      <P>Tsai advised visitors to the capital, Mexico City, to refrain from using public
transport and suggested that Taiwanese visitors stay in hotels graded with at
least four stars and he also suggested avoiding hotels in the old city district
of Col Centro.</P>
      <P>According to the latest report by the World Health Organization (WHO) April 27
on swine flu outbreaks, as of that same day Mexico had reported 26 confirmed
human cases of infection with swine influenza A(H1N1), including seven deaths,
while the United States government had reported 40 laboratory confirmed human
cases, with no deaths.</P>
      <P>Canada had reported six cases, with no deaths, while Spain had reported one

    <HEADLINE>Pact offers no 'escape' for Taiwan's fugitives in China: MAC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An agreement signed between Taiwan and China over the weekend to cooperate in
fighting crime means China must not reject Taiwan's demands that it extradite
major economic criminals wanted by the government, the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The MAC made the remarks in a statement released Monday evening to refute media
speculation that an article in the crime-combating and judicial assistance pact
inked by the two sides Sunday might provide an "escape" for some major Taiwanese
economic fugitives who take shelter in China.</P>
      <P>Some local newspaper reports voiced their suspicion of the pact, pointing to the
article which stipulates that "either side receiving the plea from the other
side may decide on its own whether to repatriate  wanted fugitives  if vital
interest or exceptional circumstances are involved."</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, the two sides worked out the mutually acceptable wording
based on the main spirit of most international judicial assistance  accords,
which usually exclude political, military and religious criminals from mandatory
repatriation.</P>
      <P>Due to the sensitive relations between Taiwan and China, it is essential to
distinguish political, military or religious criminals from two-way crime-
fighting efforts, in which economic criminals are included,  particularly  those
who commit crimes  relating  to embezzlement, breach of trust, fraud and money
laundering, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>More than 50 major economic criminals from Taiwan, including those convicted or
indicted, have fled to China over the past few years, according to information
provided by the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>They include former Legislative Yuan Speaker Liu Sung-pan, former Kaohsiung
Mayor Wang Yu-yun and his son Wang Chih-hsiung, an ex- legislator, and former
Kaohsiung City Council Speaker Chu An-hsiung, as well as Chen Yu-hao, former
head of the Tuntex Group, and Tseng Cheng-jen, former owner of the Sogo
Department Store in Taichung City.</P>
      <P>But government officials said in recent days that China will no longer be a safe
haven for Taiwanese fugitives, as the Investigation Bureau and the National
Police Agency have referred a list of most-wanted Taiwanese criminals to Chinese
authorities.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice said it will soon hold work meetings with Chinese public
security, prosecution and law authorities to discuss the establishment of a
cooperation framework and related details on joint efforts in crime fighting.</P>
      <P>In the future, Taiwanese inmates serving jail terms in China can apply to
complete their sentence in Taiwan and vice versa based on humanitarian
considerations and mutual benefits in compliance with the Taiwan-China judicial
assistance accord.</P>
      <P>This accord is one of three pacts signed by Taiwan and China in the Chinese city
of Nanjing on April 26.</P>
      <P>The two other pacts concerned  financial  cooperation  and increasing regularly
scheduled flights between the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to post marginal economic growth in 2009: think tank</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is likely to post marginal economic growth of 0.11 percent in 2009 as the
country's export momentum is battered by overall plunging demand, the Taiwan
Institute of Economic Research (TIER), a local think tank, forecast Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Despite expanded demand in some Asian markets, overall demand continues  to
dwindle because of the global financial crisis, according to a monthly report
published by the think tank.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, Taiwan's exports are projected to shrink by 9.19
percent in 2009, while imports are likely to contract by 13.87 percent, the TIER
said, predicting a trade surplus of US$25.05 billion for the year.</P>
      <P>The sharp fall in international commodity prices will ease inflation
significantly, with Taiwan's inflation rate projected at 0.17 percent for 2009,
the report said.</P>
      <P>Although government investment will increase by 26.96 percent thanks to the
administration's efforts to promote public construction projects, fixed
investment by the private sector is expected to drop by 11.53 percent as
businesses delay or cut back on their capital expenditure, the report went on.</P>
      <P>In terms of private consumption, the TIER predicted that there will be a slight
growth of 0.62 percent, as the forced unpaid leave policy and workforce
reduction by local businesses are taking a heavy toll on the public's purchasing
power.</P>
      <P>Further observation is required to judge the effect of the government's shopping
voucher program and the recent influx of Chinese tourists on boosting private
consumption, according to the TIER report.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a survey conducted by the TIER in March on the business climate for
the manufacturing sector shows that 42.8 percent of manufacturers think
conditions will improve over the next six months, up from 36.6 percent recorded
in a February survey.</P>
      <P>A total of 18.6 percent of the respondents predicted that conditions worsen over
the next six months, down from 24 percent in the previous month.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 38.6 percent said they think conditions will remain the same, down
from 39.4 percent in February.</P>
      <P>According to the TIER, despite weak demand from the European and U.S. markets,
shipments by Taiwan's electronics and machinery sectors are likely to pick up in
the next six months thanks to rush orders from emerging markets.</P>
      <P>The composite business climate indicator for the manufacturing sector stood at
105.59 in March, up 11.86 points compared with the previous month, the TIER
report shows.</P>
      <P>The composite business climate indicator for the service sector registered
103.26, up 9.78 points from February.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Every flight from America that arrives in Taiwan from April 29 onward will be
subject to a strict on-board screening procedure in an effort to prevent the
entry of a new strain of swine influenza, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
announced in a statement Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The first flight to undergo the procedure will be EVA Airways flight BR017 from
San Francisco, which is scheduled to land at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport at 5: 10 a.m. that day, the CDC said.</P>
      <P>The statement said the CDC decided to take the unusual step under the
instruction of Premier Liu Chao-shiuan and following a resolution of the
Executive Yuan's command center for prevention of A/H1N1 swine flu outbreaks
that have been reported in Mexico, the United States, Canada and several other
countries.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi said it is impossible to predict when
the procedure will be lifted.</P>
      <P>In addition to Taiwan, Japan has already taken the same measure for flights from
Mexico, said Shih.</P>
      <P>He continued that when an affected flight arrives at the airport, all passengers
will be asked to stay in their seats until quarantine officials board the plane
and give them a hygiene lecture and information on the new type of flu.</P>
      <P>The officials will also screen every passenger and anyone with flu-like
symptoms, including coughing and sore throat, will be kept on the plane for
further checks, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Those passengers allowed to leave the aircraft will still have to pass a
temperature reader once inside the airport.</P>
      <P>If the officials cannot eliminate the possibility of swine flu infection, those
who are suspected of being infected will be taken directly to a hospital for
further checks, Shih went on, adding that those who do not show signs of
infection at the airport but who develop symptoms after entering the country
will be requested to report to the CDC, he added.</P>
      <P>According to border surveillance statistics, around 50 flights from the U.S. and
Canada had landed over the past three days, bringing more than 15,000 travelers
into the country.</P>
      <P>Shih said five of the travelers were found to have a fever upon arrival, but all
were declared uninfected with swine flu.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the Kaohsiung Harbor Bureau also activated  an emergency  checking
mechanism Tuesday at the country's largest seaport.</P>
      <P>The outbreaks in Mexico and the U.S. have prompted the World Health Organization
to raise its alert level to phase 4 on a scale of six, indicating a
significantly increased risk of pandemic.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China marked the 57th anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Peace
Treaty by unveiling a set of five statues Tuesday at Taipei Guest House, where
the treaty was signed in 1952.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou presided over the unveiling of the statues which depict
ROC Envoy George Yeh and his Japanese counterpart Isao Kawada inking the treaty
while three other diplomats look on.</P>
      <P>At Tuesday's ceremony, Ma stressed that the reenactment of the 1952 signing
should serve as a reminder to the public that Taiwan belongs to the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Ma, who holds a doctorate in International Law from Harvard University, said the
Sino-Japanese treaty was a followup to the Treaty of San Francisco concluded
between Japan and the allied nations in 1951.</P>
      <P>The ROC was not invited to sign the San Francisco treaty because it was engaged
in a civil war with the People's Republic of China and there was disagreement
among the allied nations over which side was the legitimate government of China.</P>
      <P>"The Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty stated only that Japan renounced all rights to
territories it had occupied by force, but did not specify that Taiwan should be
ceded to any particular state, " Ma said, adding that "this was in line with the
terms of the Treaty of San Francisco."</P>
      <P>Since the territories occupied by Japan at the time were many, the signatories
to the San Francisco treaty preferred that the territorial issues be resolved
through separate agreements between the individual states and Japan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"This gave rise to many bilateral treaties between Japan and other countries on
territorial rights," Ma said, citing as an example the treaty between Japan and
Russia.</P>
      <P>"The Sino-Japanese  Treaty was concluded against a similar backdrop, and reading
between the lines, one can easily see that the aim was to hand over Taiwan to
the Republic of China." Ma said.</P>
      <P>The treaty not only brought peace to Taiwan and Japan, but also ushered in a
period of friendly relations between the two states, he added.</P>
      <P>"The treaty is vital not only to Taiwan, but also to the whole region, " and the
statues are a reminder of its value, the president stated.</P>
      <P>"These statues will remind people who visit this house of how much we owe to
those who drafted the treaty," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma's  comments  took  direct  aim  the  argument  by many pro-independence
activists that Taiwan has not belonged to any state since Japan gave it up at
the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>These activists reject China's claim to the island and promote their Taiwan
independence cause based on the argument that Japan did not hand over Taiwan to
any other state.</P>
      <P>The issue is often a contentious one in Taiwan, especially at election time when
some politicians campaign on a platform of permanent separation between Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>Ma was obviously trying to tread a fine line between Beijing's view and that of
the proponents of independence by saying that Taiwan belongs to the "Republic of
China, " rather than "China, " which usually refers to the People's Republic of
China.</P>

      <P>The number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan should be limited to 5,000 per
day to ensure the quality of their trips, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chinese made up 1 million of the 3.7 million foreign visitors to
Taiwan last year, the premier said, however, his administration had not
anticipated that the number would grow to the current 5,000 to 6,000 Chinese
tourists per day.</P>
      <P>"This influx results in a lower quality of service -- a problem that must be
addressed urgently by the government." Liu said at a media gathering.</P>
      <P>"We should not admit more tourists than we can accommodate and we need to
improve our local tourism infrastructure," the premier said.</P>
      <P>"The exact daily cap for the number of Chinese tourists should be determined
jointly by the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, but I expect it to be below 5,000." Liu said.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage Chinese tourists to make more comprehensive tours of the
island, the premier said, his administration is mulling a revision of the
pertinent regulations to allow groups of two or three people to visit rather,
than the current minimum of five.</P>
      <P>Liu made the statements two days after President Ma Ying-jeou asked the
administration to impose a proper cap on the daily number of Chinese tourists,
after he learned that there were not enough tour buses to meet demand.</P>
      <P>When Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists took effect on July 4, 2008, the
government imposed a cap of 3,000 visitors per day, but the number has spiked in
the lead up to China's May Day holiday, and local officials have raised the
ceiling by transferring unused quotas from previous days.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan marks anniversary of Sino-Japan Peace Treaty</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Republic of China marked the 57th anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Peace
Treaty by unveiling a set of five statues Tuesday at Taipei Guest House, where
the treaty was signed in 1952.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou presided over the unveiling of the statues which depict
ROC Envoy George Yeh and his Japanese counterpart Isao Kawada inking the treaty
while three other diplomats look on.</P>
      <P>At Tuesday's ceremony, Ma stressed that the reenactment of the 1952 signing
should serve as a reminder to the public that Taiwan belongs to the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Ma, who holds a doctorate in International Law from Harvard University, said the
Sino-Japanese treaty was a followup to the Treaty of San Francisco concluded
between Japan and the allied nations in 1951.</P>
      <P>The ROC was not invited to sign the San Francisco treaty because it was engaged
in a civil war with the People's Republic of China and there was disagreement
among the allied nations over which side was the legitimate government of China.</P>
      <P>"The Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty stated only that Japan renounced all rights to
territories it had occupied by force, but did not specify that Taiwan should be
ceded to any particular state, " Ma said, adding that "this was in line with the
terms of the Treaty of San Francisco."</P>
      <P>Since the territories occupied by Japan at the time were many, the signatories
to the San Francisco treaty preferred that the territorial issues be resolved
through separate agreements between the individual states and Japan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"This gave rise to many bilateral treaties between Japan and other countries on
territorial rights," Ma said, citing as an example the treaty between Japan and
Russia.</P>
      <P>"The Sino-Japanese  Treaty was concluded against a similar backdrop, and reading
between the lines, one can easily see that the aim was to hand over Taiwan to
the Republic of China." Ma said.</P>
      <P>The treaty not only brought peace to Taiwan and Japan, but also ushered in a
period of friendly relations between the two states, he added.</P>
      <P>"The treaty is vital not only to Taiwan, but also to the whole region, " and the
statues are a reminder of its value, the president stated.</P>
      <P>"These statues will remind people who visit this house of how much we owe to
those who drafted the treaty," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma's  comments  took  direct  aim  the  argument  by many pro-independence
activists that Taiwan has not belonged to any state since Japan gave it up at
the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>These activists reject China's claim to the island and promote their Taiwan
independence cause based on the argument that Japan did not hand over Taiwan to
any other state.</P>
      <P>The issue is often a contentious one in Taiwan, especially at election time when
some politicians campaign on a platform of permanent separation between Taiwan
and China.</P>
      <P>Ma was obviously trying to tread a fine line between Beijing's view and that of
the proponents of independence by saying that Taiwan belongs to the "Republic of
China, " rather than "China, " which usually refers to the People's Republic of
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Daily number of Chinese tourists to be fixed below 5,000: premier</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Chinese tourists visiting Taiwan should be limited to 5,000 per
day to ensure the quality of their trips, Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chinese made up 1 million of the 3.7 million foreign visitors to
Taiwan last year, the premier said, however, his administration had not
anticipated that the number would grow to the current 5,000 to 6,000 Chinese
tourists per day.</P>
      <P>"This influx results in a lower quality of service -- a problem that must be
addressed urgently by the government." Liu said at a media gathering.</P>
      <P>"We should not admit more tourists than we can accommodate and we need to
improve our local tourism infrastructure," the premier said.</P>
      <P>"The exact daily cap for the number of Chinese tourists should be determined
jointly by the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications, but I expect it to be below 5,000." Liu said.</P>
      <P>In order to encourage Chinese tourists to make more comprehensive tours of the
island, the premier said, his administration is mulling a revision of the
pertinent regulations to allow groups of two or three people to visit rather,
than the current minimum of five.</P>
      <P>Liu made the statements two days after President Ma Ying-jeou asked the
administration to impose a proper cap on the daily number of Chinese tourists,
after he learned that there were not enough tour buses to meet demand.</P>
      <P>When Taiwan's opening to Chinese tourists took effect on July 4, 2008, the
government imposed a cap of 3,000 visitors per day, but the number has spiked in
the lead up to China's May Day holiday, and local officials have raised the
ceiling by transferring unused quotas from previous days.</P>

      <P>Taiwan began to make on-board checks of passengers on flights arriving from the
United States Wednesday in a bid to keep the swine flu virus at bay.</P>
      <P>Quarantine officials from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) boarded eight
flights from Canada and the United States after they arrived at their gates at
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport early Wednesday morning and asked
passengers if they had flu-like symptoms, such as coughing or a sore throat.</P>
      <P>Since none of the fewer-than-3,000 passengers gave positive answers, they were
all allowed to leave the aircraft.</P>
      <P>Two of the passengers, however,  were found to have high temperatures when they
passed a temperature sensor as they headed to the immigration counter.</P>
      <P>The quarantine officials later let the two go after excluding the possibility
that they were infected with swine flu.</P>
      <P>The CDC announced Tuesday that every flight from the U.S. arriving in Taiwan
beginning Wednesday would be subject to a strict on-board screening procedure,
as health officials try to prevent the entry of the A/H1N1 virus that is
suspected of being responsible for over 150 deaths in Mexico.</P>
      <P>The CDC decided to take the unusual step at the instruction of Premier Liu Chao-
shiuan and following a resolution of the Executive Yuan's command center to
prevent A/H1N1 swine flu outbreaks that have been reported around the world.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) set up a central command center Tuesday to take
preventive measures against the virus and cope with any local outbreaks.</P>
      <P>Established at a meeting of cross-government agencies, the center will focus on
strengthening surveillance for swine flu at boundary control points and raising
travel warnings for the United States and Mexico and other areas affected by the
virus, Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization (WHO)  on Monday raised its influenza pandemic
alert from phase 3 to phase 4 -- just two levels short of a full-blown pandemic
-- to indicate that there is sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus.</P>

      <P>Taiwan expects to take part in more World Health Organization (WHO) information-
sharing groups after it becomes an observer in the World Health Assembly (WHA) ,
the WHO's decision-making arm, a Taiwan health official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Among the groups it expects to take part in include the International Health
Regulations (IHR) , and five other information mechanisms, including the WHO's
Food Safety Network (INFOSAN), said Yang  Che-ming,  director-general  of
Bureau  of International Cooperation under the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>It will also participate in the Global Outbreak Alert Response Network (GOARN),
the Stop TB Partnership, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) ,
and the International Collaboration and Prevention Combating Counterfeit Drugs
(IMPACT), Yang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was included in the IHR framework in early April -- which some attributed
to improved ties with China.</P>
      <P>Through its accession to the IHR -- a framework under the WHO devised to control
the spread of infectious diseases around the globe -- Taiwan was able to
directly contact WHO authorities for the first time and get first-hand
information about avian flu prevention and control, food security, and the
spread and control of other epidemic diseases.</P>
      <P>As to Taiwan's participation in the other mechanisms, Yang said it was still too
early to speculate how deeply Taiwan will be involved in activities in these
groups.</P>
      <P>There are currently six WHA observers, including the Holy See and the
International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, and Yang said the degree and
content of their participation as observers vary.</P>
      <P>"How Taiwan should take part in the WHA as an observer and to what degree will
require further discussion," Yang noted.</P>
      <P>Because of China's opposition,  Taiwan had previously been excluded from the
IHR, even though a "universal application" phrase was introduced in the
regulations in 2005 with the firm support of the United  States and Taiwan's
diplomatic  allies,  and the encouragement of the EU and Japan.</P>
      <P>In the past, Taiwan was only able to obtain information on outbreaks of
communicable diseases or emergencies in the region, including in China and Hong
Kong, on a secondhand basis.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou announced Wednesday that Taiwan has been invited to take
part as an observer in the upcoming World Health Assembly (WHA) , a major step
forward in Taiwan's  campaign  for meaning participation  in international
organizations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  possible  presence at the annual meeting of the decision-making arm of
the World Health Organization (WHO) will mark the first time that the country
has been allowed to participate in a meeting or activity of United Nations
specialized agencies since losing its U.N. membership to China in 1971.</P>
      <P>This is also the first time Taiwan will be allowed to take part in the WHA after
12 failed attempts at WHA participation since 1997.</P>
      <P>Ma attributed the achievement to the goodwill displayed by Beijing toward Taiwan
after the inauguration last May of his administration, which has been working to
improve cross-Taiwan Strait ties and has adopted a moderate approach  to promote
foreign relations.</P>
      <P>Ma also praised the strong support of prominent members of the international
community, including the United States, Japan, the European Union, Southeast
Asia, Australia and New Zealand, as helping with the campaign.</P>
      <P>Efforts made by various groups in Taiwan regardless of political affiliation
also made important contributions to the cause, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Participation in the activities of the WHO is not merely a political issue.
More importantly, it is a human rights issue, and the health and medical rights
of Taiwan's 23 million people should not get overlooked, " the president said
during a high-level meeting attended by administration officials.</P>
      <P>According to Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan, Taiwan
received a letter from the WHO Tuesday night inviting it to attend as an
observer in the WHA's annual meeting scheduled for May 18-27 in Geneva.</P>
      <P>The letter, addressed to Yeh and signed by WHO Director-General Margaret Chan,
extends the invitation to "the Department of Health, Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>"I would appreciate if you could confirm the attendance of the Department of
Health, Chinese Taipei, and the names of the attendees at your earliest
convenience," the letter read.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the use of the name "Chinese Taipei" by the WHO could signify a
policy change by the world body, which had previously stuck to the name "Taiwan,
China" or "Taiwan, province of China" in its official documents to reflect the
United Nations' "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Yeh explained that obtaining observer status in the WHA will enable Taiwan to
maintain direct contact with the WHO to exchange information on disease control
and prevention, better protecting the health and safety of the people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the DOH will assemble a 15-member delegation comprised of 12 health
officials and three public health experts to attend the event, and that the team
is expected to arrive in Geneva May 17.</P>
      <P>Journalists from Taiwan are also expected to be allowed to cover this year's WHA
for the first time in five years, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese journalists used to be able to cover the annual event, but
authorization was withdrawn in 2004 under pressure from China, on grounds that
Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the United Nations since 1971, when the
Republic of China's seat was given to the People's Republic of China, and it has
tried unsuccessfully -- thanks to Beijing's objections -- to have the United
Nations consider the issue of its representation since 1993.</P>
      <P>Unlike in 2007, when Taiwan made a high-profile push for full membership under
the name "Taiwan, " the country promoted a bid in 2008 to "participate
meaningfully in the activities of the U.N. specialized agencies, " in line with
Ma's "modus vivendi" diplomatic strategy that favors a moderate and pragmatic
approach.</P>
      <P>Ma first disclosed in March that representatives of Taiwan and China would meet
overseas in April to discuss issues concerning Taiwan's participation in the
WHA.</P>
      <P>As to the membership name preferred by the government in joining international
organizations, Ma said the country's official name of "the Republic of China"
remains the government's top choice.</P>
      <P>Coming in second would be "Taiwan, " followed by "Chinese Taipei" -- the name
used by Taiwan when competing in the Olympic Games and many other sports events,
he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has been in contact with the United States, seeking samples of the H1N1
swine flu virus strain so that local pharmaceutical companies can start
developing a human vaccine against the virus that emerged in Mexico last week,
Health Minister Yeh Chin-chuan said Wednesday.</P>

Biotechnology, is expected to be inaugurated by June.</P>
      <P>The Adimmune vaccine plant, which will be the largest of its kind in Asia with a
maximum annual capacity of 30 million doses of vaccine, will allow production of
human vaccine against swine flu to be significantly ramped up, Yeh noted.</P>

      <P>Local biopharmaceutical firm Adimmune Corp. officials said Wednesday that the
company will cancel all existing orders and shift exclusively to the production
of a human vaccine against H1N1 swine flu if asked to do so by the government.</P>
      <P>A spokesman said that once Adimmune receives samples of the H1N1 swine flu virus
strain, it will be capable of churning out up to 24 million doses of swine flu
vaccine in three to six months.</P>
      <P>The expansion of an Adimmune influenza vaccine plant is scheduled to be
completed in June and will be capable of producing 30 million doses of flu
vaccine a year -- a capacity far exceeding the approximately 3 million doses per
year that Taiwan has actually needed in terms of flu vaccine in the past prior
to the threat of a swine flu outbreak, said Lin Teh-kun, head of the business

      <P>It's free money that many people would love to snap up, but in Taiwan, more than
147,000 people have not picked up their share of shopping vouchers issued by the
government to stimulate domestic spending, it was announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, with only one day to go before the deadline for collection,
vouchers worth more than NT$530 million (US$15.74 million) have yet to be
collected, according to statistics released by Chunghwa Post Co.</P>
      <P>Chen Tzu-teh, vice president of the state-run postal company, said the number of
uncollected vouchers is still lower than expected, pointing out that 99.36
percent of the vouchers issued have been collected.</P>
      <P>He urged their rightful recipients to come forward to collect them at designated
post offices before business closes Thursday.</P>
      <P>The vouchers were given out earlier this year as part of an economic stimulus
package to boost consumer spending and economic growth in light of the current
economic downturn, which has hit export-dependent Taiwan hard.</P>
      <P>All Taiwanese citizens -- with the exception of those living abroad without
identity cards, household registration or residency rights -- and their foreign
spouses are eligible to each receive NT$3,600 in vouchers.</P>
      <P>The vouchers must be exchanged for goods or services by Sept. 30, 2009.</P>
      <P>Data from the Ministry of Finance show that as of April 20, more than NT$65.53
billion, or 78.26 percent, of the total of NT$83.73 billion vouchers issued had
been used by consumers and cashed by the businesses that received them.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will negotiate with China to establish unified standards for digital
television, light-emitting diode (LED) , and flat panel display products in a
fourth round of talks between the two sides, a Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Cooperation  on unified product standards and certification systems will be put
on the agenda of the fourth round of talks between Taiwan and China, expected to
take place in the second half of the year, according to Chen Jay-san, director
of the MOEA's Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection (BSMI).</P>
      <P>Negotiations will cover establishing joint product standards and testing,
inspection  and  certification  systems,  developing certification and metrology
techniques, and supervising and managing markets, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Part of the effort to create uniform standards, especially for more advanced
technologies, across the Taiwan Strait is to help Taiwan become more competitive
in the rapidly expanding market, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a forum on the development of flat panel standards
attended by several flat panel manufacturers and the Taiwan Accreditation
Foundation, the Taiwan Digital TV Alliance and the Industrial Technology
Research Institute's Center for Measurement Standards.</P>
      <P>During the forum, AU Optronics and Chi Mei Optoelectronics, Taiwan's two largest
LCD manufacturers, indicated that standards and measurement standardization
could be established for flat panel industries in Taiwan and China, which would
help reduce production costs and better ensure product quality.</P>
      <P>A series of standards for the industry developed  by the International
Organization for Standards (ISO) , the International Electrotechnical Committee
(IEC), and the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI)
already exist, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The most important question for the two sides across the Taiwan Strait  is how
to integrate  Taiwan's  edge in research  and manufacturing technology and
China's vast market to create more clout in developing standards for
international use, Chen noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PEMG has sold US$700 million-worth of products in Taiwan: FSC head</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 16,000 people in Taiwan have purchased structured notes and investment
funds from the U.S.-based Private Equity Management Group (PEMG) , which is
mired in a fraud scandal, the Finance Supervisory Commission (FSC) chairman said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Sean Chen revealed the figures at a Legislative Yuan Finance Committee meeting
in response to questions about the PEMG case, including that of whether the
investors will be able to recover their money.</P>
      <P>Some legislators expressed doubt as to whether the FSC can freeze PEMG assets in
Taiwan, to which Chen responded that the FSC has asked the banks that introduced
PEMG products into Taiwan to draw up plans by May 1 to protect the affected
investors.</P>
      <P>He stated that the commission is still trying to find out how PEMG sold
investment policies and said that if the financial products still have any
value, there is hope that the investors will be able to claim their money back.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has already taken
action to freeze PEMG's assets and that in Taiwan, the FSC has asked the
relevant banks to organize a task force to investigate PEMG's local financial
condition and to take legal action against the group if necessary.</P>
      <P>The FSC has also reached a consensus with the U.S. authorities to take joint
action to trace all PEMG's business operations and has come up with a resolution
that the involved banks should inform their clients of the details and future
developments of the case, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to a foreign wire report, the U.S. authorities last week accused PEMG
and its founder and former chief executive Danny Pang of bilking investors by
falsely portraying returns as coming from investments in timeshare real estate
and seniors' life insurance policies, when in fact Pang was operating a Ponzi
scheme whereby investors were paid using funds raised from newer investors.</P>
      <P>Pang, a Taiwan-born American, was arrested Tuesday by the FBI on charges that he
withdrew about US$360,000 from a company account through several dozen small
transactions so that he would not have to report the money to federal
regulators.</P>
      <P>As most of Pang's investors are from Taiwan, the case has been described locally
as "Taiwan's Bernard Madoff storm, " referring to the former American
businessman and former non-executive chairman of the NASDAQ stock exchange who
was convicted of operating a Ponzi scheme that has been called the world's
largest investor fraud ever committed by a single individual.</P>

    <HEADLINE>No hidden agenda with China on WHA discussions: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia said Wednesday that there is no hidden
agenda or conditions in discussions between Taiwan and China on Taipei's
participation as an observer in the upcoming World Health Assembly (WHA) in May.</P>
      <P>"I can say with conviction that there is no secret arrangement or hidden agenda
regarding Taiwan's participation in the WHA," Hsia said in a meeting with the
local press.</P>
      <P>However, he declined to divulge details of the cross-Taiwan Strait discussions
on the issue, saying only that "health officials of both sides of the strait
have exchanged pragmatic views on related issues."</P>
      <P>Describing the fact that Taiwan received an invitation April 28 from the World
Health Organization (WHO) Secretariat to take part in this year's WHA meeting as
an observer as "a good result and something that we want, " Hsia said it also
shows that China is demonstrating goodwill on the matter.</P>
      <P>The deputy foreign minister said he expects to continue receiving annual
invitations from the WHO Secretariat for Taiwan to attend the meeting "almost as
a matter of course" and expressed belief that there will be no interruption in
Taiwan's participation, as the country will enjoy the same rights and
obligations as other WHA observers.</P>
      <P>The annual meeting of WHA -- the decision-making arm of the WHO -- is scheduled
for May 18-27 in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's presence will mark the first time the country has been allowed to
participate in a meeting or activity of United Nations specialized agencies
since losing its U.N. membership to China in 1971 and will also be the first
time the country has been allowed to take part in the WHA after 12 failed
attempts at WHA participation since 1997.</P>
      <P>Attributing  the positive result mainly to the thawing in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations since President Ma Ying-jeou took office last May, Hsia said, however,
that it should not be viewed as the only reason for the achievement, as strong
support from major countries around the world and the Foreign Ministry's hard
work have also played significant roles.</P>
      <P>"Many countries have also told us that they do not wish to see China as the only
reason for Taiwan being able to participate in the WHA," he went on, but rather
to see other international factors taken into consideration by the WHO's
decision-making body when dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>Hsia said the supporting countries were all informed of the result immediately
after Taiwan received the letter from WHO Director-General Margaret Chan
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Asked about Taiwan's next step, Hsia said Taiwan will participate in all
meetings of the WHA and try its best to make contributions.</P>
      <P>"It has not been an easy path for us to come to this point and we have to prove
that we are a worthy participant," he said.</P>
      <P>As to how the result could affect Taiwan's attempt to participate in the United
Nations in September, Hsia said the Foreign Ministry is still studying the issue
and has yet to draw up a plan on the issue.</P>

      <P>Asked what contributed to the result, Tsutsumi said that among many reasons,
improvement of relations between Taiwan and China and cross-Taiwan Strait
communications, as well as international support were crucial to the
development.</P>
      <P>However, the most important reason is Taiwans steady and persistent efforts over
the past 12 years to fight for inclusion in WHO meetings and activities, he

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will open its stock and futures markets to qualified direct institutional
investors (QDIIs) from China beginning later this year, in a bid to attract more
foreign investment and prop up the local financial market, Vice Premier Chiu
Cheng-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The move is expected to lead to an influx of US$1.12 billion from QDIIs into
Taiwan's stock market in the first year, according to estimates from industry
observers.</P>
      <P>It will be a much-needed cash injection into the local bourse, which has dropped
more than 3,500 points from 9,287 points July 31, 2007, - one of the worst falls
of stock markets worldwide during this period.</P>
      <P>As to the scope in which Chinese investors may invest in Taiwan, that is
expected to be announced in one to two months, Chiu said at a forum on financial
memorandums of understanding (MOUs) across the Taiwan Strait, as well as
financial reform.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Sean Chen said at a
legislative  session that the commission,  in collaboration with Taiwan's
central bank, will map out relevant rules to pave the way for Chinese QDIIs to
invest in Taiwan's financial market, such as the investment amount, and the
rights to operate and serve as members of the board of directors and
supervisors.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan and China sign MOUs for cooperation  in the supervision of banking,
securities, and insurance, scheduled in the second quarter this year, China is
also expected to lift the cap on QDII investment in Taiwan from 3 percent to 10
percent of Chinese QDII funds in the financial market, which is estimated to be
at NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>If QDII funds are used to buy shares of Taiwan's financial institutions, a cap
on the investment amount will be imposed by Taiwan, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Allowing the institutional investors into Taiwan's stock, futures and financial
markets will be the latest in a recent string of market-opening measures adopted
by Taiwan and mainland China after relations between the two sides began
improving last year.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's new government took office last May, it has lifted the cap on
China-bound investment by Taiwanese companies from 40 percent to 60 percent of
the company's total assets, and has been working to relax other economic and
financial regulations in an attempt to strengthen Taiwan's competitiveness, Chiu
said.</P>
      <P>Other areas of relaxation include allowing companies listed in the Hong Kong
stock market to list in Taiwan. In one example of the effects of such a move,
Want Want China, the Hong Kong-listed unit of Taiwan's food giant Want Want
Group, began to have its Taiwan depositary receipts (TDRs) traded on Taiwan's
stock market Tuesday, according to Chiu.</P>
      <P>After Want Want started its debut trading, many more Taiwanese businesses are
expected to come back to list in Taiwan to give local financial markets a shot
in the arm, according to Former Minister Without Portfolio Chu Yun-peng, who
resigned a few days ago for going on dates during office hours. He was also
speaking at the forum.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Civic groups in Taiwan asked the government  Wednesday to clarify whether a 2005
memorandum of understanding (MOU) between China and the World Health
Organization (WHO), which allows China to determine what information from the
WHO should reach Taiwan, is still in effect.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has been invited to attend the upcoming World Health Assembly
(WHA) as an observer, this does not necessarily invalidate the MOU, said Lin
Shih-chia, chief executive of the Foundation of Medical Professionals  Alliance
in Taiwan --  a front-runner in Taiwan's campaign for participation in the WHO.</P>
      <P>It is possible that Taiwan is being admitted to the WHA as an observer under the
China-WHO MOU framework, which would mean a degradation  of Taiwan's status to
that of a non-governmental organization like the Red Cross, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He noted that among the current WHA observers, the Holy See is categorized as a
state, while the Red Cross is regarded as an NGO, and Palestine is listed as a
political entity under a special resolution.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Department of Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said that
while Taiwan has been invited to join the 2009 WHA as an observer for the first
time ever, it is so far not known how Taiwan's status will be classified.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, Taiwan's dignity was harmed by the secret China-WHO MOU that
was concluded in 2005. Since then, Taiwan's public health experts have not been
able to participate in international health meetings without permission from the
WHO, and even then they have been listed as participants from "Taiwan Province,
China," which falsely implies that Taiwan is part of China, he said.</P>
      <P>The WHA invitation,  addressed  to Yeh and signed by WHO Director-General
Margaret Chan, was extended to "the Department of Health, Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>"I would appreciate if you could confirm the attendance of the Department of
Health, Chinese Taipei, and the names of the attendees at your earliest
convenience," the letter read.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the use of the name "Chinese Taipei" in the WHA would not imply
that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrew Hsia welcomed the invitation for
Taiwan to participate in the WHA under the name "Chinese Taipei, " saying that
this is in line with the "expectations of the Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>It is the designation that Taiwan uses in major international organizations,
including the International Olympic Committee and the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, he noted.</P>
      <P>Responding to Lin's concerns,  Centers for Disease Control Director General
Steve H. S. Kuo said the WHO removed the secret MOU barrier when it brought
Taiwan into the International  Health Regulations (IHR) framework in January.
This gave Taiwan access to the WHO international information network on
quarantine, food safety and tobacco hazards, he said.</P>
      <P>Kuo, however, said he is not aware that the China-WHO MOU has been invalidated.
"The next challenge for Taiwan is to resolve this issue," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two major sports events scheduled to be held in Taiwan this summer may be
deferred if the current global H1N1 new swine flu outbreaks reach a peak during
that period, the country's top sports administrator said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We won't rule out the possibility of postponing the 2009 World</P>
      <P>Games slated for July 16-26 in Kaohsiung and the 21st Summer Deaflympics to be
held in Taipei Sept.5-15 if the new swine flu outbreaks peak during the
scheduled times, " said Sports Affairs Council (SAC) Minister Tai Hsia-ling.</P>
      <P>Tai made the remarks after the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its
influenza pandemic alert Monday from phase 3 to phase 4 -- just two levels short
of a full-blown pandemic -- to indicate that there is sustained human-to-human
transmission of the new flu virus.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that Taiwan has put a lot into securing the rights to host the two
major world sports extravaganzas, Tai said the government is unlikely to
postpone them lightly.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, in the face of the new swine flu outbreaks in Mexico and several
other countries, we must be prepared for the worst, " Tai said. "If the
situation gets worse, we'll seek a professional assessment, and postponement of
the two sports events will be the last resort."</P>
      <P>Tai said that she was so worried by WHO health experts' forecast Monday that the
H1N1 outbreak could hit a peak in September, she couldn't sleep.</P>
      <P>Stressing that public health should always be given top priority, Tai said the
SAC will deal with any epidemic situation in the most serious manner.</P>
      <P>According to Tai, the World Games organizing committee has staged several anti-
terrorism drills in light of the attacks on the Sri Lankan cricket players in
Pakistan earlier this year and knowing that many Middle Eastern countries may
take part in the World Games.</P>
      <P>The organizing committee has also staged anti-epidemic exercises, with a focus
on dengue fever prevention because outbreaks of the mosquito-borne disease have
been reported in the southern port city of Kaohsiung in recent years, Tai said.</P>
      <P>"Given the new epidemic situation, the organizing committee will include H1N1
swine flu prevention in future anti-epidemic drills, " Tai added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tai said, the sports council will keep close tabs on local sports
teams that plan to go abroad for competitions or exchanges, particularly those
bound for the swine flu-affected areas, and will provide them with information
on prevention of the disease.</P>

      <P>Health authorities warned business owners Wednesday not to hoard protective face
masks in anticipation of higher prices amid a swine flu outbreak, saying that
they could face lengthy prison terms and harsh fines.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, spokesman for the Center for Disease Control and Prevention under

Mexico has prompted fears that the disease might develop into a global pandemic.</P>
      <P>Shih pointed out that according to Article 61 of the Communicable Disease

    <HEADLINE>Swine flu outbreak to be factored into president's overseas visits</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The outbreak of swine flu is being taken onto consideration as part of the
planning for overseas visits by President Ma Ying-jeou, an official from the
National Security Bureau (NSB) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Acting NSB Director Tsai Teh-sheng made the remarks at a legislative committee
meeting when asked about Ma's planned trips, amid reports that countries around
the world have heightened alerts against swine flu as the number of confirmed
cases continues to rise.</P>
      <P>Political sources said last week that President Ma Ying-jeou planned to visit
Central America twice between late May and July to attend presidential
inaugurations in two countries with which Taiwan has diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>According to the travel plan, the president will depart Taiwan in late May for a
week-long Central America visit that will take him to El Salvador to attend the
inauguration of President-elect Mauricio Funes and to several of Taiwan's other
allies in the region.</P>
      <P>In July, the sources said, Ma is scheduled to visit Panama for three to four
days, mainly to attend the inauguration of that country's next president.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that since the first swine flu cases were reported, the NSB has
stepped up collection of information on the new strain of the flu.</P>
      <P>If infections are reported in countries that the president plans to visit, then
the bureau will suggest that he seriously reconsider his trips, Tsai said,
adding that it is "still too early to make a decision."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier confident of riding out swine flu impact (roundup)</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Wednesday that Taiwan, given its experience in
fighting the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, will be
able to ride out any possible impact of a swine flu epidemic.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks as Taiwan earlier in the day launched on-board checks of
passengers on flights arriving from North America as part of its efforts to keep
the new H1N1 swine flu virus at bay.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government  has fleshed out standards  of operations for swine
flu outbreaks, Liu said the post of the country's top epidemic prevention
official will be upgraded if the World Health Organization (WHO) further raises
its influenza pandemic alert.</P>
      <P>The world health regulatory body raised its flu pandemic alert Monday from phase
3 to phase 4 -- just two levels short of a full-blown  pandemic  --  to indicate
that there is sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) Legislator Tsai
Huang-liang urged the party's headquarters  to consider deferring an anti-
government protest scheduled for May 17 amid the current swine flu concerns.</P>
      <P>"At a time when countries around the world are gearing up to fight  the flu
outbreaks,  the ruling  party  will definitely misrepresent our motives if we
assemble a large number of people to voice outrage over controversial government
policies and measures, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In response to the legislator's suggestion, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said she
will direct the party's staff members to review the situation and will make a
final decision later.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Department of Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Taiwan
has been in contact with the United States, seeking samples  of the H1N1 swine
flu virus  strain  so that local pharmaceutical companies can start developing a
human vaccine against the virus that emerged in Mexico last week.</P>
      <P>Yeh said at the Legislative Yuan that the Department of Health (DOH) has also
instructed the non-profit National Health Research Institute (NHRI) to prepare
for developing the vaccine.</P>
      <P>He said the NHRI is capable of producing vaccine in emergency situations and
that an expanded vaccine plant run by Adimmune Corp., also known as Kuo Kwang
Biotechnology, is expected to be inaugurated by June.</P>
      <P>The Adimmune vaccine plant, which will be the largest of its kind in Asia with a
maximum annual capacity of 30 million doses of vaccine, will allow production of
human vaccine against swine flu to be significantly ramped up, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Sports Affairs Council Minister Tai Hsia-ling said two major
sports events scheduled to be held in Taiwan this summer may be deferred if the
current global H1N1 new swine flu outbreaks reach a peak during that period.</P>
      <P>"We won't rule out the possibility of postponing the 2009 World</P>
      <P>Games slated for July 16-26 in Kaohsiung and the 21st Summer Deaflympics to be
held in Taipei Sept.5-15 if the new swine flu outbreaks peak during the
scheduled times, " said Tai.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, health authorities warned business owners Wednesday not to hoard
protective face masks in anticipation of higher prices amid a swine flu
outbreak, saying that they could face lengthy prison terms and harsh fines.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under
the Cabinet-level Department of Health, gave the warning as the flu outbreak in
Mexico has prompted fears that the disease might develop into a global pandemic.</P>

      <P>Local biopharmaceutical firm Adimmune Corp. officials said Wednesday that the
company will cancel all existing orders and shift exclusively to the production
of a human vaccine against H1N1 swine flu if asked to do so by the government.</P>
      <P>A spokesman said that once Adimmune receives samples of the H1N1 swine flu virus
strain, it will be capable of churning out up to 24 million doses of swine flu
vaccine in three to six months.</P>
      <P>The expansion of an Adimmune influenza vaccine plant is scheduled to be
completed in June and will be capable of producing 30 million doses of flu
vaccine a year -- a capacity far exceeding the approximately 3 million doses per
year that Taiwan has actually needed in terms of flu vaccine in the past prior
to the threat of a swine flu outbreak, said Lin Teh-kun, head of the business
department of Adimmune Corp.</P>
      <P>Adimmune, the only private human vaccine manufacturing company in Taiwan,  has
been mainly producing vaccines against influenza, Japanese encephalitis, tetanus
and tuberculosis.</P>
      <P>A current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) biopharmaceutical manufacturing
facility endorsed by the Cabinet-level Department of Health, Adimmune is poised
to become the largest human vaccine producing company in Asia when its expanded

      <P>It's free money that many people would love to snap up, but in Taiwan, more than
147,000 people have not picked up their share of shopping vouchers issued by the
government to stimulate domestic spending, it was announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, with only one day to go before the deadline for collection,
vouchers worth more than NT$530 million (US$15.74 million) have yet to be
collected, according to statistics released by Chunghwa Post Co.</P>
      <P>Chen Tzu-teh, vice president of the state-run postal company, said the number of
uncollected vouchers is still lower than expected, pointing out that 99.36
percent of the vouchers issued have been collected.</P>
      <P>He urged their rightful recipients to come forward to collect them at designated
post offices before business closes Thursday.</P>
      <P>The vouchers were given out earlier this year as part of an economic stimulus
package to boost consumer spending and economic growth in light of the current
economic downturn, which has hit export-dependent Taiwan hard.</P>
      <P>All Taiwanese citizens -- with the exception of those living abroad without
identity cards, household registration or residency rights -- and their foreign

      <P>The vouchers must be exchanged for goods or services by Sept. 30, 2009.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will negotiate with China to establish unified standards for digital
television, light-emitting diode (LED) , and flat panel display products in a
fourth round of talks between the two sides, a Ministry of Economic Affairs
(MOEA) official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Cooperation  on unified product standards and certification systems will be put
on the agenda of the fourth round of talks between Taiwan and China, expected to
take place in the second half of the year, according to Chen Jay-san, director
of the MOEA's Bureau of Standards, Metrology and Inspection (BSMI).</P>
      <P>Negotiations will cover establishing joint product standards and testing,
inspection  and  certification  systems,  developing certification and metrology
techniques, and supervising and managing markets, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Part of the effort to create uniform standards, especially for more advanced
technologies, across the Taiwan Strait is to help Taiwan become more competitive
in the rapidly expanding market, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at a forum on the development of flat panel standards
attended by several flat panel manufacturers and the Taiwan Accreditation
Foundation, the Taiwan Digital TV Alliance and the Industrial Technology
Research Institute's Center for Measurement Standards.</P>
      <P>During the forum, AU Optronics and Chi Mei Optoelectronics, Taiwan's two largest
LCD manufacturers, indicated that standards and measurement standardization
could be established for flat panel industries in Taiwan and China, which would
help reduce production costs and better ensure product quality.</P>
      <P>A series of standards for the industry developed  by the International
Organization for Standards (ISO) , the International Electrotechnical Committee
(IEC), and the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI)
already exist, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>The most important question for the two sides across the Taiwan Strait  is how
to integrate  Taiwan's  edge in research  and manufacturing technology and
China's vast market to create more clout in developing standards for

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 16,000 people in Taiwan have purchased structured notes and investment
funds from the U.S.-based Private Equity Management Group (PEMG) , which is
mired in a fraud scandal, the Finance Supervisory Commission (FSC) chairman said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Sean Chen revealed the figures at a Legislative Yuan Finance Committee meeting
in response to questions about the PEMG case, including that of whether the
investors will be able to recover their money.</P>
      <P>Some legislators expressed doubt as to whether the FSC can freeze PEMG assets in
Taiwan, to which Chen responded that the FSC has asked the banks that introduced
PEMG products into Taiwan to draw up plans by May 1 to protect the affected
investors.</P>
      <P>He stated that the commission is still trying to find out how PEMG sold
investment policies and said that if the financial products still have any
value, there is hope that the investors will be able to claim their money back.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has already taken
action to freeze PEMG's assets and that in Taiwan, the FSC has asked the
relevant banks to organize a task force to investigate PEMG's local financial
condition and to take legal action against the group if necessary.</P>
      <P>The FSC has also reached a consensus with the U.S. authorities to take joint
action to trace all PEMG's business operations and has come up with a resolution
that the involved banks should inform their clients of the details and future
developments of the case, Chen said.</P>
      <P>According to a foreign wire report, the U.S. authorities last week accused PEMG
and its founder and former chief executive Danny Pang of bilking investors by
falsely portraying returns as coming from investments in timeshare real estate
and seniors' life insurance policies, when in fact Pang was operating a Ponzi
scheme whereby investors were paid using funds raised from newer investors.</P>
      <P>Pang, a Taiwan-born American, was arrested Tuesday by the FBI on charges that he
withdrew about US$360,000 from a company account through several dozen small
transactions so that he would not have to report the money to federal
regulators.</P>
      <P>As most of Pang's investors are from Taiwan, the case has been described locally
as "Taiwan's Bernard Madoff storm, " referring to the former American
businessman and former non-executive chairman of the NASDAQ stock exchange who
was convicted of operating a Ponzi scheme that has been called the world's
largest investor fraud ever committed by a single individual.</P>

      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia said Wednesday that there is no hidden
agenda or conditions in discussions between Taiwan and China on Taipei's
participation as an observer in the upcoming World Health Assembly (WHA) in May.</P>
      <P>"I can say with conviction that there is no secret arrangement or hidden agenda
regarding Taiwan's participation in the WHA," Hsia said in a meeting with the
local press.</P>
      <P>However, he declined to divulge details of the cross-Taiwan Strait discussions
on the issue, saying only that "health officials of both sides of the strait
have exchanged pragmatic views on related issues."</P>
      <P>Describing the fact that Taiwan received an invitation April 28 from the World
Health Organization (WHO) Secretariat to take part in this year's WHA meeting as
an observer as "a good result and something that we want, " Hsia said it also
shows that China is demonstrating goodwill on the matter.</P>
      <P>The deputy foreign minister said he expects to continue receiving annual
invitations from the WHO Secretariat for Taiwan to attend the meeting "almost as
a matter of course" and expressed belief that there will be no interruption in
Taiwan's participation, as the country will enjoy the same rights and
obligations as other WHA observers.</P>
      <P>The annual meeting of WHA -- the decision-making arm of the WHO -- is scheduled
for May 18-27 in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's presence will mark the first time the country has been allowed to
participate in a meeting or activity of United Nations specialized agencies
since losing its U.N. membership to China in 1971 and will also be the first
time the country has been allowed to take part in the WHA after 12 failed
attempts at WHA participation since 1997.</P>
      <P>Attributing  the positive result mainly to the thawing in cross-Taiwan Strait
relations since President Ma Ying-jeou took office last May, Hsia said, however,
that it should not be viewed as the only reason for the achievement, as strong
support from major countries around the world and the Foreign Ministry's hard
work have also played significant roles.</P>
      <P>"Many countries have also told us that they do not wish to see China as the only
reason for Taiwan being able to participate in the WHA," he went on, but rather
to see other international factors taken into consideration by the WHO's
decision-making body when dealing with the matter.</P>
      <P>Hsia said the supporting countries were all informed of the result immediately
after Taiwan received the letter from WHO Director-General Margaret Chan
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Asked about Taiwan's next step, Hsia said Taiwan will participate in all
meetings of the WHA and try its best to make contributions.</P>
      <P>"It has not been an easy path for us to come to this point and we have to prove
that we are a worthy participant," he said.</P>
      <P>As to how the result could affect Taiwan's attempt to participate in the United
Nations in September, Hsia said the Foreign Ministry is still studying the issue
and has yet to draw up a plan on the issue.</P>

improvement of relations between Taiwan and China and cross-Taiwan Strait

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will open its stock and futures markets to qualified direct institutional
investors (QDIIs) from China beginning later this year, in a bid to attract more
foreign investment and prop up the local financial market, Vice Premier Chiu
Cheng-hsiung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The move is expected to lead to an influx of US$1.12 billion from QDIIs into
Taiwan's stock market in the first year, according to estimates from industry
observers.</P>
      <P>It will be a much-needed cash injection into the local bourse, which has dropped
more than 3,500 points from 9,287 points July 31, 2007, - one of the worst falls
of stock markets worldwide during this period.</P>
      <P>As to the scope in which Chinese investors may invest in Taiwan, that is
expected to be announced in one to two months, Chiu said at a forum on financial
memorandums of understanding (MOUs) across the Taiwan Strait, as well as
financial reform.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Sean Chen said at a
legislative  session that the commission,  in collaboration with Taiwan's
central bank, will map out relevant rules to pave the way for Chinese QDIIs to
invest in Taiwan's financial market, such as the investment amount, and the
rights to operate and serve as members of the board of directors and
supervisors.</P>
      <P>After Taiwan and China sign MOUs for cooperation  in the supervision of banking,
securities, and insurance, scheduled in the second quarter this year, China is
also expected to lift the cap on QDII investment in Taiwan from 3 percent to 10
percent of Chinese QDII funds in the financial market, which is estimated to be
at NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>If QDII funds are used to buy shares of Taiwan's financial institutions, a cap
on the investment amount will be imposed by Taiwan, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Allowing the institutional investors into Taiwan's stock, futures and financial
markets will be the latest in a recent string of market-opening measures adopted
by Taiwan and mainland China after relations between the two sides began
improving last year.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan's new government took office last May, it has lifted the cap on
China-bound investment by Taiwanese companies from 40 percent to 60 percent of
the company's total assets, and has been working to relax other economic and
financial regulations in an attempt to strengthen Taiwan's competitiveness, Chiu
said.</P>
      <P>Other areas of relaxation include allowing companies listed in the Hong Kong
stock market to list in Taiwan. In one example of the effects of such a move,
Want Want China, the Hong Kong-listed unit of Taiwan's food giant Want Want
Group, began to have its Taiwan depositary receipts (TDRs) traded on Taiwan's
stock market Tuesday, according to Chiu.</P>
      <P>After Want Want started its debut trading, many more Taiwanese businesses are
expected to come back to list in Taiwan to give local financial markets a shot
in the arm, according to Former Minister Without Portfolio Chu Yun-peng, who
resigned a few days ago for going on dates during office hours. He was also
speaking at the forum.</P>

      <P>The 2009 World Games, scheduled to take place July 16-26 in Kaohsiung, southern
Taiwan, may have to be suspended or delayed if the current outbreak of swine flu
in North America develops into a pandemic, the CEO of the event's organizing
committee said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chao-juan, director-general of the World Games organizing committee under
the Kaohsiung city government,  said that her committee is preparing for the
worst, and that if the flu situation escalates, the committee will consider
suspending or postponing the world games.</P>
      <P>Hsu disclosed that committee members will meet with officials from the
International World Games Association May 5 to discuss contingency plans in the
event of a global flu pandemic.</P>
      <P>According to wire service reports from North America, the current flu outbreak,
caused by a new version of the A/H1N1 virus strain, has caused 2,498 infections
and 159 deaths in Mexico. The United States has reported 68 cases, including 45
in New York State, while Canada has reported 13 cases.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung, the second largest city in Taiwan, has been looking forward to
playing host to at least 4,500 athletes from 82 countries during the 2009 World
Games.</P>
      <P>The city government has estimated that the World Games will attract at least
100,000 tourists to Kaohsiung to watch the various sports events and go
sightseeing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government urged to safeguard Taiwan's dignity at WHA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Civic groups in Taiwan asked the government  Wednesday to clarify whether a 2005
memorandum of understanding (MOU) between China and the World Health
Organization (WHO), which allows China to determine what information from the
WHO should reach Taiwan, is still in effect.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has been invited to attend the upcoming World Health Assembly
(WHA) as an observer, this does not necessarily invalidate the MOU, said Lin
Shih-chia, chief executive of the Foundation of Medical Professionals  Alliance
in Taiwan --  a front-runner in Taiwan's campaign for participation in the WHO.</P>
      <P>It is possible that Taiwan is being admitted to the WHA as an observer under the
China-WHO MOU framework, which would mean a degradation  of Taiwan's status to
that of a non-governmental organization like the Red Cross, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He noted that among the current WHA observers, the Holy See is categorized as a
state, while the Red Cross is regarded as an NGO, and Palestine is listed as a
political entity under a special resolution.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Department of Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said that
while Taiwan has been invited to join the 2009 WHA as an observer for the first
time ever, it is so far not known how Taiwan's status will be classified.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, Taiwan's dignity was harmed by the secret China-WHO MOU that
was concluded in 2005. Since then, Taiwan's public health experts have not been
able to participate in international health meetings without permission from the
WHO, and even then they have been listed as participants from "Taiwan Province,
China," which falsely implies that Taiwan is part of China, he said.</P>
      <P>The WHA invitation,  addressed  to Yeh and signed by WHO Director-General
Margaret Chan, was extended to "the Department of Health, Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>"I would appreciate if you could confirm the attendance of the Department of
Health, Chinese Taipei, and the names of the attendees at your earliest
convenience," the letter read.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the use of the name "Chinese Taipei" in the WHA would not imply
that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrew Hsia welcomed the invitation for
Taiwan to participate in the WHA under the name "Chinese Taipei, " saying that
this is in line with the "expectations of the Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>It is the designation that Taiwan uses in major international organizations,
including the International Olympic Committee and the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, he noted.</P>
      <P>Responding to Lin's concerns,  Centers for Disease Control Director General
Steve H. S. Kuo said the WHO removed the secret MOU barrier when it brought
Taiwan into the International  Health Regulations (IHR) framework in January.
This gave Taiwan access to the WHO international information network on
quarantine, food safety and tobacco hazards, he said.</P>
      <P>Kuo, however, said he is not aware that the China-WHO MOU has been invalidated.
"The next challenge for Taiwan is to resolve this issue," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two major sports events scheduled to be held in Taiwan this summer may be
deferred if the current global H1N1 new swine flu outbreaks reach a peak during
that period, the country's top sports administrator said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We won't rule out the possibility of postponing the 2009 World</P>
      <P>Games slated for July 16-26 in Kaohsiung and the 21st Summer Deaflympics to be
held in Taipei Sept.5-15 if the new swine flu outbreaks peak during the
scheduled times, " said Sports Affairs Council (SAC) Minister Tai Hsia-ling.</P>
      <P>Tai made the remarks after the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its
influenza pandemic alert Monday from phase 3 to phase 4 -- just two levels short
of a full-blown pandemic -- to indicate that there is sustained human-to-human
transmission of the new flu virus.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that Taiwan has put a lot into securing the rights to host the two
major world sports extravaganzas, Tai said the government is unlikely to
postpone them lightly.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, in the face of the new swine flu outbreaks in Mexico and several
other countries, we must be prepared for the worst, " Tai said. "If the
situation gets worse, we'll seek a professional assessment, and postponement of
the two sports events will be the last resort."</P>
      <P>Tai said that she was so worried by WHO health experts' forecast Monday that the
H1N1 outbreak could hit a peak in September, she couldn't sleep.</P>
      <P>Stressing that public health should always be given top priority, Tai said the
SAC will deal with any epidemic situation in the most serious manner.</P>
      <P>According to Tai, the World Games organizing committee has staged several anti-
terrorism drills in light of the attacks on the Sri Lankan cricket players in
Pakistan earlier this year and knowing that many Middle Eastern countries may
take part in the World Games.</P>
      <P>The organizing committee has also staged anti-epidemic exercises, with a focus
on dengue fever prevention because outbreaks of the mosquito-borne disease have
been reported in the southern port city of Kaohsiung in recent years, Tai said.</P>
      <P>"Given the new epidemic situation, the organizing committee will include H1N1
swine flu prevention in future anti-epidemic drills, " Tai added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tai said, the sports council will keep close tabs on local sports
teams that plan to go abroad for competitions or exchanges, particularly those
bound for the swine flu-affected areas, and will provide them with information
on prevention of the disease.</P>

materials needed to fight against an ongoing epidemic or by hiking the prices of
such materials are liable to a sentence of one to seven years in prison,  plus a
fine of NT$5 million (US$148,286).</P>
      <P>Shih also urged the public not to rush to buy up face masks because Taiwan has

    <TEXT>
      <P>The outbreak of swine flu is being taken onto consideration as part of the
planning for overseas visits by President Ma Ying-jeou, an official from the
National Security Bureau (NSB) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Acting NSB Director Tsai Teh-sheng made the remarks at a legislative committee
meeting when asked about Ma's planned trips, amid reports that countries around
the world have heightened alerts against swine flu as the number of confirmed
cases continues to rise.</P>
      <P>Political sources said last week that President Ma Ying-jeou planned to visit
Central America twice between late May and July to attend presidential
inaugurations in two countries with which Taiwan has diplomatic relations.</P>
      <P>According to the travel plan, the president will depart Taiwan in late May for a
week-long Central America visit that will take him to El Salvador to attend the
inauguration of President-elect Mauricio Funes and to several of Taiwan's other
allies in the region.</P>
      <P>In July, the sources said, Ma is scheduled to visit Panama for three to four
days, mainly to attend the inauguration of that country's next president.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that since the first swine flu cases were reported, the NSB has
stepped up collection of information on the new strain of the flu.</P>
      <P>If infections are reported in countries that the president plans to visit, then
the bureau will suggest that he seriously reconsider his trips, Tsai said,
adding that it is "still too early to make a decision."</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Wednesday that Taiwan, given its experience in
fighting the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, will be
able to ride out any possible impact of a swine flu epidemic.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks as Taiwan earlier in the day launched on-board checks of
passengers on flights arriving from North America as part of its efforts to keep
the new H1N1 swine flu virus at bay.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government  has fleshed out standards  of operations for swine
flu outbreaks, Liu said the post of the country's top epidemic prevention
official will be upgraded if the World Health Organization (WHO) further raises
its influenza pandemic alert.</P>
      <P>The world health regulatory body raised its flu pandemic alert Monday from phase
3 to phase 4 -- just two levels short of a full-blown  pandemic  --  to indicate
that there is sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) Legislator Tsai
Huang-liang urged the party's headquarters  to consider deferring an anti-
government protest scheduled for May 17 amid the current swine flu concerns.</P>
      <P>"At a time when countries around the world are gearing up to fight  the flu
outbreaks,  the ruling  party  will definitely misrepresent our motives if we
assemble a large number of people to voice outrage over controversial government
policies and measures, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In response to the legislator's suggestion, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said she
will direct the party's staff members to review the situation and will make a
final decision later.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Department of Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Taiwan
has been in contact with the United States, seeking samples  of the H1N1 swine
flu virus  strain  so that local pharmaceutical companies can start developing a
human vaccine against the virus that emerged in Mexico last week.</P>
      <P>Yeh said at the Legislative Yuan that the Department of Health (DOH) has also
instructed the non-profit National Health Research Institute (NHRI) to prepare
for developing the vaccine.</P>
      <P>He said the NHRI is capable of producing vaccine in emergency situations and
that an expanded vaccine plant run by Adimmune Corp., also known as Kuo Kwang
Biotechnology, is expected to be inaugurated by June.</P>
      <P>The Adimmune vaccine plant, which will be the largest of its kind in Asia with a
maximum annual capacity of 30 million doses of vaccine, will allow production of
human vaccine against swine flu to be significantly ramped up, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Sports Affairs Council Minister Tai Hsia-ling said two major
sports events scheduled to be held in Taiwan this summer may be deferred if the
current global H1N1 new swine flu outbreaks reach a peak during that period.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WHA invitation raises Taiwan's international profile (roundup)</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will attend this year's World Health Assembly as an observer under the
name Chinese Taipei, marking a giant step forward in its quest for greater
international participation.</P>
      <P>It will mark the first time since its 1971 withdrawal from the United Nations
wthat Taiwan has participated in a U.N. specialized agency's event.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou announced Wednesday that Taiwan has been invited to take
part as an observer in the upcoming World Health Assembly (WHA), a major step
forward in Taiwan's campaign for meaning participation in international
organizations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  possible  presence at the annual meeting of the decision-making arm of
the World Health Organization (WHO) will mark the first time that the country
has been allowed to participate in a meeting or activity of United Nations
specialized agencies since losing its U.N. membership to China in 1971.</P>
      <P>This is also the first time Taiwan will be allowed to take part in the WHA after
12 failed attempts at WHA participation since 1997.</P>
      <P>Ma attributed the achievement to the goodwill displayed by Beijing toward Taiwan
after the inauguration last May of his administration, which has been working to
improve cross-Taiwan Strait ties and has adopted a moderate approach  to promote
foreign relations.</P>
      <P>Ma also praised the strong support of prominent members of the international
community, including the United States, Japan, the European Union, Southeast
Asia, Australia and New Zealand, as helping with the campaign.</P>
      <P>Efforts made by various groups in Taiwan regardless of political affiliation
also made important contributions to the cause, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Participation in the activities of the WHO is not merely a political issue.
More importantly, it is a human rights issue, and the health and medical rights
of Taiwan's 23 million people should not get overlooked, " the president said
during a high-level meeting attended by administration officials.</P>
      <P>According to Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan, Taiwan
received a letter from the WHO Tuesday night inviting it to attend as an
observer in the WHA's annual meeting scheduled for May 18-27 in Geneva.</P>
      <P>The letter, addressed to Yeh and signed by WHO Director-General Margaret Chan,
extends the invitation to "the Department of Health, Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>"I would appreciate if you could confirm the attendance of the Department of
Health, Chinese Taipei, and the names of the attendees at your earliest
convenience," the letter read.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the use of the name "Chinese Taipei" by the WHO could signify a
policy change by the world body, which had previously stuck to the name "Taiwan,
China" or "Taiwan, province of China" in its official documents to reflect the
United Nations' "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Yeh explained that obtaining observer status in the WHA will enable Taiwan to
maintain direct contact with the WHO to exchange information on disease control
and prevention, better protecting the health and safety of the people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the DOH will assemble a 15-member delegation comprised of 12 health
officials and three public health experts to attend the event, and that the team
is expected to arrive in Geneva May 17.</P>
      <P>Journalists from Taiwan are also expected to be allowed to cover this year's WHA
for the first time in five years, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese journalists used to be able to cover the annual event, but
authorization was withdrawn in 2004 under pressure from China, on grounds that
Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the United Nations since 1971, when the
Republic of China's seat was given to the People's Republic of China, and it has
tried unsuccessfully -- thanks to Beijing's objections -- to have the United
Nations consider the issue of its representation since 1993.</P>
      <P>Unlike in 2007, when Taiwan made a high-profile push for full membership under
the name "Taiwan, " the country promoted a bid in 2008 to "participate
meaningfully in the activities of the U.N. specialized agencies, " in line with
Ma's "modus vivendi" diplomatic strategy that favors a moderate and pragmatic
approach.</P>
      <P>Ma first disclosed in March that representatives of Taiwan and China would meet
overseas in April to discuss issues concerning Taiwan's participation in the
WHA.</P>
      <P>As to the membership name preferred by the government in joining international
organizations, Ma said the country's official name of "the Republic of China"
remains the government's top choice.</P>
      <P>Coming in second would be "Taiwan, " followed by "Chinese Taipei" -- the name
used by Taiwan when competing in the Olympic Games and many other sports events,
he said.</P>

WHO, and even then they have been listed as participants from "Taiwan Province,
China," which falsely implies that Taiwan is part of China, he said.</P>
      <P>The WHA invitation,  addressed  to Yeh and signed by WHO Director-General
Margaret Chan, was extended to "the Department of Health, Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>"I would appreciate if you could confirm the attendance of the Department of
Health, Chinese Taipei, and the names of the attendees at your earliest
convenience," the letter read.</P>
      <P>Yeh said that the use of the name "Chinese Taipei" in the WHA would not imply
that Taiwan is part of China.</P>
      <P>Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrew Hsia welcomed the invitation for
Taiwan to participate in the WHA under the name "Chinese Taipei, " saying that
this is in line with the "expectations of the Taiwan people."</P>
      <P>It is the designation that Taiwan uses in major international organizations,
including the International Olympic Committee and the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, he noted.</P>
      <P>Responding to Lin's concerns,  Centers for Disease Control Director General
Steve H. S. Kuo said the WHO removed the secret MOU barrier when it brought
Taiwan into the International  Health Regulations (IHR) framework in January.
This gave Taiwan access to the WHO international information network on
quarantine, food safety and tobacco hazards, he said.</P>
      <P>Kuo, however, said he is not aware that the China-WHO MOU has been invalidated.
"The next challenge for Taiwan is to resolve this issue," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>World Games, Deaflympics may be deferred if H1N1 outbreak worsens</HEADLINE>

      <P>Two major sports events scheduled to be held in Taiwan this summer may be
deferred if the current global H1N1 new swine flu outbreaks reach a peak during
that period, the country's top sports administrator said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"We won't rule out the possibility of postponing the 2009 World</P>
      <P>Games slated for July 16-26 in Kaohsiung and the 21st Summer Deaflympics to be
held in Taipei Sept.5-15 if the new swine flu outbreaks peak during the
scheduled times, " said Sports Affairs Council (SAC) Minister Tai Hsia-ling.</P>
      <P>Tai made the remarks after the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its
influenza pandemic alert Monday from phase 3 to phase 4 -- just two levels short
of a full-blown pandemic -- to indicate that there is sustained human-to-human
transmission of the new flu virus.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that Taiwan has put a lot into securing the rights to host the two
major world sports extravaganzas, Tai said the government is unlikely to
postpone them lightly.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, in the face of the new swine flu outbreaks in Mexico and several
other countries, we must be prepared for the worst, " Tai said. "If the
situation gets worse, we'll seek a professional assessment, and postponement of
the two sports events will be the last resort."</P>
      <P>Tai said that she was so worried by WHO health experts' forecast Monday that the
H1N1 outbreak could hit a peak in September, she couldn't sleep.</P>
      <P>Stressing that public health should always be given top priority, Tai said the
SAC will deal with any epidemic situation in the most serious manner.</P>
      <P>According to Tai, the World Games organizing committee has staged several anti-
terrorism drills in light of the attacks on the Sri Lankan cricket players in
Pakistan earlier this year and knowing that many Middle Eastern countries may
take part in the World Games.</P>
      <P>The organizing committee has also staged anti-epidemic exercises, with a focus
on dengue fever prevention because outbreaks of the mosquito-borne disease have
been reported in the southern port city of Kaohsiung in recent years, Tai said.</P>
      <P>"Given the new epidemic situation, the organizing committee will include H1N1
swine flu prevention in future anti-epidemic drills, " Tai added.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Tai said, the sports council will keep close tabs on local sports
teams that plan to go abroad for competitions or exchanges, particularly those
bound for the swine flu-affected areas, and will provide them with information
on prevention of the disease.</P>

      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan said Wednesday that Taiwan, given its experience in
fighting the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, will be
able to ride out any possible impact of a swine flu epidemic.</P>
      <P>Liu made the remarks as Taiwan earlier in the day launched on-board checks of
passengers on flights arriving from North America as part of its efforts to keep
the new H1N1 swine flu virus at bay.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government  has fleshed out standards  of operations for swine
flu outbreaks, Liu said the post of the country's top epidemic prevention
official will be upgraded if the World Health Organization (WHO) further raises
its influenza pandemic alert.</P>
      <P>The world health regulatory body raised its flu pandemic alert Monday from phase
3 to phase 4 -- just two levels short of a full-blown  pandemic  --  to indicate
that there is sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  opposition  Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) Legislator Tsai
Huang-liang urged the party's headquarters  to consider deferring an anti-
government protest scheduled for May 17 amid the current swine flu concerns.</P>
      <P>"At a time when countries around the world are gearing up to fight  the flu
outbreaks,  the ruling  party  will definitely misrepresent our motives if we
assemble a large number of people to voice outrage over controversial government
policies and measures, " Tsai said.</P>
      <P>In response to the legislator's suggestion, DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said she
will direct the party's staff members to review the situation and will make a
final decision later.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Department of Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said Taiwan
has been in contact with the United States, seeking samples  of the H1N1 swine
flu virus  strain  so that local pharmaceutical companies can start developing a
human vaccine against the virus that emerged in Mexico last week.</P>
      <P>Yeh said at the Legislative Yuan that the Department of Health (DOH) has also
instructed the non-profit National Health Research Institute (NHRI) to prepare
for developing the vaccine.</P>
      <P>He said the NHRI is capable of producing vaccine in emergency situations and
that an expanded vaccine plant run by Adimmune Corp., also known as Kuo Kwang
Biotechnology, is expected to be inaugurated by June.</P>
      <P>The Adimmune vaccine plant, which will be the largest of its kind in Asia with a
maximum annual capacity of 30 million doses of vaccine, will allow production of
human vaccine against swine flu to be significantly ramped up, Yeh noted.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, Sports Affairs Council Minister Tai Hsia-ling said two major
sports events scheduled to be held in Taiwan this summer may be deferred if the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will attend this year's World Health Assembly as an observer under the
name Chinese Taipei, marking a giant step forward in its quest for greater
international participation.</P>
      <P>It will mark the first time since its 1971 withdrawal from the United Nations
wthat Taiwan has participated in a U.N. specialized agency's event.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou announced Wednesday that Taiwan has been invited to take
part as an observer in the upcoming World Health Assembly (WHA), a major step
forward in Taiwan's campaign for meaning participation in international
organizations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  possible  presence at the annual meeting of the decision-making arm of
the World Health Organization (WHO) will mark the first time that the country
has been allowed to participate in a meeting or activity of United Nations
specialized agencies since losing its U.N. membership to China in 1971.</P>
      <P>This is also the first time Taiwan will be allowed to take part in the WHA after
12 failed attempts at WHA participation since 1997.</P>
      <P>Ma attributed the achievement to the goodwill displayed by Beijing toward Taiwan
after the inauguration last May of his administration, which has been working to
improve cross-Taiwan Strait ties and has adopted a moderate approach  to promote
foreign relations.</P>
      <P>Ma also praised the strong support of prominent members of the international
community, including the United States, Japan, the European Union, Southeast
Asia, Australia and New Zealand, as helping with the campaign.</P>
      <P>Efforts made by various groups in Taiwan regardless of political affiliation
also made important contributions to the cause, Ma said.</P>
      <P>"Participation in the activities of the WHO is not merely a political issue.
More importantly, it is a human rights issue, and the health and medical rights
of Taiwan's 23 million people should not get overlooked, " the president said
during a high-level meeting attended by administration officials.</P>
      <P>According to Department of Health (DOH) Minister Yeh Ching-chuan, Taiwan
received a letter from the WHO Tuesday night inviting it to attend as an
observer in the WHA's annual meeting scheduled for May 18-27 in Geneva.</P>
      <P>The letter, addressed to Yeh and signed by WHO Director-General Margaret Chan,
extends the invitation to "the Department of Health, Chinese Taipei."</P>
      <P>"I would appreciate if you could confirm the attendance of the Department of
Health, Chinese Taipei, and the names of the attendees at your earliest
convenience," the letter read.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the use of the name "Chinese Taipei" by the WHO could signify a
policy change by the world body, which had previously stuck to the name "Taiwan,
China" or "Taiwan, province of China" in its official documents to reflect the
United Nations' "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Yeh explained that obtaining observer status in the WHA will enable Taiwan to
maintain direct contact with the WHO to exchange information on disease control
and prevention, better protecting the health and safety of the people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the DOH will assemble a 15-member delegation comprised of 12 health
officials and three public health experts to attend the event, and that the team
is expected to arrive in Geneva May 17.</P>
      <P>Journalists from Taiwan are also expected to be allowed to cover this year's WHA
for the first time in five years, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese journalists used to be able to cover the annual event, but
authorization was withdrawn in 2004 under pressure from China, on grounds that
Taiwan is not a member of the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the United Nations since 1971, when the
Republic of China's seat was given to the People's Republic of China, and it has
tried unsuccessfully -- thanks to Beijing's objections -- to have the United
Nations consider the issue of its representation since 1993.</P>
      <P>Unlike in 2007, when Taiwan made a high-profile push for full membership under
the name "Taiwan, " the country promoted a bid in 2008 to "participate
meaningfully in the activities of the U.N. specialized agencies, " in line with
Ma's "modus vivendi" diplomatic strategy that favors a moderate and pragmatic
approach.</P>
      <P>Ma first disclosed in March that representatives of Taiwan and China would meet
overseas in April to discuss issues concerning Taiwan's participation in the
WHA.</P>
      <P>As to the membership name preferred by the government in joining international
organizations, Ma said the country's official name of "the Republic of China"
remains the government's top choice.</P>
      <P>Coming in second would be "Taiwan, " followed by "Chinese Taipei" -- the name
used by Taiwan when competing in the Olympic Games and many other sports events,
he said.</P>

      <P>Deputy Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia said Thursday that in light of the swine flu
outbreaks around the world, his ministry is reevaluating President Ma Ying-
jeou's plans to visit Taiwan's Central American allies in June.</P>
      <P>"We are evaluating the situation right now, making comprehensive assessments
that are focused on the president's safety the outbreaks of swine flu," Hsia
said before reporting to the Legislative Yuan's Foreign Affairs and National
Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>"We will make a decision in time for the president to make the final call," he
added.</P>
      <P>Ma is planning to visit Taiwan's Central American allies May 27-June 4 to attend
the inauguration of El Salvador's President-elect Mauricio Funes on June 1 and
is scheduled to also visit two other allies, Guatemala and Honduras.</P>
      <P>However, the outbreak of the new H1N1 swine flu and its spread across the world
has given rise to concerns about the president's safety on his planned trips.</P>
      <P>Asked under what conditions the Foreign Ministry would consider postponing Ma's
state visits, Hsia said it will depend on the number of new human infections in
the countries that Ma is planning to visit and whether there is containment of
the outbreaks.</P>
      <P>"If unfortunately the outbreaks continue to spread, we will of course seriously
consider postponing the visit," the deputy foreign minister said.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang legislator Lin Yu-fang suggested during the interpellation
session that while Ma's plans remain in place at the moment, the Foreign
Ministry should inform the three countries that there is a possibility the
president might cancel his trips.</P>
      <P>Hsia said that Lin's suggestion is a good one and that his ministry will work on
it.</P>
      <P>While there have been no human infections of swine flu in Taiwan to date, the
country is taking no chances and has instituted a number of precautions,
including on-board checks of passengers on flights arriving from the United
States.</P>
      <P>In the face of the rapid escalation of the swine flu situation, the World Health
Organization (WHO) early Thursday morning Taipei time raised its pandemic alert
to Phase five -- the second-highest level -- which signals that a pandemic is
imminent.</P>
      <P>The WHO said that as of April 29, nine countries had officially reported 148
cases of swine influenza A/H1N1 infection, including 91 laboratory confirmed
human cases and one death in the U.S. and 26 confirmed human cases of infection
with seven deaths in Mexico.</P>
      <P>Austria, Canada, Germany, Israel, New Zealand, Spain and the United Kingdom have
all reported laboratory confirmed cases with no deaths.</P>

Taiwan's official opening to investment from China, Minister of Economic Affairs
Yiin Chii-ming said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yiin said the government will adopt a gradual approach in opening up to Chinese
investment, with initially strict restrictions and an incremental expansion of
the permitted fields.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, 63 industries in the manufacturing sector will be opened
up, which will account for 30 percent of the total 212 businesses, Yiin said.</P>
      <P>In the services sector, 24 industries will be opened up, accounting for 21
percent of the total 113, he said.</P>
      <P>As to the infrastructure sector, 11 of the total of 812 categories will be
liberalized, including airports, harbors, tourism and recreation, the minister

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the help of Taiwan, residents of the rural area of La Bourne, Saint Lucia
recently got tap water for the first time ever, Taiwan's Ambassador to St. Lucia
Tom Chou said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The tap water system was inaugurated last Saturday during a ceremony presided
over by St. Lucia Prime Minister Stephenson King and attended by Chou, some 300
local residents and reporters, Chou told CNA in a telephone interview.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, King thanked Taiwan for its contribution to St. Lucia's
economic and social development, and particularly its work in helping to build
the country's infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The results prove that his country's  decision  to resume diplomatic relations
with Taiwan in 2007 was correct, the prime minister was reported as saying.</P>
      <P>The La Bourne Water project was a joint undertaking by the governments of Saint
Lucia and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A 70-year-old woman was quoted as saying that some 1,000 La Bourne residents had
never used tap water before in their lives. Following old practices, they had
been collecting rain water or carrying it from ponds filled with frogs and fish,
she said.</P>
      <P>"With the water supply being so precious, we had to make every drop count," the
woman told Taiwanese embassy workers. She added that a lack of water is a
hardship beyond the imagination of city people.</P>
      <P>During the ceremony, Lennard Montoute, minister of St. Lucia's Sports and Public
Services, emphasized the importance his country attached to the project, and
expressed appreciation for the Taiwanese government's support.</P>
      <P>Montoute said the project was completed in one year at a cost of nearly
US$400,000, with the St. Lucia Social Development Fund contributing US$300,000
and the Taiwanese government giving about US$97,000.</P>
      <P>Except for some technicians, all the workers on the project were from La Bourne,
he said, adding that the project created a great number of jobs during its
construction.</P>
      <P>"This is an important moment in La Bourne, as local residents can enjoy the use
of water in their homes from the convenience of their own faucets, " said
Montoute. More importantly, more investments now are now expected to flow into
the area to help boost local tourism and the economy, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'Bear mother' urges action to save long-neglected black bears</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>04/30/09  16:37:37</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>She is often called "Taiwan's Jane Goodall, " but she prefers the more modest
"bear mother," a rough translation of the respectful nickname "ali duma" given
to her by the Bunun tribe.</P>
      <P>For more than a decade, Hwang Mei-hsiu, an assistant professor at National
Pingtung University of Science and Technology, has devoted herself to studying
and helping Taiwan better understand one of its national symbols -- the Formosan
black bear.</P>
      <P>Despite her efforts, this symbol, although voted Taiwan's most representative
wildlife in a 2001 poll, could one day disappear from its native land if
poaching, habitat encroachment, and government and public indifference continue.</P>
      <P>It is an outcome Hwang is determined to prevent.</P>
      <P>"We should do something quickly and urgently to turn around the bear's grim
prospects. Otherwise, its fate will be sealed," said Hwang in a recent interview
with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>There are no clear figures on how many Formosan black bears remain in the wild
because they live in remote mountainous areas that are hard to reach. They are
also intelligent and elusive animals, which make them difficult to track.</P>
      <P>But there is no doubt that their numbers are dwindling, Hwang said, citing
Forestry Bureau surveys and discussions with aboriginal hunters, who report
fewer sightings.</P>
      <P>Historical records show that the bears roamed in low-altitude areas during the
Japanese colonial occupation of Taiwan (1895-1945), but aboriginal hunters tell
Hwang that the bears, listed as an endangered species by the enactment of the
nation's Wildlife Protection Act in 1989, have now disappeared from traditional
hunting grounds, possibly having fled to higher altitudes.</P>
      <P>Hwang puts the estimate on the number of black bears remaining in Taiwan at
between 200 and 700, way below the count of at least 2,000 that conservationists
generally consider as a healthy number for large mammals.</P>
      <P>"The number of the Formosan black bears has fallen mainly because of over-
exploitation and habitat encroachment, " Hwang said.</P>
      <P>Poaching remains serious, as evidenced by the continued use of wire snares and
jaw traps to catch the bears, said Hwang, who tracked and tagged bears in their
habitat in Dafen, at an elevation of 1,350 meters, in Yushan National Park from
1998-2000, and now returns there frequently.</P>
      <P>Eight out of the 15 bears she and her team of volunteers found at Yushan
National Park in the late 1990s were either pawless or toeless, as the bears had
bitten off their extremities or lost them after being ensnared for too long.</P>
      <P>She is also concerned that the bear's elusiveness may be their undoing.</P>
      <P>The public, she worries, is more interested in more visible endangered animals,
such as the Formosan landlocked salmon, green turtle, or the bird fairy pitta.</P>
      <P>"The average person has no chance of encountering Formosan black bears because
the animals live in remote mountainous areas and are rare and shy, " Hwang says.
"But just because you haven't seen one doesn't mean it does not exist."</P>
      <P>The government needs to get more involved if the Formosan black bear is to have
a future, Hwang said, criticizing the efforts of past and present
administrations as "slow and limited."</P>
      <P>"The government has not really addressed the issue squarely, so it has never
come up with a systematic and long-term plan. It has shown a lack of commitment
to resolve the complicated questions involved in conservation efforts," Hwang
said candidly.</P>
      <P>One sign of the government's limited commitment is the NT$18 million
(US$540,540) it has spent to conserve the species over the past five years.
However, this largely went to raising the animals in captivity, and was lower
than what is provided to protect more visible endangered species.</P>
      <P>Unlike funding for other endangered animals, funding for the work of Hwang's
team -the only group researching the Formosan black bears in the wild - is
frequently interrupted because of bureaucratic vagaries.</P>
      <P>The law also needs to support a long-term recovery plan and matching funds to
maintain a sustainable bear population, she added.</P>
      <P>Hwang made a name for herself with her study of the bears at Dafen in the late
1990s. Respected by Bunun tribesman because she was seen as "a woman who always
lives in the mountains and takes care of the Formosan black bear."</P>
      <P>Her study provided long-awaited baseline information on bears in the wild,
including their seasonal movements, the range of their activities, and the food
they consume, especially the acorn, the fruit of the ring-cupped oak.</P>
      <P>Although many people mistake bears as carnivorous, they are actually mainly
herbivores, Hwang noted.</P>
      <P>Her Dafen research in late 1990s for her Ph.D. studies in the University of
Minnesota made Hwang realize how important a steady flow of resources is to
tracking the animal.</P>
      <P>"It takes a lot of time, money and people to do the job," Hwang said when asked
why she has not caught a bear since her return from the United States in 2003,
despite monthly trips to Dafen.</P>
      <P>To ensure that conservation efforts continue and become more effective, Hwang is
preparing a 10-year NT$200 million proposal to submit to authorities to finance
her team's long-term bear tracking activities and expand public education
campaigns.</P>
      <P>Tracking the bears requires funding, training and much effort, as Hwang learned
during her research in the mountains in the late 1990s.</P>
      <P>She and her team had to carry heavy backpacks and walk three days from the
trailhead to Dafen. Although the distance is only 40 kilometers, they had to
navigate very steep hills, cross old suspension bridges, and even heck their way
through thick forest growth with machetes.</P>
      <P>Laborious preparation work goes into setting up the team's harmless traps. Team
members have to endure long and frequently fruitless periods waiting for the
animals and then release them.</P>
      <P>Though the working conditions of the Dafen station, which Hwang's team set up,
has improved now with solar panel-powered electricity, Hwang or her students
still need to hike to Dafen every month to monitor the installed infrared camera
and check the traps to collect the hairs of the bears.</P>
      <P>The hairs are then used for DNA analysis to develop estimates of the bears'
population.</P>
      <P>Over the years, Hwang has also devoted much of her time to educating the public
about the importance of protecting the animals. She has given more than 100
speeches around the island since 2003 when she returned from the United States,
where she earned her Ph.D.</P>
      <P>One of the central themes of her speeches is to dispel ancient Chinese beliefs
that could be harmful to the bears. According to the Chinese medicine Bible --
Ben Cao Kang Mud -- every part of the bear, whether it is the gall bladder, fat,
meat, or blood, is useful as medicine. Bear paws also have long been regarded as
a culinary delicacy.</P>
      <P>Yang Chieh-chung, deputy director of the Council of Agriculture's Endemic
Species Research Institute (ESRI), which has worked closely with Hwang on
research on Formosan black bear in captivity, agreed with Hwang on the
challenges Taiwan faces in protecting the animals.</P>
      <P>"Aside from limited funding, finding researchers is also not easy because of the
hardship involved. Long-term observation also means that they can't obtain
tangible results as quickly as they want," Yang said.</P>
      <P>Among the findings on bear by the researchers is that the animal snap wild
silver grass stalks or any other available materials to make a comfortable
resting place for itself, - a unique trait compared to other bear species.
Formosan black bears also do not hibernate.</P>
      <P>Hwang, Yang and others hope to continue to learn more about the bears to raise
public awareness about them and ultimately save them from extinction.</P>
      <P>What concerns them however, is whether humans can play a supportive, rather than
destructive role, in the bears' survival.</P>
      <P>"If the Formosan black bear continues to be ignored, it could end up facing the
same fate as the clouded leopard and the river otter, " said Hwang, referring to
two other animals thought to be extinct in the wild. ******** captions: 1.A

    <HEADLINE>Premier calls for larger reserves of flu vaccines in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Liu Chao-shiuan on Thursday urged biopharmaceutical manufacturing
companies in Taiwan,  which are capable of producing human vaccines, to begin
developing a vaccine against swine flu as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Liu advised the companies to quickly acquire samples of the A/H1N1 swine flu
virus strain from the United States so they can produce a swine flu vaccine
locally, to help Taiwan acquire enough reserves to keep at bay the virus that
emerged in Mexico last week.</P>
      <P>"The government will purchase these newly-developed swine flu vaccines at
reasonable prices, " Liu said while presiding over an emergency meeting at the
A/H1N1 Flu Central Command Center.</P>
      <P>The command center was set up by the Cabinet-level Department of Health (DOH)
Tuesday in a bid to prevent a possible swine flu outbreak in Taiwan, as the
virus continues to spread around the world.</P>
      <P>Liu stressed that the country has enough reserves of medical supplies to fight a
potential swine flu pandemic, but he warned individuals against attempting to
hoard supplies.</P>
      <P>"The administration will not be lenient toward those who hoard or seize the
opportunity to make a fortune," he noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Department of Health Minister Yeh Ching-chuan said that one-eighth of
the swine flu is not detectable.</P>
      <P>He said that during the eight-day period of contagion of swine flu, the virus is
not detectable in one of the eight days, meaning that one-eighth of the virus
cannot be monitored.</P>
      <P>Since only seven-eighths of the virus can be detected, Yeh called for full
cooperation from the public to ensure adequate monitoring of any possible swine
flu epidemic in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yeh, convened the emergency meeting of the A/H1N1 Flu Central Command Center
after the World Health Organization (WHO) raised its influenza pandemic alert
for swine flu to phase 5, from phase 4, earlier in the day, indicating that
there is sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus.</P>
      <P>As of Thursday, 148 cases of swine flu infection have been reported in nine
countries in the world, according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>Nine suspected cases were reported in Taiwan over the past two days, with five
of them having been ruled out as swine flu and four others still being checked.</P>
      <P>The virus so far is known to only spread from human to human, not animal to
human. Victims suffer flu-like symptoms, including fever and coughing.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-grown butterfly and Oncidium orchids presented by the Taipei City
government took first place in the Judges' Prize at an international flower
exhibition being held in South Korea, a city government said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taipei City is one of 121 exhibitors from 21 countries in Asia, Europe and the
Americas, which competed for the prize in the Korea Floritopia 2009, according
to Chen Hsiung-wen, head of the city government's Department of Economic
Development.</P>
      <P>The city saw the exhibition, which opened on April 23 in South Chungcheong
Province, as a warm-up to its 2010 Taipei International Gardening and
Horticulture Exposition, which will be held in Taipei next year, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In the Korea fair, the 36-square-meter Taipei booth, which focuses on promoting
Taipei's upcoming horticulture  expo,  is displaying a wide array of unique
flower species from Taiwan, including the butterfly orchid, Oncidium orchid,
flamingo flower, peace lily, and Pleomele.</P>
      <P>These are all high-priced species in South Korea and have been under the media
spotlight since they made their presence at the fair, Chen added.</P>
      <P>The 2010 Taipei exhibition and the ongoing Korean fair are two of the biggest
flower shows in the world. Both are International Association of Horticultural
Producers (AIPH) -certified expositions, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Taipei will also participate in the 10th Floralies Flower Show slated to take
place in Nantes, France from May 8-19, and the Hamamatsu International

      <P>As soft and warm breezes herald the approach of summer, the first geographic
park in Taiwan's northeast coast and Yilan area will be officially opened
Saturday to public tours, a tourism official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Mei-kang, head of the Northeast and Yilan Coast National Scenic Area
Administration under the Tourism Bureau, said the opening of the "Bitou-Longdong
Geopark" on May 2 is aimed at bolstering local development and promoting eco-
friendly tourism to inject new life into local communities.</P>
      <P>Chen said the geology of Taiwan's northeast region, particularly the curious and
intriguing rock formations created by sea erosion over thousands of years, is
amazing and impressive not only to tourists but also to international
researchers.</P>
      <P>Nanya is the northern gateway to the Northeast Coast National Scenic Area. The
views from there encompass rising mountain peaks, large expanses of ocean,
unique land and rock formations, serene fishing villages and quiet towns.</P>
      <P>From Nanya, tourists can travel to Bitou and Longdong where the Bitou-Longdong
Geopark, with its unique ecology and geology, will be opened to the public.</P>
      <P>Scores of geologists from Taiwan and 11 East Asian countries will jointly
preside over Saturday's opening of a "Geography Pavilion" within the park in
Taipei County. The more than 40 foreign experts are in Taiwan to attend the 2009
East Asia Geopark Conference being held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Bitou-Longdong Geopark, Chen said, a second geopark between
Longdong and San Diego Cape and a third between Dali and the Turtle Island off
Taiwan's northeastern coast, are also under protection by the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>A new tour route featuring nearby coastal and mountain areas will be unveiled
May 2 on the same occasion to attract more tourists to the region, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Tourism Bureau said it is planning to apply by 2010 to list the
Yehliu Geopark, in northern Taipei County's Wanli Village, as part of UNESCO's
Global Geoparks Network, and thus step up Taiwan's exchanges with the
international community.</P>
      <P>Yehliu is a 1.7-kilometer-long cape that juts into the sea, and where wave
erosion, weathering, and the action of the earth's crust have combined to create
sea-eroded trenches, candlestick rocks, mushroom rocks, bean curd rocks, beehive
rocks, potholes, dissolved basins, and all sorts of other unusual rock
formations.</P>
      <P>Queen's Head Rock, Fairy Shoe, and Candlestick Rock are among those most
spectacular and famous formations in Yehliu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Britains private English-learning school Center of English Studies (CES) on
Thursday opened its first branch outside England and Ireland in Taipei, aiming
to help Taiwanese students improve their English skills so they can get into
schools abroad.</P>
      <P>The branch was opened in collaboration with the local education consultant
United Kingdom Education Advisory Service (UKEAS) , which has been working with
the CES in sending Taiwanese students to study at CES schools in England and
Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Taipei CES School will offer specialized training for students who plan to
take the U.K. English proficiency tests for foreign students - IELTS. Scoring
high on the test is necessary if students want to study in the U.K. The School
will also provide learning and consultancy services on British education to
Taiwanese students.</P>
      <P>Justin Quinn, managing director of CES, said at an opening ceremony that he
believed the Taipei CES School will provide the same high level of standards and
commitment to quality in English language learning, as it has done in England
and Ireland over the past 30 years.</P>
      <P>The new school has been fitted out with highest quality facilities to provide an
excellent learning environment. We employ excellent and well qualified teachers
with many years experience of teaching IELTS, " Quinn said. "We are sure the new
Taipei school will uphold these standards and set a new level for quality
IELTS."</P>
      <P>David Campbell, director of the Taipei-based British Trade &amp; Cultural
Office, said at the same occasion that the opening of the first private British-
Irish based language school in Taiwan showed the confidence that CES and UKEAS
have in Taiwan's market potential.</P>
      <P>"We believe that the longstanding cooperation between CES and UKEAS and this new
joint venture specialist school will enjoy great success here and be of huge
benefits to English language learners in Taiwan,Campbell said.</P>
      <P>The joint venture of CES and UKEAS also serves as a good example for great
partnership between Taiwan and the U.K., Campbell added.</P>
      <P>There are currently 15,000 Taiwanese students studying in the U.K., Campbell
said.</P>
      <P>The School will help more and more Taiwanese students fulfill their dreams of
studying abroad, Campbell said, adding that he hoped more students will go to
the U.K. for short courses, as starting March 3 Taiwanese citizens can enjoy
visa-free entry to the U.K. for maximum stays of up to six months.</P>
      <P>Established in 1976, CES is one of the leading English language schools in
Europe. It is accredited by the British Council in England.</P>
      <P>The UKEAS, established in 1993, offers free services to Taiwanese students on
studying in the U.K.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WHA participation will not harm Taiwan's sovereign status: president</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
04/30/09  18:14:35
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Thursday that Taiwan's success in obtaining the
right to attend this year's World Health Assembly (WHA) has not been achieved at
the expense of the country's sovereign status.</P>
      <P>Instead, the achievement has been the result of a pragmatic and flexible
approach adopted by his administration to promote Taiwan's international
presence, Ma stressed.</P>
      <P>As an observer at the annual meeting of the World Health Organization's (WHO)
decision-making body, Taiwan will enjoy the same rights and will have the same
obligations as other WHA observers, he said.</P>
      <P>WHA observers are different from full members only in that they do not have
voting rights.</P>
      <P>"We will be participating under these conditions, and the name used will be
'Chinese Taipei, ' which involves nothing that would downgrade our sovereign
status," Ma said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan is known simply as "Chinese Taipei" in the World
Trade Organization, although the country's membership name is "the Separate
Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu."</P>
      <P>Taiwan also used the name "Chinese Taipei" to join the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum (APEC) in 1991, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>After 12 failed attempts since 1997 to participate in the WHA, Taiwan received a
letter from the WHO Tuesday inviting it to take part as an observer in the next
WHA that is scheduled to open May 18 in Geneva.</P>
      <P>The invitation opens the way for Taiwan to participate for the first time in any
meeting or activity of the United Nations specialized agencies since the country
lost its U.N. membership to China in 1971.</P>
      <P>The former ruling pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), however,
has expressed fears Taiwan is being invited to attend the WHA as an non-
governmental organization or an associate of China, rather than a sovereign
state.</P>
      <P>Ma explained that over the past year since his inauguration, his administration
has been promoting a "modus vivendi" diplomatic strategy that favors a moderate
and pragmatic approach, with the goal of ending the cutthroat struggle between
Taiwan and China in the international arena.</P>
      <P>Such a strategy has resulted in improved cross-Taiwan Strait relations and
enhanced mutual trust and understanding, which in turn has prompted Beijing to
take a pragmatic and amicable view of Taiwan's bid to participate in the WHA, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>"This shows that harmonious and amiable cross-strait relations complement rather
than conflict with Taiwan's goal of international participation," he said.</P>
      <P>Expressing disapproval of the aggressive strategy adopted by the former DPP
administration to highlight the status of Taiwan as an independent country, the
president stressed that the purpose of Taiwan's participation in the WHA is to
better protect the health of the people in Taiwan, which "should not involve any
unnecessary confrontation to highlight some specific ideology."</P>
      <P>At a time when the world is facing a possible swine flu outbreak, Taiwan's WHA
participation will help the government establish closer contact with the WHO and
improve its preparations for emergencies, he said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the government's strategy to push for Taiwan's participation  in the
United Nations this year,  Ma said his administration will continue to follow a
pragmatic and flexible approach in promoting  Taiwan's participation  in
international organizations and will not set any "impractical objectives."</P>
      <P>Taiwan has not been represented in the United Nations since 1971, when the
Republic of China's seat was given to the People's Republic of China. Since
1993, Taiwan has been trying to have the United Nations consider the issue of
its representation, but these efforts have proved futile due largely to China's
objections.</P>
      <P>In a departure from the then DPP administration's high-profile push in 2007 for
U.N. membership under the name "Taiwan, " Ma's government adopted a "modus
vivendi" diplomatic strategy in 2008, which included seeking "meaningful
participation" in the activities of the U.N.'s specialized agencies.</P>

      <P>Two female Chinese tourists were injured by falling rocks Thursday while touring
the Taroko National Park in eastern Taiwan's Hualien County, according to
medical sources.</P>
      <P>The women, identified as Shih Jinhong, 56, and Shu Yuying, 57, were rushed to
the Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital in Hualien City for emergency treatment.</P>
      <P>According to a hospital spokesman, both women sustained serious injuries to
their heads and were undergoing surgery as of press time.</P>
      <P>Shih was in a coma when she arrived at the hospital, the spokesman said, adding
that she was struck on the head by falling rocks, which fractured her skull and
caused intracranial bleeding.</P>
      <P>Chu also sustained skull fractures and had a 20-cm laceration on the left side
of her face, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Travel sources said the women were members of a tour group from China's
southeastern coastal city of Fuzhou. The group arrived in Taiwan earlier this
week, traveling from Fuzhou to the Taiwan-held island of Kinmen via what is
commonly known as the "mini three links."</P>
      <P>Members of the group were walking along the Jiucyudong Trail, also known as the
Tunnel of Nine Turns, one of the most popular sightseeing spots in the Taroko
National Park, when they were struck by rocks that fell down the steep side of
the mountain.</P>
      <P>The injuries were the second travel accident involving Chinese tourists reported
in less than a week. Last Friday, a crane that fell from a construction site at
Taipei's upscale Xinyi shopping district left three Chinese tourists dead and

12 failed attempts since 1997 to be seated in the WHO's highest decision-making
body.</P>
      <P>It will also mark the first time that the country has been allowed to take part
in a meeting or activity of a United Nations specialized agency since 1971 when
the country lost its U.N. membership to the China.</P>
      <P>Singapore's foreign ministry issued a statement April 29, saying that the city
state welcomes the agreement for Taiwan to participate in this year's WHA
meeting as an observer under the name of Chinese Taipei.</P>
      <P>"This  is a positive  development  which demonstrates  the determination of both
sides (of the Taiwan Strait) to set aside differences in order to cooperate in
mutually beneficial areas. This is in the interest of the global community," it
said.</P>
      <P>British Foreign Office Minister Bill Rammell also expressed similar views on his
ministry's Web site April 29, saying that the U.K. welcomes the news and hopes
that both sides of the Taiwan Strait will continue to engage in direct dialogue
to resolve differences and strengthen cross-strait stability.</P>
      <P>"It is important that Taiwan can meaningfully participate in the global health
safety net. The fact that the rapid spread of diseases is again high in the news
emphasizes the importance of this decision," Rammell said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Job seekers favor Taiwan's telecoms firm in wake of economic crunch</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's partially state-owned Chunghwa Telecom company has emerged as the
favorite place to find a job by the island's fresh job seekers, as the global
economic downturn is making job security their top demand.</P>
      <P>Cheers monthly magazine in its latest poll found that Chunghwa Telecom has for
the first time become the most coveted company by fresh graduates of university
or postgraduate schools in Taiwan among 100 top choices for employment.</P>
      <P>Under the impact of the global economic crisis, the rankings of high-tech and
financial services companies -- which used to be top choices -- have all slid in
the 100 most coveted enterprises rankings, according to Cheers.</P>
      <P>Chunghwa Telecom has edged out Taiwan's top electronics maker Hon Hai Precision
Instrument, which was Taiwan new job seekers' top choice in 2008.</P>
      <P>This year, their top five choices were Chunghwa Telecom, the food company Uni-
President Group, Eslite Bookstore, China Steel Corp., and Hon Hai, in that
order, according to Cheers.</P>
      <P>Of this year's top 20 choices,  only four were high-tech companies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) , once the most coveted
enterprise in Taiwan by young job seekers, fell in ranking beyond the top 10
this year, while AU Optronics, which used to rank high on the "top 100" list,
fell beyond 30.</P>
      <P>The Cheers poll found that over 40 percent of the fresh job seekers favor
seeking a career as a civil servant or at a state-run enterprise.</P>
      <P>Over half of these people said they want to work at a government agency or
state-run enterprise because wages and benefits there are seen as better and
more secure than at private companies, according to Cheers.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, graduates of National Taiwan University (NTU) were considered by
private enterprises as the best choice in terms of overall job performance,
according to a survey conducted jointly by 104 Job Bank, Taiwan's largest online
employment service provider, and the Global Views (GV) Survey Research Center.</P>
      <P>Graduates of National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) , meanwhile, were named as
top hiring choices for local businesses, in terms of performances  as new
workers,  professional quality and alumni influence, according to the 104-GV
poll.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 60.6 percent of the companies surveyed said they will
recruit fresh graduates as employees this year, but 51.7 percent of them said
their recruiting standards will be tougher.</P>
      <P>The candidates' ability to withstand stress is considered by the businesses as a
quality or criterion they value most in hiring fresh graduates, with 53.5
percent of the businesses identifying it as such.</P>
      <P>Some 47.5 percent of the businesses mentioned professional knowledge and skills
as a desired quality in job applicants, 46.3 percent mentioned self-motivation,
45.7 percent said a sense of responsibility, and 40.1 percent said flexible
learning ability.</P>
      <P>A total of 851 valid samples were collected in the 104-GV poll conducted from
March 23-31. The survey was given to the human resources personnel of Taiwan-
based companies which are 104 Job Bank's members. The poll has a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.36 percentage points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Kaohsiung MRT deficit expected to be reduced</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung, April 30 (CNA)
04/30/09  21:29:34
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit System is expected to cut its operating losses
this year by NT$900 million (US$27.08 million), a city official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chou Teh-li, acting director of the city's Kaohsiung City Rapid Transit
Department, forecast that the system is likely to slash spending in 2009 thanks
to a retrenchment plan that the Kaohsiung Rapid Transit Corp. (KRTC) implemented
in 2008 after the launch of its Red Line in March that same year.</P>
      <P>The MRT system consists of the Red Line, which is 28.3-km long, has 23 stations
and runs from Kaohsiung's Siaogang district to Chiaotou in neighboring Kaohsiung
County, and the Orange Line, which began running in August 2008 and is 14.4-km
long with 15 stations running from Sizihwan in western Kaohsiung to Daliao
township in Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>Chou expressed concern that the KRTC might encounter difficulties if operational
losses continue to expand.</P>
      <P>The Kaohsiung city government, meanwhile, has been mulling the possibility of
adopting possible countermeasures in the hope of tackling  the looming crisis to
secure the system's continued operations in the largest city in southern Taiwan,
he added.</P>
      <P>KRTC General Manager Yen Pang-chieh said the company needs some NT$4.5 billion
to maintain its operations each year and is trying hard to run peripheral
businesses to help offset the system's losses.</P>
      <P>According to the KRTC, the MRT registered a loss of NT$2.2 billion for 2008.</P>
      <P>Experts have estimated that the MRT needs to attract at least 400,000 passengers
per day to break even and contended that it might take six to eight years for
that to happen.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the issue sponsored by a Kaohsiung city councilor later
that same day, Lee Liang-chien, secretary-general of I-Shou University in
Kaohsiung County, ascribed the system's red ink to its low passenger load --
averaging just 110,000 passengers per day over the past year, well short of the
original daily target of 200,000 passengers.</P>
      <P>Lee called for stimulus measures from the city government to increase the
passenger load.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lee continued, mounting expenditure in interest on loans and high
spending for phasing out equipment also put dents into the system's operations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Three nabbed for producing semi-finished amphetamine</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
04/30/09  21:55:52

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three people were nabbed in two separate police actions reported Thursday for
producing semi-finished material that would have been processed into illegal
amphetamine,  law enforcement sources said that day.</P>
      <P>Agents with the Bureau of Investigation's  Central  Taiwan operations raided a
house in Taichung County's Taiping City, catching two men red-handed and seizing
7.8 kg of ephedrine -- a precursor chemical used in the production of
amphetamine.</P>
      <P>According to an initial investigation, the men had bought some 500,000 flu pills
that they refined to obtain the ephedrine.</P>
      <P>If the ephedrine had been sold to downstream underground drug makers, it would
have fetched some NT$2 million (US$60,000), said Lee Hua-chun, a secretary at
the Bureau of Investigation's Central Taiwan office.</P>
      <P>Lee said that because the acquisition of raw materials for the production of
amphetamine -- mostly from China -- has become increasingly difficult, Taiwanese
drug rings have begun to use flu medicine to process into ephedrine as a
substitute.</P>
      <P>Also that day, police in the northern city of Keelung announced that they had
nabbed a man surnamed Chin in Taipei City for ephedrine processing the previous
day.</P>
      <P>The Keelung police said they busted an amphetamine processing plant in Keelung
operated by a woman surnamed Huang in March and from that case, discovered that
Chin had been Huang's supplier. They raided Chin's Taipei home Wednesday, where
they seized 2.1 kg of ephedrine and equipment for producing the chemical.</P>

    <HEADLINE>190 Taiwanese citizens still serving prison terms in Korea: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There are still 190 Taiwanese citizens serving prison terms in South Korea after
participating in fraud rings in that country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MOFA officials said that since September 2006, a total of 321 people from Taiwan
have been arrested by South Korean police for allegedly opening dummy bank
accounts, receiving suspicious funds from banks or using fake credit cards for
purchases made in that country.</P>
      <P>To date, 190 of them are still doing time in Korean jails, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Last month, a Korean university student killed herself after she was conned out
of her tuition by a fraud ring -- a case that aroused international attention
and prompted the Korean police to crack down on cross-border fraud ring
operations, as well as seeking tougher penalties for people convicted of such
crimes, the officials went on.</P>
      <P>The MOFA has issued a series of press releases since the beginning of 2007
urging the Taiwanese public to remain alert and guard against the possibility of
being "unwittingly" set up as the front for an illegal company, group or
individual based in South Korea, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They reminded the public once again Thursday  not to seek employment with fly-
by-night  companies or individuals  seeking frontmen for unlawful activities in
South Korea.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the perpetrators' greed has not only caused big trouble
for themselves and their families, but has also left Taiwan's international
image severely tarnished.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taroko Gorge falling rock reporting mechanism in pipeline</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau plans to collaborate with the Taroko National Park
Administration in setting up a mechanism to report rockfalls in Taroko Gorge to
better protect the safety of tourists, a bureau official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The official issued the statement after two Chinese tourists were injured by
falling rocks earlier in the day while touring the Taroko National Park in
eastern Taiwan's Hualien County.</P>
      <P>The women, identified as Shih Jinhong, 56, and Chu Yuying, 57, were rushed to
the Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital in Hualien City for  emergency  treatment
and surgery  for fractured  skulls, intracranial bleeding and lacerations.</P>
      <P>A later report from the Tourism Bureau, however, said that one of the two had
sustained less serious injuries than had been previously reported.</P>
      <P>According to the Tourism Bureau official, both were members of a tour group from
Putien in China's southeastern coastal province of Fujian. The 12-member group,
led by a tour guide, arrived in Taiwan April 25 and was originally scheduled to
leave Taiwan this weekend.</P>
      <P>Travel sources said members of the group were walking along the Jiucyudong
Trail, also known as the Tunnel of Nine Turns, one of the most popular
sightseeing spots in the park, when they were struck by falling rocks from the
mountain above.</P>
      <P>The injuries were the second accidents involving Chinese tourists reported in
less than a week. On April 24, a crane fell onto a moving tour bus from a
construction site in Taipei's upscale Xinyi shopping district, killing three
Chinese tourists and injuring three others.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Huge funds to be invested in health care industry upgrading</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 30 (CNA)
04/30/09  23:31:33
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will invest NT$86.4 billion (US$2.59 billion) over the next four
years to upgrade the health care industry, Department of Health (DOH) Minister
Yeh Ching-chuan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Yeh made the announcement at a news conference held after a weekly Executive
Yuan meeting in which the four-year investment project was approved.</P>
      <P>According to Yeh, the investment project is aimed at raising the the health care
industry's production value by an estimated NT$346.4 billion by 2012 and
creating an additional 310,000 jobs during the four-year period.</P>
      <P>Noting that health care services are one of six emerging industries that the
government is promoting, Yeh said the government move is not aimed at boosting
the gross domestic product but rather at enhancing the people's well-being and
benefiting society.</P>
      <P>The new investment project will cover three categories -- medical care and long-
term care in the service category; health care, intelligent medicine, medical
service globalization and public health and safety  in the category  of value-
added  industries;  and biotechnology  development in the manufacturing
category,  Yeh explained.</P>
      <P>The most noteworthy  feature of the package  lies in the development of
intelligent medicine, Yeh said, adding that Taiwan, given its competitive edge
in the information technology industry, stands a good chance of success in this
field.</P>
      <P>Under the new investment project, the government plans to spend NT$1.4 billion
on digitizing medical examination reports, anamnesis and medical imaging within
five years, establishing an image exchange and sharing center in two years and
issuing second-generation smart health insurance cards.</P>
      <P>Relevant databanks from those system can also be further used in remote medical
monitoring and wireless medical telemetry services, Yeh went on, adding that the
project is also expected to boost the annual production value of the RFID
technology-related industry from NT$20.73 billion in 2009 to NT$129.3 billion in
2012.</P>
      <P>On the long-term care system, Yeh continued, the launch of such a system will
account for nearly half of the new investment budget. He added that Premier Liu
Chao-shiuan has also instructed that the originally scheduled 10-year
development period be shortened.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Council for Economic Planning and Development will work out a
comprehensive plan for the gradual launch of a long-term care insurance system,
beginning probably in specified regions or for specific age groups.</P>
      <P>On the globalization of medical services, Yeh said his department will pool its
resources with other relevant government agencies in promoting medical tourism
to attract foreign patients seeking bone marrow transplants, joint replacements,
health checkups, tooth implants and other medical treatment.</P>
      <P>"The government is planning to invest NT$1.7 billion in this regard, with the
goal of seeing medical tourists accounting for 10 percent of the total tourist
arrivals," he added.</P>
      <P>On health care, Yeh said, the government will inspire market demand by
subsidizing preventive health care services and encouraging private investment
in the field, with the goal of seeing the market value of health care services
and health food industry reaching NT$189.5 billion by 2012 and revenues of
health checkups amounting to NT$11.4 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yeh said, the government will also induce the private sector to join
investment in development and production of flu vaccines, serum-vaccines and
selected pharmaceuticals.</P>
