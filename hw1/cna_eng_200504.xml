serve, but difficult to please. If you go beyond your duty to please
him, he will not be pleased. But in his employment of men, he always
takes into consideration their capacity. A fool, on the other hand,
is easy to please, but difficult to serve. If you go beyond your duty
to please him, he will be pleased. But in his employment of men, he
expects them to be able to do everything."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>INTER-PARTY RACE FOR RECONCILIATION WITH BEIJING 'UNHELPFUL': PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that it is
"unhelpful" that political parties in Taiwan scramble to try to sign
accords with Beijing.</P>
      <P>It does not benefit Taiwan to have political parties competing
among themselves to demonstrate their "openness" in cross-strait
relations by seeking to forge agreements with Beijing, Hsieh said. He
did not elaborate on why he considers it "unhelpful."</P>
      <P>Commenting on opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman P.K.
Chiang's visit to China and the 10-point consensus Chiang reached
with Chinese authorities on a number of cross-strait issues, Hsieh
said that any talks between KMT representatives and those of the
Chinese Communist Party on their past conflict or on reconciliation
are strictly a "party-to-party" matter. He stressed that they do not
represent "public affairs, " which he said is solely the
responsibility of the government.</P>
      <P>As to reports that the Chinese authorities might be willing to
help Taiwan obtain World Health Assembly observer status, Hsieh said
that joining the WHA, the decision-making body of the World Health
Organization (WHO), is a basic right of Taiwan and that the WHA needs
Taiwan in order to close the loopholes in its global
disease-prevention network.</P>
      <P>Seeking to join the WHO is an established policy of the country,
and the administration will continue in this effort relentlessly,
Hsieh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MATERIALIZING 10-POINT CONSENSUS UP TO ADMINISTRATION: SPEAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is up to the administration whether to
materialize the 10-point consensus for the well-being of the people
of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reached between the Kuomintang
(KMT) delegation visiting Beijing and Chinese authorities,
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng said Friday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang's 10-point consensus
reached with officials of China's Taiwan Affairs Office in Beijing on
a number of cross-strait issues, Wang, who also serves as a KMT vice
chairman, said that it is something the Democratic Progressive Party
administration could not achieve.</P>
      <P>That 10-point consensus on a wide range of issues, including
cross-strait charter flights, agricultural cooperation, protection
for China-based Taiwanese business people, tourism, journalistic
exchanges and the opening of the Chinese financial market, is also
crucially important for the government as well as the people in
Taiwan, Wang added.</P>
      <P>Any consensus, however, is futile if the administration
disregards it, Wang stressed.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks in response to Premier Frank Hsieh's
comments earlier the same day that any talks between KMT
representatives and those of the Chinese Communist Party on their
past conflict or on reconciliation are strictly a "party-to-party"
matter. "They do not represent 'public affairs, ' which is solely the
responsibility of the government," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The 27-member KMT delegation, led by Chiang, embarked on its
five-day visit Monday, making it the party's first official
delegation to visit China.</P>
      <P>Members of the delegation first paid tribute at the cemetery of
72 martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the KMT-led Huanghuagang
Uprising against China's last empire, the Ching Dynasty, in
Guangzhou, southern Guangdong Province, Tuesday. The death of the 72
martyrs March 29, 1911, is designated as the Republic of China's
National Youth Day.</P>
      <P>The group then paid tribute at the mausoleum of ROC founding
father Sun Yat-sen in Nanjing Wednesday before heading north to
Beijing later in the day.</P>
      <P>It is has been widely speculated that the visit by Chiang's
delegation could mark a stepping stone to a landmark visit by KMT
Chairman Lien Chan in the near future.</P>
      <P>Chiang and his delegation are scheduled to return home Friday
after wrapping up their visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN PEOPLE URGED TO REMAIN ALERT WHILE TRAVELING IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The people of Taiwan were urged again
Friday to remain vigilant at all times when traveling in mainland
China on business or for pleasure.</P>
      <P>Hosting a press conference for a Taiwanese businessman who was
robbed in his hotel room in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen
recently, two legislators from the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) called for Taiwan tourists and businesspeople traveling
to the mainland to remain alert at all times for their personal
safety.</P>
      <P>According to the businessman, identified as Chi Chien-chuan, he
checked into a hotel in Shenzhen March 23 during a business trip. At
around midnight of the same day, someone knocked on his hotel room
door claiming that it was a routine inspection by public security
officers. When Chi opened his door, three men attacked him, tying him
up with rope and robbing him of his cash and valuables.</P>
      <P>Chi claimed that after he reported the crime to a local police
station, the public security officers dealt with the case in a
perfunctory manner.</P>
      <P>The businessman said he will not go to the mainland again if his
case remains unsolved.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tsai Chi-chang said that Taiwan people make more
than a million trips to the mainland every year. He urged all Taiwan
people heading to China to bear in mind the hidden risks of visiting
the country.</P>
      <P>Shen Fa-hui, another DPP legislator, said that if a crime similar
to the one that Chi was a victim of occurred in Taiwan, it would be
considered a prominent case and dealt with seriously by law
enforcement authorities here. Pointing to the mainland authorities'
alleged ignoring of Chi's case, Shen urged all Taiwan travelers to
China to remain vigilant concerning their personal safety.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHINA TRIP DISGRACES ROC DIGNITY: MAC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent trip made by an opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) delegation to mainland China has disgraced the
dignity of the Republic of China at a time when the nation has come
under increased threats from Beijing, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Vice Chairman Chiu Tai-san said Friday.</P>
      <P>It is "quite clear" that the politically sensitive activities in
which the mission engaged in China have already tainted the ROC's
national dignity and appear to show the delegation siding with the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP) , as the KMT did not clarify a report
by China's Xinhua News Agency that claimed the KMT mission visited
the "mother homeland" to gain an understanding of its reform-oriented
establishments.</P>
      <P>At a time when the international community is increasingly wary
of Beijing's enactment of its anti-secession law aimed at Taiwan, it
is highly inappropriate for any group from Taiwan to indulge in
politically charged activities in China, he said, pointing out that
there is concern that such behavior might violate relevant government
rules, namely the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People
of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman made the remarks in reference to the KMT
delegation led by Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang that returned to Taiwan
that same day after wrapping up a five-day visit to China.</P>
      <P>The KMT delegation -- the first of its kind in 56 years since the
party retreated to Taiwan in the wake of losing a civil war to the
Chinese communists -- visited Guangzhou, Nanjing and Beijing. It also
clinched a 10-point consensus with CCP officials late Wednesday to
step up civil exchanges, ranging from cross-Taiwan Strait air links
and agricultural issues to labor and academic affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT'S VISIT DIMINISHES OPPOSITION TO ANTI-SECESSION LAW: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that
opposition Kuomintang Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang's recent visit to
China is problematic and claimed that its timing diminishes the
strength of Taiwan's opposition to Beijing's enactment of its
anti-secession law.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions at the Legislative Yuan, Hsieh said that
Chiang's 10-point consensus reached with officials of China's Taiwan
Affairs Office in Beijing is also controversial from a legal point
of view.</P>
      <P>Citing the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of
the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, Hsieh said that visits to
China by Taiwan public functionaries and legislators are strictly
regulated by the statute and they are forbidden to sign any form of
accord with official Chinese institutions or organizations without
authority from the government.</P>
      <P>It would be illegal if Chiang's 10-point consensus reached with
the Beijing officials were put into black and white, Hsieh said,
adding that even if it was not, it is still a debatable case. Chiang
is also a KMT legislator-at-large.</P>
      <P>According to KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung, who was among
Chiang's 27-member entourage that visited Beijing, the consensus is
on a wide range of issues, including cross-strait charter flights,
agricultural cooperation, protection for China-based Taiwanese
businessmen, tourism, journalistic exchanges and the opening of the
Chinese financial market.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that any talks between KMT representatives and those
of the Chinese Communist Party on their past conflict or on
reconciliation are strictly a "party-to-party" matter. "They do not
represent 'public affairs,' which is solely the responsibility of the
government," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Joseph Wu, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, noted that Chiang, as a legislator, might have
violated the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of
the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, in which it is stipulated that
no Taiwan citizen is allowed to forge any kind of cooperation with
China's political and military organizations without prior authority
from the government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan High Speed Rail Corp (THSRC)
officials promised Friday that the company will complete this month
its delayed plan to increase NT$6 billion (US$190.47 million) in
capital.</P>
      <P>The plan was originally scheduled to be completed by March 31.</P>
      <P>THSRC Vice President of Public Affairs Arthur Chiang explained
that the plan was deferred because of a processing delay with some
investors.</P>
      <P>As a result of the delay, the THSRC is due to pay interest to the
bank, consortium with which the company has a contract for a NT$323.3
billion loan, at an annual rate of 0.1 percent payable according to
the number of days delayed, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang also said the company is keeping to its schedule to have

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN'S PLANNED CHINA VISIT HARSHLY CRITICIZED BY WUFI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A staunch Taiwan independence heavyweight
lashed out Friday at the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , arguing
that a visit to mainland China planned by its chairman and a 10-point
consensus inked between the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
will downgrade the status of Taiwan in dealings with China.</P>
      <P>Ng Chiau-tong, chairman of the World United Formosans for
Independence (WUFI), harshly criticized the KMT, saying that what the
party is doing now at a time when Beijing has stepped up its threats
against Taiwan with its Anti-Secession Law will only make
Taiwan-China disputes a problem of China's internal affairs.</P>
      <P>Ng was referring to a just-concluded five-day visit to China by a
KMT delegation led by Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang. Chiang's visit is
widely seen as a prelude to a planned visit by KMT Chairman Lien Chan
in June before he steps down from the party's top post in August.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the 10-point consensus reached between the KMT
delegation and CCP officials last Wednesday in Beijing, Ng claimed
that the pact has seriously infringed upon Taiwan's sovereignty and
has damaged Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>It is useless and meaningless to extend more olive branches to
China, an enemy of Taiwan, at a time when Beijing has readied itself
with the Anti-Secession Law to curb Taiwan through "non-peaceful
means," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Politicians should have wisdom to deal with politics and must not
do things that are harmful to the country's interests, he said.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the government toughen its stance toward
China to protect Taiwan business interests there.</P>
      <P>The 10-point consensus clinched by the KMT and CCP focuses on
private sector exchanges between Taiwan and China, ranging from
cross-Taiwan Strait agricultural and financial cooperation to the
opening of air links and academic exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP, KMT TRADE BICKERING OVER 2008 TAIWAN EXPO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) lambasted the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Friday over legislation of a statute governing the 2008 Taiwan Expo,
saying that a legislative consensus on such an enactment could be
reached if the KMT was more cooperative.</P>
      <P>Four DPP lawmakers, including Tsai Chi-fang, said that
legislative consensus on the enactment of a 2008 Taiwan Expo statute
was about to be reached but the absence of the KMT Caucus endorsement
prevented it.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the DPP legislators will instigate a protest at
the KMT headquarters if the KMT Caucus fails to sign up to the
consensus before the end of next week.</P>
      <P>Discounting the DPP's challenge, Chen Chieh, a KMT legislative
whip, said that the KMT basically supports the notion of Taiwan
hosting a world expo in 2008 that the DPP has claimed will create
some 60,000 job opportunities. However, Chen said it must be a
program that will benefit the development of Taiwan's tourism as well
as the economy.</P>
      <P>A world exposition like the 2008 Taiwan Expo should serve to
raise Taiwan's visibility in the international community and help
prop up the country's domestic economy, Chen said, adding that the
KMT will remain reserved toward it if the party believes the expo is
being used merely as a political tool of the ruling DPP aimed at
broadening the DPP's support base for the 2008 presidential election.</P>
      <P>Chen described the rationale behind the initial plan of the expo
as "fishy, " as the main sponsor of the expo is registered as a
non-profit organization, a move he claimed is apparently aimed at
evading the regulations of the procurement and budget law.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the
2008 Taiwan Expo slated to be held in Taoyuan, Tainan and Chiayi from
May to September 2008 is expected to attract 5.5 million visitors.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the national exposition, to be organized by the
ministry, is to make the country a world-class technology hub by
attracting visitors from home and abroad and to secure the country's
international status as a base for supplying technological products
worldwide so that the country can attract foreign investment that
will allow the nation's economy to develop, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The exposition venue in Taoyuan will be dedicated to high
technology, with topics including digitized operations in the home,
mobile life, biotechnology and nanotechnology. In Tainan, the event
will center around sustainable ecology and environmental protection,
while in Chiayi, it will revolve around history and culture, with
subjects including the visual arts, performance art and animated film
art, they said.</P>
      <P>Thus far, the ministry has cultivated a total of 5,500
professionals that will take part in the exposition, they said,
adding that it is expected to create 41,000 jobs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA TALKS MEANINGLESS WITHOUT PRIOR DOMESTIC CONSENSUS: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian questioned the
significance Friday of the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT's) talks with
China given the lack of domestic consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>Chen was commenting on a 10-point consensus reached during a
Wednesday meeting between KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang, who wrapped
up a five-day visit to China and returned to Taipei Friday, and Chen
Yunlin, director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while receiving a delegation from the
overseas Chinese community in Osaka, Japan.</P>
      <P>The consensus covers a wide range of issues, including
cross-strait transportation, agriculture, protection of Taiwan
businessmen in China, Chinese fishermen, and an easing of China's
financial market.</P>
      <P>"We have our own country and our own government, " the president
said, adding that "anyone engaging in consultation and negotiations
with others on issues that are sensitive, serious and important has
to get permission or authorization from the government."</P>
      <P>"If (the KMT) has reached no consensus with the government, and
if there is no consensus sought first within Taiwan's ruling and
opposition parties, then what is the significance of wishfully
promoting a consensus between the KMT and the Communist Party of
China?" Chen asked.</P>
      <P>He said that cross-strait relation is a fundamental issue on
which Taiwan's existence hinges, which he said will not only affect
national security, but will also be crucial to the fundamental rights
and wellbeing of the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that different political parties can have
different views and advocacy, but "Taiwan's national interests should
have one voice and one voice only -- and that voice should represent
the will of the people and should be a common language and common
voice in defending the overall interests of Taiwan -- when facing the
outside world."</P>
      <P>He said that a divided house will not stand and that a
cross-strait policy that is in disarray will not endure.</P>
      <P>Faced with ever daunting tests and challenges, Taiwan must be
even more unified, the president said, adding that only with a
unified Taiwan will the country prosper.</P>
      <P>The president also said that lowering cross-strait tension,
creating reconciliation and fostering an atmosphere of cooperation
between the two sides to break the cross-strait stalemate will be a
test of the wisdom of the leaders on each side of the strait, as well
as of the leaders of the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the ruling and opposition parties will
stick to the stance of "Taiwan first, and Taiwan's separate identity"
and that they will put aside their differences in an orderly manner
to work toward pursuing lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed gratitude for a series of recent friendly
gestures by Japan, including the granting of visa to former President
Lee Teng-hui, listing peaceful dialogue to settle cross-strait
disputes as the common goal of the United States and Japan, visa-free
privileges for Taiwan people during this year's Aichi Expo, Japanese
government support for Taiwan into the World Health Organization, and
Japan's urging of peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue in the wake
of the recent passage of China's Anti-Secession Law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PARTY AFFILIATION NOT AN ISSUE WITH PRESIDENTIAL ADVISERS: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential advisers are not chosen
because of their party affiliation and "non-green personnel" have
never been excluded, a spokesman for the Presidential Office said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tzong, director of the Department of Public Affairs of
the Presidential Office, was responding to comments made the previous
day by Stan Shih, former chairman of the Acer Group.</P>
      <P>Shih, who has been acting as a national policy advisor to the
president, said he has always maintained a neutral political stance,
but as current presidential advisers exclude "non-green personnel,"
referring to the "green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) and its ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, if he were to
continue to advise the president, people might get the wrong
impression. Therefore, Shih said, he hopes President Chen Shui-bian
will no longer ask him to serve that post; and if he does, he will
have to decline.</P>
      <P>Shih currently heads another investment institution.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the posts of senior presidential adviser
and national policy adviser have terms of one year, and that the
president reviews and selects new advisors, if necessary, every May
20.</P>
      <P>When making these selections, the spokesman said, the president
takes a number of factors into consideration, including where a
person is from, their ethnicity and their affiliation with civic
groups or trade organizations so that the advisor can be as
"multifaceted, professional and useful" as possible, the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>Judging from the current list of presidential advisers, the
president has never excluded "non-green personnel, " adding that the
president has "always respected their views," he added.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-chun, a DPP whip in the legislature, said that the
Presidential Office cares most about whether advisers have expertise
in their own fields, whether they are contributing to Taiwan and is
unconcerned about which political party a person favors.</P>
      <P>William C. D. Lai, another DPP caucus whip in the Legislative
Yuan, said that Shih is the second victim of Beijing's newly passed
Anti-Secession Law, following Hsu Wen-lung, founder of the Chimei
Group.</P>
      <P>Hsu, a supporter of President Chen in his first presidential bid
in 2000, said on the eve of the 326 March for Democracy and Peace, in
which hundreds of thousands of Taiwan people took to the streets to
show their displeasure over the Anti-Secession Law, said "Taiwan and
the mainland are part of one China," and that he felt more at ease
after the law was passed.</P>
      <P>Lai said that Shih is an admirable entrepreneur who has
contributed a great deal to Taiwan's economic development, but he
said that the legislative caucus is concerned about the knock-on
effect Beijing's law is having on business people.</P>
      <P>He said he was worried that corrupt Chinese officials could use
the law as a tool to blackmail or persecute Taiwan business people.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsan, director of the DPP's Department of Culture and
Information, said that entrepreneurs have a social responsibility,
and they should contribute to the country.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng said, the DPP will respect Shih's freedom of
choice and will not give the incident a political spin.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must not take part in World Health
Assembly (WHA) activities under any name associated with China, even
though China has publicly shown willingness to help Taiwan medical
experts to play a role in the organization, the leader of the
Foundation of Medical Professionals Alliance (FMPA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Alliance president Wu Shu-min was commenting on a goodwill
overture from Tang Jiaxuan, a People's Republic of China official,
that Beijing is willing to help Taiwanese medical experts have a WHA
role.</P>
      <P>Wu said he had not yet fully grasped the full meaning of the
overture, but as the leader of the FMPA, he would like the World
Health Organization (WHO) to formally invite Taiwan to participate as
a full member instead of as an observer, as offering observer status
would be "too condescending" on the part of the WHO.</P>
      <P>He said he would also not accept the name Chinese Taipei -- the
name Taiwan uses in order to participate in most international
events. Only the name of the Republic of China or Taiwan is
acceptable, he said, adding that any other name would be "dwarfing"
the country.</P>
      <P>What is needed is an official invitation from the WHO extended to
Taiwan, said Kao Ming-chien, a National Taiwan University Hospital
doctor who is also a former board chairman of the Taiwan Neurological
Surgery Association.</P>
      <P>Kao said the best scenario is for Taiwan to join the WHO as a
"health entity." As the government has spent huge sums of money
lobbying Third World countries without achieving much, he suggested
that Taipei seize this opportunity to directly negotiate with Beijing
over the island's role in the world health community.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT TOOL OF CHINESE COMMUNISTS' UNITED FRONT TACTICS: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
officials accused the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Friday of becoming
a tool of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to carry out its united
front tactics against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The officials were referring to the just-concluded visit to China
by a KMT delegation led by KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan claimed that the trip was plotted by
the Chinese communists as part of its united front scheme to divide
Taiwan and said the KMT has disgraced itself and Taiwan by dancing to
Beijing's tune.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the KMT opposed a party-to-party model for
cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations when it was in power and is now
making what he called "a preposterous twist" by supporting precisely
that form of talks.</P>
      <P>The KMT delegation held talks with officials of China's Taiwan
Affairs Office Wednesday and reached a 10-point consensus on a wide
range of issues including cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights,
agricultural cooperation, protection for China-based Taiwanese
businessmen, tourism, journalistic exchanges and the opening of the
Chinese financial market.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with the delegation Thursday, Jia Qinglin,
chairman of the People's Political Consultative Conference of China,
extended an invitation to KMT Chairman Lien Chan to visit China.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that despite the high-profile reception provided to
the KMT, China was styling itself as a sovereign that was "admitting
the KMT to an audience" in an attempt to reverse an international
climate that is extremely unfavorable to Beijing after the enactment
of its Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the KMT's move has done great harm to Taiwan because
it has fallen into a trap set by Beijing to make cross-strait
relations an internal affair of China.</P>
      <P>Lai Ching-teh, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, urged the
KMT to stop pushing for hasty unification between Taiwan and China
against the will of the majority people in the nation.</P>
      <P>Also, Lai said, the KMT should not have established any agreement
with Beijing.</P>
      <P>In response to the DPP's criticism, KMT legislative caucus whip
Chen Chieh claimed that the visit was aimed at "completing what the
government has failed to accomplish" and at "serving the people of
Taiwan, " and had nothing to do with the issues of unification and
independence.</P>
      <P>Chen said it is ridiculous for the DPP to start a smear campaign
to paint the KMT as a pro-China party.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 10-point consensus reached between the
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) is beneficial for Taiwan, and Taiwan and mainland China should
shelve their disputes to create a win-win atmosphere for both sides,
KMT spokeswoman Cheng Lee-wen said Friday.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the call after a ranking KMT delegation returned from
China to Taiwan earlier the same day after concluding a five-day
visit, which took it to Guangzhou, Nanjing and Beijing.</P>
      <P>The 34-member mission, led by KMT Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang,
forged a 10-point consensus late Wednesday in Beijing with CCP
officials to bolster civilian exchanges between Taiwan and China.
Chiang's visit was the first of its kind by a ranking KMT official in
56 years since the party retreated to Taiwan after losing a civil war
in 1949.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the trip was fruitful since the 10-point consensus
is beneficial to Taiwan and in the national interest, Cheng, however,
lamented that the government and the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) have smeared the trip, calling the response from both
"sad, biased and myopic."</P>
      <P>She said that the government should feel happy for the beneficial
results that the KMT mission obtained in China and she urged
President Chen Shui-bian to open his mind and build on this positive
development in cross- Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>President Chen's way of thinking can decide if Taiwan and China
can enjoy a mutually beneficial relationship, or if the two go to
war, she said.</P>
      <P>President Chen described the 10-point consensus as " wishful
thinking" on the part of the KMT, while the DPP's publicity
department director, Cheng Wen-tsan, said that the KMT has turned out
to be a tool in the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) propaganda
offensive.</P>
      <P>The 10-point consensus touches on a wide range of issues, with
agricultural exports to China and regular cross-strait charter
passenger flights the two most urgent issues for the people on
Taiwan, KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Despite harsh criticisms from the independence-leaning camp, two
more delegations of the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) will
head for China later this month for talks on agriculture and air
links.</P>
      <P>The KMT delegation will discuss Taiwan's farm exports and the
opening of regular charter passenger and cargo flights between the
two sides, all issues covered in the KMT-CCP 10-point consensus,
according to a party official.</P>
      <P>The PFP delegation, probably to be headed by Vice Chairman Chang
Chao-hsiung, is slated to hold talks with China on agricultural
issues.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu lambasted the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Friday for what she called the party's
"paradoxical values" in its approach to China.</P>
      <P>In a vocal criticism of a just-concluded visit to China by a KMT
delegation led by one of its vice chairman, P. K. Chiang, Lu said the
opposition party had been known for its firm stance against
communism, but its current leaders have baffled the world by sending
a delegation to visit China, ignoring the 700 Chinese missiles
targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The party's unexpected about-face from being anti-communist to
being pro-communist only underlined the fact that the party has
"paradoxical values," Lu said.</P>
      <P>In light of the contradictory approaches of the KMT, Lu said the
party owes the people an explanation of why it used so much money
over the nearly 55 years it was in power to brace for a war with
China when now it fawns over the Chinese Communists.</P>
      <P>During those years, Lu said, no one could associate with a
Chinese Communist without being thrown into prison. But why is it
that since the KMT lost power over the country, it has abandoned its
cause? Lu asked.</P>
      <P>Lu said the KMT should be thankful that it is because the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party embraces democracy, which gives the KMT
the right to toady up even to the Chinese Communists.</P>

      <P>Hsieh was referring to holding the elections for city mayors and
county magistrates, city and county councilmen, and village and
township heads at the same time.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's remarks came in the wake of a closed-door talk
Thursday with DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang. Su has warned that the move
is doomed to fail because it will open the door to massive
vote-buying in the absence of complementary measures.</P>
      <P>The premier also said that whether to hold the three local
elections simultaneously will be decided by the Central Election
Commission, and that the announcement of the Executive Yuan is "not a
final decision."</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Teh-fu of the opposition Kuomintang said that
the Taiwan provincial election committee is in charge of city and
county elections, while the village and township elections are
overseen by the city and county election committee, neither of
which are under the jurisdiction of the Central Election Commission,
and the Cabinet's announcement of "three-in-one" elections exceeds
its authority.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN ACCEPTS INVITATION TO VISIT CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan said
Friday during a trip to Japan that he will accept an invitation to
visit China made by a Chinese Communist Party official.</P>
      <P>However, Lien said when he would go would be figured out after he
returns to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien described the visit of a 34-member KMT delegation headed by
party vice chairman P. K. Chiang, which returned to Taiwan from its
five-day visit to China Friday, as a "journey of peace."</P>
      <P>Jia Qinglin, a member of the China's Central Standing Committee,
invited Lien to visit China during his meeting with Chiang in Beijing
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lien pointed out that cross-strait relations have been strained
for quite a long time, especially in the past five years since
President Chen Shui-bian took office in 2000.</P>
      <P>He said that he has said repeatedly that he wants to embark on a
"journey of peace" to the mainland for the sake of cross-strait peace
and stability.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chiang reached a 10-point consensus with Chen Yunlin,
director of the Taiwan Affairs Office Wednesday, which covers a wide
range of issues including cross-strait transportation, farm products,
protection of Taiwan businessmen on the mainland, mainland fishermen
and the easing of entry into China's financial market, Lien said that
there are many things across the Taiwan Strait that still need to be
worked out.</P>
      <P>Lien said that some of the things in the 10-point consensus can
be quickly carried out or promoted, others will need to be legislated
and the KMT intends to act on them duly.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that when he visits China there will be
some substantial progress on these matters.</P>
      <P>Regarding the election for the KMT chairmanship, due on July 16,
Lien said that the party lost the presidency five years ago because
of divisions within the party, and this is why it has to engage in
comprehensive reforms.</P>
      <P>The election of the chairman will held through a popular vote,
and he hopes the election can be held in an open and fair way to
boost the party's competitiveness and popularity, Lien said.</P>
      <P>He also said that he had exchanged views on matters of mutual
concern with several Japanese political figures, and also explained
to them the views of the KMT and the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT
and the People First Party (PFP) on ROC-Japan relations and
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that he has no plan to meet with Koh Se-kai, the
Republic of China's envoy to Japan on this visit, adding that he and
pro-independence Koh are far apart in their views of political issues
which has greatly affected their personal relations despite the fact
that they were high school and university classmates.</P>

      <P>It was meant as an April Fool's joke, but a

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Shanghai-based businessman who was fined
by Taiwan authorities for investing in China said in an e-mail to
local journalists Friday that he is a citizen of the United States
and therefore not subject to Taiwan's law.</P>
      <P>Richard Chang, who is the chief executive officer of the
Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., said
in the e-mail issued from his Shanghai office that he had studied and
worked in the United States for many years and has been using an
American passport.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chang said, the hi-tech industry, such as the
manufacture of semiconductors, knows no boundaries. "I am glad that I
am involved in the building of many semiconductor manufacturing
factories in various countries," he said.</P>
      <P>Although, he has lived in China since February 2000, Chang said
his passion for Taiwan and the United States remains the same.</P>
      <P>He vowed to devote himself to his job in Shanghai for the benefit
of the shareholders of his company.</P>
      <P>Chang was fined NT$5 million (US$159,311) by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs the previous day for investing his company in
Shanghai in violation of Taiwan's regulations.</P>
      <P>The ministry asked Chang to withdraw his investment in China
within six months or more fines will be imposed on him until he obeys
the order.</P>
      <P>In handing down the decision, the ministry said Chang was still
considered a legal resident of Taiwan between 2000 and 2002 and is
therefore considered to have been living in Taiwan during that time,
ergo he is subject to Taiwan's China investment regulations.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is preparing for an international
publicity campaign to drum up support for Taiwan's bid to join the
World Health Assembly (WHA) , Government Information Office (GIO)
chief Pasuya Yao said Friday.</P>
      <P>Noting that the international community has shown sympathy for
Taiwan in the wake of China's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law
which permits it to use force against Taiwan, Yao said it is a good
opportunity for Taiwan to translate their sympathy into support for
Taiwan's efforts to enhance its international profile.</P>
      <P>Yao said the publicity campaign will be organized by the National
Security Council and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the GIO
will do its part according to their instructions.</P>
      <P>After the successful March 26 march which was called to show the
country's displeasure at the Anti-Secession Law, Yao said the

      <P>The establishment of this public television group to be financed

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two legislators from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) urged the opposition-controlled Legislative
Yuan Saturday to speedily complete the consideration of Control Yuan
nominations.</P>
      <P>Legislators Hsieh Hsin-ni and Huang Wei-tze noted that the
Control Yuan, the nation's highest watchdog body, has been moribund
for over two months after the six-year term of the previous 29
ombudsmen expired January 31.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian nominated a new list for approval by the
previous Legislative Yuan late last year, but the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" of the Kuomintang and the People First Party were
dissatisfied with the nominations -- especially that of Clement C.P.
Chang, who was nominated for Control Yuan president -- and refused to
screen the list.</P>
      <P>The two DPP legislators pointed out that the Control Yuan has
received 3,496 appeal cases between Feb. 1 and April 1, but no
Control Yuan members are available to handle them, undermining the
rights of the people.</P>
      <P>Also, Control Yuan members are required to monitor national
examinations, so their absence will also affect the rights of more
than 128,000 participants in various national examinations, they
said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh expressed the hope that the ruling and the opposition
parties can put aside their differences and begin to screen the list
seriously.</P>
      <P>Huang also said that the legislature will renege upon its
constitutional obligations if it refuses to screen the list.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the term of current city and county heads
will expire Dec. 20 and according to the political donation law, the
aspirants for the city and county chief positions can start to accept
political donations only after applying to the Control Yuan to set up
a special bank account in which to deposit the donations.</P>
      <P>If the members of the Control Yuan cannot be produced in time, it
will affect the exercise of government authority and the rights of
the hopefuls, he added.</P>

      <P>The PFP responded in a statement that the party follows a steady,
pragmatic and foresighted approach in dealing with cross-Taiwan
Strait issues and has never scrambled for credit and selfish gains.</P>
      <P>A four-point declaration issued by Chinese President Hu Jintao
last month and the 10-point agreement reached between Soong and
President Chen Shui-bian in February represent a rational and
pragmatic voice across the strait, the PFP said.</P>
      <P>While Hu has reprised Beijing's policies of "one China" and
peaceful unification and its opposition to Taiwan independence, Chen
has reiterated his "five-noes" commitment including no independence
for Taiwan and no change to the cross-strait status quo during his
term.</P>
      <P>According to the PFP, a 10-point consensus established between
the KMT and the Chinese authorities during a just-concluded visit to
Beijing by a delegation led by KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang has not
surpassed the spirit of the two documents or of a cross-strait peace
legislation promoted by the PFP.</P>
      <P>The party said it is a top priority to enact the law to set up an
institutionalized framework for cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Chih-pin, convener of the PFP legislative caucus,
said it is not appropriate for Soong to visit China until the
PFP-initiated peace promotion bill is passed.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, without the law, any talks held by Soong with
the Beijing authorities would have no legal basis and any agreement
coming out of the talks would have problems being realized.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP DISAPPROVES OF KMT'S PANDERING TO CHINA TO BOOST LEVERAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  2  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party
Chairman Su Tseng-chang expressed his disapproval Saturday of what he
described as the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) collaboration with
China in an attempt to increase its political leverage at home.</P>
      <P>Su said during a trip to central Taichung City that the KMT's
"journey of kowtowing" to China has obscured the protest voiced by
the people of Taiwan against Beijing's Anti-Secession Law.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that KMT Chairman Lien Chan, during his term as
premier in 1993, openly dismissed a party-to-party model for
cross-Taiwan Strait negotiations as a "downgrading of the country's
international status," but he is now following exactly this model.</P>
      <P>Su was referring to a just-concluded visit to China by a KMT
delegation led by KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang, which reports claim
have paved the way for a later trip to China by Lien.</P>
      <P>During the visit, the delegation also reached a 10-point
consensus with the Beijing authorities on a wide range of issues
including cross-strait charter flights, agricultural cooperation,
protection for China-based Taiwanese businessmen, tourism,
journalistic exchanges and the opening of the Chinese financial
market.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang pointed out that the talks held
by the KMT with the Chinese Communist Party were not authorized by
the government and thus do not represent the opinions of the 23
million people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the KMT's promise that it will report to the government on the
details of its agreement with Beijing, Lee said this would be totally
unacceptable because the government has its own timetable for
promoting cross-strait exchanges and remains in control of
cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>Lee said the KMT's move was tantamount to conceding the
cross-strait issue to China, which he said has undermined the
national interests of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, it is one of Beijing's united front tactics
against Taiwan to deny the sovereign status of the Republic of China
and the legitimacy of the ROC government.</P>
      <P>By supporting party-to-party negotiations with the Chinese
communists, the KMT has fallen into a trap set by Beijing to create a
false impression that cross-strait relations are an internal affair
of China, Lee said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislators asked the Ministry of National Defense (MND) Saturday to
phase out what they called outdated military songs, particularly
those featuring strong Chinese ideology.</P>
      <P>DPP legislators Hsueh Ling and Lin Chin-hsing said at a news
conference that the singing of pro-China songs in the military has
become "ridiculous and absurd" after China enacted its Anti-Secession
Law justifying the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The two lawmakers demanded that the MND delete all those
pro-China songs from its officially sanctioned list by July 1.</P>
      <P>On March 1, the MND issued a writ to all military personnel to
stop singing the song "I Love Chunghua (Chinese)" during evening roll
call.</P>
      <P>Hsueh and Lin urged the MND to examine all 180 of the songs that
the MND requires military personnel to learn during their service
period, and to immediately abolish 10 of them, such as "China Will Be
Strong" and "The Chinese."</P>
      <P>"It is ridiculous for our soldiers to sing those songs as it is
actually the enemy that such songs encourage," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The move was seen as the latest act by Taiwanese people to show
their strong resolve against the Anti-Secession Law after the "one
million-man" protest march in Taipei last weekend.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SERVICE SECTOR EXPANDS IN TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  2  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The service sector generated NT$6.9
trillion (US$219.5 billion) , or 68.6 percent of Taiwan's gross
domestic product (GDP) in 2004, beating Singapore's 63 percent, South
Korea's 55 percent and China's 34 percent, an economic official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Because of this good performance, Taiwan's economic growth rate
was 5.7 percent last year, according to Hu Sheng-cheng, chairman of
the Council for Economic Planning and Development, who added that the
service sector's expansion has reached the level of mature economies
elsewhere in the world.</P>
      <P>However, Hu said, despite the expanding revenue in the sector,
its employment rate remained at a lower level compared with those in
mature economies, and he noted that the service sector's employment
rate accounted for 0.85 percent of the GDP in 2004, lower than an
average 1.0 percent in economically mature countries.</P>
      <P>To accelerate Taiwan's economic growth, the government has mapped
out a wide range of strategies to boost development of the service
industry, including finance, product distribution, communication and
media, medical treatment and health care, manpower training and
management, tourism and sport and leisure activities, culture,
design, information and environmental protection.</P>
      <P>He indicated that the goal for the service sector's annual growth
has been set at a level of 6.1 percent during the period between 2004
to 2008, while its GDP ratio is aimed at the level of 71.4 percent by
2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA USING 'UNITED FRONT TACTIC' ON TAIWAN'S WHA BID: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China is using a "united front tactic" on
Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) with the
intention of making Taiwan part of China against the wishes of local
people, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang made the remarks following
reports that China might be willing to help Taiwan enter the WHA, the
decision-making arm of the World Health Organization (WHO), under the
title "Taiwan, China."</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has been pushing for Taiwan's entry
into the WHO under the designation of "Taiwan, " insisting that both
sides of Taiwan Strait are two sovereign entities, Lee said the name
"Taiwan, China" would be a "united front tactic" of Beijing, to which
the Taiwan people will be strongly opposed.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, convener of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union's (TSU) legislative caucus, said that his party will not accept
the way China is downgrading the island by helping Taiwan join the
WHA under the name "Taiwan, China, " suggesting that the country
enter the world organization with the title "health entity."</P>
      <P>Claiming that Taiwan does not need such help from China in its
WHA bid, Lo suggested that the government continue to solicit support
from the international community, including the United States.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-ping, legislative caucus leader of the opposition People
First Party (PFP) , declined to comment as the report had not been
confirmed.</P>
      <P>However, she recommended that the nation use a title that will
not cause controversy when joining international organizations.</P>
      <P>Noting that "Taiwan, China" would make people believe that Taiwan
is only a region of China, Lee suggested the title "Chinese Taipei."
Lee said such a title has been used in Taiwan's participation in
several international organizations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Kuomintang welcomed China's overture,
but opposed China's setting limits to the name by which Taiwan will
be referred in the WHA.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus leader Chen Chie noted that his party
welcomes the overture from China, saying that "both sides of the
Taiwan Strait should open their doors for dialogue in pursuit of the
welfare of the people on both sides." He added that China should not
impose any limits on the name Taiwan should use if it is really
willing to create a reconciliatory climate between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The KMT claims to the "only political party in Taiwan" that is
working to reconcile with China, as its vice chairman
P.K. Chiang has just led a big delegation on a five-day visit there,
where he met several high-ranking Chinese officials and inked a
10-point consensus with them.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The fact that more and more women over the
age of 30 or 35 are bearing children in Taiwan has prompted local
insurers to take advantage of the situation by offering a product for
both future mothers and their unborn babies.</P>
      <P>Statistics of the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics show that in 2003, the number of pregnant women aged over
30 accounted for over 36 percent of all pregnant women in the
country, up 10 percent from the level of 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>The number of child-bearing women aged over 35 accounted for
nearly 10 percent that year, representing almost 5 percent growth
over the level of a decade ago, according to the tallies.</P>
      <P>To exploit this potential market, ING Life Insurance Company of
America Taiwan Branch has recently introduced a special insurance
policy for both child-bearing mothers and their unborn babies, an ING
Life executive said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The insurance covers medical treatment under certain
circumstances, for example if the insured baby is found to suffer a
genetic disease, the official noted, adding that the "women plus

    <HEADLINE>ENACTMENT OF BILL TO AUTHORIZE POWER TO NATIONAL ASSEMBLY URGED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Presidential Adviser Yeh Chu-lan called
Saturday for early legislation of a bill governing the exercise of
the power of a soon-to-be-elected mission-oriented National Assembly.</P>
      <P>Yeh, who ranks first on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) nomination list for the National Assembly elections, made the
remarks during a meeting to promote the DPP's female nominees for the
National Assembly.</P>
      <P>If the ad hoc National Assembly, whose mission is to approve a
package of constitutional amendment proposals passed by the
Legislative Yuan last year, convenes without the presence of
legislation to regulate its operations, it will be rendered toothless
and will be a terrible squandering of the nation's resources, Yeh
said.</P>
      <P>Touching on some political parties that are having second
thoughts about the constitutional amendments, she said it will be a
betrayal of their promises to the public if they balk at the reforms.</P>
      <P>She also urged the public to vote in support of the DPP, which
has been consistent in its ideals of reforms to end constitutional
chaos and lead the nation to a normal path.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a legislative reform action alliance urged Saturday a
speedy passage of the bill.
</P>
      <P>The Organic Laws and Statutes Committee in the legislature will
start next Thursday to screen six versions of the bill submitted by
various parties.</P>
      <P>Lu Hsiu-chu, convener of the alliance composed of academic and
civic groups, urged the political parties not to fool the public, not
to filibuster the bill out of their own interests, and to continue to
promote the constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>Ku Chung-hua, executive director of the Taipei Society, said that
if the bill is not adopted, there is a risk of further constitutional
crisis.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope of a large turnout for the National
Assembly election and that the voters will support those political
parties that are in favor of the constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>Huang Chang-lin, chairman of the Awakening Foundation, said that
the amendments are far from perfect, but added that the point is not
the content, but an opportunity for reforms and that the civic group
cares most about the pushing through of the will to reform.</P>
      <P>After six constitutional amendments between 1991 and 2000, the
National Assembly, its delegates nominated by political parties on
the basis of proportional representation, is now a non-standing body
with most of its functions having been transferred to the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>The ad hoc National Assembly, to be elected May 14, is expected
to convene around June 1 for one month. Its mission will be to vote
on the constitutional amendments -- including the halving of the
225-seat legislature, an electoral change to a "single seat, two
votes" system, the abrogation of the National Assembly itself and the
inclusion of the referendum right into the Constitution -- passed by
the legislature last August.</P>
      <P>Faced with a public outcry for reforms, the ruling DPP, along
with the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), People First Party and Taiwan
Solidarity Union, voted for the constitutional amendments with
reluctance last August, but after several months, all but two major
parties -- the DPP and the KMT -- have changed their minds in the
belief that the new electoral system will be detrimental to them.</P>
      <P>The minor parties could play a key role in dethroning the fate of
the constitutional amendment proposals, according to analysts.</P>
      <P>If lawmakers do not agree to begin screening the bill that
regulate the operations of the National Assembly next week, the bill
will have to wait for a four-month consultation among all parties
before it can be put to another vote.</P>
      <P>If the bill is put on hold this way, then even if the delegates
to the National Assembly are elected, they will be powerless, the
analysts have pointed out.</P>
      <P>The minor parties could also resort to the raising of the
threshold of passing the constitutional amendments. The PFP, the TSU
and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union legislative caucus whips have
advocated that the threshold be raised from half to three fourths,
which would effectively kill the proposed amendments.</P>

      <P>An official of the opposition Kuomintang
said Saturday that the public will make its own judgment on his
just-concluded visit to China, amid scathing criticism by the
government and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Chiang, who wrapped up what he claimed was a five-day
"ice-breaking journey" Friday that took him to Guangzhou, Nanjing and
Beijing, made the remarks during an interview with a local TV
station.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Beijing, Chiang reached a 10-point consensus
with Chen Yunlin, director of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, which
covered a wide range of issues, including cross-strait
transportation, agriculture, tourism, journalism, Chinese fishermen,
protection of Taiwanese businessmen in China, and the easing of
China's financial market. He also met with other high-ranking Beijing
officials.</P>
      <P>He admitted that "some" of the consensus reached with the
communists will be up to the government to carry out or not and he
said he will ask the KMT legislative caucus to explain this to the
government.</P>
      <P>He also said he would be happy to discuss the issue with Premier
Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Faced with questions that his visit is mere "wishful thinking, "
and that it might have violated the Statute Governing the Relations
Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, Chiang
disagreed.</P>
      <P>Chiang said Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who helped formulate the
statute during his tenure as vice chairman of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council, told him while greeting him upon his return
from Beijing the previous night that there is no concerns about him
having violated the law.</P>
      <P>Chiang also said that if the court wants to prosecute him for the
trip, he will be willing to cooperate.</P>
      <P>His visit was for the good of Taiwan, Chiang claimed, adding that
the issues raised by the KMT with the Chinese Communist Party have
long been included in the suggestions made by the Council for
Economic Planning and Development or the Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>Many of the issues have existed for a long time, Chiang went on,
saying that he raised them with the communist regime to promote
cross-strait trade exchanges, adding his belief that for the Taiwan
people, the economy is the most important issue.</P>
      <P>With Beijing inviting Lien to visit China and Lien gladly
accepting the invitation, Chiang assessed that the timing for such a
visit could come between the National Assembly election of May 14 and
the KMT chairman election of July 16.</P>
      <P>But he said that June 1 could be significant, because the body of
Dr. Sun Yat-sen, founder of the Republic of China, was relocated from 
Beijing to bury in Nanjing on that day.</P>

    <TEXT>The Times: The Pope of Popes.

He had received the last rites and the Vatican was openly
preparing for his passing. But even as the life ebbed from his
afflicted body yesterday, Pope John Paul II kept fighting. 

As the world prayed for the dying pontiff and cardinals began
to fly to Rome to prepare for the succession, the Vatican
announced that the Pope had appointed 17 bishops and
archbishops and accepted the resignation of six others. 

Having declined further hospital treatment, the 84-year-old
pontiff lay in his private quarters attended by four doctors, a

Paul, who has reigned since 1978, was described in an official Vatican statement
as being in a "very serious condition".</TEXT>

      <P>An American couple had
their wedding in a Catholic church in Taichung in Central Taiwan
Saturday in order to cheer the bride's mother, a Taiwanese who
married an American man more than 30 years ago in the same town.</P>
      <P>In order to make the wedding a day to remember, the bride, Teresa
Krebsbach had to convince her husband Matt Murray, an archaeologist,
and a whole bunch of their family members to come to Taiwan, the
birthplace of Teresa's mother, Lin Mei-ling and the place where she
married her American husband Earl Krebsbach, who died in 1979.</P>
      <P>The 61-year-old Lin, who worked in the 1960s in the food and
beverage store on the former American air base at Chingchuankang,
Taichung, and Krebsbach, an airplane maintenance engineer at the
base, became acquainted in 1958 and married in a Catholic church in
Taichung City the following year.</P>
      <P>Lin and her husband relocated to the United States soon after
their wedding, but unfortunately Krebsbach died in 1979, 10 years
after their marriage.</P>
      <P>Lin raised four children on her own in a land where she knew
nobody. She managed to set up a tiny restaurant and in her scant
spare time, recalled her beloved husband and their beautiful memories
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Knowing her mother's feelings, Teresa decided to have her wedding
in Taiwan, so more than 20 people from both the bride's and groom's
sides of the family came to Taiwan March 23 and had a brief tour
around northern Taiwan before the wedding.</P>
      <P>Saturday's wedding was presided over by a Belgium priest who has
lived in Taiwan for more than 30 years in a ceremony that filled
Lin's eyes with tears and her heart with fond memories.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Saturday it welcomes a statement issued by a group of pro-Taiwan
German lawmakers urging the European Union to maintain its ban on
arms sales to China.</P>
      <P>The German lawmakers, all of whom are members of a pro-Taiwan
group in the German Bundestag, issued the joint statement Friday at
the conclusion of a visit to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A MOFA official said the ministry appreciates the German
legislators' appeal for the European Union to maintain its arms
embargo on China.</P>
      <P>The joint statement says the signatories hope all E.U. member
states will abide by the arms embargo, which was imposed in the wake
of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing in which Chinese
troops brutally crushed pro-democracy demonstrators.</P>
      <P>A lifting of the ban will not be helpful to peaceful development
in East Asia, the statement says.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition People First Party (PFP)
lawmaker said Saturday that President Chen Shui-bian and the two
leaders of the opposition "pan-blue alliance" should meet as soon as
possible to forge a national consensus on relations across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Noting that a major obstacle to cross-strait relations lies in
divisions in Taiwan's ruling and opposition camps over the issue, PFP
Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung said he hopes Chen and the two "pan-blue
alliance" leaders -- Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman
James Soong -- should meet to forge a consensus on the development of
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Liu made the appeal after a high-profile KMT delegation signed a
10-point consensus with China in Beijing earlier this week, which has
drawn scathing criticism from the Taiwan independence-leaning
"pan-green camp" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
its ally the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>In the wake of China's enactment of a law justifying the use of
non-peaceful means against Taiwan, Liu said integrating domestic
opinions on strategies for cross-strait engagements has become an
urgent task.</P>
      <P>"It is also an unshirkable responsibility for Chen and Lien, the
leader of the nation's largest opposition party. Neither the ruling
party nor the opposition camp can ignore the public demand for stable
and peaceful cross-strait ties," Liu said.</P>
      <P>President Chen and PFP Chairman Soong already held a summit
meeting in February and reached a 10-point consensus on cross-strait
relations and major domestic policy issues. Therefore, Liu said he
would not oppose a meeting between Chen and Lien without the
participation of Soong.</P>
      <P>At this critical juncture, Liu said, Taiwan's ruling and
opposition should stop partisan infighting and hammer out a unified
stance and strategy to promote constructive cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>In his view, Liu said, how to ensure "Taiwan first" and national
dignity should be the top concern in boosting cross-strait
engagements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CONDEMNS CHINA OVER FORCING 'TAISHANG' TO BACK ANTI-SECESSION LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 2 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu condemned China Saturday for pressuring Taiwan
businesspeople operating in China, known locally as "taishang, " to
voice support for its anti-secession law targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu issued the denunciation after a Beijing-based broadcasting
network reported earlier in the day that six Taiwanese trade
associations in the southeastern Chinese province of Fujian opposite
Taiwan have issued a joint statement supporting China's
anti-secession law that codifies the use of non-peaceful means
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The nation's top China policy planner said the Taiwanese trade
associations' move was yet another example of China's use of
non-peaceful means against "taishang" following its use of a similar
tactic against Hsu Wen-lung, founder of Chi Mei Group, one of
Taiwan's largest business conglomerates.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who retired from the Chi Mei chairmanship a year ago,
published an open letter in a local newspaper last Saturday throwing
support behind Beijing's "one China" policy and its anti-secession
law.</P>
      <P>Hsu's statement came as a surprise and an embarrassment for
Taiwan's government because he was one of President Chen Shui-bian's
big supporters during Chen's presidential bid in 2000. Hsu's support
for Chen made his China business a target of retaliation by Beijing
authorities. The publication of Hsu's letter coincided with a massive
protest march in downtown Taipei against Beijing's "ill-intentioned"
law.</P>
      <P>"China's pressuring 'taishang' to issue statements supporting the
anti-secession law indicates that the legislation has begun to affect
'taishang,'" Wu said, adding that the new law has not only restricted
their freedom of speech and freedom of choice but may even jeopardize
their business interests.</P>
      <P>Noting that none of Taiwan's government agencies can exercise
public authority on China soil, Wu reminded "taishang" to should
become more risk-conscious in addition to heeding their own economic
benefits in the wake of China's enactment of the anti-secession law.</P>

    <TEXT>Manila Bulletin: GMA addresses IPU today.

President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo will address today the 112th
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) General Assembly with more than 1,500
participating lawmakers and their staff from around the globe
gathered at the opening ceremonies to be held at the Cultural Center
of the Philippines.

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Palace giving up on new special
session for VAT.

MALACANANG has apparently given up the idea of calling another
special session of Congress to rush Senate approval of the expanded
value-added tax after coming up empty in the just-concluded special
three-day session.

The Philippine Star: GMA: Pope a source of strength.

Pope John Paul II remained a lasting source of strength despite
his ailing condition during his last few years, President Arroyo said
yesterday as Filipinos trooped to churches and prayed for a
miraculous comeback for the pontiff.

The Manila Times: Pope nears the end.

Policemen who thwarted a 1995 attempt by Islamic extremists to
assassinate Pope John Paul II in Manila joined fellow Filipinos in
praying Saturday for the gravely ill Pontiff, adding that the failed
plot enabled them to discover other major terrorist plans.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MOURNS PASSING OF POPE JOHN PAUL II</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 3 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President
Annette Lu led the country to express their deep sadness over the
death of Pope John Paul II Sunday, saying that the world has lost a
great religious leader.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Pope's lifetime efforts to seek peace and happiness
for all human beings will long be remembered.</P>
      <P>The president recalled that in July 2003, his wife, Wu Shu-jen,
on behalf of himself and the government and people of the Republic of
China, visited the Vatican to congratulate the Pope on the 25th
anniversary of his inauguration.</P>
      <P>During that visit, the Pope warmly received the ROC's first lady.
Most people in Taiwan remember a most touching moment when they shook
hands -- each from a wheelchair, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Lu lauded the Pope for tirelessly visiting so many places across
the world to show his genuine concern about people. The world should
continue his selfless devotion to peace, she added.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has asked the ROC Vatican Embassy
to forward the ROC's profound condolences. The ministry said the
government will send a senior official to attend the Pope's funeral,
in addition to having senior officials join a memorial service to be
held by the Holy See's Embassy in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The Pope's passing away early Sunday (Taipei time) also drew a
chorus of sadness and regret from all major political parties as well
as church groups in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, caucus whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party at the Legislative Yuan, urged everyone to remember
the Pope's will to promote peace, reminding those in Europe that
while they mourn the great leader's death, they should also do a
sensible thing -- not lift the arms embargo on China to maintain
peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-pin, Lai's counterpart in the opposition People First
Party, said the government should quickly dispatch a special envoy to
express the country's condolences and actively consolidate bilateral
relations. The Vatican is Taiwan's only diplomatic ally in Europe.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union's legislative caucus whip, Lo
Chih-ming, said he hopes John Paul II's successor will continue to
work for peace and religious freedom for people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said KMT Chairman Lien
Chan expressed his deepest condolences, especially when he remembered
how the Pope had held mass while he was in attendance.</P>
      <P>Raymond Tai, former ROC envoy to the Holy See, pointed out that
since his being elected in 1978, Pope John Paul had always wished
that love and peace would prevail on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"Peaceful co-existence and no war between Taiwan and China" was
always on the mind of the Pope, whose successor hopefully will uphold
the same principle in tackling cross-strait issues, Tai said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Regional Bishops' Conference, based in Taipei, called
on believers and non-believers alike to join in paying their respects
to the Pope by glorifying his spiritual legacy of peace and love.</P>
      <P>Father Chen Kun-chen, secretary-general of the conference, said
his group will sponsor a large memorial service in conjunction with
the Pope's funeral for the great leader.</P>
      <P>In Taichung, central Taiwan, Catholics were showing their sadness
at churches Sunday morning. The Taichung diocese will hold a public
mass Tuesday evening.</P>

    <HEADLINE>APPROVE PRESIDENT'S CONTROL YUAN NOMINEES OR EXPECT CHAOS: DPP WHIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If the opposition in the Legislative Yuan
continues to refuse to act on President Chen Shui-bian's Control Yuan
nominees, political chaos will ensue, ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) legislative caucus whip William C.T. Lai warned Sunday.</P>
      <P>The opposition-controlled Legislative Yuan has asked President
Chen to resubmit his list of nominees and the president has agreed to
do so, Lai said, adding that there is no rationale for the
legislature to turn down the list this time around.</P>
      <P>The list requesting approval of the president's selections will
be included in a letter to be delivered to the Legislative Yuan
Monday morning, according to the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>However, Lai said, the president did not add or subtract names to
the previous list that will be submitted to show that he still has
faith in his first selections. The president will respect the
Legislative Yuan's decision even if some of the nominees are not
affirmed, he added.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan is encroaching on the president's nomination
power by asking him to replace the names of his nominees even before
exercising their right to affirm the individuals, Lai said.</P>
      <P>If the president were to consent to changing his selections, it
would be tantamount to the Legislative Yuan usurping the president's
power to nominate the chiefs of other government agencies, such as
the Examination Yuan and the Judiciary Yuan, Lai said. This situation
would lead to political chaos, he added.</P>
      <P>Lai warned the opposition, mainly the Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP) , that they will face a backlash from the
public in the next elections if they keep boycotting the president's
nominees.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DPP's political ally in the Legislative Yuan, the
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) , warned Sunday that if the opposition
continues its boycott of the president's nominees, the TSU will appeal
to the Council of Grand Justices to suspend the Control Yuan
according to a constitutional interpretation.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, the whip of the TSU caucus at the Legislative Yuan,
didn't elaborate on how this could be done, saying only that his
party disagrees with the KMT and PFP's position of boycotting the
nomination process all together, but that the TSU is not prepared to
give all the nominees a rubber stamp of approval.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP, which held a very small majority in the last
Legislative Yuan -- as it does in this new one -- asked the president
in the previous legislature to withdraw all his nominees, claiming
that none of them lived up to public expectations for Control Yuan
members.</P>
      <P>The president refused; the result was a Control Yuan that has had
no members since Feb. 1 when the terms of the previous Control Yuan
members ended.</P>
      <P>The opposition in new legislature asked the president to submit a
new list of nominees on the grounds that his original list to the
previous legislature is invalid in this new legislature.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor and Kuomintang (KMT) Vice
Chairman Ma Ying-jeou got together Sunday with his backers to explain
why he is seeking the KMT chairmanship, stressing his determination
to carry the burden of party reform.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a half-hour activity held in Taipei,

Liluan, Hsinchu County Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin, and legislators
John Chang and Hsu Shu-po were also present to lend support.</P>
      <P>Ma outlined six major directions for the KMT's future

centenarian party capable, young, democratic and clean to help the
nation move ahead.</P>
      <P>He encouraged supporters to volunteer to serve the party and
called on young people to join the party, saying that he will set up
a youth and voluntary service group within the party to serve
society. Ma also vowed to deal properly with the party's remaining
ill-gotten assets and the large number of people on the party's

      <P>He also praised incumbent Chairman Lien Chan's performance in
initiating KMT reforms, suggesting an amendment to the party's

the party's top post in August.</P>
      <P>The main opposition party has five vice chairmen and the next
chairman will be elected through a vote among party members.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST LADY WORRIED ABOUT RISE IN CHILD ABUSE, LOW BIRTH RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  3 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The rise in child abuse and the falling
birth rate in Taiwan are worrying, first lady Wu Shu-jen said Sunday,
adding that caring for children should be no problem as long as there
is a will to do it well.</P>
      <P>Wu made the comments at a garden party for parents and children
at the 228 Peace Memorial Park in downtown Taipei. The event was
aimed at creating "a new paradise for children."</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of the Interior, there have been over
30,000 cases of domestic violence each year in Taiwan in recent
years, of which 6.3 percent were related to child abuse. Charity
organizations estimate that there are more than 18,000 child victims
each year.</P>
      <P>In January, the Taipei-based Child Welfare League Foundation
released a report saying that at least 4.13 children are abused to
death by adults every month on average in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The first lady said that proper care of children need not be a
burden. "It all depends on how you allocate your time, " she said.</P>
      <P>Wu cited her own example to respond to some parents' complaints
that they are too busy at work to spend much time with their
children. She said while she was a lawmaker, she still managed to
take some time out for her young ones, even though she was
wheelchair-bound.</P>
      <P>Another social issue the first lady said she was concerned about
is Taiwan's falling birth rate, which last year stood at 1.24 babies
per woman -- one of the world's lowest rates.</P>
      <P>Couples in France and the United States had an average of 1.9 and
1.2 babies in 2004, while the figures for Sweden and Italy were 1.2
and 1.5, respectively, according to statistics compiled by the
Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Wu said she was especially concerned that so many well educated
couples seem to be losing interest in starting a family. She pointed
out that even some members of President Chen Shui-bian's staff do not
want children.</P>
      <P>The development of a nation, to a large degree, depends on the
quality of its human resources, she said, adding that she hopes that
people will love life, care about kids and cherish what they have, so
that Taiwan will have a better society and a brighter future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T MUST VET NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA BEFORE MAINLAND TRIPS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 3 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Individuals or political groups must report
to the government before and after their visits to mainland China if
they intent to hold negotiations there, Premier Frank Hsieh said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the government does not disallow visits to China,
but he warned of political groups that are hell-bent on being the
next to try to cut some deal with China at the expense of Taiwan's
national interest. Reporting to the government before and after such
visits to China is thus important and a procedural must, he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's comments came at a time when there has been rampant
speculation over the question of whether opposition People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong would accept an invitation to visit
China extended by Chen Yunlin, director of Beijing's Taiwan Affairs
Office.</P>
      <P>A Kuomintang (KMT) delegation, led by Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang,
returned to Taiwan Friday after concluding a five-day visit to China
where they paid tribute to Republic of China founding father and KMT
founder Sun Yat-sen and reached a 10-point consensus with ranking
Beijing officials to bolster civilian exchanges.</P>
      <P>The 10-point consensus touches on a wide range of issues,
including agriculture, air links, labor affairs, the protection of
Taiwan investors and financial cooperation.</P>
      <P>Although the KMT claimed that Chiang's China trip -- the first of
its kind in 56 years since the two sides of the Taiwan Strait split
in 1949 following a civil war -- was fruitful, it has backfired among
pro-independence camps who accuse the main opposition party of
selling out Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong confirmed a media report that a PFP mission, to
be led by Legislator Tsai Sheng-chia, is slated to visit China in the
middle of this month for talks on Taiwan's farm exports.</P>
      <P>Soong promised that the PFP mission will brief relevant
government agencies, such as the Council of Mainland Affairs and the
Council of Agriculture, to learn their opinions on Taiwan's
agricultural exchanges with China before it departs.</P>
      <P>He made it clear that the PFP delegation has no power to
represent the government, but added that it will work hard to seek
the maximum benefits for Taiwan farmers in the coming talks with
Beijing officials.</P>
      <P>The mission will also make public the upshot of the trip after it
returns to Taiwan so that society can better understand what went on
in China, he said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a possible personal visit to China, the PFP
chairman said that he will not report to the government if he decides
to go.</P>
      <P>He said that only the government has the authority and the final
say to settle cross- Taiwan Strait issues and he called for mutual
respect in bilateral dealings. He said he is ready to play some role
between the two sides in the future but pointed out that he is "in no
hurry to visit China now."</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES TSU, PFP TO SUPPORT CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  3  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislative caucus whip William C. T. Lai urged the People First
Party (PFP) and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Sunday to make good
on their promise to support proposed amendments to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Lai said the four proposals -- abolishing the National Assembly,
cutting the number of members of the Legislative Yuan by nearly half,
changing the electoral system for lawmakers and redefining the
existing right in the Constitution to hold nationwide referendums --
were all agree upon in August last year by all parties in the
Legislative Yuan, including the PFP and the TSU.</P>
      <P>Lai warned the two parties that if they renege on their promise,
they face disappointing their constituents and feeling their wrath
for flip-flopping.</P>
      <P>This is especially true for the TSU, which has always campaigned
for the reform of the legislature by trimming the number of its
seats, and redefining the people's constitutional right to hold
referendums, Lai cautioned.</P>
      <P>Simply getting constitutional amendment proposals to be heard at
the National Assembly is a rare occurrence since before this can
happen, three-fourths of all lawmakers must be present at the
legislature to vote on the issue and of these, three-fourths must
vote in favor of convening a mission-oriented National Assembly for
this purpose, Lai said.</P>
      <P>If the TSU backs down from its promise and votes against the
proposals at the National Assembly, another chance to amend the
Constitution might not be available for many, many years, Lai said.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Su Chin-Chiang argued that his party will support
all proposals except the new electoral system for lawmakers which, he
claimed, is designed to eliminate small parties from the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>Su said his party was tricked into favoring the change to the
electoral system in the legislature, and will not support this in the
task-oriented National Assembly.</P>
      <P>Su did not explain how his party had been duped.</P>
      <P>Su said if the four proposals are to be voted on by the National
Assembly one by one, the TSU will vote for all but the new electoral
system. However, if they are to be bound together and voted on as a
whole, which appears to be likely, he said, the TSU would have no
choice but to vote against the package.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-ping, the PFP legislative caucus whip, said his party
has had to shift its position because it has perceived a subtle shift
since last August by the public.</P>
      <P>"We won't hesitate to reverse our position to reflect public
opinion. The DPP should mind its own business rather than worry about
us changing our minds," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The country is gearing up for the election on May 14 of members
to a National Assembly that is tasked only to approve the four
proposals to amend the Constitution. Among the political parties
which have fielded candidates, both the TSU and the PFP have vowed to
vote against the proposals.</P>

in Kaohsiung, Su said he hopes that some of it will rub off on the
eight DPP candidates to help them win.</P>

      <P>The government will continue to conduct
economic and financial reforms to further improve Taiwan's business
environment, an official of the country's top economic planning
agency said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Commenting on a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit
(EIU) that ranked Taiwan as the 18th-best place to do business
globally, an advancement of two notches from the previous year's
list, Thomas M.F. Yeh, vice chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, said that this was a form of international
recognition of Taiwan's reforms.</P>
      <P>Experiencing an economic recession, the government has taken a
series of measures to revitalize the country's economy, including
expanding public construction and public services, conducting
financial reforms and revising out-dated and unsuitable laws and
regulations.</P>
      <P>He added, however, some structural problems remain to be
resolved.</P>
      <P>Chen Tain-jy, president of the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic

      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) will firmly stick to
its constitutional amendments promises as part of its efforts to help
wipe out political disorder and lay a sound foundation for Taiwan's
political development, a party official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Liao Fung-te, director of the KMT's Organization Development
Committee, said that the party will never stand back from its
promises regarding the amendment of the Republic of China
Constitution -- redefining the people's constitutional rights to hold
referendums, halving the seats in the Legislative Yuan, guaranteeing
gender-equality politics and granting power to the court regarding
the impeachment of the president and vice president.</P>
      <P>Despite opposition from other parties to some of these
constitutional amending proposals that already gained an inter-party
consensus in August last year, the KMT will stand firm on its stance
in this regard, Liao said, singling out that redefining the public's
rights to go to a referendum will be of great significance to
Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>Liao's remarks came at a time when a mission-oriented National
Assembly is slated to be set up in the middle of next month to be
exclusively in charge of endorsing the Legislative Yuan's package of
constitutional reforms.</P>
      <P>The KMT has fielded 160 candidates for the May 14 National

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN PRAISES LATE POPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian praised the late
Pope John Paul II Monday for his legacy of peace and espousal of
"peaceful means" to deal with international disputes and social as
well as political issues.</P>
      <P>Pope John Paul II passed away at the Vatican early Sunday
morning, Taipei time.</P>
      <P>Chen said that while mourning the great religious leader's death,
people from across the Taiwan Strait should also emulate the pope's
lifetime efforts of seeking peace and happiness for all human beings,
by addressing cross-strait differences in a peaceful manner.</P>
      <P>In a formal statement delivered at the Presidential Office on the
pope's passing, Chen said that Pope John Paul II always made clear
that peace must be built on a foundation of love, justice, truth and
liberty -- the "four pillars of peace, " as he called them.</P>
      <P>These "four pillars of peace" should also serve in guiding
today's efforts to resolve international disputes via diplomacy, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>"I believe that only when both sides of the Taiwan Strait respect
and follow the 'four pillars of peace, ' can peace prevail across the
strait," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>He said that with the pope's death, the Catholics of the world
have lost their most beloved shepherd, while the world as a whole has
lost one of its strongest leaders.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as the Vatican's staunchest diplomatic ally, he is
representing the Republic of China government as well as the island's
23 million people in expressing Taiwan's deepest condolences for the
passing of the pope. The Vatican is Taiwan's only diplomatic ally in
Europe.</P>
      <P>Chen recalled that in July 2003, his wife, Wu Shu-jen, on behalf
of himself and the ROC government and people, visited the Vatican to
congratulate Pope John Paul II on the 25th anniversary of his
assuming the papacy. During the visit, Wu met with the pope in
person.</P>
      <P>"My wife still vividly remembers the meeting, " Chen said, adding
that "she told me that the pope's hand was soft and warm and his
kindness and sincerity toward people just as unforgettable."</P>
      <P>Wu also presented the pope with a letter written by Chen himself
in which he expressed his total agreement with the pope's "four
pillars of peace."</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated that Taiwan is more than willing to play the role
of a "loyal guard of international order" and a "staunch supporter of
democracy and peace."</P>
      <P>"Only when we exercise democracy, peace, freedom and respect, can
the people live in a world where there is no violence, no war and no
discrimination," Chen stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has asked the ROC
Embassy in the Vatican to relay the ROC's deepest condolences. The
ministry said the government will send a senior official to attend
the pope's funeral, in addition to having senior officials join a
memorial service to be held by the Holy See's Embassy in Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CHAIRMAN SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING INVITATION TO VISIT CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong will seriously consider an invitation extended
by the Beijing leadership to visit China, but so far, there is no
timetable for such a trip, PFP spokesman Hsieh Kong-ping said Monday.</P>
      <P>Coordination tasks -- including seeking consensus within the PFP
as well as consensus among Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties --
are more urgent and need to be dealt with before Soong makes any
decision on a visit to Beijing, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>It has always been Soong's goals as the PFP chairman to sort out
a "right direction" for efforts seeking common interests across the
Taiwan Strait and to enable the two rival sides to treat each other
"like a family," Hsieh said, adding that therefore, Soong has tried
his utmost in seeking approaches to resolve the cross-strait
differences, without having the slightest consideration of his
personal standing.</P>
      <P>Soong will visit China only at a "proper" time, with the PFP
reaching consensus on this matter with the government and having
various "possibilities" worked out, Hsieh stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, five PFP legislators jointly appeared at a press
conference Monday to talk about scenarios surrounding Soong's
possible visit to China, chorusing that "vision is more important
than gesture," and "policy is better than politics."</P>
      <P>All five PFP lawmakers said that it is a PFP priority to enact
cross-strait peace legislation to set up an institutionalized
framework for cross-strait peace. Enactment of the law, however, will
be clearly delinked from Soong's China visit plan, they said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Yong-ping said that cross-strait affairs, which
concern the people's security and welfare, should not be relegated to
the level of competition among the political parties in Taiwan. Lee
called for parties across Taiwan's political spectrum to forgo their
personal biases and instead work concertedly to reach consensus on
cross-strait efforts.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Wen-hsiung said that any form of cross-strait
negotiation, including the possible visit to Beijing by Soong, should
be conducted under the principles of dignity and reciprocity.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chou Hsi-wei said that the PFP's cross-strait plans and
the recent visit to Beijing by a delegation of its ally party, the
Kuomintang, represent efforts to "build bridges and open paths."</P>
      <P>"However, it seems that these two parties are now developing some
kind of grudge against each other, while the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party is apparently showing jealousy without admitting
it," he added.</P>
      <P>Chou called for Taiwan's political parties to first reconcile
with one another before seeking reconciliation with China.</P>

his plan to visit the Republic of Kiribati in May and expressed his

      <P>Chen made the announcement in a meeting with visiting Kiribati
Parliament Speaker Etera Teangana at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen thanked Kiribati for its support for Taiwan's bid to join

will help usher in full exchanges between the parliaments of the two
countries.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, bilateral Taiwan-Kiribati interactions have
been frequent since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in
November 2003.</P>
      <P>Kiribati President Anote Tong visited Taiwan in February 2004,
while former Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien paid a visit to
Kiribati in January 2004, followed by a visit by Vice Foreign Affairs
Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau last July to attend the Kiribati's 25th
founding anniversary, he said.</P>
      <P>Further exchanges are already on the way, as the two nations have
clinched cooperative pacts on agriculture, fishing and sports, he

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT HAILS HEALTH INSURANCE FEE WAIVER FOR POOR YOUNG KIDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday he
takes great pleasure in seeing waiver of national health insurance
premiums for children under three years of age from impoverished
families starting today in connection with celebrations of
Women's/Children's Day.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while attending a ceremony marking the
inauguration of a special bank account to receive donations for
helping disadvantaged children.</P>
      <P>Starting on Women's/Children's Day, Chen said, the central
government will pay health insurance premiums for children under
three from low-income families.</P>
      <P>"This new measure will benefit an estimated 24,000 young children
from poor families around the country, " Chen said, adding that the
premium waiver is expected to help reduce the financial burden for
low-income families by an estimated NT$137 million annually.</P>
      <P>The government has exempted out-patient and hospitalization fees
for all local children under three since 2002.</P>
      <P>With a view to offering more aid and welfare services for
children from impoverished families, Chen said, the Children's Bureau
under the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has decided to open a new
bank account to raise funds from individual citizens and private
business groups.</P>
      <P>Chen said several local news organizations and business groups
have thrown their support behind the "Dear Kids Welfare Account"
program. The president said he himself will raise funds for this
special account in the future.</P>
      <P>"I hope the account can raise at least NT$200 million this year,"
Chen said, adding that he hopes local people can donate funds to help
disadvantaged children or kids from impoverished families.</P>
      <P>The account was set up at the E. Sun Bank's Taichung branch in
central Taiwan. The account number is 0141493012345.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Su Chia-chyuan and many other senior officials
were also present at the ceremony marking inauguration of the account
as part of the Women's/Children's Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>To protect the education rights of pre-school children from
low-income families, the government has offered subsidies for
pre-schoolers up to the age of five. Chen said he has directed the
Interior Ministry and the Education Ministry to study the feasibility
of lowering the age to three for receiving similar subsidies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Three female opposition lawmakers
announced Monday that they will push for the formation of a special
Cabinet-level commission to implement the government's gender
equality policy.</P>
      <P>Legislators Huan Chao-shun and Huang Min-hui of the Kuomintang
and Lee Yong-ping of the People First Party held a news conference at
the Legislative Yuan to announce that they will propose an amendment
to the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan for the Cabinet to set up an
agency in charge of gender equality affairs.</P>
      <P>Huang explained that the existing laws and government policy
concerning gender equality or women's rights have not been thoroughly
carried out because there is no organization within the executive
branch to deal with the issue.</P>
      <P>Therefore, she urged the Executive Yuan to set up a new
commission which enjoys an independent budget and staff to promote
gender quality in an inter-ministerial manner.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that setting up a special agency to promote gender
equality was one of the 2004 presidential election campaign promises
made by President Chen Shui-bian and his running mate, Vice President
Annette Lu.</P>
      <P>Representatives of private women's organizations, including the
Awakening Foundation and the Modern Women's Foundation, also attended

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian sent a list of
Control Yuan nominees -- the same one that was rejected by the last
legislature -- to the new legislature Monday.</P>
      <P>The list contained exactly the same 29 names that were on the
list submitted to the previous legislature. Among others, the list
contained the name of Clement C.P. Chang, a former speaker of the
Taipei City Council and one of the reasons that the opposition
parties have been opposed to the president's nominations.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the Legislative Yuan, President Chen said the
terms of office for the members of the third Control Yuan, including
its president and vice president, expired on Jan. 30, 2005, but the
last legislature failed to act on his Dec. 20, 2004 nominations which
he put forward in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Since a new legislature was sworn in Feb. 1, 2005, the president
wrote, "I hereby request that the Legislative Yuan exercise its right
to approve the list as soon as possible."</P>
      <P>The president did not change the names from the original list to

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party legislative caucus whip
William C.T. Lai said the opposition can veto any of the nominees,
but they have no right to refuse to screen the list.</P>
      <P>"It's their duty to act on the list, but by refusing to do so,

some goodwill before re-sending the nominees list. This, however, has

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although visits by political party leaders
to mainland China are a good thing to help ease tensions across the
Taiwan Strait, it will be much better if they could talk with the
government before they do so, Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the suggestion while answering questions from lawmakers
at a legislative committee focusing on the 10-point consensus reached
by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) delegation led by Vice
Chairman P. K. Chiang and officials of the Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) last Wednesday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Admitting that it is good for governments to sit down and talk,
Lee, however, pointed out that political parties' inking accords with
China without prior government understanding is not acceptable to the
ROC government. Such a development is not good for the nation and
society, he added.</P>
      <P>He said he believes that cross-strait relations will gradually
get better in the coming months as President Chen Shui-bian has
showed a willingness to reopen talks with China on the basis reached
by officials from the two sides in a 1992 meeting in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Chiang's trip has provoked strong criticisms from the
pro-independence camps, including President Chen as well as his
ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>They accused the trip of being "highly inappropriate" at a time
when Beijing's recent adoption of an Anti-Secession Law against
Taiwan has poisoned cross-strait relations and they lashed out at the
KMT-CCP 10-point consensus for having "sold out" Taiwan's interests.</P>
      <P>The 10-point consensus is aimed at promoting civilian exchanges,
covering a broad range of issues in the fields of education, air
links and protection of Taiwan business interests as well as fishery,
agricultural and financial cooperation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Aboriginal Legislator May Kao-Chin from the
Non-Partisan Solidarity Union protested in strong words Monday
against the forthcoming visit to Japan's Yasukuni Shrine by Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Su Chin-chiang.</P>
      <P>Wearing head gear adorned with the Chinese characters for
"protest" and historical pictures, Kao-Chin lodged the protest at the
headquarters of the TSU, lambasting Su's plan to visit the Japanese
temple dedicated to war dead as "selling his soul to the devil for
political gain."</P>
      <P>Local newspapers reported Monday that Su plans to pay tribute to
the nearly 30,000 "patriotic" Taiwanese commemorated at the Yasukuni
Shrine who were killed during World War II fighting for Japan.</P>
      <P>If they were indeed "patriotic, " Kao-Chin asked which side they
supported - - Taiwan or Japan? Japan, Kao-Chin added, killed numerous
Taiwanese, including aborigines, before and during its rule of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kao-Chin likened Su's upcoming visit to the Yasukuni Shrine to
the Jews worshipping their Nazi rulers and murderers.</P>
      <P>Discounting Kao-Chin's broadside, TSU Secretary-General Chen
Chien-ming said that Su is not going to pay tribute to the Japanese
war dead, but to the soldiers who came from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the people of Taiwan were not only the victims of
atrocities committed by the Japanese, they were also victims of
Chinese brutality, Chen called for tolerance toward diverse voices
and different opinions in society.</P>
      <P>Chen asked that Kao-Chin direct her hatred away from Taiwan or
Japan and focus it on China.</P>
      <P>The Yasukuni Shrine, situated in central Tokyo just outside the
moat to the Imperial Palace, is dedicated to about 2.46 million
people who have died in Japan's conflicts between 1853 and 1945. Of
the total enshrined, 1,068 are convicted war criminals.</P>
      <P>Su will be traveling to Japan in the near future, mainly to mark
the establishment of a TSU branch in Japan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS CRITICIZE OUTDATED BUS REGULATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of legislators slammed what they
called an outdated bus regulation Monday, saying that a height
restriction on bus fares is unfair.</P>
      <P>The legislators said that according to a current bus regulation,
the minimum height to decide for a high school student's ticket or
for a children's fare is 140 cm.</P>
      <P>According to the height regulation, which has been in place for
nearly 40 years, school children are entitled to paying the
children's fare, or NT$8 if they are under 140 cm, the legislators
said.</P>
      <P>If they are taller than 140 cm, they must pay the student fare,
or NT$12, the same as that required of a high school or college
student.</P>
      <P>The problem is, they argued, the average height of sixth graders
in Taiwan has now exceeded 140 cm to reach 148 cm.</P>
      <P>The outdated height restriction is not only unrealistic but also
deprives elementary school pupils of their due privilege, the
lawmakers said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a survey conducted in the northern county of Taoyuan
found that one out of every four first graders in all elementary
schools in the county were suffering from myopia, while some 70
percent of them have cavities.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan Magistrate Chu Li-lun said that an extra budget will be
allocated to improve school facility and health programs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU SUGGESTS PFP CHAIRMAN SERVE AS ENVOY FOR TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong should serve as an envoy to lobby world support for Taiwan at a
time when cross-Taiwan Strait ties have turned soured after Beijing
adopted an Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan in mid-March, a
spokesman for the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming, secretary-general of the pro-independence TSU,
made the proposal at a news conference he called at the TSU
headquarters.</P>
      <P>Suggesting that President Chen Shui-bian appoint Soong as a
special envoy to seek backing from the United States, Japan and the
rest of the world for Taiwan when the country has come under growing
military threats from Beijing, Chen Chien-ming said that Soong should
play a bigger role in cross-strait affairs due to a 10-point
agreement that he inked with the president in late February.</P>
      <P>Since PFP lawmakers have argued that the 10-point consensus
reached recently between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the Chinese
Communist Party does not go beyond the framework of the Chen-Soong
agreement, Soong should seize the opportunity and not allow the KMT
to steal the limelight, Chen said.</P>
      <P>By helping gain international backing for Taiwan, Soong could see
his 10-point accord with the president really be implemented and
serve the country, he suggested.</P>
      <P>He also urged Soong to display greater goodwill by helping push
through a special budget bill and a major military procurement bill
at the Legislative Yuan before a possible second Chen-Soong meeting.</P>
      <P>The president and Soong met on Feb. 14 in a gesture of rapport
between the ruling and opposition parties in view of the fragile
cross-strait situation.</P>
      <P>The two signed the 10-point accord, promising not to change the
nation's official title of the Republic of China and not to write a
new constitution -- actions viewed by Beijing as moves toward Taiwan
independence and ones that could invite "non-peaceful" reactions from
Beijing under the conditions set forth in the Anti-Secession Law.</P>

      <P>Intra-party negotiations over how to handle
President Chen Shui-bian's nominations of Control Yuan members broke
down at the Legislative Yuan Monday and its leader announced a new
round of talks for Thursday.</P>
      <P>Monday's negotiations could not go anywhere because the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP) were not
satisfied with the president's refusal to name new nominees.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) caucus whip William
C.T. Lai said the president has the constitutional right to nominate
whomever he likes while the legislature has a duty to screen his
nominees.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, Lai's counterpart in the minor opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union, said the controversy should be discussed at a
legislative committee, including whether to change some names or not.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP expressed regret that the president refused
to change any of the names on the nomination list. KMT legislative
caucus whip Chen Chieh said if the president remains adamant on this,
it would be pointless to screen his old list.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative caucus whip Li Yung-pin refused to link this
issue to a 10-point consensus her party leader, James Soong, had
reached with President Chen.</P>
      <P>Failing to bring both sides together, Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng said this is a political problem that needs a

Just 12 hours after Pope John Paul II died Saturday night, the

Wall Street Journal: In Changing World, Church Faces Choice Over
Pope's Role.

In his 26 years as pope, John Paul II transformed the papacy like
few of his 263 predecessors. His role in aiding the defeat of
communism in Eastern Europe, his grueling trips around the world to
bless mass audiences and his writings on topics ranging from war and
ethics to his own life story granted him a moral authority few other
world leaders could match. The cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church
face a wrenching choice: Even if they could find someone with similar
star power to succeed John Paul II, would he be the right sort of man
to lead the church into the third millennium?</TEXT>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between the Republic of China and
the Vatican have remained steadfast, a senior Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Larry Yu-yuan Wang, director of the MOFA's European Affairs
Department, made the remarks while attending a news conference hosted
by the opposition Kuomintang's (KMT) legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>During the news conference, KMT legislators Su Chi and Lee
Fu-hsiung said the government should do its utmost to cement
diplomatic relations with the Vatican after Pope John Paul II died
early Sunday Taipei time at the age of 84.</P>
      <P>Su, who once served as Mainland Affairs Council chairman, said if
the Vatican switched its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to
Beijing, it could have a domino effect on Taiwan's diplomatic
situation.</P>
      <P>"Sixteen of the ROC's 25 diplomatic allies are Catholic
countries. If the government fails to handle events following the
pope's death appropriately, it could have a grave impact on our
diplomatic map," Su cautioned.</P>
      <P>In response, Wang said, the ROC government has consistently
supported the late Pontiff's global charity and peace-promotion
activities over the past decades.</P>
      <P>"Our relations with the Vatican have been close and steadfast, "
Wang said.</P>
      <P>He further said dialogue between China and the Vatican has been
suspended since 2000 because of China's stubborn resistance to any
Vatican involvement in its domestic Catholic church affairs.</P>
      <P>For years, China has insisted on its two prerequisites for
establishing formal ties with the Vatican -- cutting ties with Taiwan
and promising not to get involved in Chinese Catholic church affairs.</P>
      <P>In history, Wang said, the Holy See has never taken the
initiative to sever its diplomatic relations with any country in the
world.</P>
      <P>Wang said the ROC government has taken appropriate measures to
pay homage to the Pope, including having the national flags flown at
half-staff at government buildings since Sunday for two days.</P>
      <P>Senior government officials, including President Chen Shui-bian
and Vice President Annette Lu, have expressed their deep sadness over
the death of Pope John Paul II, saying that the world has lost a
great religious leader. In addition, President Chen gave a eulogy in
praise of the Pontiff Monday.</P>
      <P>The MOFA has asked the ROC Vatican Embassy to forward the ROC's
profound condolences. The ministry said the government will send a
senior official to attend the Pope's funeral, in addition to having
senior officials join a memorial service to be held by the Holy See's
Embassy in Taipei.</P>

Embassy of the Holy See Monday to pay tribute to Pope John Paul II,
who died Saturday at the age of 84.</P>
      <P>The president was accompanied by Presidential Secretary-General
Yu Shyi-kun and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu and Premier Frank Hsieh also went to
the embassy to pay their respects.</P>
      <P>The president first bowed three times before a picture of the
late pontiff and then talked with Ambrose Madtha, charge d'affaires
of the embassy, who invited him to attend the late pontiff's funeral.</P>
      <P>The president said that after learning of the pope's death, he
asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to express grief on behalf of
himself and his wife. He also instructed the Presidential Office and
the Executive Yuan to fly the national flag at half mast as a mark of
respect.</P>
      <P>The president expressed his highest regards for the contributions
to world peace by the late pope and said he hopes to continue to
promote lasting peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait in line
with the pope's wishes.</P>
      <P>He and his wife prayed for the pope April 2, Chen said, recalling
that his wife, Wu Shu-jen met the late pontiff in Vatican City in
July 2003 during her European visit, and that the scene of the two --
both in wheelchairs -- shaking hands moved him to tears.</P>
      <P>Madtha said that the pope has been positive about the efforts of
the ROC government and people in pursuing cross-strait peace and he
expressed the hope that the close relations between the two sides
will be further strengthened.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Calling trips to China by political parties
"a good thing, " Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh said Monday
that he would like to lead his staff on a visit to the Chinese
Academy of Sciences for exchanges when the time is ripe.</P>
      <P>However, Lee told the Legislative Yuan that it would not serve
the interests of the country if agreements between local parties and
the Chinese Communist Party are rejected by the government because
that parties did not get government approval to forge such
agreements.</P>
      <P>Lee was asked by lawmakers to comment on the just-concluded trip
to China by a delegation from the opposition Kuomintang. The trip,
taking place days after a massive protest in Taipei against China's
enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, was criticized by some as
cutting the ground from under the feet of the government in its
intensifying confrontation with China.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lee said, Taiwan's ties with China have been turning
for the better in the last several months, especially President Chen
Shui-bian's announcement Oct. 10, 2004 that he was willing to talk
with China on the basis of the 1992 talks between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan and China cannot even agree with each other on
what understanding they reached in those talks, Lee said, Chen's
announcement showed a converging of positions between Taiwan and
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SUGGESTS THAT WTO REVIEW VISA FEES FOR EXPORTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has suggested that the World Trade
Organization (WTO) review the practice of some countries charging
visa fees to exporters, the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said
Monday.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials noted that the WTO Doha Round of trade
negotiations has made the facilitation of the flow of trade one of
the WTO's priority issues.</P>
      <P>A WTO trade negotiating team held the fourth meeting in the
second half of March, during which Taiwan, the United States, South
Korea, the European Union, and Japan submitted 10 written suggestions
focusing mostly on how to streamline export and import fees and
procedures, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They said Taiwan exporters have often complained that some
countries charge consular visa fees that are not only expensive but
also inconvenient. As many counties have not set up consular or
representative offices in Taiwan, the exporters have to send the
documents to neighboring countries that do host such offices.</P>
      <P>Taiwan representatives said in the meeting that these
unreasonable fees increase the cost of international trade, mitigate
trade opportunities and cut into the profits of small- and
medium-sized enterprises, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The BOFT has commissioned the Importers and Exporters Association
of Taipei to investigate this and other trade hurdles encountered by
Taiwan exporters so as to create a more favorable trade environment
for them.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP PITCHES FOR CONCERTED EFFORTS TO STAMP OUT CHILD ABUSE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Monday she
deplores the increasing prevalence of parents abusing their children
in local society.</P>
      <P>"Child abuse has become an ever-more serious social issue in
Taiwan due in part to a lack of parenting education. It is deplorable
that parents fail to love their own children and even maltreat them,"
Lu said at a roundtable meeting on child abuse problems as part of
the Women's and Children's Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Lu said the number of child abuse cases
reported in the first half of 2004 marked a 10 percent increase from
that reported in the whole of 2003.</P>
      <P>"In 1994, 1,638 child abuse cases were reported in 1994 and the
number had jumped to 5,349 by 2004. If juvenile abuse was included,
the number exceeded 8,000 in 2004, or an average of one child and
juvenile abuse case reported every 1.1 hours last year," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Lu said, 81.06 percent of abusers were parents,
while 6.9 percent were baby sitters, 3.67 percent were relatives and
4.33 percent were their parents' live-in lovers.</P>
      <P>In her view, Lu said, abusive parents mainly result from their
ignorance of parental responsibilities.</P>
      <P>"Love for children is the basic parenting principle. It's
unthinkable that parents maltreat their own children. Child abuse is
an irresponsible way of life," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a series of surveys by children's welfare
groups, Lu said marital problems accounted for 20 percent of child
abuse cases, 11.6 percent resulted from abusive parents' alcohol or
drug abuse, 10.9 percent were related to poverty and 9.8 percent were
caused by parents' unemployment.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Taiwan is advanced in terms of children's
welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>"We enacted the domestic violence prevention law in 1998, the sex
crime prevention law in 2002, the family education law and the
children and juvenile welfare law in 2003, and the gender equality
education law in 2004. It's lamentable that we have so many child
abuse cases even after the enactment of all those laws, " Lu said,
adding that the government, social workers, scholars and experts
should pool their wisdom to work out measures to prevent child abuse.</P>
      <P>"We should not only consider how to help abused children but also
hammer out measures to prevent those cases from happening, " she
added.</P>
      <P>The outspoken vice president further said that the local women's
movement has focused only on sexual liberation while failing to put
equal emphasis on cultivating sexual ethics. Lu said she believes
this deficiency is one of the major causes of the significant rise in
child abuse in Taiwan in recent years.</P>
      <P>"Besides helping abused youngsters, we should from now on devote
more efforts to exploring relations between the genders and improving
parenting education to prevent child abuse," Lu added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Monday that
the interests of the nation and the people should be above those of
individuals and political parties.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received visiting Kiribati
Parliament Speaker Etera Teangana at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that Taiwan underwent the first peaceful power
transfer between parties in 2000. A true democratic country must have
parliament and party politics and it is only natural to have
arguments and competitions among different parties, he said.</P>
      <P>But when faced with the outside world, there can be only national
interests, he said.</P>
      <P>He also said that Taiwan and Kiribati share the universal values
of believing in democracy, freedom, peace and human rights, and that
whether a country is great or not has nothing to do with its size and
per capita income. Although Taiwan is small, it is on the side of
democracy and justice and both it and Kribati are great countries, he
added.</P>
      <P>Chen, who revealed his plan to visit Kiribati in May earlier in t
he day, said bilateral interaction has been frequent since the two
countries forged diplomatic ties in November 2003.</P>
      <P>Kiribati President Anote Tong visited Taiwan in February 2004,
while former Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien paid a visit to
Kiribati in January 2004, followed by a visit by Vice Foreign Affairs
Minister Michael Ying-mao Kau last July to attend Kiribati's 25th
founding anniversary.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWO LATE PRESIDENTS' MAUSOLEUMS TO BE TURNED INTO MEMORIAL PARKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  4  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The interim mausoleums of the late
President Chiang Kai-shek and his son and successor Chiang Ching-kuo
in Taoyuan County will be converted into memorial parks after their
embalmed bodies are interred at a cemetery in Taipei County later
this year, a local official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lun said both the Chiang
Kai-shek mausoleum at Tzuhu and the Chiang Ching-kuo mausoleum at
Touliao have long been the northern Taiwan county's major tourist
attractions.</P>
      <P>"In addition to bearing great historical significance, the two
mausoleums also boast beautiful natural scenery and unique
architectural styles, " Chu said, adding that the county government
has decided to convert the two mausoleums into memorial parks or
libraries after the embalmed bodies of the two late presidents are
interred at the Wutzushan military cemetery in Hsichi, Taipei County
in July.</P>
      <P>The Chiang family sent a letter to the Ministry of National
Defense (MND) last year asking it to help with the relocation of the
two Chiangs -- who have been embalmed in interim mausoleums in
Taoyuan to the Wutzushan military cemetery for permanent interment.</P>
      <P>With the consent of President Chen Shui-bian, the MND, the
Ministry of the Interior and various other government agencies began
to plan for the relocation and burial in line with the state funeral
law.</P>
      <P>After some twists and turns, the MND commissioned contractors
early this year to build tombs for the two late presidents and the
graves are scheduled for completion in June. If all goes well, the
interment ceremony will be held in July.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office will announce relocation and interment
procedures and rituals later in accordance with the state funeral
law.</P>
      <P>Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese
mainland to the Mao Zedong-led communist party in a bloody civil war.
He died in 1975 and his remains were embalmed in a temporary
mausoleum at Tzuhu in Taoyuan, awaiting a proper burial on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>Chiang Kai-shek ruled Taiwan with an iron fist, using martial law
to suppress democracy. However, some view him as a hero for keeping
the island out of reach of the Chinese communists and claim that it
was he who fostered Taiwan's freewheeling market economy.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-kuo is respected for ending martial law in 1987,
shortly before his death, thus unleashing the democratic forces that
broke his family's vice-grip on power and eventually ended the
Kuomintang's half-century of rule over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chiang Ching-kuo died in 1988 and his remains also lie embalmed
in an interim mausoleum at Touliao in Taoyuan. His Russian-born wife
died Dec. 15, 2004 and her cremated ashes, which are being kept at
Chiang's mausoleum, will be buried along with her husband.</P>

      <P>A delegation from the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Japan Monday to
pay their respects to the Taiwanese and Japanese war dead enshrined
there.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Su Chin-Chiang and his 10-member entourage arrived
at the shrine and was greeted by the shrine's abbot, who ushered them
into the main hall of the shrine to pay their respects.</P>
      <P>Su told journalists accompanying him on the trip that he visited
the shrine to show his party's respect for the 28,000 Taiwanese who
died as Japanese soldiers during World War II when Taiwan was ruled
by Japan as well as Japanese who sacrificed for their country.</P>
      <P>Saying that he is the first leader of a Taiwanese political party

people around the world to forgive their feuds with one another and
work together to create a better future.</P>
      <P>The shrine has been at the center of a bitter dispute between
Japan and other Asian countries, which take offense at Japanese prime
ministers' visits to the shrine because it also enshrines 14 Japanese
war criminals of World War II who were executed by the victorious

      <P>These Asian states, especially China, consider the visit to be a
sign that the country shows no remorse for its war crimes during

country in the world has the freedom to express its respect for
soldiers who died for its flag, Japan being no exception.</P>

China's territorial claim over Taiwan, Su showed his disdain for

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) would wish People First Party Chairman James Soong a successful
visit to China and might even ask him to convey a message to Beijing
if Soong will consult the opinion of the government and DPP before
his departure, a DPP official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Dung Li-wen, director of the DPP's Chinese Affairs Department,
said, however, that he did not know whether Soong will seek
endorsement from the DPP and the government before his trip, in light
of Soong's contradictory statements of the last few days.</P>
      <P>Dung said that Soong has contradicted his earlier statement that
he will built a common front with other political parties before his
departure for China by claiming that he will visit China in his
private capacity and therefore will not require to inform the
government of his trip in advance.</P>
      <P>Dung said he doubts whether the PFP chief could visit China as a
private person, as this would not be the expectation of either China
or the general public in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since a PFP agricultural delegation is preparing to head for
China, Dung said, Soong is probably waiting to see what results from
that trip before deciding upon his own visit.</P>
      <P>Dung said DPP does not oppose any person or group visiting China,
but insists that these trips should be made according to the laws,
which is especially important when these Taiwan visitors negotiate
with their Chinese hosts on affairs falling within the government's
authority, because the "Chinese Communist Party can hurt us more in
talks than outside talks."</P>
      <P>Under this principle, Dung said, the DPP will not oppose Soong's
proposed trip to China as long as he can forge a consensus with the
government and other political parties.</P>
      <P>Judging from China's persistent attempts to divide the political
parties in Taiwan, he predicted that China will reserve its largest
charm offense toward Taiwan for KMT Chairman Lien Chan, although it
would give Soong the honor of visiting ahead of Lien.</P>
      <P>Dung said his party will treat Lien's possible visit to China
with the same attitude as it treats that of Soong.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The German Green Party on Monday urged
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder not to continue to work for a
lifting of the European Union's arms embargo against China, pointing
to Beijing's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law and its human rights
problems.</P>
      <P>Claudia Roth, chairwoman of the German Green Party, which is part
of the German coalition government, said after a meeting with other
leaders of the party that China's Anti-Secession Law and its
aggressive manner toward Taiwan do not qualify it to request that the
E.U. lift its arms sales ban.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, lifting the arms embargo against China would send
the "wrong message" as China continues to have serious human rights
problems, including harming the interests of ethnic minorities and
excessive use of the death penalty, Roth said.</P>
      <P>Roth added that she believes that German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer, also from the Green Party, will advise Schroeder not to
support a lifting of the ban.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that the purpose of the E.U.'s China policy is to
support democratization in China and to avoid regional dispute,
Roth said that a lifting of the arms embargo would not help promote
democracy and instead, would only worsen the situation.</P>
      <P>Schroeder has reiterated recently that his stance in support of a
lifting of the arms sales ban remains unchanged despite opposition
from most of the German lawmakers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) Chairman Su
Chin-chiang should explain the rationale behind his visit to a
controversial Japanese Shinto shrine in Tokyo, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, a DPP legislative caucus whip, was commenting
on Su's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine the previous day. The shrine is
dedicated to 2.5 million war dead, including 14 convicted war
criminals.</P>
      <P>Su is one of a few senior Asian political figures ever to visit
the shrine, and his visit immediately drew criticism at home.
Aboriginal Legislator May Chin and her supporters even staged a
protest at the TSU headquarters in Taipei Monday, accusing Su of
dignifying Japan's militarism in the early 20th century and its
campaigns against Taiwan's aboriginal people during its colonial rule
of the island from 1895 to 1945.</P>
      <P>Noting that the people of Taiwan have bitter memories of Japan's
militarism during World War II, Lai said Su, as the leader of a major
Taiwan political party, should clearly explain to the public the
purpose, motivation and target of his visit to the Yasukuni Shrine.</P>
      <P>The shrine lists the names of 28,000-plus Taiwanese and 21,000
Korean soldiers, most of whom were forced into military service under
Japan's colonial rule. The holy site also lists the names of Japanese
civilians who died in fighting.</P>
      <P>Visits by Asian leaders to the Shinto shrine in central Tokyo
have been extremely rare, but military envoys and attaches from
countries in other regions around the world have often paid visits.
Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visits to the shrine have
tarnished Japan's relations with its neighboring countries,
particularly China and South Korea.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's enactment of an anti-secession law,
which authorizes its central military commission to use
"non-peaceful" means in dealing with problems in the Taiwan Strait,
has expanded Beijing's room to use force against Taiwan, the Republic
of China defense minister said Monday.</P>
      <P>Defense Minister Lee Jye, who made the comments at a monthly
gathering of ministry personnel, also said that the law has brought
more variables of instability to peace in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Saying that China has tried to mislead the international public
and to give itself a legal excuse to use force to resolve the
so-called "Taiwan problem" as well as unilaterally change the status
quo in the Taiwan Strait by enacting the anti-secession law, Lee
noted that Beijing also wants to use so-called "legal warfare" and
"opinion warfare" as a basis to expand it psychological "war
preparedness" in order to achieve its "goal of reunification by
force."</P>
      <P>Faced with an increasing threat to Taiwan's national security,
President Chen Shui-bian has reiterated his "reconciliation, without
concession" and "firmness, without confrontation" stance, the
minister said, adding that the armed forces, which are responsible
for protecting the country and the people, should do their utmost to
support the government's policy of pursuing democracy and peace.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that only strength can ensure security, peace and
hope and that the strength of national development and survival
relies on a solid foundation of national defense and security, Lee
said that purchasing advanced arms and equipment that can modernize
Taiwan's military is part of the process of pursuing peace rather
than an arms race with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Warning that China's military has more authority and room to
attack Taiwan following the enactment of the anti-secession law, Lee
said that China will also have a better chance of winning a war
against Taiwan if the island postpones purchasing advanced arms and
equipment.</P>
      <P>He also said that his ministry's arms-procurement project not
only considers Taiwan's urgent military needs but also provides
Taiwan with a strength of security to develop better cross-strait
dialogue and exchanges.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Tuesday he is more than willing to make a "journey of
peace" to mainland China, but he added that the timing for his visit
has yet to be determined.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks while visiting the interim mausoleum of the
late President Chiang Kai-shek at Tzuhu in Taoyuan County to mark
Tomb Sweeping Day and the 30th anniversary of Chiang's death.</P>
      <P>In response to a press inquiry about Beijing's invitation to him,
Lien said he feels honored to be invited to visit China.</P>
      <P>"I would be pleased to visit the mainland on a 'journey of
peace, ' but the time has yet to be determined, " Lien said, adding
that he has directed his aides to study the most opportune time for
him to visit the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lien, who just returned to Taipei Monday evening after a vacation
in Japan, dismissed as a "joke" the Democratic Progressive Party
administration's warning that if he fails to report to the government
or obtain the government's approval before departing for a China
visit, he could be considered to be breaking Taiwan law.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former vice president who lost twice in his bid for the
presidency in 2000 and 2004, would not elaborate on the topics he
plans to discuss with Beijing leaders during his proposed "journey of
peace."</P>
      <P>Leading a group of senior KMT officials, Lien also visited the
interim mausoleum of the late President Chiang Ching-kuo -- Chiang
Kai-shek's son and successor -- at Touliao near Tzuhu Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The embalmed bodies of the two late presidents will be interred
at the Wutzushan military cemetery in Hsichi, Taipei County later
this year.</P>
      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu Li-lun said Monday that the Tzuhu
and Touliao mausoleums will be converted into memorial parks after
the relocation of the bodies of the two late presidents.</P>
      <P>For years, Chu said, the two mausoleums have been major tourist
attractions in the northern Taiwan county.</P>
      <P>"In addition to bearing great historical significance, the two
mausoleums also boast beautiful natural surroundings and unique

      <P>The Legislative Yuan should quickly act on
the president's nomination list of Control Yuan members for the sake

Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) urged Tuesday.</P>
      <P>William C. T. Lai said the operations of the Control Yuan --
Taiwan's highest watchdog body -- have come to a halt for over two
months, with some 3,500 complaints having piled up in that time. He
called for a swift screening by the legislature of the name list put
forth again by President Chen Shui-bian in order to "save social
costs and maintain a good image for the Legislative Yuan."</P>
      <P>Inter-party negotiations on the issue broke down Monday after the
president submitted the list again to the Legislative Yuan earlier
the same day. Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng set a new round of
negotiations for Thursday.</P>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP)
refused to screen the list because of dissatisfaction with the fact
that the president had not replaced certain controversial figures on
the initial list.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP have made it clear that they will not consent to
the list if the president does not change the lineup.</P>

      <P>Information services companies are being
encouraged to create flagship units with other companies to increase
their efficiency through synergy, the Industrial Development Bureau
(IDB) under the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Under the so-called "best flagship" project, which is part of the
government's efforts to upgrade the manufacturing industry -- a key
driving force behind the country's economic development -- local
companies in the information services sector are being encouraged to
cooperate with other businesses in the fields of manufacturing,
distribution, finance, medical treatment and health care,
communications, e-commerce, information distribution security,
e-commerce, and software creation, IDB officials said.</P>
      <P>In the preliminary stage, each flagship enterprise should lead at
least three other companies to provide integrated information
services or to engage in cooperative development, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They added that the IDB will take two years to build up
cooperative entities and offer a subsidy of at most NT$30 million
(US$949,850) to each applicant during the build-up period.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that assisting private businesses to organize 12
service fleets in the information services industry will require
about NT$570 million, but the work is expected to build Taiwan into a

said, adding that the project has passed the National Science

    <HEADLINE>HARMFUL ALGAE APPEARS IN HALF OF TAIWAN'S RESERVOIRS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A harmful algae that can cause liver damage
in humans has appeared in half of Taiwan's 27 reservoirs, the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>This "green scum" produces the peptide toxin microcystin, which,
when ingested in concentration, causes liver damage and can be a
major drinking water contaminant.</P>
      <P>EPA officials, however, stressed that the algae is only toxic
after it dies and the amount of blue-green algae observed in the
water so far has been minimal.</P>
      <P>"The public has no need to panic over the safety level of the
water despite the latest monitoring results," they said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the administration worked with National
Taiwan University in February to test for microcystis, commonly known
as "reservoir killers, " in reservoirs around Taiwan. Fourteen showed
signs of the algae.</P>
      <P>Seven small reservoirs in the outlying islands of Kinmen and
Matsu also have microcystis and Feitsui and Hsinshan reservoirs on
Taiwan proper have the algae, although the amount is small.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the reservoirs in the outlying islands
are confined by their natural environment. Their sizes are small and
their accumulated waters are more stagnant, making them susceptible
to being contaminated by pollution from farmland and household waste
water and rain, which is a prime breeding ground for microcystis.</P>
      <P>They advised the public to separate potable water or drink tap
water desalinated from the sea.</P>
      <P>They said that September will be a critical month since the
propagation of the algae will reach its zenith in summer and then
begin to die.</P>
      <P>The EPA has made plans to monitor the reservoirs in February,
May, September and November every year to ensure the safety of the
water, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's stock market had grown to NT$15
trillion ( US$475 billion) by the end of 2004, an increase of 131
percent over the past 10 years, according to the Directorate General
of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) of the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Total capital accounted for 148.07 percent of the nation's gross
domestic product (GDP) , up from the 1994 share of 101 percent, an
indication that the stock market has played an increasingly important
role in Taiwan's economy, the DGBAS said.</P>
      <P>It said the number of companies listed on the Taiwan Stock
Exchange (TAIEX) and the over-the-counter (OTC) market, as well as
their capital, have been increasing as corporations have been growing
in size, aided by government deregulation and an ever-transparent
flow of information.</P>
      <P>By the end of last year, 697 companies were listed on the TAIEX
and 466 on the OTC market, the former having a total capital of
NT$5.1 trillion and the latter NT$0.6 trillion.</P>
      <P>The capitalization on the TAIEX by the end of 2004 was NT$14
trillion, more than double that of a decade earlier. Combined with
the OTC market value, Taiwan's stock market had a total value of
NT$15.1 trillion, equivalent to 148 percent of its GDP.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS said Taiwan's economy has gradually climbed out of the
financial depression caused by the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis,
registering a yearly growth rate of 5.8 percent in 2000, when stock
market turnover reached NT$35 trillion.</P>
      <P>But starting in the last quarter of 2000, global high-tech
bubbles drove the economy down, dragging Taiwan's stock market
turnover down by 40 percent, to NT$20.7 trillion.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of 2004 the economy has turned around, and
Taiwan's stock market has fared better too. For example, the average
earnings per share (EPS) for the TAIEX and OTC companies reached

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) said
Tuesday the dispute over whether or not party members who have not
paid their membership dues will be eligible to vote for the party's
chairman has been sorted out.</P>
      <P>A proposal by the KMT organization and development committee
states that KMT members have an obligation to pay membership fees;
however, unless they have been disciplined by the party for
non-payment of dues, they can still vote even though they have not
paid their dues, according to KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng.</P>
      <P>"Those who have not been disciplined will be able to vote for
party chairman on July 16," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Although the party charter stipulates that only those who have
paid their membership dues are eligible to vote for the party's
chairman, the party will do all it can to contact the people who are
behind in their dues and ask them to pay up. If a person does not
then pay the dues owing, the party will mete out discipline -- the
maximum punishment being the suspension of that person's right to
vote on party matters.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Cheng Li-wen said that the party will ask local
chapters to pull out all the stops to get members pay their
membership dues, and also work out incentives to get as many party
members as possible to pay. </P>
      <P>Although the KMT boasts of over one million members, it is
believed that fewer than half pay their dues.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the two KMT vice chairmen vying for the party's top
job said Tuesday that they agreed with the compromise proposal to
expand the number of members going to the polls.</P>
      <P>But Legislator Wu Yu-sheng, a supporter of Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou and who originally advocated that only those who have paid
their membership dues should be allowed to vote, said that it is
still "not fair" to those who have paid their membership dues.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chuan-chiao, who backs legislative speaker Wang

    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) said Tuesday that if a party delegation visits China, it
will discuss Taiwan farming groups investing there and the rights of
Chinese fishermen working on Taiwan ships.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Tsai Sheng-chia said that a delegation he is
planning to organize will probably leave for China in the middle or
latter part of this month.</P>
      <P>Once he receives notification from China, Tsai said that he will
talk to the government on the fine points of cross-strait farming
policy, "mainly to see where the government's bottom line is."</P>
      <P>Tsai noted that the government has imposed a great deal of
restrictions on farming groups investing in China, and that although
the Council of Agriculture has promised to be supportive, the party
does not know the real attitude of the government.</P>
      <P>In addition, Tsai said that he will communicate with both sides

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT FARM EXCHANGES UNCERTAIN DESPITE BEIJING OVERTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Agricultural exchanges between Taiwan and
mainland China remain uncertain despite Beijing's offer to broaden
contacts and open mainland markets to Taiwan's farm products,
industry insiders and experts said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The issue has again become a focal point between the two sides
after Beijing came up with the overture at a time when its
Anti-Secession Law has poisoned the bilateral relationship. However,
experts pointed out that a host of uncertainties remain because
Taiwan and China differ in their motives and demands.</P>
      <P>China can provide cheap labor, vast land, abundant raw materials
and a huge market for Taiwan farmers who are bottlenecked by
increased difficulties after the island entered the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in Jan. 2002, but they warned of long-term risks,
such as technology flight to China and the reshipment of produce back
to Taiwan, a situation that might deal a crushing blow to the
domestic industry.</P>
      <P>Yuan Ming-jen, a consultant at a foundation affiliated with the
Mainland Affairs Council to serve mainland-based Taiwan businessmen,
opined that it would be much better for Taiwan farmers to set up
exploration bases in China with the assistance of the government
sector or farmers' associations. This would help give a new lease on
life for the domestic industry, he said.</P>
      <P>Kung Shih-ming, vice secretary-general of the Cross-Strait
Agricultural Association, is optimistic about the prospects for
bilateral agricultural cooperation because the two sides complement
each other. Exports to China could be a remedy for oversupply at
home, he said.</P>
      <P>Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Lee Chin-lung termed
Beijing's promise to offer preferential treatment to Taiwan farm
products as just paying lip service since the issue is complex and
now is the wrong time with the current cross-strait atmosphere being
what it is.</P>
      <P>Even if domestic goods are given greater access to the Chinese
market, Taiwan's national interests as a whole must take precedence
over all other matters, Lee stressed.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Chairman Lee Chien-chuan also called attention to the
issue regarding the reshipment of low-priced produce from China to
Taiwan despite its lucrative but volatile market.</P>
      <P>Tien Chun-mei, a researcher at the Chung-Hua Institution for
Economic Research, said that there is a large gap behind the two
sides' motives for promoting agricultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is willing to provide technical and managerial assistance
to China, while China is more interested in luring investment and
trade from Taiwan, she said, adding that the difference has resulted
in serious problems such as smuggling.</P>
      <P>Chien Lee-hsien, a professor at National Chung Hsing University,
pointed out that Beijing has begun using agricultural issues as an
approach to deal with Taiwan on the political front. But he pointed
out that only concrete measures count despite the fact that an
initial opening seems to be in place with a concerted move between
the central government in Beijing and local provincial authorities.</P>
      <P>If China resorts to using agriculture as a "bargaining chip" to
appease farmers in southern Taiwan, cross-strait exchanges in this
field will become much more complex in the future, observers said.</P>
      <P>In contrast to Taiwan's caution and reserve, China has been very
welcome to farm exports from Taiwan and Taiwan farmers settling in
China in as much as that would bring in capital and technology.</P>
      <P>Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said on March 14 following Beijing's
enactment of the Anti-Secession Law that China is willing to open its
markets to domestic farm produce, in particular those from southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Starting from April this year, Beijing's Ministry of Agriculture
will provide duty-free treatment to imports of 12 fruits from Taiwan,
including mangoes and bell fruit for sale in Beijing and Shanghai.
Southern Fujian province is also soon to allow fast customs clearance
for Taiwan agricultural imports.</P>
      <P>Taking mangoes for example, the two markets can take as much as
2,000 tons of the tropical fruit from Taiwan each year, creating
earnings of at least NT$80 million (US$2.6 million) for domestic
growers and helping resolve an oversupply in the home market,
relevant agricultural agencies estimated.</P>
      <P>During a recent China visit by main pposition Kuomintang Vice
Chairman P. K. Chiang, Chinese Communist Party officials also
promised to draft preferential policies for Taiwan agricultural goods
and expressed welcome to Taiwan farmers to settle in five provinces.</P>
      <P>Beijing officials said that they hope Taiwan can assist in
upgrading agriculture and introduce its food processing, warehousing,
transport and distribution know-how in China.</P>
      <P>Zhang Juan, a researcher at the Taiwan affairs study center under
the Beijing-based Tsinghua University, said Taiwan cultivated
tropical fruits and flowers are popular in the vast Chinese market,
especially during winter in northern regions where there is a great
demand for fruits and vegetable.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES OTHER PARTIES TO HONOR CONSTITUTIONAL REFORM PROMISE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmaker called on his colleagues from other political
parties Tuesday to make good on their campaign promise to pass a
constitutional amendment package on political reforms.</P>
      <P>Lai Ching-teh, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, pointed out
that completing the reforms was a promise shared by all parties
during the run-up to last year's legislative elections and that they
should not change their mind just because the elections are over.</P>
      <P>Lai made the call before the legislature's Organic Laws and
Statutes Committee is set to start reviewing a bill Thursday
governing the exercise of power of the ad hoc National Assembly,
which will be elected on May 14 for the sole purpose of considering
the constitutional amendment package adopted by the Legislative Yuan
with the support of all parties last August.</P>
      <P>Items in the package include reducing the number of legislative
seats from the present 225 to 113 and adopting a "single seat, two
votes" legislative electoral system starting with the seventh
legislature to be elected in 2007, as well as phasing out the
National Assembly to allow for popular referendums on future
constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) and Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) have recently reversed their support of the reform
package and proposed setting a high threshold for the passage of
constitutional amendments in the bill.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, partisan differences over the content of the
bill could stall and kill the constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>Inter-party consultations over the bill could take up to four
months, leaving the National Assembly delegates powerless after they
are elected.</P>
      <P>Also, Lai said the PFP's proposals asking for a vote requiring a
three-quarter majority for the passage of constitutional amendments
and a turnout rate of at least 50 percent for the National Assembly
elections are both likely to block the constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the issue, Tseng Yung-chuan, head of the opposition
Kuomintang's (KMT) Policy Committee, said his party believes
constitutional amendments should be considered passed if they are
endorsed by at least half of the National Assembly delegates.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-pin, convener of the PFP legislative caucus, said the
PFP insists that a three-quarter threshold be set for the passage of
constitutional amendments and that the amendments should be voted on
as a package, rather than individually.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TSU legislative caucus convener Lo Chih-ming said the
TSU supports adopting a three-quarter threshold for the passage of
constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>Lo said his party is in favor of all of the amendments with the
exception of the "single seat, two votes" system and it will have to
vote against the package if no individual votes are allowed for the
amendments.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP CHAIRMAN VOWS TO COMMUNICATE WITH PRESIDENT ON CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  5  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong said Tuesday he will communicate with President
Chen Shui-bian and opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan on
relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Soong made the remarks after heading a group of PFP public office
holders to pay tribute to the late President Chiang Kai-shek at his
interim mausoleum at Tzuhu in Taoyuan County to mark Tomb-Sweeping
Day and the 30th anniversary of Chiang's death.</P>
      <P>In reply to a media inquiry about whether he plans to visit China
in the near future, Soong said cross-strait relations are very
complicated and delicate.</P>
      <P>Noting that it takes two to tango, Soong said forging
cross-strait rapprochement requires concerted efforts from both sides
of the Strait.</P>
      <P>While the KMT failed to resolve the cross-strait political
dispute during its 55-year rule of Taiwan, Soong said, the current
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration also has had a hard
time achieving a breakthrough to the lingering impasse.</P>
      <P>For its part, Soong said, the PFP will promote cross-strait
reconciliation with the common well-being of the people on both sides
as its ultimate goal. In the process, Soong said, the PFP will see to
it that Taiwan's dignity should never be compromised.</P>
      <P>"What matters is not which party visits China first. The most
important thing lies in the purpose or functions of the visit. What
we want is not courteous treatment to be granted by Beijing. What
really matters is the Republic of China's national dignity, " Soong
said.</P>
      <P>While receiving a KMT delegation in Beijing last week, senior
Chinese officials publicly invited the two top leaders of Taiwan's
opposition "pan-blue alliance" -- KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP
Chairman James Soong -- to visit China at times of their convenience.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien has said he is more than willing to visit
China, but he added that the timing is still being considered.</P>
      <P>Soong said he will communicate with President Chen and Lien in
the coming week over cross-strait issues. Nevertheless, Soong stopped
short of mentioning whether he would hold face-to-face talks with
Chen and Lien over cross-strait topics.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, DPP administration officials have
expressed the hope that Soong can visit China under the government's
authorization. Without the government's prior approval, Soong's China
visit would be of a completely private nature just like the KMT
delegation's just-concluded visit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a DPP official lauded Soong Tuesday for his recent
remarks that the government, not any single political party, should
play the leading role in formulating cross-strait policy and
strategies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Those in the non-private sector will have
to start reporting to the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) this month on how it is dealing with its waste in accordance
with current regulations.</P>
      <P>The EPA said that some 5,000 companies and institutions subject to
the regulations will have to file reports online as to how and where
they are disposing of their waste.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said the new regulations will include the
construction sector, medical institutions, college laboratories,
universities and research institutes that produce hazardous waste,
photo shops, laundries, the environmental monitoring collection
sector, the plating and printing sectors and wholesale markets of
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the waste produced from the construction
sector and medical institutions have often been dumped on roadsides,
along riverbeds or on hillsides, which has hampered traffic and
polluted the environment.</P>
      <P>This is why the EPA has put the construction sector, hospitals,
dialysis clinics and smaller clinics on their priority list for
regulation, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They also said that with the expansion of the regulations and
vigorous monitoring, the amount of waste reported grew by 12.2
percent from the previous year to reach 1.52 million tons in 2004.

    <HEADLINE>TECO GROUP SEEKS TO BUILD BRAND NAME IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 5 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The TECO Group, a conglomerate dealing in a
variety of electrical products, will either introduce its own name in
China, or buy established international brands to get a toe-hold in
the Chinese market, TECO Chairman Theodore M.H. Huang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Pointing the seriousness the company attaches to this project,
Huang said that only two Taiwanese businesses, TECO and the Aurora
Group -- a leading provider of office automation equipment in Taiwan
-- have constructed large neon ads in Pudong, the commercial area of
China's largest city, Shanghai.</P>
      <P>However, Huang admitted that it's not easy to build a brand name
in an emerging market, adding that the work requires a huge amount of
investment and needs time to achieve. Therefore, he noted, he will
also seek to take a "short cut, " meaning purchasing a well-known
international brand name.</P>
      <P>For example, Huang said, by founding TECO-Westinghouse Motor
Company after acquiring Westinghouse Motor of the United State in
1995, TECO Group made successful inroads into the Southeast Asian
market.</P>
      <P>TECO was founded in 1956 as an industrial motor-maker, named TECO
Electric and Machinery Co., Ltd. Over the years, it has successfully
diversified into a conglomerate with a broad spectrum of business
operations in heavy electrics, home appliances, telecommunications
equipment, information technology systems, electromechanical
components, commercial electronics, stock holdings, and even
eateries.</P>
      <P>TECO introduced Mos Burger to Taiwan from Japan years ago and has
taken a portion of the market share from the dominant fast food
businesses in Taiwan, McDonald's, Huang said. He believes the fact
that rice hamburgers fit local people's dining habits and better
management are the key to Mos Burger's success.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that the TECO group has about 30 subsidiaries
and affiliates across Asia, America and Europe, and employs tens of
thousands of people, Huang, also a gourmet, said he keeps a close eye
on the operations of the Mos Burger chain and is considering
expanding to China and Southeast Asia.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing, April 5 (CNA)
(By Chen-yi Liao/S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tuesday marks the first Tomb-Sweeping Day
since former Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang
died on Jan. 17, but his family did not have to go to a cemetery to
pay their respects as they have kept his ashes at home after
disagreeing with Chinese authorities over where to bury him.</P>
      <P>Chinese authorities have asked Zhao's family to bury him along
with officials at the director-general level -- much lower than what
he had been -- at Babao Cemetery, rather than where Chinese party
leaders are usually interned.</P>
      <P>Zhao's family, saying that that would be "quite inappropriate, "
decided to keep his ashes at his Beijing home and "wait for a while"
before making a decision.</P>
      <P>So on Tuesday, Zhao's kinsmen decorated his study at No. 6
Fuqiang Alley in Beijing with his photo and two couplets that read
"We [family members] are proud of you for having promoted democracy
and for your conscientiousness; now that you are gone and free, your
style will forever be remembered" and "It's our unchanging choice to
support your decisions; it's our lifetime honor to be your children."</P>
      <P>Since Zhao's house had been closely watched as April 5
approached, many of his friends and relatives came to pay their
respects ahead of the holiday celebrated by the Chinese to honor the
memories of their departed relatives and to clean their gravesites.</P>
      <P>Tian Jiyun, a former deputy chairman of the National People's
Congress, was one of the mourners. He left a calligraphy that said:
"Three generations of the Tian Jiyun family" before saying good-bye
to Zhao's kinsmen.</P>
      <P>Zhao's daughter, Wang Yannan, said her family was willing to
accept offerings of respect from anyone, but judging from people
coming to Fuqiang Alley Tuesday morning, Beijing still was banning
the general public from paying tribute to Zhao Ziyang.</P>
      <P>So the daughter, Zhao Erjun, Zhao Sijun and other family members
performed their own rituals before planting a Chinese magnolia in the
garden outside of Zhao's study.</P>
      <P>"The white magnolia symbolizes my father's pure personality, so
every year, when the flowers begins to bloom, it will be time to
remember him," the daughter said.</P>
      <P>She said her family has not yet had any further discussion with
Chinese officials over where to bury Zhao. "This is an unsettled
question that may need to be addressed in the future. Still, we have
to wait and see."</P>
      <P>Zhao's wife, Liang Boqi, has not been told of her husband's death
because the children are worried that the news would upset her too
much, given her frail health. She is staying at a seniors facility.</P>

      <P>The ratio of single-parent families to the
total number of local households has increased and more mothers now
play the role of breadwinner, according to tallies released Tuesday

(DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Quoting the findings of the DGBAS survey of household income and
expenditure in 2003, statisticians said many local mothers are not
just homemakers, but rather breadwinners.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS report, Taiwan had 6.96 million households
in 2003, 573,000 of which were single-parent families, or 8.2 percent
of the total. The ratio marked a 1.2 percent rise from the 1997
level.</P>
      <P>Among single-parent families, 52.8 percent were financially
supported by mothers, compared to 47.2 percent supported by fathers.</P>
      <P>In contrast, male breadwinners accounted for 78.8 percent of

      <P>According to the survey, 22.7 percent of the breadwinners in
single-parent families were college graduates or higher degree
holders, falling 5 percent below the percentage for overall
households.</P>
      <P>Of the 573,000 single-parent families, 318,000 were financially
supported by parents and the remaining 255,000 were supported by
children.</P>
      <P>Among parent-supported single-parent families, female
breadwinners accounted for 72.1 percent, up 3.1 percent from the 1997
level. Meanwhile, 50.2 percent of breadwinners in this type of family
had education level below junior high school and their average
monthly household income was NT$53,000, falling below the average
income of overall local households by NT$15,000.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 169,000 single-parent families had children under 18
years of age, with 44,000 featuring male breadwinners, roughly same
as the 1997 level. By comparison, this category of family with the
mother as breadwinner increased 26,000 from the 1997 level. The
average monthly household income of this family bracket was only
NT$44,000 and children's education spending accounted for 19.4
percent of total income.</P>
      <P>Among single-parent families with children as breadwinners, the

the Red Cross Society, being the designated recipient.</P>
      <P>Hau said that he was on business trip in Hong Kong when his

Taipei with no return address.</P>
      <P>Although stunned, Hau said he has always had faith in others, and
believes that the donation "must be true, " The bank informed him
that the money was deposited into the bank account Monday.</P>
      <P>The Red Cross Society has wanted to say thank you to the person

Wall Street Journal: Morgan Stanley Plans to Spin Off Discover

executives, said it is looking to spin off its Discover credit- card
unit -- a business built by Chief Executive Philip Purcell. The move,
an abou t-face by the company, was one of several steps announced
late yesterday that signaled an effort to quell the turmoil around
Purcell's leadership and performance.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR INTENDS TO VISIT CHINA AFTER ENDING MAYORAL TERM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday he
does not rule out the possibility of visiting China after concluding
his mayoral term in 2006.</P>
      <P>Ma divulged his intention while videotaping an interview with
Sisy Chen, a TV talk show host, in the afternoon. </P>
      <P>Under current regulations, Ma said, he cannot visit China in his
capacity as Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, I can't accompany Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
on his planned China visit in the near future, " said Ma, who is also
a KMT vice chairman.</P>
      <P>Ma is currently vying with Legislative Yuan speaker Wang
Jin-pyng, another KMT vice chairman, for the opposition party's
chairmanship.</P>
      <P>"If I manage to win the KMT chairmanship in July, I would be
willing to visit China in my capacity as the top KMT leader after
ending my mayoral term," Ma said, adding that a prerequisite for his
China visit would be that the trip would have to be conducive to
Taiwan's development and peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He further said he believes that Lien's overture that Taiwan
should refrain from pursuing independence while China should renounce
the use of force against Taiwan can serve as the bedrock for a viable
framework for peaceful cross-strait engagements.</P>
      <P>Touching on the KMT chairmanship race, Ma said that if he wins
the election, he will fully cooperate with Wang in running KMT
headquarters, including policy formulation and personnel
appointments.</P>
      <P>Ma also said he will continue to employ incumbent party workers
appointed during Lien's chairmanship if he wins the July election.</P>
      <P>KMT rank-and-file members are scheduled to elect the party
chairman July 16.</P>

(By Wayne Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Customizable personal Websites have become
the latest popular hangout for Internet surfers, according to a
survey by the Taiwan-based portal Youthwant.</P>
      <P>Internet portal giants such as Yahoo have begun to offer free
upgrades to their online storage services, allowing surfers to create
their own personalized websites.</P>
      <P>Although creating a Website may not be a novelty for experienced
Internet users, last year saw the rise of blogs in Taiwan. Blogging,
which has been extremely popular elsewhere in the world for many
years, offers interactive features that turns such sites into
"virtual lounge bars," the portal claimed.</P>
      <P>Blogs are usually a combination of Internet services, including
message boards, photo albums and sometimes even a chatroom. Blogs not
only allow users to keep journals or diaries online, but those who
browse them can also leave comments or questions, creating an
interactive environment for both friends and strangers. The
anonymous, interactive and boundless characteristics of blogging
cater to the needs of those who are too shy to reveal their
identities on the Web, as well as those who are bold enough to
express themselves in cyberspace,</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, what differentiates blogging from the
old-fashioned, text-only personal websites is the ability to permit
users to complement their sites by adding photos, which, courtesy of
the affordability of digital cameras, eventually create uniqueness.</P>
      <P>According to the Youthwant survey, 87 percent of Taiwanese
students have at least once browsed an online photo album, while 56
percent of them maintain their own.</P>
      <P>Yahoo's recent US$40 million purchase of Flickr, a Canada-based
online photo sharing service with over 5 million photos stored in its
database, shows how promising it sees the market for personalized
Websites, even though Yahoo already has a photo album service.</P>
      <P>While a growing number of cyberspace lounge bars are being
created each day, this popular hangout place is also quietly morphing
into a bloody battleground for the dot-com's.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Members of a Hong Kong labor group
staged a demonstration in the special administrative region Tuesday
to protest against what they called Beijing's manipulation of an
upcoming by-election for region's chief executive.</P>
      <P>According to the protesters from the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade
Union Council, reports that acting chief executive Donald Tsang has
been designated by Beijing as the next leader have discouraged other
candidates who were interested in running for the post and have
undermined the fairness of the election.</P>
      <P>The government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's
plan to request the National People's Congress (NPC) of China to make
a legal interpretation concerning the term of the next chief
executive also indicates that the by-election is being manipulated by
Beijing, the protesters said.</P>
      <P>They claimed that the situation could threaten the autonomy of
Hong Kong and turn the by-election into a farce.</P>
      <P>An electoral college in Hong Kong is set to elect a new chief
executive July 10 to fill the position left vacant by Tung Chee Hwa,
who resigned last month.</P>
      <P>The government of Hong Kong reportedly is planning to request the
NPC Wednesday to issue an interpretation on whether the new chief
executive will serve out the remainder of Tung's term until 2007 or
get another five-year mandate.</P>
      <P>However, the majority of people in Hong Kong have demanded that a
popular vote be held to elect the chief executive.</P>
      <P>According to a vote held among students of the University of Hong
Kong between March 30 and April 1, 69 percent of the 2,100 students
taking part in the vote are in favor of a general election for chief
executive starting from 2007, compared with 24 percent who are
against the idea.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WOMEN'S GROUP TO PROTEST AGAINST TSU HEAD'S VISIT TO JAPANESE SHRINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A women's group that has assisted Taiwan
women and children forced by the Japanese imperial army into sexual
slavery in military brothels during World War II said Tuesday that it
will launch a drive to protest against the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), whose chairman concluded a visit the previous
day to a controversial Japanese Shinto Shrine honoring Japan's war
dead, including many executed war criminals.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation (TWRF) said it plans to
launch a letter, telephone, fax and email campaign to the TSU to
express their indignation. It will also link up with other social
welfare groups to protest against the TSU.</P>
      <P>At issue is the pro-Taiwan independence TSU Chairman Su
Chin-chiang's visit to the Yashukuni Shrine Monday.</P>
      <P>Lai Tsai-er, director of the foundation's department of
international affairs, noted that the demands by "comfort women" --
as the World War II sex slaves are euphemistically known -- for
compensation have fallen on the deaf ears of the Japanese government,
and she said she could not understand why the TSU head would want to
visit the shrine.</P>
      <P>Lai said that Asian countries who have cooperated with the
foundation over the years have also inquired why any Taiwanese would
want to pay tribute by visiting the shrine.</P>
      <P>" I could only explain that this was the action of just a very
few people," Lai said.</P>
      <P>She said some of the surviving comfort women have also phoned the
foundation to complain about the insensitivity of Su's visit.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, a legislator from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), earlier Tuesday demanded an explanation from
Su for the visit, while Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition
Kuomintang said Su should apologize.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that whether or not Taiwan people were forced into the
Japanese army during the war, Japan was fighting an "unjust war" and
pro-unification or pro-Taiwan independence political parties should
not visit the shrine.</P>
      <P>Su is the first Taiwan political party head to visit the shrine,
and his visit immediately sparked criticism at home. Aboriginal
Legislator May Chin of the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union accused Su
of glorifying Japan's militarism in the early 20th century and its
bloody and brutal campaign against Taiwan's aboriginal people during
the colonial rule of the island from 1895 to 1945. Chin likened Su's
visit to Jews worshipping the Nazis.</P>
      <P>Su responded by urging people to put aside historical feuds and
hatred to pursue peace, adding that his visit was to pay tribute to
the 28,000 recruited Taiwanese who died in war and housed in the
shrine as well as the Japanese who died for their country.</P>
      <P>Visits by Asian leaders to the shrine in central Tokyo have been
extremely rare, but military envoys and attaches from countries in
other regions around the world have often paid visits. Japanese Prime
Minister Junichiro Koizumi's visits to the shrine have caused tension
with its neighboring counties, particularly China and South Korea.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
Chairman Su Chin-chiang said Tuesday that Taiwan and Japan should
strengthen cooperation in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks upon his return from a visit to Japan where
he attended the inaugural ceremony for the party's chapter in Japan
and a meeting of an association composed of Japanese supporters of
former ROC President Lee Teng-hui, the TSU's so-called "spiritual
leader."</P>
      <P>During his visit, Su said he held extensive talks with Japanese
parliamentarians, scholars, defense officials and experts on the
Taiwan Strait issues in the wake of China's enactment of its
so-called anti-secession law that codifies its longtime threat to
attack Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Su said Japanese politicians and academics have expressed strong
concern about the Taiwan Strait security and stability in the face of
China's fast military buildup and expansionism.</P>
      <P>"My visit was fruitful. We have reached a consensus with many
Japanese lawmakers that a Taiwan-Japan security cooperation meeting
will be held alternately in Taipei and Tokyo in the future to hammer
out common strategies against China," Su said.</P>
      <P>Su also defended his visit to a controversial Japanese Shinto
shrine in Tokyo Monday, saying that his visit was aimed at paying
tribute to the 28,000-plus Taiwanese soldiers who died fighting for
the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II when Taiwan was under
Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>Su is one of only a few senior Asian political figures ever to
visit the Yasukuni Shrine, which is dedicated to 2.5 million war
dead, including some convicted war criminals. His visit immediately
drew criticism at home.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, Su said, the biggest threat to Taiwan's security mainly
comes from China, not Japan and China should be blamed for its
militarism.</P>
      <P>Su said his visit to the shrine was arranged by the TSU's
Japanese chapter chief, not Taiwan's representative office in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TSU Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming claimed that
local people need not continue harboring hostility toward Japan
because of its past militarism.</P>
      <P>"At present, the biggest threat to Taiwan's security comes from
China. It's very regrettable that pro-unification people have seldom
criticized China's missile threat against us and have instead
continued to bash Japan for its historical mistake," Chen said.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) unveiled Tuesday its latest energy-saving
technology, claiming that it uses up to 40 percent less power.</P>
      <P>ITRI Executive Vice President Chu Hsin-sen said the new
technology, called "Energy Electronic Technology, " can efficiently
manage energy consumption and reduce emissions. Air conditioners
using the technology can use 30 percent - 40 percent less energy,
which in Taiwan's sub-tropical climate could mean great savings on
energy.</P>
      <P>The new technology, developed by the nation's leading technology
institute, was born in the face of the Kyoto Protocol, an agreement
that came into effect in February against global climate change by
restricting each country's energy consumption. Taiwan ranks 22nd in
the emissions category, accounting for 1 percent of world's total
output.</P>
      <P>The institute also displayed some applications of the new
technology in its Hsinchu headquarters in northern Taiwan, including
inverters, system integration, high-efficiency illumination and

    <HEADLINE>EVERGREEN MARINE SETTLES OIL DISCHARGE CASE IN U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Evergreen Marine Corp. said Tuesday that it
has agreed to pay US$25 million to settle a case in relation to
illegal oil discharges in U.S. waters and will work with the U.S.
government on the execution of an environmental project over a
probation period over the next three years.</P>
      <P>Evergreen said that the case was caused by the dereliction of
duty by a few crewmembers and was not the result of an authorization
of the company or its policy.</P>
      <P>Some of the 10 crewmembers involved in the case had already quit,
while others were being transferred back to company headquarters to
receive more training.</P>
      <P>Evergreen will strengthen the training for its crewmembers so
that they will rigorously follow standard procedure in handling oil
discharges, Evergreen said.</P>
      <P>At issue was a U.S. government probe March 4, 2001, after the
discovery of an oil discharge in the Columbia River in the West Coast
U.S. state of Washington. The U.S. Coast Guard traced the spill to
Ever Group, a container vessel managed by Evergreen Marine Corp.</P>
      <P>The company said that to avoid the squandering of unnecessary
manpower and resources on long legal litigation, it began to discuss
the matter with the U.S. Justice Department in the first half of 2004
and recently reached a plea agreement.</P>
      <P>Evergreen stressed that the case will not have any effect on the
normal operation of the company's fleet, its mooring in U.S. harbors,
or the cargo the company takes in and out of U.S. harbors.</P>
      <P>The company said that global marine environmental protection is
crucial and that it will work with port authorities of other nations,
introduce a professional auditing system to strengthen vessel
regulation, and sail new vessels built according to the "greenship
concept."</P>
      <P>Evergreen will take delivery of the new vessels starting this

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES SHOULD ABIDE BY LAW: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian convened a major
meeting Tuesday in which the participants reached a seven-point
conclusion, including that cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges should abide
by the law.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general of the Presidential Office and one
of the participants in the meeting, said Chen invited officials from
the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to the meeting in view of the latest
cross-strait political and economic development, including a visit to
China by a vice chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) in the
wake of the passage of China's Anti-Secession Law March 14.</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang reached a 10-point consensus with
Chen Yunlin, director of Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office, during his
March 28-April 1 visit, which covered a wide range of issues,
including cross-strait transportation, agriculture, protection of
China-based Taiwan businessmen, the rights of Chinese fishermen
working on Taiwan fishing vessels, and further easing of China's
financial market.</P>
      <P>The participants in the meeting concluded that cross-strait
affairs are related to the national sovereignty and the exercise
of the government's authority. No political parties, groups or
individuals have the right to represent the Taiwan people or replace
the government's authority.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait exchanges should abide by the law and anyone who
reaches agreement with foreign governments, the other side of the
Taiwan Strait or the envoys they dispatch will be dealt with
according to the law by related agencies.</P>
      <P>Other conclusions reached by the participants included that the
overall interests of the nation and the wellbeing of the people are
above the interests of political parties, especially cross-strait
contacts, dialogue and consultation, which should require prior
consensus among the political parties and the general public for the
maximum interests of the nation.</P>
      <P>Chen is willing to meet with leaders from the ruling and
opposition parties so as to avoid a craze of "China fever"
undermining Taiwan's dignity and interests.</P>
      <P>The participants pointed out that the biggest difference between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is not about separate rule, but
democracy vs. authoritarianism. If Beijing really wants to close the
gap between the peoples on both sides, it should not try to lure
Taiwan with small favors under its undemocratic system.</P>
      <P>As a rising power, Beijing should seriously consider that it
should serve as the keeper of international peace and not an
intimidator who uses non-peaceful means to sabotage the international
order.</P>
      <P>Only the 23 million people of Taiwan have the right to decide the
fate of the nation and that the Beijing authorities should address
and respect the will of the majority of people on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait differences should be resolved peacefully through
dialogue and that the choice of the Taiwan people under free will
should be respected. The Taiwan people adamantly oppose China's

    <HEADLINE>KMT TO COOPERATE WITH ANY INVESTIGATIONS INTO LEGALITY OF CHINA VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will fully
cooperate with any investigations that the administration may launch
into the legality of the recent visit to mainland China by a KMT
delegation, KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who led the delegation to China March 28-April 1 and
reached a 10-point consensus with the Beijing leadership, said that
he and the KMT understand the existing Statute Governing the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area
and would not violate the law by any means.</P>
      <P>He said the Democratic Progressive Party administration has
the right to investigate the matter and that the KMT would fully
cooperate with any such investigations.</P>
      <P>Local newspapers reported Wednesday that law enforcement
authorities may take legal action against the KMT for the China visit
and could soon start investigations.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian met with officials from the DPP, the
Presidential Office and the Executive Yuan Tuesday night. The meeting
was aimed at clarifying the government's position on cross-Taiwan
Strait issues in the face of visits to China by domestic political
leaders, particularly those of the opposition camp, according to Ker
Chien-ming, director of the DPP's policy committee.</P>
      <P>President Chen reportedly said during the meeting that Taiwan
will descend into anarchy should the government fail to take action
in the face of the current situation.</P>
      <P>A seven-point conclusion was reached at the meeting, including
that all cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges should be in line with the
law.</P>
      <P>Responding to the conclusions, KMT Secretary-General Lin
Feng-cheng said that the KMT welcomes the DPP administration to
take legal action against the KMT for the China visit.</P>
      <P>Lin called for the DPP not to continue making themselves into "a
laughingstock" by questioning the legality of efforts to defend
Taiwan and protect the interests of the people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chiang also said that the rationale behind the KMT's
mission to China was to seek cross-Taiwan Strait peace, as well as
long-term, healthy economic development for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that peace and prosperity are inextricably linked, Chiang
said that "Taiwan's economic development hinges on investment, that
investment hinges on confidence, and that confidence hinges on
cross-strait peace."</P>
      <P>As a major opposition party in Taiwan, the KMT is responsible for
pushing for peace across the strait so that Taiwan's economy can be
revived, Chiang claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOH HEAD ACTIVELY DRUMS UP SUPPORT FOR TAIWAN'S WHA BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, April 5 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's top health official
said Tuesday that medical and health experts attending the World
Medical Forum understand and support Taiwan's bid for observer status
in the World Health Assembly (WHA), the highest decision-making body
of the World Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Hou Sheng-mou, minister of the Department of Health under the
Executive Yuan, who is also attending the two-day forum being held in
Zurich, Switzerland April 4-6, said the experts also agreed that
health is a "fundamental human right" which should be separated from
politics.</P>
      <P>He said he explained to medical and health professionals and
experts from other countries at the meeting that Taiwan's
participation in the global health system will not only benefit the
people of the island, but also the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>Almost all the participants in the forum agreed with Taiwan's WHA
bid to be included in the world health body, saying that health
should be separated from politics as it is a fundamental human right.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the DOH head preferred to remain low key on the
issue of Taiwan's bid to participate in this year's WHA meeting,
which is set to begin May 16 in Geneva, saying that it is for the
ROC's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to respond to relevant questions.</P>
      <P>Asked about China's willingness expressed recently to assist in
having Taiwan participate in the WHA's technical affairs, Hou said
that he has not received any messages on the matter.</P>
      <P>Hou is expected to visit some other European countries after the
conclusion of the forum to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with
medical institutions in those countries. This is Hou's first visit to
Europe since becoming the DOH head.</P>
      <P>A total of 150 professionals and experts attended discussions
of the forum on the themes of the impact of modern medical technology
on medical care services and medical and health insurance systems in
various countries around the world.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP, KMT SHOULD COOPERATE TO PASS NATIONAL ASSEMBLY STATUTE: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker
said Wednesday the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should
cooperate with his party to facilitate passage of a draft statute
governing the operations of the mission-oriented National Assembly.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lin Hung-che made the appeal after three lesser
opposition parties -- the People Fist Party (PFP) , the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) and the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU)
-- called for a second look at the legislature-approved
constitutional amendments package to be put up for endorsement by the
soon-to-be-elected National Assembly.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the PFP and the TSU intend to push for changing
the provision in the Cabinet -proposed draft NA operations statute
regarding the number of National Assembly members needed to pass the
legislature-approved constitutional amendments package from a simple
majority of members to three quarters of the members.</P>
      <P>Lin said he believes that the PFP and the TSU want to veto the
critical amendment package by setting such a high threshold.</P>
      <P>Noting that the package passed by the Legislative Yuan last
August is crucial to domestic legislative and political reforms, Lin
said the DPP and the KMT, which jointly control more than 70 percent
of legislative seats, should cooperate to ensure the passage of the
version of the National Assembly statute that requires only a simple
majority for the endorsement of the constitutional amendments
package.</P>
      <P>The package includes halving the number of legislative seats to
113, changing the legislative electoral system to a "single seat, two
ballots" system, abolishing the mission-oriented National Assembly,
and enshrining the referendum system into the Constitution.</P>
      <P>As the "single seat, two ballots" electoral system adopted in the
package may hinder the development of small parties, the PFP, the TSU
and the NPSU have backpedaled on their previous support for the
package.</P>
      <P>The legislature is scheduled to screen six versions of the NA
operations statute proposed by the government and various political
parties Thursday. It remains uncertain whether the draft statute can
be included into the legislature's work agenda for the coming week.
If the draft statute cannot be enacted in time, the mission-oriented
National Assembly to be elected May 14 will be unable to operate.</P>
      <P>A total of 300 National Assembly members will be elected in
accordance with a proportional system, with voters required to vote
for political parties or legally registered groups composed of at
least 20 members instead of individual candidates.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian would like to meet
with leaders of the nation's various political parties for summits on
a prospective spate of China visits which may result in harm to
Taiwan's dignity and interests, a top presidential aide said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun noted that he
will start planning for the summit meetings between President Chen
and the leaders of the various opposition parties soon after
consulting with the president on the precise times and agenda of the
meetings.</P>
      <P>On who President Chen may meet first, Yu said that the president
will remain open on this issue.</P>
      <P>President Chen met with officials from the ruling Democratic

      <P>The conclusions stressed that national interests and the people's
welfare should always come before political parties' interests and
personal gain.</P>
      <P>According to the conclusions, there should be no contact,
dialogue or negotiations by Taiwan's political parties with the
Chinese authorities without consensus between the ruling and the
opposition parties in advance for the sake of safeguarding the
interests of the country as well as its people.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER OPPOSES LIFTING OF E.U. ARMS SALES BAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin, April 5 (CNA)
(By Y.L. Lin and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer has
publicly voiced his stance against German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder's China policy by saying in an interview that he opposes a
lifting of the European Union's arms sales ban against China.</P>
      <P>Fischer, who is a member of the Green Party, which is part of the
German coalition government, said in the interview with the German
nationwide weekly "Die Zeit" that Schroeder knows that he has his
doubts about the matter and his party also has doubts about the E.U.
plan to lift the ban. The interview will appear in the weekly's April
6 issue.</P>
      <P>Since Schroeder reiterated recently that his stance in support of
a lifting of the arms sales ban remains unchanged despite opposition
from most of the German lawmakers, the German media and political
circles have awaited clarification from Fischer on his stance on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Almost all the German political parties, including the Green
Party, consider that this is not the right time to lift the E.U. ban
as Beijing has recently enacted an anti-secession law authorizing the
use of force against Taiwan in certain situations.</P>
      <P>The Green Party on Monday also urged Schroeder not to continue to
work for a lifting of the E.U. arms sales ban, saying that Beijing's
anti-secession law and its aggressive manner toward Taiwan do not
qualify it to request that the E.U. lift the ban.</P>
      <P>Fischer also requested those who support a lifting of the ban to
make concessions, saying that those who want to reach a consensus
must shorten their distance with those who oppose a lifting of the
ban. "Only by doing this, can doubts be removed," he added.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that foreign ministers of the E.U. countries can only
lift the ban by a unanimous vote, Fischer said that Beijing's human
rights record, regional stability, the E.U. code of conduct for arms
exports and U.S. opinions toward a lifting of the ban should be taken
into consideration before lifting the ban.</P>
      <P>The minister also made an assessment of the Taiwan Strait
situation, saying that there had been positive developments,
including the inauguration of special cross-strait flights during the
Lunar New Year period, prior to Beijing's enactment of the
anti-secession law.</P>

      <P>Judicial authorities are investigating
whether opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang has
violated any laws by reaching a consensus with Beijing authorities
during his recent visit to China, Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At a session of the legislature's Judiciary Committee, Shih noted
that a person can be charged with treason according to the Criminal
Code for agreeing secretly with a foreign government on matters
requiring the authorization of the government. Those charged with
such a crime could face a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, he
added.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, the term "agreeing" means coming to terms on
substantial items, either verbally or in writing, but he added that
this does not include exchanges of views and discussions of some
common ideals.</P>
      <P>Shih stressed that private individuals or groups, without the
government's authorization, are prohibited from forging agreements
with foreign governments, and he urged the public to pay attention to
this legal restriction.</P>
      <P>As far as the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People
of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area is concerned, visits to
China by private individuals or groups are not in violation of the
law as long as the visits do not involve government or political
matters, he explained.</P>
      <P>The minister said prosecutors will look into Chiang's case to see
whether his act constitutes a crime.</P>
      <P>Chiang led a KMT delegation to China last week and reached a
10-point consensus with Beijing officials on a wide range of issues
including cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights, agricultural
cooperation, protection for China-based Taiwanese businesspeople,
tourism, journalistic exchanges and the opening of the Chinese
financial market.</P>
      <P>The Public Prosecutors' Office of the Taiwan High Court on
Wednesday assigned prosecutor Chu Chia-chi to probe into the case
after accepting a treason lawsuit filed by the public against Chiang
last Friday.</P>
      <P>A group of politicians in Tainan also lodged a lawsuit with the
Tainan District Prosecutors' Office last Friday, accusing Chiang of
violating the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of
tha Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>According to the statute, civic organizations that reach an
agreement with China on issues concerning government or political
matters without the authorization of government can be fined up to
NT$2 million (US$63,492) , and if the offense is considered very
serious, a prison sentence of up to five years can be handed down.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA TO LAUNCH NEW DIPLOMATIC ASSAULT TO FURTHER ISOLATE TAIWAN: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China is set to launch a new wave of
schemes on the diplomatic front aimed at stealing away all of
Taiwan's diplomatic allies, a source from the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) legislative caucus claimed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Beijing may launch the diplomatic assault in September aimed at
rounding up all of Taiwan's 25 diplomatic allies and "forcing" them
to sever formal relations with Taiwan, said Chen Ching-chun, a DPP
party whip at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>After all the diplomatic allies forsake Taiwan and Taiwan's
international maneuvering chain is smashed, Beijing will be able to
force all the United Nations members to recognize the "one China"
policy and that Taiwan is part of China, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>He quoted President Chen Shui-bian as saying at a meeting the day
before that Taiwan is facing unprecedentedly harsh challenges now,
with Beijing increasingly tightening its grip on Taiwan in the
international diplomatic arena.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he said, Taiwan's opposition parties
should cooperate with the ruling DPP to help forge cross-strait
rapprochement for the benefit of people on both sides of the strait,
rather than paying visits to China one after another to win favor
from the Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>Chen was referring to the recent visit to China by opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang March 28-April 1, during
which Chiang reached a 10-point consensus with the Beijing
leadership.</P>
      <P>Chiang's China visit could open a Pandora's box of more visits to
Beijing by opposition leaders, including KMT Chairman Lien Chan and
People First Party Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>At Tuesday's meeting, President Chen and officials from the DPP
and the DPP administration agreed that national interests and the
people's welfare should always come before political parties'
interests and personal gain.</P>
      <P>A seven-point conclusion was reached at the meeting, including
that all cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges should be in line with the
law. As a result, the DPP administration might even launch
investigations into the legality of the recent visit to China by
Chiang and the KMT group.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT FARM TRADE SHOULD BE CONDUCTED UNDER WTO FRAMEWORK: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Agricultural exchanges between Taiwan and
mainland China should be conducted under the framework of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) as both sides of the Taiwan Strait are
members of the world trade regulatory body, officials from the
Council of Agriculture (COA) reiterated Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level COA is not opposed to private agricultural
exchanges across the Taiwan Strait if the trade or exchanges involve
no public authority exercise of power, such as customs tariffs and
quarantine, the COA officials said.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan farm products heading to China have to pass through
customs tariffs and quarantine, the trade should not be conducted
without approval by government offices or prior negotiations between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait by government-authorized
intermediary bodies such as the Straits Exchange Foundation, the
officials noted.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian met with officials from the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, the Presidential Office and the
Executive Yuan at his residence Tuesday to discuss Taiwan's situation
in light of Beijing's enactment of an anti-secession law targeting
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen reportedly said during the meeting that Taiwan is facing
unprecedentedly harsh challenges now and that the country will
descend into anarchy should the government fail to take action in the
face of the current situation, including a recent visit to Beijing by
opposition Kuomintang Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang that he made without
notifying the administration in advance.</P>
      <P>A seven-point conclusion was reached at the meeting, including
that all cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges should be in line with the
law.</P>
      <P>The conclusions stressed that national interests and the people's
welfare should always come before political parties' interests and
personal gain.</P>
      <P>The conclusions also said that cross-strait exchanges should not
be allowed to develop unrestrainedly and that such exchanges should
be "effectively managed."</P>
      <P>The conclusions also indicated that agricultural issues,
including bilateral trade, should be regulated and conducted under a
WTO framework and that if negotiations are required, they should also
be conducted under the WTO framework, the officials added.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Whether fingerprints should be carried on
new identification cards is an issue to be decided by the Legislative
Yuan, Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan wishes to have the current law requiring
fingerprints on the ID cards amended, but the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI) will require fingerprints to be submitted unless the
existing household registration law is revised by the Legislative
Yuan before July 1, Su said.</P>
      <P>The MOI is scheduled to replace existing ID cards with a new
forgery-proof version from July 1 this year, valid until June 30,
2006.</P>
      <P>At a meeting held at the Legislative Yuan Home and Nation's
Committee Wednesday, a majority of lawmakers who attended the meeting
voiced opposition to the option of repealing the existing law
requiring fingerprints.</P>
      <P>As the current regulations require fingerprints, Su said, the MOI
has been preparing the replacement work in line with this principle
and has begun formulating rules governing the preservation and storage
of the fingerprints.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Hsiu-neng, deputy director-general of the National Police
Administration, said that he supports the notion of the nation
building a nationwide system for the preservation and storage of the
fingerprints. Fingerprints on ID cards will be helpful to police in
identifying bodies, the homeless and senile persons who become lost,
Hsieh added.</P>
      <P>To ensure the smooth procedure of the ID card replacements, Su
said, the MOI has organized training courses for relevant staff
members to be launched from March 31 through April 15.</P>
      <P>The new cards will be pale purple and will have 21 forgery-proof
features. Unlike the existing identification cards, which have
vertical print, the writing on the new ones will be horizontal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT'S CHIEF OF STAFF DEPARTS FOR SIGHTSEEING TRIP TO JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff
departed for Tokyo Wednesday for a sightseeing trip.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the president, was accompanied
by his wife and former Vice Premier Lin Hsin-i.</P>
      <P>Yu kept a low profile and declined to reveal the purpose of his
visit prior to his departure.</P>
      <P>According to Yu's aides, the visit is mainly a vacation and an
opportunity for him to meet with his Japanese friends. He is expected
to stay in Japan for a week.</P>
      <P>Yu, a former premier, would not comment on pro-independence
Taiwan Solidarity Union Chairman Su Chin-chiang's visit to the
Yasukuni Shrine in central Tokyo Monday. The Shinto shrine is
dedicated to 2.5 million war dead, including several convicted war
criminals. Su's visit has drawn criticism in local society, with some
people blaming him for dignifying Japan's militarism in the early
20th Century by visiting the shrine.</P>
      <P>Yu also refrained from revealing whether Chen will travel to the
Vatican to attend Pope John Paul II's funeral in person.</P>
      <P>For fear of offending China, Japan has traditionally been
reluctant to issue visas to senior Taiwan government officials.</P>
      <P>With a view to attracting more foreign visitors to the Aichi
Expo, Japan passed regulations in February to waive the visa
requirement s for Taiwan tourists between March 11 and Sept. 25.</P>
      <P>During the period, Taiwan passport holders can enter Japan
without visas for sightseeing purposes for a maximum 90-day stay.</P>
      <P>Japanese government officials said they will also consider
whether to offer Taiwan citizens permanent visa-free privileges after
the Aichi Expo.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is Japan's second-largest source of foreign tourists after
South Korea. </P>
      <P>However, Taiwan's top five officials are still required to apply
for a visa if they decide to visit Japan during the world exposition
in the central Japanese prefecture of Aichi.</P>
      <P>According to a previous report by Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan
Sun Chen, Japan's visa waiver is inapplicable to top five Taiwan
officials -- President Chen Shui-bian, Vice President Annette Lu,
Premier Frank Hsieh, Vice Premier Wu Rong-i and Tan Sun Chen himself.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO REVIEW CHINA'S PROGRESS IN MARKET OPENING NEXT YEAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has interacted with China according
to World Trade Organization (WTO) regulations and will review China's
progress in honoring its market-opening promises next year, Bureau of
Foreign Trade (BOFT) officials said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The officials were responding to a seven-point conclusion on
cross-Taiwan Strait relations reached during a high-level meeting
between President Chen Shui-bian and representatives of the Cabinet
and ruling Democratic Progressive Party a day earlier.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait economy and trade, it was concluded that the
government must not ignore the crucial "effective management" while
adopting an opening policy toward China.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, national security and administrative
agencies will review and adjust cross-strait trade policy, and the
government should also conduct consultations with China under the WTO
framework on issues related to the cross-strait agriculture and
service sectors, according to the conclusion.</P>
      <P>The BOFT officials said Taiwan has been involved in multilateral
talks with China under the WTO framework and share similar views with
China on certain WTO issues.</P>
      <P>They said Taiwan welcomes the opening of the Chinese market to
Taiwanese agricultural products according to WTO standards.</P>
      <P>While China promised to open its service sector during its
admission into the WTO, the WTO will conduct a trade policy review of
China next April, they noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also participate in the review to examine China's
progress in opening its market, they added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, members of Taiwan's financial sector said they will
respect the government's decision to adjust its cross-strait policies
but expressed the hope that the government will continue a policy of
openness in terms of cross-strait economy and trade.</P>
      <P>They pointed out the government has allowed the securities and
financial service sectors to set up operations in China under the WTO
framework.</P>
      <P>However, cross-strait financial activities are not as active as
expected, mainly because China remains conservative in terms of its
financial policy, they said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), Su Chin-chiang, whose pilgrimage to Japan's
war dead memorial drew strong protests and vehement criticism at home
Tuesday and Wednesday, said he has been a soldier and that he "fears
nothing."</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang and People First Party legislators, as well
as aboriginal lawmakers, have loudly criticized Su's visit to the
Yakusuni shrine in Tokyo as "deranged" and even ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lin Cho-shui described the visit
as "inappropriate."</P>
      <P>At a press conference welcoming 100 new recruits to his party
Wednesday, Shu said the TSU has been growing on the strength of the
people and Taiwan's identity, and it is proud to be what he claimed
is "a mouthpiece for the grassroots people."</P>
      <P>Facing a group of protesters and an even larger group of new TSU
members, he said: "I have been a soldier. How could I be daunted by
protests?"</P>
      <P>According to Su, his visit to Tokyo was aimed at strengthening
Taiwan's security cooperation with Japan, in sharp contrast to a KMT
delegation's visit to Beijing, which Su claimed helped legitimize
China's anti-secession law.</P>
      <P>His visit to the Yakusuni Shrine, which is dedicated to Japan's
2.5 million war dead and lists the names of 28,000 Taiwanese and
21,000 Korean soldiers, as well the names of many convicted war
criminals, has continued to stir up debate across Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng, speaking as a historian at the
Legislative Yuan, said paying respects to the memory of the Taiwanese
war dead is, "I feel, something that should be done."</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese might not have been recruited to the Pacific War
zone and listed in the Yasukuni shrine of their own accord, but
still, Tu added, like those killed in the China war zone, they are
Taiwan compatriots.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-jun, DPP legislative caucus secretary-general,
recommended that the government welcome "bring home" the spirits of
the 28,000 Taiwanese war dead so they can rest in peace and the
bereaved families can be solaced.</P>
      <P>At a press conference, Lee Sheng-feng, secretary-general of the
tiny opposition New Party, and three other Taipei-area lawmakers,
condemned Su for "honoring the militarist war criminals, " accusing
the TSU of inciting a conflict between Chinese nationalism and
Taiwanese nationalism with the ulterior motive of dividing Taiwan to
save the Taiwan independence movement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, police have targeted a number of the protesters at the
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport who pelted Su with eggs upon
his return to Taiwan Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Police said those who resorted to violence against Su will be
prosecuted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh ordered the relevant
authorities Wednesday to review and adjust policies concerning
"unmanageable" cross-Taiwan Strait activities.</P>
      <P>Hsieh told a weekly Cabinet meeting that the review will cover
cross-strait charter flights, agricultural products, tourism, the
service sector, the information sector, journalistic exchanges and
cooperation on crime-fighting, according to Cabinet spokesman Cho
Jung-tai.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the government's policy of "positive opening,
effective management" toward China remains unchanged and that the
government must not ignore "effective management" while continuing to
open to China.</P>
      <P>A seven-point conclusion on cross-strait relations reached during
a high-level meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and
representatives of the Cabinet and ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) a day earlier will be the government's top guidelines in
dealing with cross-strait affairs, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>The premier said the government will react carefully to the
various pressures imposed by China on the international community to
isolate Taiwan and its tactics to deny Taiwan's sovereignty, divide
Taiwan and distort international perception of the cross-strait
situation.</P>
      <P>He urged political parties and individuals in Taiwan to build up
a consciousness of common destiny, prioritize national interests over
personal and partisan interests, and stop competing with each other
to win China's favor.</P>
      <P>He said cross-strait exchanges must abide by existing laws and
that the government will act against violators if any irregularities
are discovered.</P>
      <P>Cho pointed out that the Statute Governing the Relations Between
the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area defines China as
a regime that is hostile to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The government will enforce the law strictly and adopt an
effective management mechanism for cross-strait activities, Cho said.</P>
      <P>The government's decision to review its cross-strait policies
came one month after Beijing enacted its Anti-Secession Law that
threatens the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A visit to China by a delegation led by opposition Kuomintang
Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang last week has also enraged the DPP
government, which has accused the KMT of becoming a tool of Beijing's
united front tactics against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Judicial authorities are investigating whether Chiang has
violated any laws in reaching a 10-point consensus with the Beijing
authorities during the trip.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh has demanded that all
administration officials refrain from making pilgrimages to a
controversial Japanese shrine dedicated to 2.5 million war dead,
including several convicted war criminals, an official said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai quoted Hsieh as having given the
directive at a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Hsieh's directive came after pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) Chairman Su Chin-chiang's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine in
central Tokyo Monday sparked controversy in local society.</P>
      <P>The premier was quoted as having said that TSU heavyweights'
pilgrimage to the Yasukuni Shrine was a controversial act which none
of the administration officials were allowed to follow.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Hsieh said, all government officials should also
refrain from giving a thumbs-up or encouraging such a controversial
act.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a lawyer-turned-politician, further said Su's pilgrimage
to the Japanese Shinto shrine was not a legal issue, but rather a
political one.</P>
      <P>"The crux of the issue was not whether the visit was legal or
illegal. It is a political issue that requires individual political
parties to make a correct judgment," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>At a time when the government is wholeheartedly pursuing peace
and stability across the Taiwan Strait, Hsieh said all administration
officials should keep in mind the sins of war and all the sufferings
it could bring to the people.</P>
      <P>"We should staunchly oppose war and all sorts of non-peaceful
actions," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Su is one of only a few senior Asian political figures ever to
visit the Yasukuni Shrine. In addition to honoring Japanese war dead
and civilians who died in fighting, the shrine also lists the names
of 28,000-plus Taiwanese and 21,000 Korean soldiers, most of whom
were forced into military service under Japan's colonial rule.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP)
legislators, as well as aboriginal lawmakers, have criticized Su's
visit to the shrine as "deranged" and even ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) Legislator Lin Cho-shui described the visit
as "inappropriate."</P>
      <P>Su said Wednesday that his just-concluded visit to Japan was
aimed at strengthening Taiwan's security cooperation with Japan, in
sharp contrast to a KMT delegation's visit to Beijing, which Su
claimed helped legitimize China's Anti-Secession Law. He further
claimed that the Yasukuni pilgrimage was to pay tribute to the
spirits of Taiwanese soldiers.</P>
      <P>Minister of Education Tu Cheng-sheng, speaking as a historian at
the Legislative Yuan earlier in the day, said paying respects to the
memory of the Taiwanese war dead is, "I feel, something that should
be done."</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese might not have been recruited to the Pacific War
zone and listed in the Yasukuni shrine of their own accord, but
still, Tu added, like those killed in the China war zone, they are
Taiwan compatriots.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING IS PLAYING TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN AGAINST TAIWAN: LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 5 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of visiting Taiwan lawmakers
said here Tuesday that they have urged their U.S. contacts to concern
themselves with Chinese infringements on the human rights of Taiwan
businessmen operating in China, because they are played against their
goverment by China.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers, members of the ROC-USA Inter-Parliamentary Amity
Association, told Taiwan journalists posted in Washington, D.C., that
Beijing is forcing Taiwan businessmen working in China to support its
Anti-Secession Law, which is at the center of a bitter dispute
between Taiwan and China because it allows China to attack Taiwan as
it deems necessary.</P>
      <P>Legislator Charles C. Chiang, who is the head of the visiting
group, said that Hsu Wen-lung, the founder of Taiwan's Chi Mei Corp.,
was forced to assert that he supports Beijing's "one China" policy
the day before a million people gathered in Taipei March 26 to
protest the Anti-Secession Law.</P>
      <P>As a firm supporter of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party, Hsu was "obviously" compelled by
Beijing to speak against his mind because of his group's huge
investments in China, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chuang He-tsi, also a member of the visiting group,
claimed that one of Chi Mei's senior executives was jailed in China
and that Hsu had to voice support for Beijing in its dispute with
Taipei in the hope that Beijing would treat the executive leniently.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Chung-mo said that Hsu is only the most prominent
victim of Beijing's policy of "bringing Taiwanese businessmen to bear
on the Taiwan authorities."</P>
      <P>"There are at least 1,000 Taiwan businessmen who have been forced
to speak in favor of China in the dispute surrounding the
Anti-Secession Law," Lin claimed.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities scrutinize and find fault with Taiwan
businessmen's accounting books to force them to say what they want
them to say, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>The group arrived in the United States April 2 and will continue
its tour of America until April 9.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A government official said Wednesday that a
"Tea Day" organized to begin the following day will promote the
island's tea culture.</P>
      <P>The newly introduced "Tea Day" is part of a campaign organized
jointly by the Council of Agriculture (COA) under the Executive Yuan
and the Taiwan Tea Association to encourage the public to enjoy the
healthy, natural drink, which some claim to be Taiwan's national
treasure.</P>
      <P>The day of the activity was also chosen to echo "World Health
Day," which shares the same date, as studies claim that drinking tea
can help reduce blood pressure and prolong life.</P>
      <P>Aside from the health benefits of drinking tea, a COA official
said that tea drinking has evolved into an art and that serving tea
has become a subtle way for Taiwanese people to show others care and
affection.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Tea Association Chairman Wang Rei-kai described tea as an
indispensable part of Chinese culture and a national treasure.</P>
      <P>According to COA statistics, each year Taiwan produces 20,000
tons of tea on 20,000 hectares of land. Taiwan is known for exporting
a large proportion of its tea output, most notably oolong tea.</P>
      <P>Even though Taiwan's tea production was affected by the harsh
weather conditions this winter, tea prices nevertheless are not
expected to rise sharply, according to the council.</P>

Labour and the Tories are spending millions of pounds on a hidden
high-tech campaign to win over the 800,000 key voters in marginal
seats who will settle the general election. The party leaders took to
the air on whistle-stop tours yesterday as the date of the election

Tony Blair on Tuesday launched what is set to be the most keenly

call an election for May 5, the prime minister sought to galvanise

Wall Street Journal: After 8 Years, Legislation Finally Nears
Passage of New New Bankruptcy Law.

After eight years of trying, U.S. Congress next week is expected
to pass legislation aimed at a growing problem: Encouraged by mass
mailings from the credit-card industry, more and more consumers are
taking on more debt than they can handle and ending up in bankruptcy
court. The new bankruptcy law, crafted with industry help and backed
by President Bush, takes the firm view that this is the borrower's
problem, not the industry's. Credit-card companies, banks and t heir
allies say the legislation, the biggest change to U.S. bankruptcy law
since 1978, is an over due correction to a system that is biased in
favor of borrowers and too often protects deadbeats. Opponents
condemn the bill will inflict pain on consumers overwhelmed by debt
that they can't pay because of health problems or layoffs.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa was given less than sterling marks for his performance over
the last eight years as head of the Special Administrative Region
(SAR) by residents in a poll released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Over 1,000 Hong Kong citizens were surveyed by the University of
Hong Kong in mid-March on Tung's administrative performance. Forty
percent of the respondents said that Tung had done more harm than
good in promoting the region's general development. Just 19 percent
gave him a higher score, while 30 percent said that Tung's influence
had been equally positive and negative on the SAR.</P>
      <P>Thirty-one percent believed Tung made a positive contribution to
Hong Kong's economy, while 27 percent gave him credit in political
affairs, and 18 percent gave him no credit at all.</P>
      <P>However, 51 percent blamed Tung for leading Hong Kong into
recession, while 25 percent said he had made political mistakes, and
4 percent said the former chief executive performed perfectly during
his administration, which began in July 1997 and ended in March 2005.</P>
      <P>Tung received 4.6 points out of 10 for his administrative
achievements, but 5.4 points for being incapable. The scores reflect
that Hong Kong people believe Tung did more harm than good to Hong
Kong's development, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Tung's eight years in power were marred by recessions, a deadly
SARS epidemic, and accusations he was a puppet of Beijing. His
unpopular leadership sparked huge pro-democracy protests in 2003 and

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 6 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government would like to bring together
all political parties to discuss the best way to approach dealings
with China, specifically regarding individuals or groups wishing to
travel to China on their own without the government's blessing,
Taiwan's top mainland policy planner said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions raised by lawmakers at an interpellation
session of the Legislative Yuan, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
Chairman Joseph Wu said that President Chen Shui-bian had already
proposed in a high-profile meeting with officials from the
Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party a day earlier to hold a meeting of leaders across
the political spectrum to discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>The proposal, which was listed in a seven-point summary of the
meeting, is the best way to reach a national consensus, Wu stressed.</P>
      <P>Criticizing a recent visit to China by opposition Kuomintang Vice
Chairman P.K. Chiang, during which he reached a 10-point consensus
with Chen Yunlin, director of Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office,
covering a wide range of issues, including cross-strait
transportation, agriculture, protection of China-based Taiwan
businessmen, the rights of Chinese fishermen working on Taiwan
fishing vessels, and the further easing of China's financial market,
Wu said that it hurts Taiwan's interests, particularly at this moment
when the government is assessing the impact of China's recently
enacted Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The 10-point consensus seriously damaged Taiwan's interests
because it deprives the government of its authority and its
bargaining power in negotiations with Beijing, Wu said. Worse still,
he added, it deprives Taiwan of its sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The government is not opposed to political parties and
individuals visiting China to promote cross-strait exchanges and
mutual understanding between the two sides of the Strait, Wu went on.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that any matter involving national interests
and the public mandate should be authorized by and have the
permission from the government.</P>
      <P>A national consensus in dealing with cross-strait issues will
serve as a guideline for visits to China by political parties and
individuals from Taiwan, Wu said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's upcoming visit
to the Vatican to attend Pope John Paul II's funeral mass has been
met with broad approval from across party boundaries.</P>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Su Chi on Wednesday hailed
the trip, saying it will be one of Chen's most important overseas
trips as president.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
announced earlier in the day that the Italian government has already
issued a visa for President Chen to attend the Pope's funeral mass.</P>
      <P>Noting that 16 of the Republic of China's 25 diplomatic allies
are Catholic countries, Su said maintaining good relations with the
Vatican should be given priority.</P>
      <P>The Vatican is the ROC's only diplomatic ally in Europe. Su said
if ROC-Vatican ties change drastically, a domino effect could ensue.
Should that be the case, he cautioned, Taiwan's diplomatic prospects
could be grim.</P>
      <P>Su, a convener of the Legislative Yuan's foreign affairs
committee, said he is pleased to see President Chen obtain an Italian
visa to visit the Vatican.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Su said local people should refrain from billing it
as a major diplomatic breakthrough to avoid provoking China or
bringing unnecessary troubles to the Italian government, which
maintains diplomatic ties with China.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA officials, Chen and his entourage will travel
to Italy via a chartered China Airlines flight. Chen will depart
Taipei at 3: 40 p.m. Thursday and arrive in Rome at 5 a.m. April 8.
After attending the funeral, Chen will depart for home in the evening
the same day.</P>
      <P>Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP), said President Chen will represent the 23 million Taiwan
people to pay homage to the late Pope.</P>
      <P>Hsiao, who concurrently heads the DPP's international affairs
department, said President Chen is not expected to touch on any
political issues during his brief Vatican visit.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hsiao said that the trip will offer Chen a rare
opportunity to interact with top leaders from major countries around
the world. Therefore, she said, the visit is of great significance
both from a political and religious perspective.</P>
      <P>Because of China's diplomatic embargo against Taiwan, top ROC
leaders have few opportunities to attend major international events.
This will be Chen's first trip to Europe since assuming the
presidency in May 2000.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-tsan, director of the DPP's information and publicity
department, said the Vatican symbolizes the values of peace and human
rights. In his view, Cheng said Chen's Vatican visit will underscore
Taiwan's resolve to deal with relations with China with these
universal values as cardinal principles.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative caucus whip William C.T. Lai said that the late
Pope John Paul II had been a courageous guardian of peace and
democracy upheld by Taiwan. As the Vatican has been Taiwan's longtime
diplomatic ally, Lai said the DPP caucus fully supports Chen's
attendance at the Pontiff's funeral.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the pro-independence opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union and pro-unification opposition People First Party also threw
their support behind Chen's visit to the Vatican, saying they believe
the visit will help cement the ROC's diplomatic ties with the Holy
See.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People
First Party (PFP) vowed Wednesday to proceed with their respective
plans to arrange for their party leaders to visit China in spite of a
government warning such visits might damage Taiwan's dignity and
interests.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan's plan to make a "tour of peace" to China
won't be shaken by the government's seven-point decision to dampen a
rush by opposition figures to go to China, a phenomenon dubbed "China
fever," so Lien will begin his visit as scheduled, which is "as soon
as possible," KMT spokeswoman Cheng Li-wen said.</P>
      <P>PFP Policy Center Director and Legislator Chang Hsien-yao said
his party's plans are still on track to send an agricultural mission
to China and to arrange for party leader James Soong to visit later.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called a meeting of top government and
ruling party officials Tuesday night, in which they reached a
seven-point decision to put the brakes on a series of opposition
moves to visit China "to stop 'China fever' from harming Taiwan's
dignity and interests."</P>
      <P>Cheng said the government should do its part to seek peace across
the Taiwan Strait instead of hobbling the opposition's efforts to
establish rapprochement.</P>
      <P>Chang said his party will proceed with preliminary contacts with
Chinese authorities regarding Soong's proposed visit to China.
Meanwhile, PFP Legislator Tsay Sheng-jia will lead an agricultural
mission to visit China in the near future, Chang added.</P>
      <P>The PFP has tried hard to lower the profile of the mission in
hopes that talks over "pure" agricultural exchanges between Taiwan
and China will bring some good results, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's strategy to cool down the current
infatuation with opposition party officials traveling to China, the
authorities are re-emphasizing the "active opening, effective
management" dictum of cross-strait economic and trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>As to exchanges in services and farming, the government
reiterated the need to negotiate under the framework of the World

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan should refrain from mocking the people of Taiwan and the
country's laws, Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cho made the remarks after Lien said the Democratic Progressive
Party administration's decision to deal with KMT Vice Chairman P. K.
Chiang's recent visit to China in accordance with existing
regulations "could make the administration the laughing-stock of the
international community."</P>
      <P>Cho said all citizens must abide by the law. "It's not nonsense
to demand that political figures also abide by the law," Cho added.</P>
      <P>As to which laws Chiang might have broken, Cho said the Cabinet
is not a judicial agency.</P>
      <P>Quoting judicial experts' opinions, Cho said Chiang might have
violated Article 113 of the Criminal Code and Section I of Article 5
and Section 1 of Article 33 of the Statute Governing the Relations
Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>According to Article 113 of the Criminal Code, private
individuals or groups, without the government's authorization, are
banned from forging agreements with foreign governments.</P>
      <P>Chiang led a KMT delegation to China last week and reached a
10-point consensus with Beijing officials on a broad range of issues
including cross-Taiwan Strait charter flights, agricultural
cooperation, protection for China-based Taiwanese business people,
tourism, journalistic exchanges and the opening of the Chinese
financial market.</P>
      <P>Cho said that as some local people have filed lawsuits against
Chiang, prosecution authorities will look into the case in line with
present regulations.</P>
      <P>The Public Prosecutors' Office of the Taiwan High Court on
Wednesday assigned prosecutor Chu Chia-chi to the case after
accepting a treason lawsuit filed by the public against Chiang last
Friday.</P>
      <P>A group of politicians in Tainan have also lodged a lawsuit with
the Tainan District Prosecutors' Office, accusing Chiang of violating
the cross-strait statute.</P>
      <P>According to the statute, civic organizations that reach an
agreement with China on issues concerning policy issues or political

    <HEADLINE>ROC-VATICAN TIES NOT TO CHANGE UNDER NEW POPE: CARDINAL BISHOP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Vatican,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Tony Fang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Diplomatic relations between the Republic
of China and the Vatican will not change after a new Pope in elected,
Cardinal Paul S. J. Suan who is based in Taiwan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Suan, who came to the Vatican in late March for a visit, was
responding to an inquiry about whether the Vatican is likely to
switch its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China after Pope
John Paul II's death and the election of his successor.</P>
      <P>Pope John Paul II died Sunday (Taipei time) at the age of 84.
According to Catholic regulations, the 183 cardinal bishops around
the world will begin the election process for a new pope within 20
days of the death.</P>
      <P>Suan, who is the only cardinal bishop in either side of the
Taiwan Strait, said unless mainland Chinese people can enjoy full
religious freedom, the Vatican is unlikely to forge formal ties with
China. At the moment, the 83-year-old cardinal bishop said he sees
little possibility of that scenario becoming a reality.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE REFUSES TO ACT ON ARMS PURCHASE, NOMINEES FOR CONTROL YUAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 6 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's request for the
Legislative Yuan to affirm his nominees for the Control Yuan and his
administration's request for a special budget to buy a package of
arms from the United States failed to make it onto the agenda of the
Legislative Yuan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers from the two main opposition parties in the
legislature, the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People First Party (PFP) ,
worked together in the Committee on Rules to vote against putting the
two bills on the agenda for this session.</P>
      <P>The president's request, contained in a letter, was delivered to
the Legislative Yuan on Monday. The 29 nominees were the same ones he
had named in December, 2004 and submitted to the previous Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>The proceeding legislature, also controlled by the opposition,
refused to exercise their right to affirm the nominees, claiming that
they failed to live up to public expectations for members of the
Control Yuan.</P>
      <P>Instead, they asked the president to withdraw his list and to
come up with a new one. Chen refused and the political stalemate
continued until the end of January when the legislature's term
expired.</P>
      <P>When the new legislature opened in February, the opposition
lawmakers still refused to act on the president's request on the
grounds it was presented to the proceeding legislature, and was,
therefore, no longer valid. It was for this reason that the president
re-submitted his request, but refused to replace any of his nominees
to the displeasure of the opposition parties in the legislature.</P>
      <P>The special budget for the arms purchase has been at the center
of another dispute between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
and the two opposition parties because the KMT and the PFP will not
agree to the government's decision to include them in a special
budget, which is exempt from the legal cap on government loans.</P>
      <P>The government is anxious to get the legislature's green light
and wrap up the deal before the U.S. considers withdrawing its offer.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  6  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several business groups aired their
concerns Wednesday about the chilling effects on economic exchanges
with China caused by a consensus formed between the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and government leaders on ties with China the
previous day.</P>
      <P>Wang Tiao-chun, secretary-general of the Council for Industrial
and Commercial Development, said this consensus is basically putting
the brakes on exchanges across the Taiwan Strait and is therefore not
conducive to trade with China.</P>
      <P>Although the consensus was meant to check the political fever of
opposition parties wanting to visit the mainland, Wang said it will
dampen local business groups' enthusiasm to promote trade ties with
China.</P>
      <P>Lo Huai-chia, deputy secretary-general of the Taiwan Electrical
and Electronic Manufacturers Association, said when it comes to trade
with China, what matters is the normal channels of exchanges, not the
pace of development.</P>
      <P>"A smooth communication channel can spare businessmen a lot of
troubles," Lo said, without elaborating.</P>
      <P>"The increasing exchanges between Taiwan and China are facts
neither the Taipei authorities nor the Beijing authorities can
overlook," he said.</P>
      <P>The consensus was worked out by the government and the DPP in an
emergency meeting since the leaders of the two major opposition
parties have been invited by Beijing to visit the mainland.</P>
      <P>In the consensus, the government warned the opposition to follow
the law in their associations with those in China or face possible
legal repercussions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ID CARD LAUNCH PREPARATIONS TO BE BASED ON FINGERPRINT REQUIREMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Preparations for the launch of the new
version of the national identification card July 1 will be based on
the existing law which requires that citizens be fingerprinted when
claiming a new ID card, Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Su made the remarks while attending a training program held to
familiarize related staff with the ID card replacement operations.
The remarks came one day after the Executive Yuan passed a revised
draft bill to remove the fingerprint requirement in the existing
household registration law.</P>
      <P>Although the Cabinet has passed the bill, preparations for
launching the new ID card will be made based on the fingerprint
requirement in case the bill fails to gain Legislative Yuan approval
in its current session which ends at the end of May, Su said.</P>
      <P>It has been learned that if the bill is not approved, the
Interior Ministry will have to purchase around 900 fingerprint
scanners at a total cost of NT$500 million (US$15.87 million).</P>
      <P>Noting that ID cards should be renewed every 10 years according
to the existing regulations, Su said that the launch of a new version
of the national ID card has been delayed for 19 years because of the
controversy over the fingerprints issue. He said that if issuance of
anew card is again delayed this year, this will represent a serious
blow to the government's credibility and a violation of the law.</P>
      <P>The new cards will be pale purple and have 21 forgery-proof
features. Unlike the existing identification cards, which have
vertical print, the writing on the new ones will be horizontal.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers
threatened Thursday to sue President Chen Shui-bian and Premier Frank
Hsieh over what they called the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) government's use of the judicial system to serve its own
political needs.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers made the remarks one day after the Public
Prosecutors' Office of the Taiwan High Court started an investigation
into KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang over his establishing a so-called
10-point consensus with Beijing authorities during his visit to China
last week.</P>
      <P>According to the Criminal Code, a person can be charged with
treason for forging an agreement with a foreign government without
the government's authorization.</P>
      <P>During a seminar with Ministry of Justice and National Security
Bureau officials, KMT legislative caucus whip Chen Chieh said the DPP
government must make it clear as to whether China is considered a
foreign government, and if it isn't considered a foreign country,
then investigating Chiang would be unjustifiable.</P>
      <P>Chen said the caucus will not rule out the possibility of suing
the president and premier after gathering relevant evidence.</P>
      <P>Also, Chen announced that the KMT caucus has from Thursday
suspended consultations with the ruling party until the Cabinet makes
a positive response regarding Chiang's case.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Huang Teh-fu pointed out that treason is a crime
subject to public prosecution, and he urged prosecutors to initiate a
similar investigation into President Chen, who had previously shown a
note he claimed was passed on to him from former Chinese President
Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Legislators Su Chi and Lai Shyh-bao, also from the KMT, accused
the DPP government of resorting to legal means to achieve political
objectives.</P>
      <P>Su suggested that the KMT caucus boycott the Cabinet-proposed
NT$480 billion (US$15.19 billion) arms procurement package in protest
and demand that Justice Minister Shih Mao-lin step down immediately.</P>
      <P>Responding to the KMT's criticism, Vice Justice Minister Tang
Chin-chuan said that the investigation into Chiang is based on a
complaint lodged by the public and that his ministry respects the
powers of the prosecutors.</P>
      <P>State Public Prosecutor General Wu Ying-chao told the
legislature's Judiciary Committee that it will be up to prosecutors
to determine whether Chiang's act constitutes a crime after the
investigation is completed.</P>
      <P>Wu said it is not appropriate for him to comment on the case at
this point.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP lawmakers expressed regret over the KMT caucus'
decision to suspend consultations with the ruling party.</P>
      <P>Lai Ching-teh, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, urged the
KMT to stop "acting like children" and hampering the legislative
process of a number of important legal and budget bills.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT has suspended consultations with the ruling
party on three occasions in less than two months, Lai said he hopes
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng will try to mediate in the
dispute.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GREATER TAIPEI TO BECOME 'MOBILE METROPOLIS' BY 2010: MAYOR MA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  March 7 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei will become a city of the future by
2010, with "smart buses" relaying their locations to cellphones for
people waiting at stops, 2.3 million citizens using the MRT each day
and ultimately the merger with Taipei County to create a "mobile
metropolis, " Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou told the City Council
Thursday.</P>
      <P>By that time, wireless fidelity technology will have so matured
that many business transactions will be conducted using the
technology, as will the city government's services to the public,
according to Ma.</P>
      <P>In his latest administrative report, the mayor tried to boost the
confidence of the city's residents by comparing fast-developing
Asian cities, including Taipei, with American and European cities. He
pointed to the use of stored value cards for use on buses and
subways, for example, as a technological development that is now used
in most Asian cities. Also, Taipei's MRT has been renovated into
better shape than New York's subway system, the mayor claimed.</P>
      <P>"This shows that small cities can beat big cities and small
countries can beat big ones as long as they know how to make full use
of information technology," he said.</P>
      <P>To enhance the city's competitiveness, Ma proposed merging Taipei
City and Taipei County. By 2010, the proposed metropolitan area would
boast of an MRT system able to carry 2.3 million passengers daily,
similar to the capacity that Hong Kong's subways currently handle,
meaning that Taipei's MRT will have transformed itself from the
Little League to the Majors.</P>
      <P>The MRT system will work together with information technology
services and " smart buses, " enabling passengers to use their
cellphones to see when the next bus will be arriving, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>Turning to the money available for the city's budget, Ma said the
budget for the capital city has been shrinking over the past five
consecutive years. He joked that if he had believed in a fortune
teller's predictions a long time ago of the city's future financial
difficulties, he wouldn't have dared to run for mayor.</P>
      <P>In spite of budget constraints, Ma said the city government has
pushed ahead with many development projects, including the difficult
job of enlarging the sewer system, which is now serving 80 percent of
the city's population and, he hopes, will cover 95 percent when his
term of office expires at the end of 2006.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP MISSION WILL BE CAREFUL DURING CHINA VISIT: LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) promised Thursday that a PFP delegation will be careful
what it does during its upcoming visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>PFP lawmakers Chen Chih-pin and Lee Yung-pin made the remarks at
a news conference at the Legislative Yuan after colleague Tsay
Sheng-jia, who will lead the delegation to China next week for
negotiations on agricultural exchanges, paid a visit to Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu earlier the same day.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Wu pledged to help private sector exchanges
between Taiwan and China, Lee said that the PFP delegation will
exercise extreme caution during its China visit and will not do
anything that might hurt Taiwan's interests. The PFP only hopes to
serve as a bridge for cross-strait interactions, she noted.</P>
      <P>Tsai also made it clear that the delegation will not engage in
activities that could infringe on the government's power and that it
agrees with the MAC on this point. All the PFP wants to do is help
Taiwan's farmers, he added.</P>
      <P>However, they still called on the MAC to review its position that
prohibits any private individuals, groups or political parties from
reaching verbal or written agreements with Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>ROC government authorities have recently reiterated that any
individuals or groups that sign or reach agreements with China
without prior government permission will be dealt with according to
Republic of China law.</P>
      <P>The government's reiteration of its stance came after a mission
by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) led by Vice Chairman P. K.
Chiang to China late March. The group reached a 10-point consensus
with Chinese Communist Party officials to bolster civilian exchanges
-- a situation viewed by the government as one that might hurt
Taiwan's national interests and dignity and open the floodgates to
any individuals or parties wanting to ink agreements without
government approval.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP Policy Center Director Chang Hsien-yao said that a
meeting between PFP Chairman James Soong and President Chen Shui-bian
or a meeting between Soong and KMT Chairman Lien Chan is not part of
their party's program.</P>
      <P>Chang's comments came after news that Yu Shyi-kun,
secretary-general to the president, had contacted the PFP in recent
days to arrange a second Chen-Soong meeting. Chen and Soong met on
Feb. 24 and made public a 10-point agreement, promising to maintain
the national title of the ROC and not to declare Taiwan independence
in an effort to ease cross-strait tensions.</P>
      <P>As to a prospective visit to China by Soong, Chang said Wednesday
that such a visit by Soong is highly possible in the near future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The military held a live-fire exercise on
the outlying Penghu Islands on Thursday to simulate actions against
an invasion by China.</P>
      <P>The "Lien Hsin No. 248" joint land, sea and air exercise came one
month after China enacted its Anti-Secession Law, which threatens the
use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the drill, combat readiness was practiced under the scenario
of unusual military maneuvering along Chinese coasts, with Chinese
fighter jets flying across the median of the Taiwan Strait and
Chinese frigates approaching Penghu to try to intercept Taiwan's
supply ships.</P>
      <P>However, operations of the Air Force and Navy were called off
because of poor visibility as a result of foggy weather. Artillery
live-fire exercises were successful.</P>
      <P>Also on Thursday, Penghu County councilors Li Tien-chin and Hsu
Yueh-li demanded that the military hold the routine exercise in some
other place in the future, saying that the exercises damage Penghu's
marine ecology and affect the life of Penghu residents.</P>
      <P>Military officials in Penghu said the military had consulted with
local residents before the exercise.</P>
      <P>The impact of the exercise on local residents should be minimal
because the site of the exercise is several hundred meters away from
their communities, they said.</P>

(By Wennie Chi and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About half of the Congressional staff
and business leaders in the United States think that the United
States should defend Taiwan militarily if China attacks the island,
the results of a study on American attitudes toward China showed
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Seventy-six percent of U.S. Congressional staff questioned oppose
the European Union lifting its arms embargo on China, the results of
the first poll of a two-phase study commissioned by a
Chinese-American elite group, the Committee of 100, showed.</P>
      <P>The study, conducted by the polling firm Zogby International in
March, gauged the opinions about China of Congressional staff,
including legislative consultants, legislative authorities, aides and
press secretaries, as well as business leaders, including enterprise
chairmen and CEOs, corporate public relations authorities, department
managers and board directors.</P>
      <P>When asked, "Should the United States protect Taiwan with its
military forces in the event of a cross-Taiwan Strait conflict after
Taiwan declares independence? " 52 percent of the Congressional staff
queried said that the U.S. should defend Taiwan militarily; only 19
percent said "no, " while 29 percent provide no precise answer.</P>
      <P>For the same question, 48 percent of business leaders think the
U.S. military should help defend Taiwan; 50 percent think the U.S.
military should not, and only 3 percent are undecided.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 76 percent of the U.S. Congressional staff expressed
strong opposition to the European Union's plans to lift its arms
embargo on China, compared with a mere 2 percent who said that they
absolutely support the E.U. lifting the embargo.</P>
      <P>In addition, 49 percent of the Congressional staff and 50 percent
of the business leaders surveyed think that the United States should
be more active toward the development of cross-Taiwan Strait
relations.</P>
      <P>The same survey also found that Americans think the biggest
obstacle to doing business with China is "bureaucratic intervention."</P>
      <P>Other major obstacles included cultural and language barriers,
poor financial and judicial systems, as well as corruption, in that
order, the poll found.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian left for the
Vatican Thursday to attend the funeral mass of Pope John Paul II the
following day.</P>
      <P>The president, who has defined his trip as a "journey of peace
and memory," said prior to his departure that he will pay the highest
regards to the late pontiff on behalf of the government and the 23
million people on Taiwan, adding that his passing away represents one
of the biggest losses to the world.</P>
      <P>The president expressed the hope to join world leaders to reflect
upon the gracious munificence of the late pontiff, and to cement
solid relations between the Republic of China and the Vatican by
attending the Pope's funeral.</P>
      <P>The president said that the legacy left by Pope John Paul II will
encourage people the world over to attach more importance to lasting
peace, love and harmony, and that he represents a light to
civilization and the progress of freedom.</P>
      <P>"As a staunch diplomat and peace partner of the Vatican and a
most faithful member of the international democratic society, Taiwan
will make every effort to carry out the teachings of the late Pope, "
the president said.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the determination to pursue lasting peace in the
Taiwan Strait, as well as to embark on cross-strait dialogues and
reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Presidential Office said that president's
five-member delegation also includes Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan
Sun Chen, two Catholic fathers and a Muslim representative.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time the president will have visited the
Vatican, the only country in Europe with which the Republic of China
maintains diplomatic ties, and his first official trip to Europe, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>The visit is only to pay tribute to the late pontiff and after
Chen's arrival at the Vatican, he will attend the funeral mass
immediately, and will then visit the ROC Embassy to the Holy See
beside St. Peter's Square.</P>
      <P>The president will return to Taipei Saturday afternoon. His stay
in the Vatican will be less than 24 hours, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The president will receive preferential treatment as accorded
other national leaders, including preferential customs treatment,
they added.</P>
      <P>Michel Lu, spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said
that President Chen's visit demonstrates the solid and friendly
relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The government hopes that the Vatican will dispatch an ambassador
to head its embassy in Taipei, instead of a lower ranking figure,
although it will respect the wishes of the Holy See, Lu stressed.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lu said that as the late pontiff had attached great
importance to religious integration, and was concerned with the
Muslim development in the Middle East and the integration of the
Catholics and the Muslims, the president's delegation has included a
representative from the Muslim community.</P>
      <P>President Chen went to the Embassy of the Holy See Monday to pay
tribute to the late Pope who died Saturday at the age of 84. The
charge d' affaires of the embassy then invited him to attend the late
pontiff's funeral.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government must take steps to tackle
continuously surging oil prices to secure Taiwan's economy, according
to a report carried out by the Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD).</P>
      <P>The report proposed that state-run enterprises and the private
sector collaborate in setting up cooperative ventures with foreign
companies to diversify energy resources in view of a historic high
price of crude oil in the world market that breached US$58 per barrel
early this week.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Bureau of Energy under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, the report points out that Taiwan's
energy consumption during the 1992-2002 period grew faster than the
world average.</P>
      <P>The country's demand for coal and petroleum increased by an
average of 8.7 percent and 4 percent per year, respectively, during
that time, while consumption of liquefied natural gas and electricity
rose by 10.1 percent and 66.7 percent, respectively, on an annual
basis.</P>
      <P>The report suggests that this might be a result of either rapid
economic growth or waste and points out that the government's latest
projection that puts Taiwan's annual growth for electricity and coal
at 2.4 percent and 2.2 percent, and that 2.4 percent for petroleum is
still higher than the average expansions posted by the member states
of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development over the
past 10 years.</P>
      <P>The government must evaluate adequate growth rates for power
consumption, it says.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan's export-oriented economy relies tremendously on
imported energy, it calls on the government to address the oil supply
issue to minimize the impact of soaring oil prices.</P>
      <P>It proposes that the government make policy to allow state-run
enterprises, such as Taiwan Power Company and Chinese Petroleum
Corp., to seek partnerships with foreign businesses in cooperation
with the private sector to diversify investment channels for energy
in the international market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's booming financial sector should be a good tool to raise
funds for that purpose and help foster related businesses, it adds.</P>

the hope that Taiwan and China will normalize their relations to make

stay in the hearts of everyone on the island.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan is now a democratic country enjoying absolute
freedom of speech, social justice has been realized to an initial
extent in Taiwan, and human rights protection has been made a
principle policy of the government, the president pointed out.</P>

freedom is under threat from China, which has rejected the wishes and

An immediate review of how children are taught to read was
demanded yesterday after MPs cast doubt on one of Tony Blair's key

of 11 is "unacceptably high" eight years after the National Literacy

Financial Times: Blair bid to end Brown rivalry.

Tony Blair on Wednesday dramatically ended long-running
speculation that he would try to switch Gordon Brown to another job
after polling day, in a move that boosts the party's poll hopes and
Mr Brown's own chances of one day succeeding to the premiership.
Acting to end months of bitter rivalry with his principal ally in the

"foolish" to move Mr Brown from the Treasury where he has held sway

    <HEADLINE>NEW TAIWAN DOLLAR EXPECTED TO CONTINUE PICKING UP IN VALUE: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite noticeable fluctuations of the new
Taiwan dollar in recent days, the local currency is expected to keep
on picking up in value over the long term, analysts said Thursday.</P>
      <P>They said that the long-term course for Asian currencies,
including the new Taiwan dollar, is to keep on appreciating due to a
weaker U.S. dollar and a much anticipated stronger renminbi.</P>
      <P>Urging Taiwan companies to quickly hedge against risks of
currency exchanges to bring down production costs, experts proposed
branding, industry upgrading and market diversification as means of
staying competitive.</P>
      <P>Only by doing so can domestic companies grow sustainably, they
said, adding that it is important to catch up with market trends now.</P>
      <P>In the 1980s, Taiwan companies were also troubled by a fast
rising local currency, resulting in massive relocations offshore of
labor-intensive businesses, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>Those remaining in Taiwan took the opportunity to purchase pricey
machinery to undergo industrial upgrading -- efforts that saw the
country's high-tech sector gain ground in the world market, they went
on, adding that the ratio of Taiwan's technology-intensive exports
grew from 18.4 percent of its total outbound shipments in 1986 to
43.5 percent in 2004.</P>
      <P>Now Taiwan takes pride in value-added goods such as computers and
monitors -- a major shift from the sporting shoes and tennis racquets
of the past, they noted.</P>
      <P>Taking advantage of a rising local currency to achieve
sustainable growth, Taiwan companies now should engage in creating
their own distinguished brands and edging into new markets, rather
than just manufacturing on a contract basis to rack up greater
profitability, they suggested.</P>

      <P>Given that China just passed the Anti-Secession Law, which will
legalize an attack against Taiwan should the island declare formal
independence, Cheng said Chiang's visit to the mainland and the
consensus he achieved with Beijing on the issues which still lack
consensus within the island will be seen as "kowtowing" to China.</P>
      <P>Cheng went on that in contrast to President Chen Shui-bian's
visit to Rome to attend Pope John Paul II's funeral mass, which he
classified as successful diplomacy, Cheng stressed that Chiang's
visit to China was unjustifiable and cannot represent all the people
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Legislator Huang Wei-che said he was glad to see
that both the government and opposition politicians were working
actively for better ties with other countries. However, he urged them
to demonstrate solidity, especially when China has not shown good
will toward the island.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: One Million Wait to View
the Pope as Line Is Cut Off.

The streets around St. Peter's Basilica swelled Wednesday with an
estimated one million pilgrims, nearly double the barely manageable
number of the day before. The surge was so great hat late on
Wednesday night Italian officials close d down the line to view the
body of Pope John Paul II. Vatican officials said in this city o f
three million, one million people had seen the pope's body since it
went on public display on Monday. Viewing is to end Thursday evening,
and safety officials, concerned with the size of the crowd and
recognizing the wait to see the body would exceed 24 hours, sent
warnings on the radio and through text messages to cellphones
advising people to stay away. Eventually they decided to close the
line to newcomers.

Wall Street Journal: Church and State, In Vantican City, A
Cardinal Works To Balance Budget.

The late Pope John Paul II earned praise for his role in facing
down communism. One of Cardinal Edmund Szoka's contributions to the
Roman Catholic Church has been an injection of capitalism. The
77-year-old former archbishop of Detroit is president of the
Governatorate of Vatican City, the closest thing this tiny city-state
has to a mayor. Two years ago, Cardinal Szoka moved the Vatican's
department store out of a glum basement and into the former train
station, a spacious, refurbished stone building behind St. Peter's
Basilica. Since being assigned to his current post in 2001, he has
boosted the Vatican's retailing operations, which now account for
53percent of the city-state's annual budget of about US$190 million.
Revenue from the Vatican Museums, including admissions and gift-shop
sales, makes up an additional 19 percent, while odds and ends such as
the sale of stamps and coins issued by the post office provide the
rest. Without that cash, the Vatican wouldn't be able to pay its
electricity bill or the salaries of its 1,500 employees, including 63
full-time gardeners.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>KMT IGNORING THE LAW: DPP LAWMAKER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 7 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
lawmaker claimed Thursday that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
ignored the government's reminder that the party should pay heed to
related laws while visiting China.</P>
      <P>Chao Yung-ching, convener of the DPP's legislative caucus, made
the remarks after the Public Prosecutors' Office of the Taiwan High
Court began an investigation into KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang, who
recently returned from a visit to China, where he reached a 10-point
consensus with the Beijing authorities covering issues such as
cross-Taiwan Strait transportation, agricultural cooperation,
protection of Taiwanese businessmen with operations in China, and the
opening of China's financial market.</P>
      <P>The Public Prosecutors' Office took the case Wednesday after
accepting a treason lawsuit filed by the public against Chiang for
reaching an agreement with a foreign government without the
government's authorization.</P>
      <P>The KMT's legislative caucus said in retaliation that it will not
exclude the possibility of suing President Chen Shui-bian and prime
minister Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Chao said the KMT should pay more attention to the related laws
and listen more to public opinion. He did not make clear which law
the KMT was alleged to have broken.</P>
      <P>He added that at a time when China has passed the Anti-Secession
Law, which legalizes an attack against Taiwan should the island seek
formal independence, the politicians from both the government and the
opposition should reach consensus within the country before
conducting sensitive cross-strait negotiations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Lai Ching-teh, the DPP's legislative caucus
whip, criticized the attitude of KMT Chairman Lien Chan toward a
seven-point conclusion reached by officials of Chen Shui-bian's
administration following Chiang's China visit.</P>
      <P>The participants in the meeting convened by Chen concluded that
the Republic of China is a sovereign country, that any change to
Taiwan's future should be decided by the country's 23 million people,
and that any cross-strait affairs involving national sovereignty
should not be negotiated by any political parties, groups or
individuals without the authorization of the government.</P>
      <P>Lai suggested that Lien have a meeting with Chen to better
understand the meaning of the conclusion.</P>
      <P>Lien, to whom Beijing also extended an invitation, said earlier
this week that he would be honored to visit China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT VICE CHAIRMAN PROBED FOR TALKS WITH CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Public Prosecutors' Office of the
Taiwan High Court said Thursday that they have assigned a prosecutor
to look into opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang's
talks with Chinese officials during his high-profile trip to China
from March 28 to April 1.</P>
      <P>The Prosecutors' Office said the probe was launched after people
alleged to them that Chiang's 10-point consensus with Chinese
officials constituted the crime of "concluding an accord with a
foreign government without government authorization, " which is high
treason under the Criminal Code.</P>
      <P>An anonymous official in the office said, the case was classified
as "ta" category, which includes complaints with little evidence of
wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Although the prosecutor was ordered to investigate Chiang two
days after President Chen Shui-bian and the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) formed a united front to get tough with
opposition parties which are scrambling to visit China, the
Prosecutors' Office claimed that politics "has no role" in the case.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT launched a broadside against Chen and the DPP
Thursday, with party lawmakers taking turns to criticize the DPP
government for what they claimed was trying to make the law a tool in
a political power struggle.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Huang Teh-fu said the prosecutors should also probe
the president in connection with high treason, since Chen once
showcased a written note purporting to be a secret message to him
from a senior Chinese official.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Su Chi said Minister of Justice Shih Mao-ling should
step down for downgrading his prosecutors into servants of the ruler,
and the KMT lawmakers at the legislature should stop considering the
government's request for a special budget to buy arms from the United
States.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Lai Shih-pao said that if P.K. Chiang is guilty,
that the KMT, which sent him on the mission, should be guilty too,
along with all the Taiwan businessmen operating in China.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Chen Chieh pointed out that under the Republic of
China Constitution, China is not a foreign country and that the
Ministry of Justice is attempting to "stretch" the Criminal Code to
cover China.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu claimed that any person who loses a
presidential race but attempts to usurp the president's power by
concluding treaties with "other countries" should
be brought to justice.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO RESTRICTIONS ON AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 7 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) , said Thursday that the government has set no
restrictions on Taiwan agricultural exports to China and has made
every effort to assist farmers wishing to tap into the China market.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks while meeting with legislators from the
opposition People First Party (PFP) who had come to exchange views
with Wu on how to carry out the 10-point conclusion -- including
President Chen Shui-bian's reaffirmation of no change to the nation's
official title -- reached between the president and PFP Chairman
James Soong, and a PFP plan to send an agricultural delegation to
China.</P>
      <P>Wu welcomed the visit and expressed hope that political parties
and the government could have more such discussions to forge
consensus and avoid Beijing's "united front" tactics to split the
island.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Taiwan agricultural exports to China are not
smooth mainly because Beijing imposes too high customs tariffs plus
complicated customs clearing and quarantine procedures, while there
are difficulties in establishing marketing networks.</P>
      <P>The above questions will require government planning if they
involve the execution of the authority of the government, Wu said,
adding that any groups will have to wait for government authorization
before conducting negotiations with China.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that the government will not oppose or interfere
with domestic political parties or civic groups going to China to
engage in cross-strait exchanges if they will be helpful to
cross-strait understanding and will not undermine national interests.</P>
      <P>As the leaders of the two major opposition parties -- Lien Chan
of the Kuomintang and PFP Chairman James Soong -- have expressed
their intention to visit China, a MAC spokesman also said that
considering the sour atmosphere in the wake of China's recent
enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, the MAC is not keen on any party
leaders visiting at present.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a former MAC official urged the government not
to rashly export agricultural products to China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar in Taipei on China's agricultural problems, 
Chiu Tai-san, a former MAC vice chairman, said the government has
invested a great deal of money in the improvement of agricultural
technology and should not do anything recklessly.</P>
      <P>He said that if Taiwan's agricultural products are concentrated
too much in one place, it will cause risks and pressure on domestic
agricultural development, especially because Beijing often interferes
politically with economic issues, compounded by its myriads of
agricultural problems and its wavering agricultural policy.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Taiwan farmers often face the problem of
imbalanced production and marketing, Chiu said that farmers often
fail to take note of market changes, resulting in gluts and
shortages alternatively.</P>
      <P>Chiu also said that "the intent of China is self-evident" in its 
active solicitation of Taiwan agricultural associations to visit
mainland China. </P>
      <P>He said Beijing has to address its failure squarely after years
of a "united front" tactics toward Taiwan, and claimed it is now
taking a more soft and appeasing approach to try to woo Taiwan people
following the anger vented by them in the wake of the passage of the
Anti-Secession Law.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei city government sent an invitation
letter to Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara Thursday, asking him to
serve as the spokesman of a Japanese version of a Taipei tourism
magazine.</P>
      <P>Government officials noted that Taipei is a major attraction for
Japanese tourists and that Japanese tourists are a major target of
the tourism publications issued by the city government.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou invited Ishihara to visit Taiwan during
a visit he made to Japan last month.</P>
      <P>Even though there will be difficulties in arranging the visit
because of Ishihara's tight schedule and because of the recent
controversy surrounding the head of the pro-Taiwan independence
opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union's visit to a shrine in Tokyo
honoring Japan's war dead of World War II, Taipei city government
still sent the invitation to him.</P>
      <P>The officials said that 70 percent of 5,000 tourism publications
issued monthly are supplied to Taiwan missions in Japan, with the
remainder distributed to tour operators, which they said exert a
certain impact on luring Japanese tourists.</P>
      <P>As the itinerary of Ishihara is tight, the tourism publication is
expected to ask him to promote Taipei tourism in an interview, the
officials said.</P>
      <P>Ishihara will be the first political figure to serve as the
spokesman of the tourism publication. Previous spokesmen have been
mostly from business, literary and cultural circles.</P>
      <P>The officials said they chose Ishihara because he has visited
Taiwan five times and recently spoke at the launch of a luxurious 
tourism train organized by the Taiwan Railway Administration.</P>
      <P>They said his name will be familiar to quite a number of older
Japanese tourists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIBNET SERVES AS WINDOW ON TAIWAN'S RICH, VALUABLE BIODIVERSITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A newly completed Internet network known as
TaiBNET is poised to serve as a window on Taiwan's ecological system,
which is unparalleled in the world and the most invaluable natural
asset of the country, a source from Academia Sinica said Thursday.</P>
      <P>TaiBNET, the first-phase project of a Web site network
introducing Taiwan's rich biodiversity, has been completed by the
Academia Sinica Biodiversity Center after three years of painstaking
work, said Shao Kuang-chao, director of the Biodiversity Center.</P>
      <P>According to Shao, Taiwan is indeed an "Ilha Formosa, " or
"beautiful island" as it was named by the first Portuguese
colonialists nearly 500 years ago, because it has 2.5 percent of the
world's genetic variations even though the island's area is only
0.00025 of the globe, constituting 100 times the average density of
species worldwide.</P>
      <P>In the seas surrounding Taiwan, the number of species is about
one-tenth of the whole world, or 400 times that of the world's
average, Shao added.</P>
      <P>It is justifiable to say that if there were no Taiwan and the
waters surrounding it, the biodiversity jigsaw puzzle of the world
would have a piece missing, Shao claimed.</P>
      <P>Currently, TaiBNET covers 45,040 species and genetic variations
found in Taiwan. Estimated according to the food chain theory of
Peter Raven, a distinguished U.S. botanist, the number of Taiwan's
plant and animal species should be around 150,000 to 200,000, Shao
said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's trade surplus plummeted by 85
percent in the first quarter of this year due to declining exports
and soaring imports, a source from the Ministry of Finance reported
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$42.85 billion-worth of products and services
in the first three months while importing US$42.56 billion-worth of
commodities and products, according to Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the
Finance Ministry's Department of Statistics.</P>
      <P>As a result, the country posted a trade surplus of US$290 million
in Q1, representing a decline of 85 percent or US$1.66 billion over
that posted in Q1 of 2004, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, Taiwan's export trade totaled US$15.78 billion
in March, while the country's import trade amounted to US$16.17
billion, up 6.9 percent and 14.9 percent, respectively, over the
corresponding month of 2004.</P>
      <P>Although both figures were record highs, Taiwan suffered a trade
deficit of US$390 million in March due to rising imports that
exceeded exports, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>In March, Taiwan's exports of information technology and
telecommunications products -- the bulk of the island's export trade
-- declined by 25.6 percent over the same month of the previous year.</P>
      <P>Hsu attributed the surging imports in March to several factors,
including oil imports that skyrocketed 132 percent in March compared
with the same month of the previous year as a result of soaring
international oil prices, plus imports of civilian aircraft, as well
as trains to be used on the Taiwan High-Speed Railway.</P>

year-on-year, Tourism Bureau officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>At a meeting presided over by Vice Premier Wu Rong-i on ways to

visiting Taiwan this year is expected to reach 3.25 million.</P>
      <P>The officials added that the number of inbound travelers in the
first half of 2004 did not meet the original target of 1.4 million
due to several factors, such as bird flu and the politically
tumultuous situation following the presidential election in March.</P>
      <P>However, more and more travelers began to visit Taiwan in the
second half of 2004 when those negative factors were eliminated, the
officials said, adding that a total of 2.95 million tourists visited

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) think tank,
the Foundation for National Policy Research, recommended direct
weekly passenger charter flights and direct quarterly cargo charter
flights between Taiwan and China Thursday as a transitional step
toward direct regular flight service across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, the executive director of the KMT's Policy
Coordination Committee, said at a seminar called to present the
foundation's study that the direct weekly charter flights for
passengers, preferably lined up on the four days between Friday and
Monday, would cater to the needs of commuters between Taiwan and
China.</P>
      <P>These flights should link at least the Chinese cities of Beijing,
Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Xiamen with the four
Taiwan airports of Shungshan, Chiang Kai-shek, Hualien and Hsiaokang
in Kaohsiung. </P>
      <P>The direct cross-strait cargo flights are more urgent than the
passenger flights in terms of Taiwan's economic development, Tseng
said, adding that they would be lined up for every quarter so that
businessmen can plan their delivery of goods in advance.</P>
      <P>Without the direct cargo flights to and from China, Tseng quoted
local businessmen as saying, Taiwan is set to see more companies
relocating their manufacturing operations from Taiwan to China.</P>
      <P>In the initial stage, the cargo flights should cover the Chinese
cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Tienjin, Shenzhen,
and Xiamen with Chiang Kai-shek Airport and Hsiaokang Airport,
according to the study.</P>
      <P>Kao Kung-lien, a former vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs

      <P>A French Senate group friendly to Taiwan
issued a statement Thursday saying it regrets that the island has
been excluded from the World Health Organization (WHO) and hopes the
World Health Assembly (WHA) can help find a solution when it convenes
its annual conference in Geneva next month.</P>
      <P>The statement was issued to coincide with World Health Day. It
came one day after Republic of China Minister of the Department of
Health Ho Sheng-mao called on the French Senate in Paris.</P>
      <P>The group, composed of some 45 senators from various political
parties, said it regrets that the 23 million people of Taiwan have
been excluded from the global disease prevention information system.</P>
      <P>In the statement, the group expressed the hope that a solution to
this problem could be found during the 58th World Health Assembly,
WHO's policy-making body, in Geneva May 16-25.</P>
      <P>Noting that the slogan of this year's World Health Day is "make

    <HEADLINE>BOFT TO WORK TO BOOST TAIWAN FRUIT EXPORTS TO CHINA VIA WTO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) will
work to help Taiwan farmers to export more fruit to the Chinese
mainland via the World Trade Organization (WTO) mechanism, BOFT
officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Despite the facts that both Taiwan and China are WTO members and
that Taiwan has been involved in multilateral talks with China under
the WTO framework and that the two sides share similar views on
certain WTO issues, China has not opened its door wide enough to
Taiwan fruit, the BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>According to BOFT tallies, China allows only 12 categories of
fruits from Taiwan to be imported. In 2004, China imported only
US$1.637 million worth of Taiwan fruit, constituting a mere 1.47
percent of China's total fruit imports for the year.</P>
      <P>The BOFT will continue to seek consultations with China under the
WTO framework to open the Chinese market wider to Taiwan fruit,
including bananas, the officials said. The 12 categories of Taiwan
fruit that are currently allowed into China include mangoes, betel
nuts and shaddock.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, they pointed out, a number of Taiwan banking
institutions have established representative offices in China for
more than two years, qualifying them to open branches on the
mainland. However, the officials noted, these banks have not been
able to further upgrade their operations there due to the lack of a
"supervision cooperation memorandum" signed by the governments of the
two sides.</P>
      <P>Although China promised to open its service sector in its WTO
entry protocol, the Beijing authorities have been intentionally
difficult toward Taiwan investors, being picky even on the
"feasibility study reports" filed by Taiwan businesspeople for
investments in China's distribution business, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the BOFT will ask China, during the forthcoming Doha
round of bilateral and multilateral talks, to further relax
restrictions on building and running hospitals in China, the
officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking U.S. State Department
official said Wednesday that the United States does not welcome any
efforts that might alter the military balance in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Nicholas Burns, under secretary for political affairs, made the
comments while touching on the European Union's intentions to lift a
arms ban on China in a speech he delivered at Chatham House in
London. The full text of the speech was released by the State
Department Thursday.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the United States still seeks to maintain its
historic role as the principal guarantor of peace and stability in
the Asia-Pacific region, Burns said that Washington also seeks a
peaceful and constructive relationship with China.</P>
      <P>"We are China's partner in the Six-Party talks. We have improved
our relationship with China," he said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the under secretary said that the United States has
been dismayed by China's military forces' buildup, particularly its
ballistic missile forces across from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also noted that U.S. President George W. Bush had made it
clear during his latest trip in Europe that "due to human rights and
regional security concerns, ending the E.U. arms embargo (against
China) is a bad idea."</P>
      <P>"We will not support the E.U.'s efforts to do so. It would have
an impact, as Deputy Secretary Zoellick said recently, on our
Trans-Atlantic partnership, particularly if the U.S. Congress were to
enact legislation limiting the sale of important U.S. technology to
E.U. countries," Burns said.</P>
      <P>"Clearly, it is now time for the United states and the European
Union to engage in a serious strategic dialogue about our mutual
interests in Asia and the Pacific, " he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A four-member Taiwan medical mission has
traveled to Indonesia to help with post-earthquake relief work, a
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The medical personnel will offer medical services to surviving
victims of the powerful magnitude 8.7 earthquake that struck off
Indonesia's Sumatra Island March 29, the official said.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the temblor resulted in the death or
injury of more than 1,000 people, with the remote Indonesian island
of Nias bearing the brunt of devastation. Transport and
communications in the Nias region remain difficult as the earthquake
severely damaged the power system there.</P>
      <P>Out of humanitarian concern, the Republic of China government has
donated US$50,000 in cash and a large number of body bags to the
Indonesian government, the official said, adding that the MOFA has
also directed the ROC representative office in Jakarta to purchase
US$10,000 worth of rice in Indonesia to help feed the quake
survivors.</P>
      <P>In addition, the official said the MOFA has cooperated with the
Department of Health in organizing the four-member medical mission to
Nias and Sibogal in Sumatra to offer post-disaster relief aid.</P>
      <P>The March 29 earthquake followed an even-bigger quake that caused
the tsunami disaster of Dec. 26, 2004. The death toll in South and

    <HEADLINE>CEC NOT CONSIDERING POSTPONING NATIONAL ASSEMBLY ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Central Election Commission
(CEC) said Friday that he will not consider postponing the
mission-oriented National Assembly election for the time being.</P>
      <P>CEC Chairman Chang Cheng-hsiung made the remarks when he was
invited by the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) to report on
the National Assembly election and the proposed "three-in-one" local
elections at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Lo Chih-ming suggested that the CEC postpone the
National Assembly election for "major incidents, " citing the example
of the 1979 legislative elections which were postponed after the
United States severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With the bill governing the operations of the National Assembly
still in limbo because of bickering between the ruling and the
opposition parties, Lo said that even if the 300 delegates are
elected on May 14 as scheduled, the National Assembly will still be a
toothless organ, and this could trigger constitutional crisis.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the 1979 legislative elections were postponed by
an emergency decree issued by then-President Chiang Ching-kuo. He
said that as there is no such emergency decree at present, the CEC
will carry out the conclusions reached by the Legislative Yuan last
August to hold a National Assembly election on May 14.</P>
      <P>A total of 300 delegates are to be elected to the National
Assembly, whose mission will be to approve a package of
constitutional amendment proposals -- halving the number of seats in
the legislature, changing the electoral system to a"single
constituency and two votes" system, abrogating the National Assembly,
and including the referendum system into the Constitution.</P>
      <P>"It is not the jurisdiction of the CEC to suspend or postpone the 
election, and we are not considering it," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The TSU also suggested that the CEC seriously consider postponing
the National Assembly election to the end of the year and holding it
simultaneously with the city and county head elections to save money
and boost the turnout rate, and to avoid a constitutional crisis.</P>
      <P>On the proposal to hold mayoral, magistrate, city and county
councilor, and village and township chief elections simultaneously to
save money, Chang said that the CEC will study the proposal at a
meeting next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After reaching a resolution at the upcoming meeting, the CEC will
send letters to local election committees as a reference, he said,
adding that the views of local election committees will be respected
in terms of deciding whether to hold the "three-in-one elections."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, four legislators from across the party spectrum lent
their support to the "three-in-one" elections proposal first broached
by Premier Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Legislator Huang Chien-huei of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party said that the CEC will convene a meeting April 13 and that it
should show its determination to cut costs by holding the elections
simultaneously.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wu Yu-sheng of the Kuomintang (KMT) said that polls
have shown that 58 percent of the people support the "three in-one"
elections, and that 56 percent favor merging central and local
elections to two times every four years. He said the polls
demonstrate the public's desire for election reform.</P>

Chin-Chi echoed their colleagues.</P>

      <P>The United States has condemned China's
recent enactment of its Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, the head
of a Republic of China legislative group visiting the United States
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiang Chao-yi of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) made the remarks while meeting with Taiwanese expatriates
in southern California prior to departing Los Angeles for Taipei
Friday.</P>
      <P>Chiang noted that during his stay in Washington, D.C., the U.S.
government officials, members of Congress and academic figures that
he and his delegation met with were unanimous in their condemnation
of Beijing's enactment of the law, which authorizes the use of
non-peaceful means against Taiwan should the island move toward
formal independence.</P>
      <P>The substantive actions the U.S. government has taken include
urging the European Union not to lift its arms embargo against China,
and concluding an agreement with Japan in an earlier security
consultative meeting that peace in the Taiwan Strait is a common
strategic objective of the two countries, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Kuan-ping of the opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union said that some people in U.S. political circles consider
Washington's "one-China policy" as a remnant of the Cold War era. He
added that some voices have been calling for new thinking in U.S.
policy toward China.</P>
      <P>Four other members of the delegation, including DPP Legislators
Lin Chung-mo, Ho Shui-sheng and Hsieh Hsin-ni, and Taiwan Solidarity
Union Legislator Huang Shih-chou, also said that they have learned
during their visit that the United States has come to understand that
China is not a peaceful rising power and that the best defense for
Taiwan is its freedom and democracy.</P>

opposed to a lifting of the European Union's ban on arms sales to

      <P>Most German lawmakers have said they consider that now is not the

    <HEADLINE>MAC WON'T OPPOSE PRIVATE CROSS-STRAIT EXHANGES: VICE CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will not
oppose or interfere with visits to China by Taiwan political parties
or private organizations if the visits are private in nature,
conducive to enhancing bilateral understanding and not detrimental to
Taiwan's national interests, MAC Vice Chairman Johnnason Liu said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait exchanges that involve government authority must
first be approved by the government or government-authorized
intermediary bodies such as the Straits Exchange Foundation, Liu
added. The MAC is Taiwan's top agency responsible for China policy
planning.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the planned visits to China by opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong, Liu said the timing is controversial given Beijing's
recent passage of its anti-secession law authorizing the use of
non-peaceful means against Taiwan should the island move toward
formal independence.</P>
      <P>The timing of the visits could mislead the international
community concerning the Taiwan people's opinions about that law, Liu
said, adding that the administration may discourage Soong and Lien
from going to China anytime soon.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu said that the administration has imposed no
restrictions on Taiwan's agricultural exports to China. Taiwan
farmers have been experiencing difficulty trying to export farm
products, including fruit, to the mainland because China's
prohibitively high import tariffs, complex and confusing customs and
quarantine procedures, and Taiwan businesses' difficulties in opening
up distribution channels on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Liu said that although both Taiwan and mainland China are World
Trade Organization (WTO) members and the two sides should engage in
trade exchanges under the WTO framework, the Chinese authorities have
been passive in helping Taiwan overcome trade barriers in China.</P>
      <P>Even worse, he added, the Chinese authorities have tried to skirt

motivated by political considerations.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the imminent visit to mainland China by a PFP group
to exchange views with Chinese authorities and to promote
agricultural exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, another MAC official
said that the MAC will not block the visit so long as it is private
in nature.</P>
      <P>The PFP group, however, must not reach any "consensus" or
"conclusions" with the Chinese authorities, must not forge either
oral or written agreements, and must not hold a press conference with
mainland officials to make any "joint announcement," the MAC official
said.</P>
      <P>Referring to KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang's recent visit to
China during which Chiang reached a 10-point consensus with the
Beijing authorities, the official said that the PFP must refrain from
entering into any form of cooperation with Chinese political or
military authorities to "avoid violating Republic of China law."</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT MULLING WHETHER TO AMEND STATUTE AMID PROBE INTO VICE CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is mulling
over whether to amend a cross-strait statute to counter the
government's probe into a KMT vice chairman's recent visit to
mainland China and to pave the way for the upcoming visit of the
party's chairman to China, a ranking KMT official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The official, who preferred to remain anonymous, said that the
party is considering whether to revise Article 33 of the Statute
Governing the Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area. However, he did not elaborate on the way in which the
party would revise the statute.</P>
      <P>Article 33 of the statute stipulates that Taiwan people,
institutions and groups are prohibited from serving as members of any
mainland Chinese institutions or groups without prior government
authorization. They are also barred from forging any alliances with
mainland citizens, institutions or groups.</P>
      <P>The official's revelation came one day after the Prosecutors'
Office of the Taiwan High Court said it had assigned a prosecutor to
look into KMT Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang's talks with Chinese
officials during his high-profile trip to China March 28- April 1.</P>
      <P>The Prosecutor's Office said the probe was launched after members
of the public filed complaints that Chiang's 10-point consensus
reached with Chinese officials constituted the crime of "concluding
an accord with a foreign government without government
authorization,' which is high treason under the Criminal Code.</P>
      <P>The KMT official reasoned that as legislators from the KMT and its
ally the People First Party (PFP) hold a majority in the 225-seat
Legislative Yuan, passing an amendment could be a feasible way to
counter the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) "get tough"
approach toward the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>However, he added that pushing through the amendment would not be
of help to Chiang, who is currently under investigation, as the law
would not be retroactive. It would only be of help in terms of
facilitating a possible meeting between KMT Chairman Lien Chan and
mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao during Lien's planned China
visit.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP have suspended indefinitely their
consultations with the DPP to protest against the probe into Chiang's
China trip. With tensions between the ruling and the opposition
parties high, the review of major issues, such as confirmation of
President Chen's Control Yuan member nominees and a statute governing
a major arms procurement from the United States, could be delayed.</P>

      <P>The United States will deal with

Relations Act (TRA), according to a report in Japan's Sankei Shimbun
datelined Washington Friday.</P>
      <P>Citing remarks by U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State

group of lawmakers from Taiwan, the newspaper reported that Shriver
also suggested U.S.-Japan cooperation to counter any contingencies in

before it adopted the Anti-Secession Law March 14, but Washington
asked Beijing in turn to rethink its plan to enact the law, according
to the report.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Shriver voiced grave concern over

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN GROUP TO OBSERVE 600TH ANNIVERSARY OF CHENG HO'S NAVAL VOYAGES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A private Taiwan group is organizing a
series of activities to observe the 600th anniversary of the naval
expeditions led by Ming dynasty mariner and explorer Cheng Ho (Zheng
He).</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Chinese Zheng He Society, founded by Liu
Tah-tsai, a retired admiral, with former Education Minister Wu Jin as
honorary chairman, will host lectures and international symposiums
and other activities to mark Cheng Ho's first naval voyage -- aimed
at increasing the prestige of the emperor of the Ming dynasty -- in
1405.</P>
      <P>According to Pan Huai-tsung, a Taipei city councilor who is also
an expert on Cheng Ho, Wu Jin will give a lecture on "Cheng Ho's
international status at the present time" at the Taipei City Council
Sunday. There will also be discussions open to the audience on the
sidelines of the lecture.</P>
      <P>In November, a number of retired officers from the British Royal
Navy and internationally renowned scholars and academics will visit
Taiwan for a symposium exclusively on Cheng Ho.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Chinese Zheng He Society will cooperate with the
Taipei City Cultural Affairs Bureau in a series of other related
activities between April and November to commemorate the mariner, who
is ranked by Life magazine as the 14th most important person of the
last millennium, according to Pan.</P>
      <P>Pan said that Cheng Ho and his fleet occupies an important page
in the world's maritime history. With the approach of the 600th
anniversary of Cheng Ho's "Western Ocean" naval expeditions, Cheng Ho
mania is sweeping the world once again.</P>
      <P>The number of Cheng Ho's voyages vary depending on the source,
but he traveled at least seven times to the "Western Ocean" with his
fleet between 1405 and 1433. The "Western Ocean" refers to Asian and
African places Cheng Ho explored, including Southeast Asia, Sumatra,
Java, Ceylon, India, Persia, the Persian Gulf, Arabia, the Red Sea as
far north as Egypt, and Africa as far south as the Mozambique
Channel.</P>
      <P>Cheng Ho's fleet comprised 30,000 men and 70 ships at its height.
He brought back to China many trophies and envoys from more than 30
kingdoms.</P>
      <P>His missions showed impressive demonstrations of organizational
ability and technological knowledge but did not lead to significant
trade, since Cheng Ho was an admiral and an official, not a merchant.</P>
      <P>One popular belief holds that after Cheng Ho's voyages, China
turned away from the sea and underwent a period of technological
stagnation. This view of history has been used in modern times to
support the notion of investment in space exploration.</P>
      <P>Other reasons leading to the suspension of China's naval efforts
included increasing pressure from resurgent Mongolian tribes from the
north, as well as China's governmental finances becoming increasingly
constrained, which melted away funding for the naval expeditions.</P>
      <P>A recent controversial theory put forward by historian Gavin
Menzies suggests that Cheng Ho circumnavigated the globe and
discovered America in the 15th century before Ferdinand Magellan and
Christopher Columbus.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER BLAMES OPPOSITION FOR LOSING TAIWAN'S GROUND TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that the
situation in which opposition parties are competing with each other
to win Beijing's favor has caused Taiwan to lose ground to China.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh during a legislative interpellation session,
in "other countries, " any politicians planning to visit China will
first inform their own governments to get an idea of what their
governments' bottom lines are, and even retired presidents will
exchange views with relevant authorities before visiting China.</P>
      <P>But this is not the case in Taiwan, where opposition politicians
are scrambling to visit China and vying for high-profile receptions
from Beijing, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>This kind of vicious partisan struggle has caused the country to
lose ground to China, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Following opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang's
visit to China last week, KMT Chairman Lien Chan and opposition
People First Party Chairman James Soong are both planning to visit
China soon.</P>
      <P>During the trip, Chiang established a so-called 10-point
consensus with the Beijing authorities without the government's
authorization, which has enraged the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have started an investigation into Chiang for alleged
treason under the Criminal Code, which the DPP claims prohibits any
person from reaching an agreement with a foreign government without
government authorization.</P>
      <P>As to whether the People's Republic of China government is
considered a "foreign government, " Hsieh said the legal
interpretation and people's perception of this question "might
change" according to the evolution of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>At present, the PRC is not considered a foreign government under
the ROC Constitution.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said it is not appropriate for him to comment further on
the case as it is under investigation by judicial authorities.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the Mainland Affairs Council is investigating whether
Chiang's act has violated the Statute Governing the Relations Between
the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, which he claimed
requires civic groups to obtain government authorization before
negotiating with China on government or political matters.</P>
      <P>The premier said the government's cross-strait policy will not
revert to the "no haste, be patient" stage but the government will
enhance "effective management" while continuing exchanges with China.</P>
      <P>He urged all political parties to prioritize Taiwan's interests
while participating in exchanges with China and to learn a lesson
from history about the Chinese communists' tactic of "allying itself
with secondary enemies to attack primary enemies."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) used to
ally itself with other opposition members to attack the KMT when the
KMT was the CCP's primary enemy, but these opposition members later
became targets of massive purges during the Cultural Revolution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA USING ECONOMIC CLOUT TO ISOLATE TAIWAN IN LATIN AMERICA: U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has been expanding its economic
and political influences in Latin America, partly to isolate Taiwan,
which has 12 diplomatic allies in the region, a U.S. official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>China has been translating its economic success -- and its search
for resources to fuel its economic development -- into greater
influence in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to Assistant
Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roger F. Noriega.</P>
      <P>The U.S. will continue to closely monitor China's outreach to
Latin America to ensure that this activity is compatible with the
region's "hard-won progress towards representative democracy, "
Noriega testified before the House International Relations
Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere.</P>
      <P>Noriega said China's interest in Latin America is driven by
economic and political factors, including the desire to isolate
Taiwan politically.</P>
      <P>"Rivalry with Taiwan plays into China's courting of Latin
American countries," he said. "A key Chinese political objective is
to isolate Taiwan, and China will actively court those 12 countries
in this Hemisphere that recognize Taiwan" diplomatically."</P>
      <P>He noted that Dominica and Grenada recently broke ties with
Taiwan in favor of China, while Jamaica has opened an embassy in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>"In the cases of Dominica and Grenada, Chinese promises of
assistance preceded recognition," Noriega said.</P>
      <P>China's rapid economic growth has created a dramatic increase in
its demand for many raw materials and foodstuffs, said Noriega.</P>
      <P>He noted that China is not only importing more raw materials from
the Western Hemisphere but is also making significant investments in
the region.</P>
      <P>Noriega said that China's investment in the region reached
US$6.32 billion by 2004, but the Chinese investment remains "well
behind" the total U.S. investment in the region of more than US$300
billion.</P>
      <P>The assistant secretary questioned whether Chinese investments
truly benefit the region, citing low-interest-rate loans requiring
work to be done by Chinese companies and investments that focus
heavily on extracting raw materials from countries rather than
providing jobs and opportunities for workers.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has also noticed an increase in military-to-military
contacts between China and several Latin American countries. "While
these contacts are minimal, we are watching them closely, and seek to
ensure that they do not undermine the commitment of Latin American
militaries to democracy and civilian control," he said.</P>
      <P>"Our policy is built upon a shared commitment to democracy, free
markets and economic integration," he said, stressing the strong and
growing partnership between the U.S. and the rest of the Western
Hemisphere is "the foundation of the region's security, prosperity,
and freedom."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two-thirds of northern Taiwan's college
students would not want to serve in the military to defend the
country even if Taiwan was under attack, according to the results of
a university survey released Friday.</P>
      <P>While military service is mandatory for all Taiwanese men over
the age of 18, a survey conducted by the Chinese Culture University's
journalism students concluded that 65 percent of college students in
northern Taiwan would be unwilling to enlist in military should the
nation come under attack from China, Taiwan's most likely enemy.</P>
      <P>Just under a month ago, China passed its Anti-Secession Law,
giving it a lawful excuse to engage in military action against Taiwan
if Beijing decides that Taiwan is pursuing independence.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese government officials expressed concern about the survey
results.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-hsun, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council under
the Executive Yuan, the nation's highest agency dealing with
cross-strait matters, said Taiwanese people should seriously ponder
the issue for the sake of the Taiwan's future generations.</P>
      <P>Liu said the government is doing everything it can to maintain
peace across the Taiwan Strait, but he urged the public to make
contributions should the nation end up in crisis. He added that he
personally would be willing and able to defend the country even
though he has long been discharged from the military.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT MUST ABIDE BY LAWS: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday that the
Legislative Yuan can revise or amend any laws as long as such moves
are constitutional, but his government must abide by and execute the
existing laws until such time as any amendments are made.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks at the Legislative Yuan amid reports
that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is mulling whether to amend a
cross-Taiwan Strait statute to counter a government investigation
into a KMT vice chairman's recent visit to China and to pave the way
for a visit of KMT Chairman Lien Chan to China.</P>
      <P>The Prosecutors' Office of the Taiwan High Court said Thursday it
had begun to look into P.K. Chiang's high-profile visit to China
between March 28 and April 1 after it received complaints that
Chiang's 10-point consensus reached with the Chinese authorities was
an act "of concluding an accord with a foreign government without
government authorization, " which is high treason under the Criminal
Code.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lu Hsiu-yen asked the premier if he would like to
see the amendment of the Statute Governing the Relations between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area, mainly Article 33,
which stipulates that Taiwan people, institutions and
groups are prohibited from serving as members of any Chinese
institution or groups without prior government authorization. They
are also barred from forging any alliance with Chinese individuals,
institutions or groups.</P>
      <P>The premier said that he will respect any legislation, revision
and amendment of the laws as long as they are constitutional.</P>
      <P>He said that many laws need to be reviewed to give them a clearer
definition, saying Taiwan is a country ruled by law and that the
government acts according to the law and should not be construed as
trying to stifle the opposition parties when it invokes the law.</P>
      <P>The premier also said that before Chiang's visit to China, the
nation's top mainland China policy charter reminded Chiang that he
could be breaking the law by making the visit.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) , advised Chiang that Article 5 of the cross-strait
statute stipulates that unless there is prior authorization from the
MAC, there should not be any kind of consultation and signing of
agreements.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Chiang's 10-point consensus is controversial,
the premier said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO FUNNEL NT$3 BILLION ANNUALLY INTO ENERGY DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Friday that
the government will earmark NT$3 billion (US$94.93 million) per annum
for an energy research and development fund as part of its effort to
make Taiwan nuclear-free.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Taipei symposium on energy for the future, Lu noted
that the government finalized the "nuclear-free country action plan"
in 2003 and is working toward the goal of applying sustainable energy
to the industrial sector and the public.</P>
      <P>Lu pointed out that Taiwan is a maritime country that has no oil
resources of its own, with 97 percent of its energy imported from
other countries.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, she went on, there is ample sunshine, sea wind and
geothermal resources in Taiwan, which make it a perfect environment
for developing non-polluting, sustainable energy.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, President Chen Shui-bian promised soon after his
first inauguration in 2000 that a solar electric system would be
installed in the Presidential Office, a promise that was honored one
year later.</P>
      <P>Lu said developing the environmental protection industry is one
of the main objectives of the government's "challenge 2008" national
development project.</P>
      <P>Also, the government has worked out a plan to establish an
"environmental protection incubation center" that will integrate
industrial, government, research and academic resources to enhance
the standard of Taiwan's environmental protection industry, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol aimed at
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the island offers full support for
the protocol, Lu said.</P>
      <P>She said the Cabinet, in reaction to the implementation of the
protocol, has set up a task force to promote the use of recycled
energy, enhance the efficiency of energy use and phase out industries
with high carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>In addition, the government will hold a national energy
conference in June to discuss in which direction Taiwan should adjust
its energy structure, she said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, asked by the press to comment on reports that
China-based Taiwanese businessmen have been coerced to endorse
Beijing's Anti-Secession Law, the vice president said there are many
other ideal investment environments in other parts of the world and
she urged businessmen to reconsider their investment plans.</P>
      <P>She said that while Taiwan has achieved democracy and freedom
after decades of hard work, it is regrettable that there is still a
group of people so desperate to chase the dollar in China that they
are willing to place their human rights in constant jeopardy.</P>

billion (US$3.9 billion) in tax revenues in March, an increase of
NT$6.2 billion, or 5.3 percent, over the year-earlier level, a

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT DISPUTES DIFFICULT TO BE HANDLED UNDER WTO FRAMEWORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 7 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Disputes between Taiwan and mainland China
are difficult to deal with under the framework of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), government officials said Friday.</P>
      <P>Responding to suggestions that the government use the WTO
framework to protect Taiwan businessmen's interests in China,
officials of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) acknowledged
that it is very difficult to use WTO rules to arbitrate issues across
the strait that are not economy-related due to the special
relationship between the two sides.</P>
      <P>They were referring to a recent news report by a radio broadcast
network based in Beijing that some Taiwan businessmen's associations
based in Fujian Province have issued a joint statement calling for
support for Beijing's Anti-Secession Law aimed at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA officials, the news is not an economic
matter and is therefore out of the WTO's mandate.</P>
      <P>The Council of Mainland Affairs has blasted Beijing for forcing
Taiwan businessmen to take side and voice support for its
Anti-Secession Law that justifies "non-peaceful means" to counter
Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan officials stationed at the WTO said that they
are closely monitoring the approaches being adopted by Beijing toward 
Taiwan businessmen in China.</P>
      <P>If hard evidence regarding Chinese violations of the WTO's
multilateral trade regulations are found, they will immediately make
moves under the WTO framework to seek justice for Taiwan businessmen,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>They also warned of a "China fever" in view of the various
overtures offered by Beijing to Taiwan's farmers, and urged farmers
to stay cool and not to harbor "wishful thinking" until such time as
Beijing actually implements concrete measures.</P>
      <P>Their call came at a time when various political parties in
Taiwan are planning to send delegation to China for talks mainly on
agricultural exchanges after a mission of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), led by Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang, paid a visit to
China in late March and reached a 10-point consensus with Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) officials.</P>
      <P>The 10-point consensus touches on a wide range of issues, such as
agriculture, air links, labor affairs, financial cooperation and the
protection of Taiwan investors. CCP officials promised to draft
preferential policies for agricultural imports from Taiwan and voiced
welcome to Taiwan farmers to settle in five provinces.</P>
      <P>Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao said on March 14 following Beijing's
enactment of the Anti-Secession Law that China is willing to open its
markets to Taiwan farm produce.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a legislative mission of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) is slated to depart for China next week to hold talks on
Taiwan's farm exports. PFP lawmakers have pledged to abide by law of
the Republic of China and said that they will not do anything that
hurts Taiwan's national interests during its China visit.</P>
      <P>A KMT delegation is also expected to travel to China later this
month.</P>

Applause rang out from a huge crowd this morning at the end of
the funeral of John Paul II, the little-known Polish cardinal chosen
as pope in 1978. After a Mass that lasted about two-and-a-half hours,
his plain cypress coffin marked with a cross and an "M" for the
Virgin Mary was brought out from St. Peter's Basilica and placed
before an altar in St. Peter's Square. The bells of St. Peter's
tolled and 12 pallbearers with white gloves, white ties and tails
then carried the coffin on their shoulders back inside for burial,
after holding the coffin to face the multitude for a prolonged
moment, as the great bell of St. Peter's pealed, and waves of
applause swept through the audience.

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-SECESSION LAW AFFECTS E.U. LIFTING OF CHINA ARMS BAN: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's enactment of a law authorizing the
use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan has derailed progress in the
European Union's plan to lift its arms embargo against China,
Taiwan's top mainland policy planner said Friday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu was responding to a
German media report that quoted senior German officials as saying
that the E.U. is unlikely to lift its 16-year-old ban on arms sales
to China this year.</P>
      <P>According to the report, lifting the arms embargo against China
requires the unanimous consent of all 25 E.U. member states. Except
for Germany and France, all other E.U. members are skeptical about
the aptness of ending the arms ban now.</P>
      <P>Because of strong opposition from the United States, the report
said, Great Britain, a U.S. ally who will be the E.U.'s presiding
country for the second half of 2005, is not expected to handle the
arms ban issue. Against this backdrop, the report said, the E.U. will
be unable to lift its arms ban against China until 2006.</P>
      <P>Asked about his view on the report, Wu said Taiwan, the United
States and Japan have all voiced explicit opposition to the E.U.'s
plan to end its arms ban against China.</P>
      <P>Noting that many E.U. defense technologies have been provided by
the United States, Wu said the E.U. cannot ignore the possibility of
Washington retaliating against its move.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu said he is convinced that China's enactment of
its Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan has also discouraged the E.U.
from lifting its arms ban because the legislation is widely believed
to have had an adverse impact on Asia-Pacific peace and stability.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the German media report, Ministry of Foreign
Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said the ministry would welcome any E.U.
decision to maintain its arms ban against China.</P>
      <P>Should the report is correct, Lu said, it indicates that the E.U.
has paid heed to the grave impact of China's new legislation on
Asia-Pacific peace and stability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. TRIED TO STOP ANTI-SECESSION LAW: U.S. OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 7 (CNA)
(By George Liu/S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States tried hard to stop
China from adopting its Anti-Secession Law, but failed; therefore,
all the United States can do now is urge both sides of the Taiwan
Strait to seek all opportunities for dialogue, a ranking U.S.
official said Wednesday in Washington.</P>
      <P>Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific
Affairs Randall G. Schriver made the remarks in a report to the House
International Relations Committee.</P>
      <P>The report, released Thursday, addressed the recent passage of
the Anti-Secession Law by the National People's Congress (NPC) of the
People's Republic of China and its impact on cross-strait and
U.S.-China relations.</P>
      <P>It said that since Dec. 17 last year, when the Chinese began
publicly discussing the likelihood that the legislation would be
brought to the NPC for consideration, the U.S. has been very clear,
"including at the highest levels of the [Bush] administration --
Secretary Rice and former Secretary Powell -- that we believed such
legislation would be unhelpful, and a step in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>"Instead, we have counseled taking advantage of warming trends in
the cross-strait relationship to further peaceful dialogue that would
be in the interests of the people on both sides of the Strait, "
Schriver said. U.S. efforts to make this position known to the
Chinese, he said, included:</P>
      <P>-- In January, former U.S. Deputy Secretary Richard Armitage and
then-Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley met with the
director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, Chen
Yunlin, who was in Washington to convey China's intentions with
regard to the legislation, and expressed the reservations of the U.S.</P>
      <P>-- In a February visit to Beijing, National Security Council
Senior Director for Asian Affairs Michael Green told senior Chinese
leaders that passage of the legislation would undermine cross-strait
stability.</P>
      <P>-- In a letter to former Chinese Ambassador Yang Jiechi, former
Under Secretary for Political Affairs Marc Grossman urged China not
to complicate the cross-strait relationship and, rather than proceed
with the law, to consider instead ways to resume dialogue with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>-- On the eve of the ratification vote by the NPC, the charge
d'affaires at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing urged China not to pass the
legislation.</P>
      <P>-- In their public statements as well, U.S. officials have
cautioned against any hardening of positions and urged instead that
the two sides look to resume their dialogue.</P>
      <P>While Beijing's leaders claim the law simply restates China's
long-standing policy, Schriver said the U.S. was "deeply concerned
about Article 8 of the legislation, " which states: "If the Taiwan
independence secessionist forces should act under any name or by any
means to cause the fact of Taiwan's secession from China, or that
major incidents entailing Taiwan's secession from China should occur,
or that possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be
exhausted, the state shall employ non-peaceful means and other
necessary measures to protect China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity. The State Council and the Central Military Commission
shall decide on and execute the non-peaceful means and other
necessary measures and report to the National People's Congress
Standing Committee."</P>
      <P>This statement, now codified in law, about a non-peaceful
response raises additional questions regarding how China will respond
to what it perceives as ongoing efforts in Taiwan to define itself as
a separate identity, including steps that fall short of declaring de
jure independence, Schriver pointed out.</P>
      <P>Given the aggressive military build-up opposite Taiwan --
particularly the deployment of a large number of short-range
ballistic missiles -- he said the U.S. has cause for strong concern.</P>
      <P>He said passage of the legislation clearly runs counter to
current positive trends in cross-strait relations, including the
temporary implementation of direct charter passenger flights for the
first time since 1949 between Taiwan and China, and the Chinese
delegation that traveled to Taiwan for the funeral of former Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, upon passage of the legislation and on "our
finally having an opportunity to review the actual text passed by the
NPC, we were unequivocal in our expression of concern."</P>
      <P>In the view of the U.S., the Chinese government clearly had
options other than moving this legislation to the NPC for
consideration. "But it would seem that a combination of domestic
political factors, an approval process too far advanced to allow the
leadership to pull it back, and an urgency about the direction a
democratic Taiwan would take in the next few years led to the law's
passage," he analyzed.</P>
      <P>"That's the situation we have to deal with now, despite the very
best efforts of the administration and the concerns that have been
expressed by members of Congress in resolutions and by the American
press," he said.</P>
      <P>He concluded that passage of the legislation has undermined,
rather than raised, confidence and trust across the strait. "We
continue to be concerned about an unhelpful cycle of action and
reaction."</P>
      <P>The Taiwan public and its authorities have understandably focused
on the legislation's provisions for the use of non-peaceful means.
Statements by leaders in Taiwan equating the legislation to a
unilateral change of the status quo and the March 26 demonstration in
Taipei reflect the perception that the law does not serve the
interests of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Although passage of the Anti-Secession Law has brought a new
challenge to U.S. efforts to promote a peaceful resolution to
cross-strait differences, he said, "We do not believe it requires a
shift in our approach to the issue.</P>
      <P>"We remain committed to our longstanding 'one-China' policy,
which has helped both sides to prosper and contributes to peace. We
are making clear that we do not support Taiwan independence, oppose
unilateral changes by either side to the status quo -- particularly

    <HEADLINE>PFP LAWMAKER ON LOW-PROFILE VISIT TO CHINA FOR AGRICULTURE TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislator Tsay Sheng-jia of the opposition
People First Party left Taiwan Friday for a low-profile visit to
China where he hopes to open up a new market for Taiwan's
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Asked at the airport which cities he will be visiting, Tsay
replied that he was going to Hong Kong, but then added he has been
invited by China to give a speech on agriculture. His cautiousness
reflects an on-going controversy over who should represent Taiwan in
talks with China.</P>
      <P>He said since Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization,
the country's farmers have been hard hit by increased imports of
foreign agricultural products, yet the government is only concerned
that they will be "bought off" if their produce is exported to China.</P>
      <P>"It's a sad day when even trade in agricultural products has to
be politicized," a disillusioned Tsay said.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's tea, fruits and other farm products are quite
competitive, as they are selling well in Japan, Hong Kong, Canada and
other countries. "I don't understand what's wrong with adding China
as a market for our farm products," Tsay said.</P>
      <P>Tsay said that while in China, he will only speak on Taiwan's
agriculture and will not go to Beijing. "Please don't dub me a
pro-this or that," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC CAUTIOUS OF BEIJING'S ISOLATION PLAN: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 8 (CNA)
(By Wayne Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will exercise caution
over Beijing's recent move to isolate Taiwan carried out in Latin
America, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said during an
interview that the ROC will keep a close eye on China's recent
attempts to isolate the island by trying to lure away its handful of
diplomatic allies in Central and South America.</P>
      <P>His remarks came following a statement made earlier by United
States Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs
Roger F. Noriega, who noted that China is attempting to extend its
diplomatic reach into Latin America by providing countries there with
economic, political and military incentives, hoping they will
eventually cut diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Beijing's isolation plan has succeeded with several of Taiwan's
12 diplomatic allies in the area, including Dominica and Grenada,
which recently severed diplomatic relations with the ROC.</P>
      <P>China has been investing heavily in these countries with an
estimated US$6.32 billion as of the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>Lu said that ROC will try to maintain sound relations with its
diplomatic allies by inviting their officials to the island to
further discuss economic cooperation plans.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORLD HEALTH DAY 'HANDICAPPED' WITHOUT TAIWAN IN WHA: HEALTH MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels, April 7 (CNA)
(By Lo Yuan-hsiao and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>World Health Day is "handicapped" because
of Taiwan's exclusion from the World Health Organization, ROC Health
Minister Hou Sheng-mao said in Belgium Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a news conference timed to coincide with World Health Day on
April 7, Taiwan's health chief said diseases know no political
boundaries, and pointed to the fact that every year 1.5 million
flights are made to and from Asia, showing that the world is
inexorably linked to the region, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Hou said, Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO for political
reasons has created a big loophole in this global network and poses a
threat to the health of everyone.</P>
      <P>Although China claims that Taiwan is a part of its territory,
Taiwan is not included in China's health care system and China did
not aid Taiwan in 2003 when severe acute respiratory syndrome broke
out on the island, Hou said.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-teh, a Taiwanese doctor who practices in Switzerland,
told the news conference that Taiwan's absence from the WHO makes it
impossible for foreign travelers to learn from the WHO Web site what
health risks they may encounter, if any, during a trip to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also, Huang said, foreign medical workers cannot share their
Taiwan counterparts' experiences through the WHO Web site.</P>
      <P>She disputed the argument that Taiwan is not allowed to join the
World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer because it is not a United
Nations member, saying that Switzerland had long been a WHA observer
before it joined the U.N. in 2002.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has tried to join the WHA as an observer since 1997 but
has not succeeded.</P>

      <P>MOE Bureau of International Cultural and Educational Relations

    <HEADLINE>VP ANNETTE LU HAILS CHEN'S PRESENCE AT POPE'S FUNERAL A GODSEND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu hailed as a
godsend President Chen Shui-bian's attendance at Pope John Paul II's
funeral in the Vatican Friday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony of an activity promoting Taipei
County's tourism and cultural development, Lu said the death of the
pope was sorrowful.</P>
      <P>"But God has brought dignity to the people of Taiwan through the
pope. For decades, it was the first time that our president could
visit Rome in his capacity as our head of state," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on China's refusal to send any envoy to attend Pope
John Paul II's funeral in protest of the Vatican's invitation of
Chen, Lu said she doesn't think that China is qualified to attend the
occasion.</P>
      <P>"The pope had preached love and religious freedom throughout his
life. China doesn't allow religious freedom and has a poor human
rights record. It has even enacted a law codifying the use of
non-peaceful means against Taiwan," Lu said.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived at Da Vinci Airport aboard a China Airlines charter
plane early Friday, making him the first Republic of China president
ever to set foot in Europe.</P>
      <P>He received courteous treatment befitting his status as the ROC
head of state upon his arrival in Rome. A Vatican protocol official,
ROC Ambassador to the Vatican Tou Chou-seng and ROC Representative to
Italy Lin Ki-tseng boarded the plane to welcome Chen.</P>
      <P>Italian media and BBC referred to Chen as the "Taiwanese
president" in their reports, while the ROC national flag and footage
featuring Chen visiting the Vatican Embassy in Taipei to pay his
respects to the pope earlier this week was also shown on the big
screen in St. Peter's Square.</P>
      <P>After attending the pope's funeral, Chen is scheduled to make an
inspection tour of the ROC Embassy in the Vatican to boost the morale
of all embassy staff.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage, including Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan

    <HEADLINE>EPA BACKPEDALS ON STATEMENT THAT TOXIN ALGAE WAS FOUND IN RESERVOIRS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Apparently contradicting its own statement
three days earlier that said that 14 of the islands reservoirs were
found to have potentially harmful algae, the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) Friday said that no toxic algae has been found
in any of the island's reservoirs.</P>
      <P>The new statement said none of the samples taken from the 37
reservoirs around the island tested positively for the algae. The
algae in question can produce the peptide toxin microcystin, which is
harmful to people when ingested in concentration.</P>
      <P>In the EPA report three days ago, officials said that the algae
is only toxic after it dies and the amount of blue-green algae
observed in the water so far has been minimal.</P>
      <P>They went on to say then that September would be a critical month
since the propagation of the algae will reach its zenith in summer
and then begin to die.</P>
      <P>It is unclear if the new EPA statement Friday was referring to
whether no living algae was observed in any reservoir or if no dead
algae has yet to be detected.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN AT POPE'S FUNERAL RAISES TAIWAN'S PROFILE: LAWMAKERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers across the political spectrum
took pride in the high-profile treatment President Chen Shui-bian
received in Rome at the funeral of Pope John Paul II Friday.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chen Chin-jun, who is the secretary for the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party caucus at the Legislative Yuan, said he
was moved to learn from reports that Chen sat in the first row with
other state leaders and that the entire world was watching.</P>
      <P>Noting that the trip was hastily-arranged, Chen Chin-jun said
that it will be a demanding for the president to fly to and from Rome
over only two or three days, adding that "the president has brought
the country to the front row of the world; we really appreciate what
he has done for the country."</P>
      <P>Taiwan Solidarity Union Legislator Lo Chih-ming, who is the
party's convener at the Legislative Yuan, said the high-profile
treatment President Chen received from the Holy See is evidence of
the firm ties between Taiwan and the Holy See.</P>
      <P>Lo said the publicity the president has received by his
attendance at the pope's funeral has significantly enhanced the
country's international profile.</P>
      <P>Thanks partly goes to the first lady who visited the Vatican in
2003 to mark the pope's 25th year in office, further cementing the
country's ties with the Holy See, Lo said.</P>
      <P>An extra feather in Taiwan's cap was Beijing's refusal to send a
delegation to the funeral upon learning that President Chen would be
in attendance. The ROC rarely wins a political tug of war with China
on the international stage, according to Lo. </P>
      <P>Lawmaker Chen Chih-pin, the People First Party's convener at the
Legislative Yuan, concurred, saying that the Vatican's decision to
let President Chen attend the pope's funeral is a sign of the firm
relations between the two sides, and the president's trip to Rome has
successfully projected the country's image as a peace-loving state
onto the international stage.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang lawmaker Su Chi said the president's attendance at the
funeral was a good thing, but warned against reading too much
political significance into it. The trip, he said, is for the
president to pay his last respects to the pope, which is a religious
event.</P>
      <P>The trip is hardly an indication of future ROC-Vatican ties, Su
said. That will depend on who will succeed Pope John Paul II and how
China will respond to the Vatican's offer to establish diplomatic
relations with Beijing.</P>

      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) urged the Legislative Yuan Friday to approve as
soon as possible a special budget of NT$137.7 billion (US$43.7
billion) for the 10 new major construction projects for this year.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the budget, should it be approved, will
make a contribution of 0.87 percentage points to the country's annual
economic growth rate, CEPD officials said.</P>
      <P>According to an estimate by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, Taiwan will enjoy an economic growth of
4.21 percent this year, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh has, however, set a target of 4.5 percent
growth for this year although the country's economy is facing various
potential negative factors internationally, including rises in oil
prices, an expansion of the U.S. trade deficit and the depreciation
of the U.S. dollar. China's efforts to cool down its overheated
economy and the recent enactment of its Anti-Secession Law, are
another concern they said.</P>
      <P>The government has been trying to do more to secure the target
set by the premier, including easing restrictions and amending
outdated laws while expanding domestic demands by making more public
investments.</P>
      <P>Also, they added, the government needs the cooperation of the
legislature in this regard.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
had a diplomatic rendezvous with his Honduran counterpart, Ricardo
Maduro, at Da Vinci Airport in Rome Friday after both of them
attended Pope John Paul II's funeral earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Chen held a closed-door meeting with Maduro at a VIP room before
they boarded a China Airlines (CAL) charter plane bound for Taiwan.
It marked the first time that a CAL charter plane has ever carried
two heads of state at the same time.</P>
      <P>Maduro, who has been to Taiwan several times, is scheduled to
travel from Taiwan to the Japanese island of Okinawa to attend an
annual conference of the American Development Bank.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Rome early Friday to attend the pope's funeral,
making him the first incumbent ROC president ever to visit the
Vatican since the two countries established formal diplomatic ties in
1942. Chen is also the first serving ROC president ever to set foot
in Europe. The Vatican is the ROC's only diplomatic ally in Europe.</P>
      <P>Chen joined with 200-plus presidents, prime ministers and royals
as well as hundreds of thousands of citizens from around the world to
attend the pope's funeral at St. Peter's Square, which started at 10
a.m. Friday.</P>
      <P>After the funeral, Chen paid a visit to the ROC Embassy in the
Vatican, which is an estate of the Holy See. In addition to looking
at the embassy facilities, he gave a brief pep talk to boost the
morale of all embassy staff.</P>
      <P>Chen then dined with members of a pro-Taiwan group in the Italian
parliament, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
Chamber of Deputies, influential Italian politicians, as well as
staff members of the ROC Embassy in the Vatican and the ROC
Representative Office in Italy.</P>
      <P>Addressing the occasion, Chen called for leniency and
reconciliation among political parties at home and between the two
sides of Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Only leniency and reconciliation will pave the way for harmony
among the different political parties and ethnic groups, and is the

    <HEADLINE>VICE DEFENSE MINISTER URGES QUICK PASSAGE OF ARMS PROCUREMENT PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice Defense Minister Tsai Ming-hsien on
Saturday urged the Legislative Yuan to pass the bill for a major arms
procurement plan quickly.</P>
      <P>Tsai said legislators from across the party spectrum should put
aside their differences and make the nation's interests a top
priority and pass the major arms procurement package for six Patriot
PAC-III anti-missile batteries, eight diesel-electric submarines and
a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine aircraft from the United States
under a special budget.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while attending a seminar during which he
cited a poll conducted by the Chinese Culture University to back up
his appeal.</P>
      <P>The poll found that 65 percent of northern Taiwan college
students are unwilling to be enlisted into the military should the
nation come under attack from China. Among these respondents, 30.5
percent said that Taiwan couldn't withstand an attack by China, while
25.6 percent said that they would only be cannon fodder if they
fought.</P>
      <P>Tsai interpreted that two-thirds of the students wouldn't want to
fight because they think that Taiwan doesn't have the capability to
withstand a Chinese military attack and that resistance would be
useless.</P>
      <P>To root out such defeatism, Tsai said, Taiwan's military must
build up its combat capability to meet the threat from China.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that legislators could have a rational
discussion so as to put the statute for the major arms procurement
and its special budget up for review and that the proposal could
clear the Legislative Yuan quickly.</P>
      <P>If the major arms procurement package can't be passed, then
Taiwan will be unable to show to the United States and the
international community that it is determined to defend itself, Tsai
said.</P>
      <P>China would be more than happy to see the arms procurement
proposal fail, he added.</P>
      <P>However, National Taiwan University professor Chang Ya-chung,
speaking on the same occasion, didn't see eye to eye with Tsai on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Chang said that cross-strait issues are political in nature, and
that if political figures can't resolve the problems and only ask
young people to go to war, it is only natural that the young people
are unwilling to serve in the military.</P>
      <P>The legislature has failed to put the statute on the major arms
procurement on the Legislative agenda for review since the start of
its first session in February because the opposition Kuomintang and
People First Party -- which together command a slight majority in the
legislature -- do not agree with the government's decision to finance
the package in a special budget, which is exempt from the legal cap on
government spending.</P>
      <P>The statute has been blocked twice since the Cabinet lowered the
ceiling price for the procurement package from the original NT$610.8
billion when it was first proposed in mid-2004 to $480 billion
(US$15.38 billion) this year because a plan to make the submarines in
Taiwan was dropped and because the new Taiwan dollar had appreciated
against the U.S. dollar.</P>

      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) on Saturday
denied that KMT Chairman Lien Chan will visit mainland China on May
10.</P>
      <P>The KMT Culture and Information Committee said that the report
that Lien will lead three party vice chairmen to visit China and that
KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-Chen will visit China soon to arrange
for their trip was "unfounded."</P>
      <P>Lien's trip to mainland China is still being planned, the

      <P>KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang visited China March 28-April 1,
during which Beijing invited Lien to visit and the latter gladly
accepted.</P>
      <P>Chiang, however, is currently under investigation to see if he
violated the Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of
the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area for reaching a 10-point
consensus with Beijing authorities during his visit. 
</P>
      <P>The consensus covered a wide range of issues, including
cross-strait transportation, agriculture, the rights of mainland

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Friday that the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) is very important,
expressing the hope that the United States can thoroughly fulfill its
obligations under the act.</P>
      <P>A report appeared Friday in the Japanese daily Sankei Shimbun

told a visiting group of Taiwanese legislators in Washington, D.C.,
Monday that the United States would deal with contingencies in the

      <P>The newspaper also reported that the U.S. official proposed
U.S.-Japan cooperation to deal with any contingencies in the strait.</P>
      <P>In response to media questions raised about the report, MOFA
spokesman Michel Lu said that Taiwan insists that the cross-strait
issue should be resolved peacefully and that it will also make
necessary contributions to maintaining peace and stability in the
strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also hopes that neighboring countries can jointly work on
regional security, he added.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the U.S. State Department clarified the report the

peace and democracy embraced by the late Pope John Paul II will have
apositive influence on cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lai Ching-teh, a whip of the DPP legislative caucus, said
President Chen Shui-bian's attendance at the pope's funeral on behalf
of the 23 million people of Taiwan has played up the island's status
as an independent, sovereign state.</P>
      <P>Lai pointed out that in addition to committing himself to
reforming the Catholic Church, the pope also renounced non-peaceful
means and spoke out against war on many occasions, including
condemning the United States for sending troops to Panama, Grenada
and Iraq.</P>
      <P>He said Catholicism can be a reference for domestic politics and
cross-strait relations and that it is regrettable that China did not
send any representative to attend the pope's funeral.</P>

      <P>The state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC)
will cut its carbon dioxide emissions by 500,000 tons in four years
in reaction to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol aiming at
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, CPC officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Under the guidance of the Ministry of Economic Affairs'
Industrial Development Bureau, the CPC -- the largest oil supplier in
Taiwan and the only one supplying natural gas -- started to survey
its greenhouse gas emissions in 2002 and completed a survey report
last month.</P>
      <P>According to the CPC, the carbon dioxide released by coal is four
times that of natural gas in producing one unit of energy, while the
carbon dioxide produced by fuel oil is 1.4 times that of natural gas.</P>
      <P>With natural gas releasing significantly less carbon dioxide, it
is now used in the CPC's refineries in Kaohsiung, Talin and Linyuan,
the officials said.</P>
      <P>They said the greenhouse gas survey has helped the CPC determine
direct and indirect sources of emissions and establish an open and

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian returned to Taipei
Saturday after concluding his 48-hour "journey of peace and
commemoration" that took him to the Vatican to attend Pope John Paul
II's funeral.</P>
      <P>In addition to joining presidents, prime ministers, royals and
pilgrims from around the world in bidding farewell to the pope, Chen
also became the first sitting Republic of China president ever to set
foot in Europe.</P>
      <P>After his history-making visit, Chen had a diplomatic rendezvous
with his Honduran counterpart, Ricardo Maduro, at Da Vinci Airport in
Rome. Maduro had also traveled from his country to the Vatican to
attend the pope funeral.</P>
      <P>Chen held a closed-door meeting with Maduro at a VIP room before
they boarded a China Airlines (CAL) charter plane bound for Taiwan.
It marked the first time that a CAL charter plane has ever carried
two heads of state at the same time.</P>
      <P>Maduro, who has been to Taiwan several times, will travel from
Taiwan to the Japanese island of Okinawa to attend an annual
conference of the Central American Bank for Economic Integration
later in the day.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived in Rome early Friday to attend the pope's funeral,
making him the first incumbent ROC president ever to visit the
Vatican since the two countries established formal diplomatic ties in
1942. Chen is also the first serving ROC president ever to set foot
in Europe. The Vatican is the ROC's only diplomatic ally in Europe.</P>
      <P>After the funeral, Chen paid a visit to the ROC Embassy in the
Vatican, which is an estate of the Holy See. In addition to looking
at the embassy facilities, he gave a brief pep talk to boost the
morale of all embassy staff.</P>
      <P>Chen then dined with members of a pro-Taiwan group in the Italian
parliament, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the
Chamber of Deputies, influential Italian politicians, as well as
staff members of the ROC Embassy in the Vatican and the ROC
Representative Office in Italy.</P>
      <P>Addressing the occasion, Chen called for leniency and
reconciliation among political parties at home and between the two
sides of Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Only leniency and reconciliation will pave the way for harmony
among the different political parties and ethnic groups, and is the
cornerstone for peace with China," Chen said.</P>

Saturday that if he wins the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) chairmanship
election, he will invite Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng --
another contender for the post, to co-lead the party, and that if he
loses the election, he will give Wang his full support.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks while speaking to more than 1,000 supporters
at a labor entertainment and education center in Kaohsiung, southern
Taiwan to drum up support for his bid for the party's top post.</P>
      <P>The supporters waved KMT party and ROC national flags and banners
in support of Ma, with some of the more enthusiastic supporters
cheering Ma from time to time.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that the July 16 election will not be a battle that

battle."</P>
      <P>He also took the opportunity to scathingly criticize the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) for its poor handling of the
economy and diplomatic affairs.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's per capita income is now lower than it was in 2000 when
President Chen Shui-bian first came to power, and the unemployment
rate has been high during the period of DPP rule, Ma claimed. He
added that he wants to galvanize the people's will and be elected
party chairman to put the nation back on a proper course. </P>
      <P>He also said that he aims to rebuild the pivotal values of the
party, oppose Taiwan independence and the "one country, two systems"
formula, advocate the signing of a 50-year cross-strait peace
agreement, maintain the cross-strait status quo, and show zero
tolerance for corrupt "black gold" politics so as to regain the

      <P>Taiwanese are most concerned about their
safety and worry life in the future will only get worse, according to
the results of a survey released Saturday.</P>
      <P>The findings of the survey also revealed that many Taiwanese do
not know how to protect themselves even though they think they live
in a dangerous environment.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the Taiwan branch of the U.S.-based
DuPont Co. March 25-28.</P>
      <P>Nearly 80 percent of the 1,075 respondents said food and traffic
safety issues are their greatest concern among the five categories
presented to them in the survey on citizens' sense of security.</P>
      <P>In the food category, 77.4 percent said disease-infected pork
poses the greatest threat to them, while 74.4 percent pointed to
residual pesticide on fruits and vegetables, and 73.4 percent
mentioned the quality of take-out plastic bags.</P>
      <P>In the traffic categories, 85.2 percent mentioned concerns over
the possibility of an accident, 81.9 percent pointed to the potential
of sexual assault by taxi drivers, and 70.9 percent mentioned
long-distance bus operations.</P>
      <P>Despite the insecurity revealed by the survey, 40 percent of
Taiwanese lack the basic know-how to protect themselves, with 80.7
percent not knowing which bus companies are operating under a legal
license, and 64.8 percent saying they jaywalk or run red lights.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 34.3 percent acknowledged that they do not know how to
properly wash off the residual pesticides on food, and 28.4 percent
said they do not pay attention to restaurants' sanitation.</P>
      <P>The study also indicated that many Taiwanese are pessimistic
about the future, with 46.6 percent saying they think their life will
get worse in the future, 36.6 percent saying it will remain about the
same, and only 6.3 percent saying they hold an optimistic view.</P>
      <P>As to who should be responsible for enhancing the public's sense

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday that
there is no need for Education Minister Tu Cheng-sheng to step down
over a recent heated verbal exchange with an opposition lawmaker.</P>
      <P>A fierce argument broke out between Tu and opposition People
First Party Legislator Lee Ching-hua during a legislative session on
Thursday after the minister spoke up for Taiwan Solidarity Union
Chairman Shu Chin-chiang's controversial visit to Japan's Yasukuni
Shrine honoring Japanese war dead, where the names of 28,000-plus
Taiwanese soldiers are also listed.</P>
      <P>Opposition legislators have demanded that Tu be replaced over his
remarks.</P>
      <P>Coming to Tu's defense, Hsieh said that if he were Tu, he would
also lose his temper if he were called "shameless" by a legislator.</P>
      <P>It would encourage the continuation of such a culture of abuse in
the legislature if Tu were to step down over the incident, Hsieh
said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that he will make an evaluation of all his Cabinet
members in August in consideration of a possible reshuffle and that
the personnel adjustment will not be aimed at Tu.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks in response to questions from the
press while attending an event celebrating the first "international
guide dog month" held by the Taiwan Guide Dog Association.</P>
      <P>Addressing the event, Hsieh said the trust between humans and
dogs marks a relationship of coexistence and reconciliation that
transcends biological instinct.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are only 11 guide dogs in Taiwan at present,
Hsieh said there is still a lot of room for building an environment
friendly to challenged citizens.</P>
      <P>With the training of new guide dogs lagging behind demand, the
government will provide subsidies to guardians of the visually
impaired to improve their welfare, he said.</P>
      <P>According to the association, Kaohsiung City was the first city
in Taiwan to grant the right of way to guide dogs in February last
year, giving them the right to enter government agencies and public
establishments.</P>

coverage Saturday to Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian's
attendance at Pope John Paul II's funeral in the Vatican the previous
day.</P>
      <P>The Asahi Shimbun said in a report carried in its international
news section that Chen's presence at the pope's funeral in defiance
of China's persistent attempts to isolate Taiwan has attracted much
attention. Because of Beijing's diplomatic embargo, the ROC's head of
state has often been barred from international occasions.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-datelined report pointed out that the Vatican is the
only European country that maintains formal diplomatic relations with
the ROC and that Chen is the first serving ROC president ever to
visit the Vatican.</P>
      <P>While the Vatican is seeking to forge ties with China, the report
said, Chen's presence at the pope's funeral was seen to check such a
trend.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the Vatican has been working to repair
its ties with China since the 1990s. The report said the number of
Catholic followers in China, including members of underground
churches, exceeds 10 million.</P>
      <P>The report also said Vatican officials were divided over whether
the Holy See should switch its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to
China. Following John Paul II's death, all incumbent Vatican
officials will step down. The report said it will up to the new pope
to decide how to resolve the dilemma.</P>
      <P>The report further said President Chen had expressed his
gratitude for the Italian government's granting him courteous
treatment befitting his status as the ROC head of state.</P>
      <P>The Yomiuri Shimbun daily also carried a dispatch from Taipei
saying that Taiwan's government regards Chen's attendance at the

Europe by a serving Republic of China president.</P>
      <P>Chen said the administration is willing to engage in frank
dialogue with the opposition leaders prior to their planned visits to
China.</P>
      <P>Amid reports that Lien is keen on accepting an invitation to
visit Beijing following KMT Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang's recent
high-profiled China visit, the president said that Lien had
previously served as premier and as vice president, which he said
should make him familiar with national security and the political
risks in cross-strait interaction.</P>
      <P>"After all, the People's Republic of China is not a country ruled
by law, which is an undisputable fact, " Chen added.</P>
      <P>Chen asked whether Lien would allow a "normalization of
cross-strait relations to be conducted through non-normalized
channels" if he were the head of state.</P>
      <P>"Can cross-strait dialogue and consultations be conducted rashly,
recklessly and willfully without regard for national sovereignty and
public authority of the government?" the president further asked.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that he is willing to support Lien's visit to China
and that his administration can authorize Lien to discuss certain
topics with Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>However, he added that Lien should be aware that consensus must
first be achieved among the various political parties on issues
involving national sovereignty and the government's public authority
for the sake of the best interests of the nation.</P>
      <P>"What's so difficult for him to talk with the government and with
me first?" Chen asked.</P>
      <P>The president said that unity is strength, adding that when he
and the leaders from more than 150 countries gathered in the Vatican
Friday, it was a picture of unity of the international community in
response to the late pontiff's call for peace and reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Faced with the hostile and obvious threat from the other side of
the Taiwan Strait, especially when most of the Taiwan people are
demanding that China address their desire for peace and democracy,
Chen said, the people might have to endure an irreversible crisis if
Taiwan cannot unify and if some opposition parties fall into
Beijing's trap in its attempts to cause division within Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that his administration will follow a
"reconciliation without flinching" and "steadfastness without
confrontation" policy in the wake of China's recent passage of its
Anti-Secession Law which authorizes the use of non-peaceful means
against Taiwan should the island move toward independence.</P>
      <P>The majority of the Taiwan people are aspiring for a unified,
strong and sovereign Taiwan, and rational and peaceful cross-strait
relations, the president said.</P>
      <P>As the leader of the nation, Chen said, he supports pragmatic and
mutually beneficial exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"Any political leaders can visit China, but if the results of the
visits have the potential to undermine national security and the
wellbeing of the people, then the administration cannot sit idly by,
considering its own duty and its mandate from the people," he added.</P>
      <P>The president's words came after prosecutors said earlier this
week that they had started to look into KMT Vice Chairman Chiang's
visit to China to determine whether his reaching of a 10-point
consensus with Beijing violates the stipulations of the Statute
Governing the Relations between the People of the Taiwan Area and
the Mainland Area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU TO PUSH FOR 'FOUR-IN-TWO' ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) on Saturday said that it will propose combining four local 
elections into two elections in view of the astronomical time and
money spent on elections.</P>
      <P>The TSU legislative caucus said that it will formally propose the
election change through Lan Chun-chieh, a member of the Central
Election Commission (CEC) recommended by the TSU, when the CEC
convenes a meeting next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, TSU caucus whip in the legislature, noted that
during a national development conference held at the end of 1995, the
participants reached consensus on abrogating village and township
elections and on cutting the number of local elections.</P>
      <P>If local elections are not merged, then the city and county head
elections in December will kick off a series of elections for city
and county councilors, village and township heads, and borough heads
in March, June and August of the following year, respectively, Lo
said, adding that this "would be a terrible squandering of national
resources."</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh first broached the idea of combining three
local elections. The "three-in-one" election proposal refers to the
the holding of the elections for city mayors/ county magistrates,
city/county councilors, and village/ township heads at the same time.</P>
      <P>But as the change could have a profound impact on various
political parties and make the rampant vote-buying practices even
worse, Hsieh's proposal has created heated discussion.
Election workers have also complained that they won't have enough
time to prepare for the change and will be prone to committing errors
if the plan is implemented.</P>
      <P>Lo said that the TSU supports the merging of local elections, but
considering the pressure to be placed on the election workers, the
party believes that the elections for city mayors/county magistrates
and city/county councilors should be merged and be conducted at the
end of this year, while the elections for village/township heads and
borough heads should be merged and held in mid-2006.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) both affirmed the "three-in-one" and
"four-in-two" election reform proposals.</P>
      <P>William C. D. Lai, DPP caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, said
his party supports both options. However, he added that whether there
is sufficient time to implement the reforms and complementary
measures needs to be considered.</P>
      <P>The DPP will respect the decisions of the Central Election
Commission, the Taiwan provincial election committee, and the city
and county election committees, which oversee the three local-level
elections, Lai added.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT's Policy
Committee, said his party will support either of the two reform
options as long as they save costs and improve efficiency.</P>
      <P>Tseng further said that regardless of the option, the Executive
Yuan will have the final say, pointing out that the Central Election
Commission is not an independent body and must carry out the orders
of the Executive Yuan. He also expressed the hope that the Executive
Yuan will handle the issue in an impartial manner.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition People First Party, an ally of the KMT,
said that it supports the "two-in-one" option -- namely holding
elections for city mayors/ county magistrates and those for city/
county councilors simultaneously -- or the "three-in-one" option.
However, he said his party is opposed to the "four-in-two" option as
this would require that the tenures of township heads be extended.</P>
      <P>The Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU)said the fewer number of
elections there are, the better, in terms of cutting costs and
reducing confrontation.</P>
      <P>Chen Jung-chieh, NPSU caucus whip in the legislature, said
that the party will support the "four-in-two" elections, adding that
if another local election -- for delegates to village and township
administrative offices -- is added to make it "five-in-one, " this
would be even better.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT ASSENT IRRELEVANT TO KMT CHAIRMAN'S PLANNED CHINA TRIP: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Whether or not the government gives its
authorization is irrelevant to opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Lien Chan's plan to visit China, KMT officials said Saturday.</P>
      <P>They were responding to President Chen Shui-bian's proposal
earlier in the day that Lien meet with him before the latter's China
visit so that he could authorize Lien to discuss certain issues with
Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung claimed that KMT members' visits to
China are all normal exchanges and that the laws of the Republic of
China do not forbid political leaders from visiting China.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Lien, who has served in many important posts
in the government in the past, including the vice presidency, will
certainly safeguard the ROC and follow the principle of Taiwan first,
and his China visit will play up the equal status of Taiwan and
China, uphold Taiwan's dignity and promote peace across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Chang claimed Lien has offered to do something for the country
because the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) government has
failed to handle cross-strait relations properly.</P>
      <P>Expressing doubt about President Chen's sincerity in meeting with
Lien, Chang said Chen would not have accused Lien of "doing one thing
while in power and doing another while in the opposition" if he were
sincere about his invitation.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, head of the KMT's Policy Committee, said Chen's
proposal indicates that he agrees that Lien's visit to China will
help achieve a breakthrough in the cross-strait deadlock.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the president should support Lien's plan to visit
China for the sake of national interests, Tseng said.</P>
      <P>He said that Lien represents the KMT, which is a civic
organization, and that it does not matter whether he has the
government's authorization or not.</P>
      <P>He claimed that only the KMT has the ability to resolve the
cross-strait deadlock because the party has followed a consistent
policy toward China, saying the KMT was the prime mover behind the
launch of special cross-strait Lunar New Year charter flights this
year.</P>
      <P>According to Tseng, the DPP's failure to handle cross-strait
relations properly has led to economic downturn in Taiwan, and the
DPP should therefore let the KMT play a major role in cross-strait
policy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Switzerland's most important
German-language daily on Saturday billed Republic of China President
Chen Shui-bian's unprecedented visit to the Vatican to attend Pope
John Paul II's funeral the previous day as "a diplomatic coup."</P>
      <P>Because of China's diplomatic embargo, the Neue Zuercher Zeitung
daily said, Taiwan has rarely been in the international limelight.
With the Italian government's support, the paper said, Chen got a
rare opportunity to join presidents, prime ministers and royals from
around the world in attending a major world event.</P>
      <P>To protest the Vatican's invitation to Chen, Beijing didn't send
any representatives to the pope's funeral. The Swiss paper said
Beijing's decision handed Taiwan an unexpected diplomatic coup.</P>
      <P>Amid reports that the Vatican might switch its diplomatic
recognition from Taiwan to China, the paper said, this diplomatic
coup has become even more precious to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, major French dailies, including "La Mode" and "La
Figaro, " also reported Chen's attendance at the pope's funeral. The
French papers described Chen's historic Vatican visit as a modern-day
diplomatic miracle. They also predicted that the Vatican's quest for
normalizing its ties with China could suffer a setback as a result.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RULING, OPPOSITION PARTIES SHOULD ENGAGE IN RATIONAL COMMUNICATION: PFP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 9 (CNA)
(by Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
said Saturday that the ruling and opposition parties should respect
each other and engage in rational communication when dealing with
cross-strait issues.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Hseih Kung-ping was responding to President Chen
Shui-bian's earlier remarks upon his return from a visit to the
Vatican to attend Pope John Paul II's funeral the previous day.</P>
      <P>President Chen said that he is willing to endorse opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan's planned visit to China, but Chen
added that Lien should have frank communication with the government
prior to his visit.
</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that cross-strait relations is the most crucial issue
at present and that it should be handled in a rational and pragmatic
manner.</P>
      <P>Hsieh further said the opposition parties should respect the
government when dealing with cross-strait issues and have national
interests as their top priority, while the government should also
respect the opposition parties. He added that rational communication
is paramount.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that it is improper for the government to
investigate KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang for reaching a 10-point
consensus with Beijing authorities during his recent visit to China,
referring to it as using "legal means to solve a political issue."
</P>
      <P>But he also said that the opposition parties should respect the
authority of the government and that any consensus reached between
the opposition parties and mainland authorities requires the
government's approval before it can be implemented.</P>
      <P>The PFP legislative caucus said President Chen's remarks that
cross-strait relations cannot be established through non-official
channels illustrate his ignorance concerning the frequent exchanges
between the private sectors on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-ping, PFP caucus whip, said that cross-strait relations
are strained but that private exchanges are close and frequent. The
private sector could lend a hand where the government is incapable,
and this is the intention of the planned visits to China by the heads
of the "pan-blue alliance" parties of the PFP and the KMT which he
claimed is a "pragmatic" approach.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator
said that President Chen is extending an olive branch to the
opposition parties and that they shouldn't act tempestuously like
spoiled children.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-chun, DPP caucus whip in the legislature, said that if
Lien won't talk with the president and visits China as planned, he
will face the problem of representation without prior authorization
from the government.</P>
      <P>Lien should sit down with the president to try to achieve
consensus for the sake of the national interests and the wellbeing of
the 23 million people of Taiwan, the DPP legislator added.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, an ally of
the DPP, affirmed President Chen's remarks that cross-strait
relations will not be established through non-official channels.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lo Chih-ming, who is the TSU party whip, said that
cross-strait talks are "not the same as hawking goods at a market"
and that such talks "should be conducted on the basis of equality and
dignity and with the prior authorization of the government."</P>
      <P>If the opposition party leaders scramble to go to the mainland
without prior government authorization, Lo said, they might fall into
China's trap by inadvertently serving Beijing's "one China" scheme 
and undermining Taiwan's status as a separate and sovereign nation.</P>
      <P>Lo also said that his party supports a resumption of the stalled
talks between the Straits Exchange Foundation and its Beijing
counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
-- the two semi-official bodies authorized by the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to deal with civilian exchanges in the absence of
formal ties.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's tourist arrivals are expected to
break the 3 million mark this year, a Tourism Bureau official said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to the official, the number of inbound tourists has
been increasing steadily since the second half of last year. Tourist
arrivals totaled only 1.4 million in the first half of last year due
to presidential election disputes and misgivings about a possible
avian flu outbreak.</P>
      <P>With the domestic political situation stabilizing and the avian
flu scare cooling off, the official said, tourist arrivals have
gradually regained momentum since the second half of last year.</P>
      <P>The number of tourist arrivals reached 2.94 million in 2004, the
official said.</P>
      <P>Between the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of
this year, tourist arrivals totaled 1.61 million. Barring unexpected
developments, the official said, this year's tourist arrivals can
break the 3 million mark to reach 3.25 million.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the official acknowledged that if the government
wants to realize the goal of attracting 5 million tourists annually
by 2008, more activities of international allure should be staged in
the coming years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO REOPEN MARKET FOR U.S. BEEF PRODUCTS APRIL 16</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 8 (CNA)
(By Wennie Chi and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns
announced Friday that Taiwan will lift its ban on U.S. boneless beef
from animals under 30 months of age effective April 16.</P>
      <P>"We are very pleased with this development because it is further
significant progress in our efforts to reopen global markets for U.S.
beef, " Johanns said, adding that this action demonstrates Taiwan's
commitment to trade in beef and beef products based on
internationally accepted scientific standards for human and animal
health.</P>
      <P>Johanns further said the U.S. government's goal is the resumption
of normal beef trade throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Taiwan banned imports of U.S. beef, live cattle and all related
products in December 2003 after the discovery in the U.S. state of
Washington of a single BSE case. BSE refers to bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad cow disease.</P>
      <P>In 2003, the United States exported more than US$76 million worth
of beef to Taiwan, with boneless beef products accounted for US$56
million.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had been the sixth-largest market for U.S. beef before the
import ban was imposed. Australia has since then dominated the Taiwan
beef market. Taiwan's Council of Agriculture announced last month
that the import ban on live cattle from the United States will remain
in place after boneless U.S. beef is allowed to enter the Taiwan
market again from April 16.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD URGED NOT TO FALL PREY TO BEIJING'S 'UNITED FRONT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan will risk falling prey to Beijing's "united front" scheme if he
refuses to talk with President Chen Shui-bian and visits China as
planned, a legislative whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) warned Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lai Ching-teh said that if Lien goes to China without prior
consultations with Chen on cross-Taiwan Strait issues, he will risk
compromising Taiwan's sovereignty, while "stealing" the DPP
administration's authority.</P>
      <P>Lai claimed that if he makes the trip, Lien will be poised to
confer upon himself the title of "chief executive of the Taiwan
special administration region" under China.</P>
      <P>Lai said that as of Sunday, the KMT had not responded favorably
Chen, who said a day earlier that he is willing to support Lien's
planned visit to China but that he and Lien should meet first.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
upon his return from a historic trip to the Vatican to attend Pope
John Paul II's funeral. Chen's trip marked the first ever visit to
Europe by a serving Republic of China president.</P>
      <P>The KMT leadership only reportedly said that a meeting with Chen
prior to Lien's China visit would "put a millstone round Lien's neck"
and that Lien has decided to make the trip as planned.</P>
      <P>Answering his own questions, Lai said Beijing extended an
invitation to Lien and promised that Chinese President Hu Jintao will
meet him in person because the KMT has "a united front value" to
Beijing.</P>
      <P>He described the entire KMT as "seeming to be on the verge of
total derangement" recently, with Lien obstinately determined to go
to China while two other vice chairmen -- Legislative Yuan Speaker
Wang Jin-pyng and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who he said have both
been "kidnapped" by Lien's obstinacy -- dare not spell out their
platforms on cross-strait issues in the campaign for the election of
the KMT chairmanship.</P>
      <P>Lai said that in stark contrast to Chen's recent visit to the
Vatican to pay his respects to the late pope, Lien is stubbornly
insisting on visiting China, a move that not only defies the
opposition of the Taiwan people, but also makes the rest of the world
wonder whether there is both a president in Taiwan and a "Taiwan
chief executive under Beijing."</P>
      <P>He claimed that the DPP caucus supports Lien's planned visit, but
it must be made after Lien acquires a consensus with the
administration before accepting the Beijing invitation.
"Otherwise, Lien will face the problem of representation without
prior authorization from the government," he added.</P>

      <P>The United States will help Taiwan defend
an invasion by mainland China should Beijing resort to "non peaceful"
means to deal with Taiwan, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) claimed Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chiang Chau-yi made the remarks at a news conference held at the
Legislative Yuan upon his return from a visit to the United States,
where he took part in the anniversary celebrations of the
Congressional Taiwan Caucus, visited U. S. officials and met think
tank members at the head of a 10-member legislative mission.</P>
      <P>Citing testimony by U. S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of States
Randall Shriver at a public hearing held April 6 by the International
Relations Committee under the House of Representatives, Chiang said
that the United States is opposed to changes to the status quo in the
Taiwan Strait by either side and that the United States will help
Taiwan counter a Chinese invasion.</P>
      <P>Shriver was quoted as saying that the United States will respond
the same as it did in 1995 and 1996, when it dispatched two aircraft
carrier groups to the Taiwan Strait when China conducted live-fire
missile test-firing in the strait.</P>
      <P>According to Chiang, U.S. officials gave their assurances that
the U.S. has not changed its stance in this regard and stressed that
neither Taiwan nor China is entitled to alter the cross-strait status
quo unilaterally.</P>
      <P>U. S. officials are of the view that Beijing's adoption of an
Anti-Secession Law March 14, which legislates for the use of "non-
peaceful means" to curb Taiwan independence, is an attempt to
unilaterally change the cross-strait status quo, he said, adding
that Washington is fully aware of the Taiwan people's objections to
the law.</P>
      <P>The 10-member delegation departed for the United States April 2
and returned to Taiwan in two groups April 9 and 10, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT: PARTY CHAIRMAN'S CHINA TRIP REMAINS ON TRACK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 10 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan's proposed trip to China remains on the track and could take
place "at any time," KMT spokesman Chang Rung-kung said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman claimed that Lien's trip, to be titled by the KMT
"a trip for peace" to underline the KMT's efforts to pursue peace
across the Taiwan Strait, will be lined up on the basis of parity
between Taiwan and China and will not compromise Taiwan's dignity. He
added that the KMT believes government authorization is not necessary
for Lien's trip.</P>
      <P>As to President Chen Shui-bian's statement the previous day that
only if Lien consults with the president before his departure will
the president support his trip to China, Chang said his party does
not think the president really intends to see Lien. "You don't abuse
a person, threaten to bring him to justice and in the same breath ask
him to meet you for talks," the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>He was referring to a Prosecutor's Office investigation into KMT
Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang after his visit to China from March 28 to
April 1 and the consensus he is supposed to have reached with Chinese
officials during his talks there. Chen has claimed it is illegal for
Chiang to have concluded such an accord with China.</P>
      <P>The KMT spokesman said he had no idea of reports Sunday that
Beijing has asked Lien to visit China before May 20, the first
anniversary of Chen's inauguration for a second term, saying that
Lien's trip is still being planned and that no date has been fixed.</P>
      <P>As the leader of a political party of the Republic of China,
Chang claimed, Lien's planned trip is a part of the country's normal
exchanges with China and there is no law prohibiting party leaders
from visiting China.</P>
      <P>As the country's former vice president and premier, Chang said,
Lien knows how to serve the interests of the country better than
anyone else. Any worry that he might compromise the country's
interests during his trip is "groundless," he said.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) decision
to halt the stationing of correspondents in Taiwan by China's Xinhua
news agency and People's Daily is not a positive development in
Cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges, the opposition People First Party
(PFP) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said the MAC should reconsider its
decision, which flies in the face of Taiwan's long-standing efforts
to promote exchanges with China and contradicts President Chen
Shui-bian's asserted policy of seeking detente with China.</P>
      <P>If local newspapers are correct in their reports that this is an
countermeasure against China's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law,
Hsieh said his party believes it will do more harm to Taiwan's image
as a democracy than China's access to cover stories about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said Sunday that the decision was taken in
light of the dampened atmosphere between Taiwan and China after the
enactment of the Anti-Secession Law and the fact that Xinhua and the
People's Daily present Taiwan in a biased light in their stories,
even though they have correspondents in Taiwan to report the stories

    <HEADLINE>XINHUA, PEOPLE'S DAILY TAIWAN COVERAGE TO BE HALTED: MAC CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) announced Sunday that a program allowing two
major Chinese news media organizations to station staff in Taiwan
will be halted temporarily in an effort to protect the national
dignity and interests of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said the MAC decided to halt the press
accreditation for China's official Xinhua news agency and People's
Daily newspaper because their coverage of Taiwan is not conducive to
enhancing understanding between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the purpose of allowing Chinese media organizations
to station staff in Taiwan -- a practice that began in 2000 -- was to
help the two sides better understand each other.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Wu said, some Chinese media groups have focused
only on the most extreme or radical opinions in Taiwan's political
spectrum, which is not helpful to efforts to strengthen cross-strait
understanding.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu said, the Chinese authorities have blocked news
reports about Taiwan in all media channels, including Websites,
another move that does not help Chinese people to gain better
understanding of Taiwan society.</P>
      <P>Discounting immediate criticism that the halt is an abrogation of
freedom of the press, Wu claimed that halting Xinhua and People's
Daily reporting in Taiwan and freedom of the press are different but
parallel issues, given that both the Beijing mouthpieces have always
reported Taiwan from extreme, negative and unfriendly angles.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu noted that the government will not cease media
exchanges with China across the board and that other unofficial
Chinese news media organizations will still have the opportunity to
come to Taiwan to cover news.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added, any media, cultural or educational
exchanges could be strictly assessed if they are found unhelpful to
efforts to cement cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>At least five Chinese media organizations, including Xinhua,
People's Daily, China National Radio (CNR), China Central Television
(CCTV) and China News Service (CNS) , have stationed journalists in
Taiwan since the country first allowed Chinese news media
organizations entry to Taiwan Nov. 10, 2000.</P>
      <P>All these arrangements have been on a trial basis, with each
visit lasting for only two months in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO TIMETABLE FOR PFP CHAIRMAN'S CHINA VISIT: PARTY SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 10 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>No timetable has been set for People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong to visit mainland China and it is
"meaningless" for Soong to do so now at a time when Taiwan lacks a
national consensus on the issue, PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh claimed that Soong will pay a visit to China but pointed
out that "there is not a fixed timetable" on the issue. Soong will
head for China only when a national consensus is forged on the
question of whether political parties should visit China now that
Beijing has enacted its Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, Soong hopes to visit China to help break the
ice between the two sides. But it would be pointless for Soong to go
if the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) "has not made up its
mind whether it is willing to reconcile" with China.</P>
      <P>Since Soong met President Chen Shui-bian Feb. 24 and made public
a 10-point agreement promising to maintain the national title of the
Republic of China and not declare Taiwan independence in a concerted
effort to ease tension across the Taiwan Strait, the government has
not done anything concrete to serve those ends, Hsieh claimed.</P>
      <P>It would be meaningful for the PFP chairman to visit China only
if a consensus is reached in Taiwan and if all the parties concerned
can manage to work out feasible measures, he said, reiterating that
the ruling and opposition camps should respect each other and give
national interests precedence when seeking rational and workable
resolutions to cross-strait disputes.</P>
      <P>The opposition parties should respect the government's authority
and mandate, while the government should respect the opposition
camp's efforts, he said, adding that it is very important for both
sides to exchange views.</P>
      <P>Turning to a government plan to take court action to deal with
main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang, who the
government accuses of hurting Taiwan's interests by reaching a
10-point consensus with Chinese Communist Party officials during a
recent visit to China without notifying the Taiwan authorities
beforehand, he claimed that it is inappropriate for the government to
handle a political issue through legal means.</P>
      <P>The government led by the ruling DPP has blamed Chiang for
provoking "China fever" among Taiwan's political parties hoping to
cut deals with China at the expense of Taiwan's national dignity and
interests at a time when the Anti-Secession Law has dealt a heavy
blow to cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, KMT Chairman Lien Chan is also planning to visit China
in the near future, although no exact date has been fixed.</P>

      <P>An official of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) left Taiwan for Fuzhou in the southern Chinese province
of Fujian Sunday for a low-profile visit to pave the way for a visit
by a PFP delegation that will promote agricultural exchanges across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Huang Pan-kung, director of the PFP Department of Organization,
will visit only Fuzhou to conduct preparatory work for the PFP
agricultural promotion delegation scheduled to head to China later
this week.</P>
      <P>PFP officials denied that Huang's visit has anything to do with
plans pertaining to PFP Chairman James Soong's much-speculated upon
visit to China.</P>
      <P>Huang, formerly deputy director of the now-defunct Taiwan
Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, has maintained
close connections with people in the agricultural and research
sectors across the Taiwan Strait and has also kept abreast of the
situation and needs in Taiwan's farming circles, according to PFP
officials.</P>
      <P>His departure for China came on the heels of that of PFP
Legislator-at-Large Tsay Sheng-jia, who left Taiwan for China Friday
on a trip mainly aimed at opening up a new market for Taiwan's
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>PFP officials declined to confirm whether Huang will join Tsay in
China and both visits have been kept low-profile. Their cautiousness
is seen as a reflection of an on-going controversy over who should

      <P>Local political parties reacted along
party lines Sunday to a Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) decision to
withdraw permission to Beijing's Xinhua news agency and People's
Daily to post reporters in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Cheng Wen-Tsan, director of the Communications Department under
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said his party
supports the MAC's decision, which he claimed underscores Taiwan's
"free rein" in dealing with China.</P>
      <P>The decision, which Cheng admitted is a tit-for-tat attempt to
chill relations with China in the wake of Beijing's enactment of the
Anti-Secession Law, is "necessary" to reflect the country's anger
with Beijing, according to Cheng.</P>
      <P>He attempted to downplay the negative impact that the measure
will bring about to China's freedom of press, claiming that the move
does not infringe on China's freedom of the press because under the
communist regime, the media has no press freedom in China.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator William Lai, who is the secretary of the DPP
caucus in the Legislative Yuan, claimed it is "only natural" for the
government to strip Xinhua and People's Daily of the right to station
correspondents in Taiwan because they "never reflect" Taiwan's
mainstream opinions in their stories.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said in Taichung, central Taiwan,
Sunday that the MAC's decision comes too late and claimed that the
two Beijing media should have had their right to station reporters in
Taiwan suspended March 14 when the Beijing authorities passed its
Anti-Secession Law to give itself the right to attack Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), the DPP's political
ally in the Legislative Yuan, lauded the MAC decision.</P>
      <P>TSU Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming said the country should not
sit on its hands without showing its anger when China displays its
hostility toward Taiwan. Chen said all political parties should rally
behind the MAC on the issue.</P>
      <P>The major opposition Kuomintang (KMT) did not agree with him,
however, with KMT spokesman Chang Rung-kung pointing out that instead
of forcing China to backtrack from its Anti-Secession Law, the
response only underlines that the move is merely a petty attempt to
counterattack China.</P>
      <P>Noting that the exchanges of correspondents is a percusor to more
significant exchanges between Taiwan and China and vital in
developing a meaningful relationship with China, Chang said the
government is denying itself a valuable chance to do so by excluding
the two media organizations from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He predicted that the decision will cast Taiwan in a bad light in
the international publicity war between China and Taiwan, and will
tarnish Taiwan's image as a democracy that values freedom of the

      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU), a political ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in
the Legislative Yuan, called on the government Sunday to strengthen
the country's strategic cooperation with Japan to counterbalance
China's military buildup.</P>
      <P>TSU lawmaker Ho Min-hao said China's military buildup has become
a cause of great concern for Japan and the United States, and
prompted them to declare earlier this year that the peaceful solution
of the Taiwan issue is one of their joint strategic objectives in the
region.</P>
      <P>Caught between China's intensifying confrontation with Japan and
the United States, Ho said, Taiwan's status as a vital link in the
island chain off the coast of China is all the more important and
therefore could convince Japan to take on the island as a valuable
strategic partner.</P>
      <P>Ho said TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang exchanged views with Japanese
politicians on the possibility of forging closer strategic
cooperation between Taipei and Tokyo during his just-concluded trip
to Japan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile TSU lawmaker Lo Chih-ming, the party's convener in the
Legislative Yuan, said Sunday that the Taiwan Relations Act, which
obliges Washington to help Taiwan with its defense, is proof that the
United States considers Taiwan an entity separate from China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan politicians should realize this and stick to it while
dealing with China, Lo said.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to deal with local businessmen who invest
in China without government approval in the same way it does with
political parties that visit China without approval.</P>

      <P>Although South Korea has outperformed
Taiwan in per-capita gross national product (GNP) , Taiwan is still
stronger in PPP (purchasing power parity) than South Korea, according
to a government official.</P>
      <P>Tu Sheng-cheng, chairman of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said over the weekend that
the latest figures released by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
or 2003 show that Taiwan's PPP is still higher than South Korea's by
more than US$6,000.</P>
      <P>According to the IMF statistics, Hong Kong enjoyed the highest
PPP of US$27,892 among the four Asian Dragons in 2003. Taiwan came
second with US$24,558, ahead of Singapore's US$24,552 and South
Korea's US$17,900.</P>
      <P>The gap in PPP of US$6,658 between Taiwan and South Korea is an
indication that Taiwan had a substantially higher income than South
Korea, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The CEPD chairman added that he believes the figures to be
released by the IMF for 2004 will still show that Taiwan has a higher
PPP than South Korea, excluding the element of currency exchange
rate.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, the South Korean won has
appreciated by more than 15 percent against the U.S. dollar, while
the new Taiwan dollar only picked up in value by 6 percent.</P>
      <P>However, tallies compiled recently by the International Institute
for Management Development show that Hong Kong had an average PPP of
US$27,743 in 2003, followed by Singapore with US$24,183, Taiwan with
US$22,760 and South Korea with US$17,368. Taiwan exceeded South Korea
by US$5,392 according to those PPP calculations.</P>
      <P>According to figures made public by governments in Asia, Taiwan
was bottom of the list in terms of per-capita GNP compared to the
three other Asian Dragons in 2004.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had an average per-capita income of US$14,032 last year,
lagging behind Singapore's US$25,191, Hong Kong's US$23,960 and South
Korea's US$14,162.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has encountered a bottleneck in its
development and should promote a co-existence mechanism to make a
breakthrough, Premier Frank Hsieh said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a gathering of students organized by the World Leader

co-existence.</P>
      <P>The premier told more than 1,000 college students attending the
gathering that co-existence is vital in human history because when
societies encounter difficulties at a certain stage of their
development, there must be some wise people who can find a mechanism
to avoid the total destruction of the society. This mechanism, he
explained, is co-existence.</P>
      <P>Diversity, different historical experiences, languages and

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN JOINS BUSH, HU JINTAO IN TIME MAGAZINE'S 100 LIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  April  10  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian joined U.S. President George W. Bush and mainland Chinese
President Hu Jintao and 97 others on TIME magazine's annual list of
the 100 most influential people in the world, the weekly announced
Sunday.</P>
      <P>President Chen appeared in the most influential "Leaders and
Revolutionaries" category. Others on this list included U.S.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former U.S. President Bill
Clinton and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.</P>
      <P>In the article introducing President Chen, TIME reporter Michael
Elliott wrote that Chen, born to a poor family in 1951, "symbolizes
Taiwan's transition from Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship to democracy
and from a situation in which political power was dominated by
refugees from the mainland to one in which native Taiwanese like
himself lead the nation."</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Strait is sometimes called the most dangerous place in
the world, Elliott said. On one side of the waterway is mainland
China, and on the other, the island of Taiwan, where Nationalist
forces, led by Chiang, retreated after their defeat by the communists
in China's civil war.</P>
      <P>Beijing regards Taiwan as a "renegade province" and has said it
is willing to use force if necessary to prevent the island's
independence, Elliott wrote, adding that the United States, for its
part, has pledged to defend Taiwan if the island is attacked without
provocation.</P>
      <P>Having narrowly won a second four-year term last year after
surviving an apparent assassination attempt, Chen, 54, will remain in
office until 2008, the report continued.</P>
      <P>Beijing can't stand him, Elliott said. China's leaders call him a
"splittist" determined to break Taiwan away from the mainland for
good. At times, Chen's rhetoric seems excessive, even in Taiwan's
boisterous democracy. Voters denied him a victory in legislative
elections last December, preferring parties that seek a greater
accommodation with China, and since then, Chen has deliberately
reached out to Beijing, Elliott said.</P>
      <P>Chen' overtures, however, have not been received with obvious
rapture; last month China passed a law reiterating its willingness to
use force should the island declare formal independence, Elliott
reported.</P>
      <P>Elliott further wrote that though Chen summoned a million people
into the streets on March 26 to protest that law, don't rule out the
possibility that he may yet make a deal with Beijing. "I am a maker
of history," Chen told TIME, last year.</P>
      <P>"If that turns out to be so, let's hope it's because Chen
Shui-bian proves to be a force for reconciliation across the Taiwan
Strait, not for war over it," Elliott concluded.</P>
      <P>This edition of TIME magazine is set to hit newsstands Monday.</P>

      <P>Colorful butterfly orchids from Taiwan
received two top awards at the Sakoliki International Flower Show in
Moscow, organizers said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu and his wife, Peng Hsi-nan, both of whom enjoy fame in
the global floral community, overcame many difficulties airlifting
500 pots of butterfly orchids to Moscow for display at the Sakoliki
flower trade fair held April 7-10.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that Taiwan has ever participated in the
noted international floral trade fair in Russia.</P>
      <P>At Sunday's closing ceremony, organizers presented the Best
Flower Art Award and the Best Floral Design Award in recognition of
the Wus' efforts at promoting orchid cultivation and improving floral
technologies. The Republic of China national flag was also flown at
the exhibition site in honor of the Wus' achievement.</P>
      <P>"It's a great honor for us to receive the awards. We take great
pleasure in bringing Taiwan's most beautiful 'angel' to Russia for
cultural and artistic exchanges, " Wu said in a Russian television
interview after the presentation ceremony.</P>
      <P>The Wus' booth attracted a large crowd of visitors, but few of
the visitors bought the Taiwan couple's orchids. The Wus said they
felt a bit of disappointment about the lukewarm market response.
Nevertheless, they said they will not be daunted by the setback and
will devote more efforts at studying consumer tastes in the Russian
floral market.</P>
      <P>In recognition of their professionalism in orchid cultivation,
the Wus have been invited to take part in a professional flower show
to be held in Moscow April 13-17.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PEOPLE WANT BREAKTHROUGH IN CROSS-STRAIT STALEMATE: KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said in an open statement released Monday that addressing the
current political stalemate across the Taiwan Strait is the biggest
hope of most of the people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>KMT visits to mainland China, including the recent groundbreaking
visit to Beijing by a delegation led by KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang
during which Chiang reached a 10-point consensus with leaders of the
Chinese Communist Party, represent party-to-party consultations and
efforts that are opening a door that could lead to peace across the
strait, Lien said in the statement.</P>
      <P>The open statement was read by KMT Secretary-General Lin
Feng-cheng at the KMT headquarters Monday.</P>
      <P>Lien said in the statement that since the consultations are
purely party-to-party talks aimed at allowing the two sides to
understand each other better, he does not feel that government
authorization or approval is required at this current stage.</P>
      <P>However, he added, if any cross-strait talks or negotiations
involve the exercise of public authority, the KMT will definitely
communicate with the government via the proper channels prior to
engaging in such talks so as to create an environment conducive to
the people's wellbeing.</P>
      <P>Lien reiterated that all the "trips of peace" to be conducted by
the KMT in the future will be open and transparent. "They will be
conducted based on the premise that the Republic of China's national
dignity must be upheld, with reciprocity and benefits for people
across the strait as the top guiding principle."</P>
      <P>He stressed that the KMT has unwaveringly protected the
sovereignty of the ROC and the security of Taiwan ever since the ROC
was established in 1911, and that the KMT's cross-strait policy which
"champions rationality, peace, equality and reciprocity, " has
remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>At this crucial juncture, when cross-strait relations are
unprecedentedly tense, it is the KMT's keen expectation that the
Democratic Progressive Party administration will show more openness,
generosity and magnanimity to breakthrough the current cross-strait
political stalemate to create the opportunity for peace across the
Taiwan Strait, Lien said.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian looks forward to
meeting with opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan prior to
Lien's planned visit to China, a Presidential Office official said

      <P>The official, who preferred to remain anonymous, made the remarks

visit China to conduct party-to-party talks with the top Chinese
Community Party leader, such a visit doesn't require the government's

last weekend upon his return from a historic visit to the Vatican to
attend Pope John Paul II's funeral, Chen said he is willing to
support Lien's planned China visit and authorize Lien to talk with
Chinese authorities on certain issues so long as Lien meets with him
prior to his departure for the mainland.</P>
      <P>For the sake of safeguarding the ultimate national interests and
forging a domestic consensus on relations across the Taiwan Strait,
the Presidential Office official said President Chen hopes Lien can
communicate with the government before his China trip.</P>

has done all he can to further reforms and seek inter-party
reconciliation, while making numerous goodwill overtures toward China
to try to secure cross-strait peace and allowing Taiwan to stand tall
in the international community with dignity.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsung said that President Chen's unwavering efforts to
safeguard the country and its people are obvious and recognized at
home and abroad, adding that "the president's efforts will continue
relentlessly."</P>
      <P>Calling the ROC president "the President of Taiwan, " Time
grouped Chen Shui-bian Sunday with U.S. President George W. Bush and
mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao and 97 others on its annual list
of the 100 most influential people in the world.</P>
      <P>President Chen appeared in the most influential "Leaders and
Revolutionaries" category. Others on this eclectic list include U.S.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former U.S. President Bill
Clinton and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.</P>
      <P>In the article introducing President Chen, Time reporter Michael
Elliott wrote that Chen, born to a poor family in 1951, "symbolizes
Taiwan's transition from Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship to democracy
and from a situation in which political power was dominated by
refugees from the mainland to one in which native Taiwanese like
himself lead the nation."</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Strait is sometimes called the most dangerous place in
the world, Elliott said. On one side is China, and on the other, the
island of Taiwan, where Nationalist forces, led by Chiang, retreated
after their defeat at the hands of the communists in China's civil
war.</P>
      <P>Beijing regards Taiwan as a "renegade province" and has said it
is willing to use force if necessary to prevent the island's
independence, Elliott wrote, adding that the United States, for its
part, has pledged to defend Taiwan if the island is attacked without
provocation.</P>
      <P>Having narrowly won a second four-year term last year after
surviving an assassination attempt, Chen, 54, will remain in office
until 2008, the report continued.</P>
      <P>Beijing can't stand Chen, Elliott said. China's leaders call him
a"splittist" determined to break Taiwan away from the mainland. At
times, Chen's rhetoric seems excessive, even in Taiwan's boisterous
democracy. Voters denied him a victory in legislative elections last
December, preferring parties that seek a greater accommodation with
China, and since then, Chen has deliberately reached out to Beijing,
Elliott said.</P>
      <P>Chen' overtures, however, have not been received with obvious
rapture; last month China passed a law reiterating its willingness to
use force should the island declare formal independence, Elliott
reported.</P>
      <P>Elliott further wrote that although Chen called for a million
people to take to the streets on March 26 to protest the law, Chen
making a deal with Beijing is a possibility that cannot be ruled out.
"I am a maker of history," Chen told Time, last year.</P>
      <P>"If that turns out to be so, let's hope it's because Chen
Shui-bian proves to be a force for reconciliation across the Taiwan
Strait, not for war over it," Elliott concluded.</P>
      <P>This edition of Time magazine will go on sale Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP GOVERNMENT CHALLENGED ON CHARTER FLIGHTS, FARM EXPORTS ISSUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition Kuomintang (KMT) official
challenged the government Monday on cross-strait issues, including
direct charter flight services and Taiwan's farm exports to China,
saying that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) administration
should make it clear whether it is committed to these engagements or
not.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, executive director of the KMT Central Policy
Committee, said Monday that a KMT delegation plans to head to China
later this month and will try to move the discussions forward
regarding regular cross- strait charter cargo and passenger flights
and exports of Taiwan's agricultural products to China.</P>
      <P>However, Tseng said that before the delegation contacts Chinese
authorities responsible for making public policy, it would be
advantageous if the DPP administration would first make clear whether
it would be willing to follow up on these contacts in its official
capacity. "Otherwise, all of our efforts will be futile, " Tseng
argued.</P>
      <P>Tseng reiterated that prior to its delegation's departure for
China, the KMT will consult with the Mainland Affairs Council --
Taiwan's top China policy planner -- about the government's thinking
and intentions on the development of cross-strait relations,
including regular direct charter flights and agricultural exports.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the opening of direct cross-strait charter
passenger flights during this year's Chinese Lunar New Year holiday
was a good example of how the private sector can lend a hand in areas
where the government is incapable of getting the job done. He said
the KMT acted as a go-between and a "policy-pusher" before the
government took over the ensuing tasks to make the holiday
cross-strait charter flights a reality.</P>
      <P>He called for the DPP administration not to block the opposition
parties' efforts in addressing the cross-strait political stalemate
and not to act in an obstinate and irrational manner, saying that
this is not helpful and only runs counter to Taiwan's mainstream
opinion.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Air Force will feel the pinch if
China acquires French-made Mirage 2000-9CS jet fighters, the chief of
staff at the ROC Air Force General Headquarters said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lt. Gen. Peng Sheng-chu made the remarks at a meeting of the
Legislative Yuan's defense committee, where opposition People First
Party Legislator Lin Yu-fang asked Peng about his views on a media
report that said that once the European Union lifts its 16-year-old
ban on arms sales to China, China will purchase 210 Mirage 2000-9CSs
from France.</P>
      <P>As Mirage 2000-9CSs are newer than the Mirage 2000-5 jet fighters
that Taiwan acquired in the 1990s, Peng said the Mirage 2000-9CSs are
believed to outperform the Mirage 2000-5s in combat capabilities and
range.</P>
      <P>If China does obtain Mirage 2000-9CSs, Peng admitted that the ROC
Air Force will face great pressure.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased 60 Mirage 2000-5s and two of them have crashed
in training flights.</P>
      <P>With a view to upgrading air defense capabilities, Peng said, the
military has considered procuring a new generation of warplanes after
acquiring 150 U.S.-built F-16 jet fighters and 60 Mirage 2000-5s in
the 1990s.</P>
      <P>Noting that new warplane procurement requires a careful
evaluation of a number of complicated elements, Peng said the
military is still collecting information and data about the
procurement plan.</P>
      <P>"We are mulling whether to buy U.S.-made F35s or F-18s or to
upgrade our F-16 fleet now in service, " Peng said, adding that the

    <HEADLINE>CHEN-LIEN MEETING POSSIBLE IN ADEQUATE ATMOSPHERE: KMT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kuomintang (KMT) is willing to arrange
a meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and KMT Chairman Lien Chan
in an adequate atmosphere before Lien heads for a visit to mainland
China, KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks to reporters at KMT headquarters in Taipei
after making public a statement on behalf of Lien on his planned
"journey of peace" to China.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the KMT is willing to exchange views with the
government on Lien's China visit beforehand if necessary, Lin called
on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to build a favorable
atmosphere first to pave the way and claimed that "the KMT's door is
always open wide to such a development."</P>
      <P>"If it is necessary, I'm willing to meet with President Chen's
secretarial aides first, " Lin said, stressing that "the KMT will not
rule out any possibilities of contacts with the government should the
political climate at home allow the party to do so."</P>
      <P>However, he advised the government to refrain from putting out
feelers to the media and made it clear that the KMT has never refused
to talk with the Presidential Office regarding the issue. Up to now,
he has not received any call from the Presidential Office, Lin noted.</P>
      <P>Calling on the government to respect the KMT's goodwill and to
support its efforts to help mend Taiwan-mainland ties, he urged the
government to turn over the reins to the private sector and allow it
to play a role in cross-Taiwan Strait affairs for the sake of Taiwan's
overall interests should the government itself be unable to take
concrete action.</P>
      <P>The purpose of Lien's China visit is to help create a mutually
beneficial situation for the two sides of the strait, he said,
adding that it will be fully transparent and that Lien will do his
utmost to protect national dignity and seek the maximum benefits for
the people in Taiwan under the principles of parity, reciprocity and
peace in his dealings with the Chinese side.</P>
      <P>Lien is slated to travel to China in the near future. KMT
spokesma Chang Jung-kung said a day earlier that Lien's China trip
could take place at any time, although he said that no exact date has
been set.</P>
      <P>The government and the ruling DPP have both asked Lien to report
to President Chen on his planned trip out of grave concerns that any
deals reached by the main opposition KMT in China might damage
Taiwan's national dignity and interests.</P>
      <P>Traveling at the head of a 34-member delegation, KMT Vice
Chairman P. K. Chiang paid a visit to China late last month and
reached a 10-point consensus with Chinese Communist Party officials
to enhance private sector exchanges.</P>
      <P>Chiang's China trip has backfired among pro-Taiwan independence
backers who accused the KMT vice chairman of selling Taiwan out.
Prosecutors said that they will look into Chiang's China visit to vet
whether the 10-point consensus has infringed upon national interests
and the government's authority.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSU FAVORS GOVERNMENT APPOINTMENT OF VILLAGE/TOWNSHIP HEADS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) said Monday that it will support the government appointing the
heads of villages and townships, instead of holding elections.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming, TSU secretary-general, said that the party will
propose a revision to the local system law and ask the support of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to implement reforms for
the local system.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks amid media reports that the government is
planning to have elections for city mayors/county magistrates and
city/county councilmen held simultaneously and that a referendum will
also be held on that day to determine whether to abrogate the
elections for village/township heads and for elections for delegates
to village/township councils.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that a national development conference in 1996 reached
a consensus on appointing the village/township heads, adding that the
DPP has been in office for five years, and has yet to carry out the
consensus, adding that if there was already a consensus, why should
there still be referendum.</P>
      <P>He said that any system should first consider whether it is
durable and stable, and should not be an election ploy. </P>
      <P>He noted that the Executive Yuan first broached the holding of
elections for city mayors/county magistrates, city/county
councilors, and village/township heads at the same time, but the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said it was not feasible.</P>
      <P>He asked the DPP to provide complimentary measures of its
proposal so as not to let the people down.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the TSU will also kick off a campaign of the
rectification of the nation's name and the writing of a new
constitution so as to solicit support for the TSU in an election for
a mission-oriented National Assembly scheduled for May 14, Chen said.</P>

      <P>A rock-climbing event on the sidewalk of
one of Taipei's busiest streets marked the opening of a new youth
center Monday.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh, joined by Minister of the National Youth
Commission under the Executive Yuan Cheng Li-chiun, climbed an
artificial wall set up on the sidewalk of Chunghsiao East Road beside
the Shandao Temple Station to unveil the new "Youth Hub, " a youth
center built to encourage young people to exchange ideas and
participate in public affairs.</P>
      <P>While the premier appreciated the chanting from the crowd below
as he make the summit, he half-jokingly said he prefers not to do
something "life-threatening" every time he inaugurates something.</P>
      <P>The idea of building the center came from the French Cafe Philo,
which is also a place for youth to discuss national events while
enjoying coffee, Cheng said, adding that the reason rock-climbing was
included in the inauguration ceremony was to encourage young people
to think not only horizontally, or extensively, but also vertically,
or intensively.</P>
      <P>Youth Hub is open to all non-profit youth organizations who make
a reservation. It is free to use the facilities, but bringing along

      <P>The two men who attacked two policemen in
broad daylight Sunday, killing one of them, will be captured and
prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, Minister of Justice Shih
Mao-lin said Monday.</P>
      <P>Shih made the remarks at an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The two policemen, Hung Chung-nan, 30, and Chang Ta-hao, 31, were
making their rounds at around 1 p.m in Hsihchih, Taipei County, when
they were attacked from behind by two men tailing them. Chang's gun
and his 12 rounds of ammunition were taken, while Hung fought to
defend his gun. Hung bled to death after being stabbed 15 times and
Chang was seriously injured.</P>
      <P>According to a surveillance video released Monday, the two men
were riding a motorcycle and are around 170 cm, with the driver
wearing a dark shirt and trousers, while the man riding pillion was
wearing a dark shirt and grey-white trousers. They wore full-face
helmets during the attack and then sped off in the direction of
Hsihchih.</P>
      <P>Saying that this sort of attack was an open challenge to the
police force specifically and to social order in general, Shih said a
speedy investigation will be conducted and he will ask for the
maximum punishment possible by law for the attackers.</P>
      <P>He said that the case would likely involve obstructing a police
officer and manslaughter at the least. According to Criminal Code
regulations, these violations carry a maximum penalty of death.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of the Interior Lin Yung-chien said that the attack
was an isolated case and the public should have faith in the ability
of the police to keep social order.</P>
      <P>Lin said that he is aware that if major crimes go unsolved, the
public loses confidence in the police. Should this case remain
unsolved for an extended time, Lin said he "would take
responsibility." He did not specifically say if this meant that he
would step down.</P>
      <P>All police are now being told to wear bullet-proof vests while on
duty.</P>
      <P>Police are asking the public to come forward with any information
on the attack and are offering a cash reward of NT$500,000
(US$15,873) for information leading to the arrest and conviction of

(By Wayne Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must do more to promote the
protection of the threatened whale shark, the largest fish in the
world, experts from various countries said Monday at a conference in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>In response to the rapidly decreasing number of whale sharks
(Rhiniodon typus) remaining in the wild, National Taiwan Ocean
University (NTOU) and WildAid jointly invited international scholars
to join a conference to discuss ways of saving the largest shark,
also the largest fish, on earth.</P>
      <P>NTOU professor Liu Kuang-ming suggested that tours to sight the
whale shark should be organized in Taiwan to help protect the animal.
As many countries, including Australia, the Philippines and Belize
promote such tours, he added, revenues generated in some of these
countries are greater than that generated in catching fish alone.</P>
      <P>While the whale shark is protected by many countries and listed
in the "threatened species" category by CITES (the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora),
Taiwan consumes large quantities of the animal each year.</P>
      <P>Known in Taiwan as "tofusa" (Tofu shark), the whale shark can
grow up to about 20 meters long and weigh approximately 34 tons, with
a life span of almost 100 years. Usually inhabiting shallow coastal
waters, it survives by eating small fish and shrimp. It poses no
threat to humans. Its tameness is the reason it is often caught and
hence the decreasing numbers.</P>
      <P>Under regulations by the Council of Agriculture under the
Executive Yuan, the quota for catching whale sharks is 65 this year,
and Taiwanese fishermen must report to authorities if they have
caught any.</P>

      <P>The two suspects, Wong Kin Hock and Leong Ching Lai, reportedly

      <P>The drug, also known as "red bean" or "K5", is classified by the

deal with anxiety, loss of sleep and muscle contractions. While
overdosing may lead to sleepiness, prolonged use of the drug may lead
to loss of memory, short attention span, and impaired visual and
spatial abilities.</P>
      <P>Authorities said the drug was originally abused by the students

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan should meet with President Chen Shui-bian prior to his planned
visit to China, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Lien should meet with President Chen before he travels to
Beijing to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao, " DPP legislative
whip William C.T. Lai said, adding that forging a domestic consensus
on relations across the Taiwan Strait should precede consultations
with the Chinese authorities.</P>
      <P>Lai reminded the KMT that cross-strait issues can be resolved
only through negotiations between the governments on both sides of
the strait.</P>
      <P>"As an opposition party, the KMT's dealings with the Chinese
Communist Party could lead nowhere," Lai said, pointing out that Chen
is the only Taiwan political figure to make Time Magazine's 2005 list
of the 100 most influential people in the world along with Chinese
President Hu and U.S. President George W. Bush.</P>
      <P>"The Time Magazine list indicates that Chen and Hu are the key
decisive figures as far as cross-strait issues are concerned, " Lai
said.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a series of recent public opinion polls,
Lai said more and more local people have voiced their expectations
that a national consensus should be forged before Taiwan begins
negotiations with China.</P>
      <P>In his view, Lai said, holding an inter-party summit meeting is
the best way for the domestic political parties to shape a consensus
on the thorny cross-strait issue.</P>
      <P>On the speculation that Hu may decline to meet with Lien if Lien
meets with Chen first, Lai said he hopes Lien will put national
interests above partisan or personal interests.</P>
      <P>President Chen expressed a desire last weekend to meet Lien when
he spoke to reporters after returning from Pope John Paul II's
funeral in the Vatican.</P>
      <P>Details of Lien's China trip have yet to be fleshed out but media

      <P>Taiwan's leading shoemaker Ever Rite

are gaining fame in the international market after their brands have
become recognized in the international market.</P>
      <P>Ever Rite was founded 25 years ago to make footwear as an OEM --
original equipment manufacturer. It is now a major global maker of
women's shoes, producing more than 80 million pairs of shoes thus
far, according to an Ever Rite executive.</P>
      <P>In 2001, the group created the brand "Miss Sofi, " Manager Kuo
Yi-chun said Monday, noting that the company has opened a total of 19
booths at department stores and exclusive shops around Taiwan, and
two franchise stores in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Miss Sofi products entered the Japanese market this spring, while
the company obtained strong orders for Miss Sofi shoes at a trade
fair in Italy in March, marking a good start in the Taipei
County-based group's efforts to make inroads into the European
market, Kuo indicated.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Franz Collection, which has been providing OEM/ODM

Retailers of Britain's first prize for the best china gift creation
May 17 last year with its "Franz" products, according to the company.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based chinaware producer has now nearly 6,000
employees at its 4,000 operational bases and outlets around the
globe.</P>
      <P>The "Franz" series of ornament-oriented products are now seen in
the top-graded shopping centers of the world like the Neiman Marcus

    <HEADLINE>RISING LOCAL CURRENCY WILL SLASH TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A continuously appreciating new Taiwan
dollar will deal a blow to the domestic export sector and drag down
the country's economic growth, the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research reported Monday.</P>
      <P>If the local unit keeps on gaining value to the level of 30.07 to
the U.S. dollar, Taiwan's export sector will be noticeably affected,
slashing the country's economic growth rate from an originally
targeted 4.37 percent by the institution to 3.82 percent for 2005,
senior researcher Wang Su-wan said in an analysis published in an
electronic newspaper run by the think tank for Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the new Taiwan dollar will go on picking up in
value against the U.S. dollar in the future, fueled by an influx of
hot money from abroad on a weakening greenback.</P>
      <P>As the United States is likely to give free rein to its currency
over the long term due to its long-standing federal budget deficits
and mounting trade gaps, Asian currencies, including the domestic
unit, are expected to further appreciate for the foreseeable future,
he said.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the central bank, he reported that
the new Taiwan dollar has appreciated nearly 10 percent against the
U.S. dollar since the beginning of this year. The 10 percent rise is
less than the surges in value posted by the Japanese yen and the
South Korean won, but far sharper if compared with mainland China's
renminbi, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar first broke the 35 level to the U. S.
dollar in July 2004. It closed at 31.56 against the greenback Monday
in the Taipei foreign exchange market.</P>
      <P>As a result of a continuously rising local unit, price quotations
in new Taiwan dollar terms by domestic companies have dropped during
the same time, Wang said.</P>
      <P>According to tallies compiled by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, export prices measured in new
Taiwan dollars posted a negative fall in annual growth in February
this year -- the first of its kind since May 2004.</P>
      <P>Wang expressed worry that the environment at home is becoming
increasingly difficult for companies to survive in the face of
surging prices of oil and raw materials, coupled with the impact of a
rising local currency on outbound shipments -- the backbone of
Taiwan's economy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A growing trend for health has made tea
drinks the mainstream of Taiwan's soft drink consumption, with more
than 7 million tons of tea drinks, said to be able to reduce body
fat, drunk by consumers in the country every year on average.</P>
      <P>According to the latest statistics produced by AC Nielsen, the
world's leading provider of market research, information and analysis
on consumer products, revenues of NT$15.7 billion (US$497.46 million)
was generated in Taiwan's packed tea drink market last year, posing
4.4 percent growth over the previous year.</P>
      <P>The record represented the best sales in Taiwan's soft drink
market, while carbonated drinks, which used to be star performers,
only generating about NT$8 billion for their makers in 2004, the
statistics show.</P>
      <P>Of the popular tea drinks, packs of the so-called "fat-killer"
green tea generated revenues of NT$5.4 billion last year, followed by
lemon-favored and juice-added tea drinks, according to the tallies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's tea drink consumption was mainly fanned by Japan's keen
interest in catechin, an active compound in green tea that has been
proved to be a powerful, water soluble polyphenol and antioxidant,
according to local businessmen involved in the soft drink industry.</P>
      <P>It is expected that Taiwan's tea drinks market will continue to
follow the Japanese fad this year, with green tea beverages that
makers claim can "shape the body and kill fat" to be the most popular
tea drinks of the year, according to the AC Nielsen analysis.</P>

Possible Cut in Troops in Iraq.

Two years after the fall of Saddam Hussein, the American-led
military campaign in Iraq is making enough progress in fighting
insurgents and training Iraqi security forces to allow the Pentagon
to plan for significant troop reductions by early next year, senior
commanders and Pentagon officials say. Attacks on allied forces have
dropped to 30 to 40 a day, down from an average daily peak of 140 in
the prelude to the Jan. 30 elections but still roughly at the levels
of a year ago. Only about half the attacks cause casualties or
damage, but on average one or more Americans die in Iraq every day,
often from roadside bombs. Thirty-six American troops died there in
March, the lowest monthly death toll since 21 died in February 2004.

Wall Street Journal: Democracy Drive by America Meets Reality in
Egypt.

The Middle East Partnership Initiative, an office under the State
Department announced it was giving about US$1 million in grants to
five local democracy groups in Egypt, a key U.S. ally with a notably
authoritarian government. The democracy grants have created an uproar
in Egypt. A pro-government weekly, Al Osboa, ran a scorching
editorial on its front page, calling them "a unique event, an
aberrant action and a major sin, " and accusing the groups that
accepted them of being pro-Zionist, anti-Egyptian and anti-Arab.
Imams at two big mosques branded the recipients servants of the
American infidel. A committee of Egypt's parliament opened an
investigation of what it saw as U.S. collusion with the grants'
beneficiaries, and lawmakers are now weighing proposals to ban future
foreign grants.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT JOURNALISTIC EXCHANGES STILL ONGOING: GIO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Correspondent exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait will continue despite the Mainland Affairs Council's
(MAC's) decision to temporarily ban two Chinese media outlets from
posting journalists in Taiwan, a senior official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office Minister Pasuya Yao made the
remarks after MAC Chairman Joseph Wu announced a day earlier that
China's state-run Xinhua news agency and People's Daily newspaper
will be banned from sending journalists to Taiwan for the time being
because, he said, the two media outlets only air rumors or opinions
from the "extreme ends of Taiwan's political spectrum."</P>
      <P>Noting that China is not a country that values or upholds freedom
of the press, Yao said the two official Chinese media outlets'
coverage of Taiwan's news events, including the huge street march in
Taipei March 26 against China's anti-secession law, has not helped
China understand Taiwan society at all.</P>
      <P>In the wake of China's enactment of its anti-secession law
codifying the use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan, Yao said the
MAC, the nation's top mainland policy planning agency, should take
measures to rein in cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>According to Yao, the temporary ban has nothing to do with
infringing upon press freedom, as has been claimed by some local
critics.</P>
      <P>In his view, Yao said, distorted, misleading or smearing Chinese
reports about Taiwan are not conducive to cross-strait journalistic
exchanges or the promotion of press freedom.</P>
      <P>Yao further said the MAC's original aim of allowing Chinese media
outlets to post reporters in Taiwan was to promote cross-strait
mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>However, he went on, the unbalanced reports written by Xinhua and
People's Daily correspondents on political affairs in Taiwan have not
helped the Chinese public know more about Taiwan. Their reports have
not truthfully reflected the mainstream opinions of Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>Despite the temporary ban on the two media outlets, Yao said the
MAC has not banned other Chinese media organizations from sending
journalists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yao said the GIO is hopeful that Chinese media outlets can
truthfully convey the voices of the Taiwan people. If they can uphold
this principle, he said, the GIO will be more than willing to assist
in promoting cross-strait journalistic exchanges.</P>
      <P>"In the long run, cross-strait journalistic exchanges will
continue," he added.</P>
      <P>As to when the ban on Xinhua and People's Daily correspondents
will be lifted, Yao said that will be up to the MAC and national
security authorities to decide.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first allowed Chinese media to post reporters in Taiwan in
late 2000. Besides Xinhua and People's Daily, three other Chinese
media outlets -- China Central Television (CCTV) , China News Agency
and China National Radio -- have also posted journalists in Taiwan.
Each of them is allowed to send two reporters to Taiwan, rotating
them each month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MUST ACT CAUTIOUSLY WITH RISING NATIONALISM IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With nationalism on the rise in China,
Taiwan should exercise great caution so as not to affect cross-Taiwan
Strait relations and the operations of Taiwan businessmen in China, a
scholar said Monday.</P>
      <P>Professor Liu Pi-jung of Soochow University made the remarks
while commenting on a spate of anti-Japanese activities in China,
including calls for a boycott of Japanese products and angry protests
in front of the Japanese embassy and missions there.</P>
      <P>Liu claimed that nationalism started to bud in East Asia "this
year," citing Japan, South Korea, China and Taiwan as examples, and
saying that there have been clashes among these countries.</P>
      <P>"The problem with nationalism is that it is easy to run unchecked
after being incited," Liu said, adding that it will be worth watching
to see if the spate of anti-Japanese activities, which have already
swept over to Guangzhou and Shenzhen from Beijing, will continue to
spread.</P>
      <P>When the United States mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade in 1999, Liu noted that while it also caused anti-U.S.
feelings, the anger did not last long, mainly because China and the
United States are less historically entwined.</P>
      <P>But the complicated historical relations between China and Japan
have whipped up anti-Japanese activities, Liu said, adding that the
protests were the result of long-term territorial disputes, a recent
fight over valuable resources in the East China Sea, Japan's bid to
serve as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council,
and a furor over a recently published Japanese textbook that China
believes attempts to whitewash Japanese atrocities against other
countries during World War II.</P>
      <P>For China, anti-Japan and anti-Taiwan independence are "two
political orthodox things, " Liu said, adding that Taiwan should
exercise great caution amid such anti-Japanese feelings.</P>
      <P>Liu said that a recent visit by the head of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union to a Tokyo shrine dedicated to the Imperial Army
dead of World War II might lead the Chinese to link their
anti-Japanese sentiment to their anti-Taiwan independence feelings.</P>
      <P>If such feelings are incited, it will probably affect the
operations of Taiwan businessmen in China, as well as cross-strait
exchanges, he cautioned.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN COULD BE LOSER IN SOURING CHINA-JAPAN TIES: ACADEMIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If past experience is any measure, souring
China-Japan ties will not make it easier for Taiwan to improve its
relations with Japan, an academic specializing in China-Japan ties
cautioned Monday.</P>
      <P>"On the contrary, it often poses more difficulties for Taiwan to
make any advancement in its non-official relationship with Japan, "
said Ke Yu-chih, an associate researcher at the Institute of
International Relations of National Chengchi University in Taipei.</P>
      <P>This is because Japanese diplomats, who are extremely cautious,
worry that their association with Taiwan will worsen their country's
already strained ties with China, and prefer to shelf their dealings
with Taiwan when they are in trouble with China, Ke explained.</P>
      <P>But she didn't rule out the possibility for breakthroughs on
specific issues between Taipei and Tokyo amid tensions between Japan
and China.</P>
      <P>In Ke's view, the recent anti-Japan protests in many Chinese
cities will make a dent in bilateral trade over the short term, but
its long term impact, if any, is currently unclear.</P>
      <P>The Japan-bashing atmosphere prevailing on the mainland is a sign
that the China-Japan friendship that culminated in a 1998 visit to
Japan by former Chinese President Jiang Zemin is on the rocks, Ke
said.</P>
      <P>She attributed the recent anti-Japan protests to the great deal
of strife between the two countries, such as Chinese anger over the
way Japan has played down in new middle school history text books
Japan's aggression against China during World War II, the territorial
dispute in the Chinese East Sea, and China's worry about Japan's
closer defense alliance with the United States, to name a few.</P>
      <P>The demonstrations, of course, will cloud economic cooperation
between the two countries, and bilateral talks on a free trade pact
between Tokyo and Beijing, which was expected to begin this year is
set to be shelved, Ke went on. </P>
      <P>Although the possibility is slim for the two countries to improve
their political ties in the short term, the possibility that they
will sever ties because of the current troubles is even less in light
of close economic ties between them, Ke said.</P>
      <P>Noting that China is Japan's largest trading partner, with
bilateral trade of US$168 billion, or 14.6 percent of China's total
international trade last year, Ke said a severance of diplomatic ties
would be a disaster for both Japan and China.</P>

Taiwan a role in the United Nations if Taiwan were to acknowledge
Beijing's "one China" principle, according to members of a visiting
group from the Taipei-based Foundation on International &amp;
Cross-Strait Studies.</P>
      <P>An anonymous member of the group told CNA that some Chinese
academics they met here Monday suggested that as long as there is an
understanding between Taiwan and China that they will eventually
unite someday, China's delegation to the United Nations should use a
name and be made up of members agreed upon by both Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>But before Taiwan and China work out a way to assemble a
delegation and a name for this delegation, China's seat at the United
Nation should be represented by the People's Republic of China, said
the sources.</P>
      <P>The academics also said Taiwan could send its own delegations to
international bodies other than the United Nations, according to the
Taipei foundation member.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegates quoted their Chinese contacts as saying that
although the suggestions were only personal opinions, they are in
line with China's Anti-Secession Law.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's decision to temporarily
ban two Chinese media outlets from posting journalists in Taiwan has
nothing to do with restrictions on freedom of the press, Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the decision to ban China's state-run Xinhua
news agency and People's Daily newspaper from sending correspondents
to Taiwan for the time being is part of the government's efforts to
"effectively manage" exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Noting that "active opening, effective management" remains the
government's fundamental cross-strait policy, Huang said the
temporary ban was adopted in tune with this guideline.</P>
      <P>"The temporary ban is part of our efforts to maintain the order
of cross-strait journalistic exchanges and has nothing to do with
freedom of the press," Huang explained.</P>
      <P>He said it is China that has spared no efforts to suppress
freedom of the press. In addition to blacking out reports about
Taiwan, he said, China has suppressed reform-minded Chinese
newspapers, concealed recent farmers' riots in Sichuan Province, and
ordered the closure of Peking University's and Tsinghua University's
BBS Websites.</P>
      <P>If China can meet the standards outlined by the International
Press Association for press freedom, such as free access to media
information, free transmission of news information, free publication
of newspapers and free expression of opinions, Huang said, a
barrier-free environment for cross-strait journalistic exchanges can
be realized immediately.</P>
      <P>Before such a day comes, Huang said he hopes the Chinese
authorities will at least lift its blackout against the online
Internet editions of Taiwan's two major newspapers -- China Times and

      <P>Meanwhile, Huang said, the government will not waver on its
resolve to promote constructive cross-strait journalistic exchanges.</P>
      <P>Despite the temporary ban on the two media outlets, Huang said
the government has not banned other Chinese media organizations from
sending journalists to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, the MAC is studying the feasibility of
allowing reform-minded Chinese media outlets to post journalists in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We'll announce the evaluation results when the time is ripe," he
added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first allowed Chinese media to post reporters in Taiwan in
late 2000. Besides Xinhua and People's Daily, three other Chinese
media outlets -- China Central Television (CCTV) , China News Agency
and China National Radio -- have also posted journalists in Taiwan.
Each of them is allowed to send two reporters to Taiwan, rotating
them each month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT TO PROMOTE FINANCIAL MARKET INTEGRATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 11 (CNA)
(By Wayne Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A government plan to speed up integration
among Taiwan's financial institutions will continue to be promoted,
officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>During a presentation, Financial Supervisory Commission Chairman
Kong Jaw-sheng said that the financial markets are to be integrated
through mergers of banks, stock companies and insurance firms.</P>
      <P>Kong was attending a conference to brief ruling Democratic
Progressive Party representatives on the domestic financial market
situation and the government's integration plans.</P>
      <P>To encourage institutions to integrate, the government has begun
a plan to allow Taiwan-based banks with a market share of over 10
percent in the country to get early approval to set up overseas
branches and purchase foreign banks. These banks will also be
automatically allowed to move their branches to other locations,
according to the reports made during the presentation.</P>
      <P>Kong said Taiwan's financial market still has room for
integration as none of the 14 domestic financial holding companies
have a market share of more than 10 percent.</P>
      <P>The plan will also continue to prohibit new banks or branches
from being established in Taiwan unless as part of the merger plan,
said Kong.</P>

determination to promote children's welfare services, particularly
assistance to those from impoverished families.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GIO CHIEF LAUDS PRESIDENT'S INCLUSION IN TIME'S 2005 TOP 100</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  11 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The fact that President Chen Shui-bian
made it onto Time magazine's 2005 top 100 list is further evidence of
his achievements in leading the country onto the world stage,
Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Pasuya Wen-chih Yao said
Monday.</P>
      <P>He claimed that some local media erroneously translated Time's
English citation of Chen as "the president who has led Taiwan to the
brink of war."</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Yao said, China, which enacted a law to give
itself the right to attack Taiwan in defiance of worldwide
opposition, should be responsible for the crisis of war that looms
large across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Chen who refuses to compromise on Taiwan's
sovereignty despite his full understanding that the international
situation is not favorable for the country's diplomacy, has spared no
efforts to maintain peace across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Describing Chen a leader with a good grasp of public opinion, Yao
said the president knows the importance of stability across the
strait and has reiterated many times his determination to improve
ties with China.</P>
      <P>He cited as proof the president's promises, made in his 2000
inaugural address, to refrain from moving Taiwan toward independence,
and his declaration in 2004 that his administration is willing to
advance ties with China on the basis of the two sides' 1992 talks.</P>
      <P>"All these prove that the president is a pragmatic leader with
the determination to improve ties with China," the GIO chief said.</P>

      <P>A ranking U.S. State Department
official, who has been nominated for the post of U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, said Monday that he supports Taiwan's bid to join
the World Health Assembly, the highest decision-making body of the
World Health Organization, as an observer.</P>
      <P>John Bolton, the incumbent under secretary of state for arms
control and international security, voiced his support for Taiwan's
bid while attending a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing
on his nomination.</P>
      <P>Bolton has said before that Taiwan meets the requirements of
statehood to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>In his confirmation hearing to become under secretary of state in
2001, Bolton had also said that he felt the admission of Taiwan to
the United Nations would be consistent with the United States'

      <P>In response to questions raised by Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R-R.I.)

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN URGED TO SPEAK FOR HUMAN RIGHTS DURING CHINA TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan should speak for those whose basic human rights or religious
freedom have been oppressed by the Chinese government during his
planned China visit, a ruling party legislative whip said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-jun, secretary-general of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party's legislative caucus, said at a news conference
that 50.5 percent of the respondents in a just-released public
opinion poll voiced opposition to Lien's planned trip to China to
meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao, compared to 36.7 percent who
gave a thumbs-up to Lien's travel plan.</P>
      <P>"The poll results indicate that more than half of the Taiwan
people don't support Lien's planned China visit, " Chen said, adding
that if Lien insists on his travel plan in defiance of mainstream
public opinion, he should be courageous enough to ask the top Chinese
leaders to stop human rights abuse and cease suppression of Falun
Gong and Catholic followers.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, William C.T. Lai, also a DPP
legislative whip, said he hopes Lien can meet with President Chen
Shui-bian before traveling to China to meet with the Chinese leader.</P>
      <P>"Forging a national consensus on relations across the Taiwan
Strait should precede negotiations with China. We hope Lien can make
a positive response to the president's call for an inter-party summit
to shape a domestic consensus before his China trip for the sake of
safeguarding the ultimate national interest," Lai added.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
last weekend upon his return from a historic visit to the Vatican to
attend Pope John Paul II's funeral, Chen said he is willing to
support Lien's planned China visit and authorize Lien to talk with
Chinese authorities on certain issues so long as Lien meets with him
prior to his departure for the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lien issued a publis statement Monday saying that his mainland
visit doesn't require the govenrment's authorization because he is

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKER CALLS FOR FINGERPRINT REQUIREMENT TO REMAIN IN PLACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) on Tuesday urged the Legislative Yuan not to
review an amendment to the household registration law, saying that
the requirement for citizens to be fingerprinted when claiming a new
identification card should remain in place.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Tsai Huang-liang made the remarks amid public
concerns about social order after two policemen were attacked from
behind in broad daylight while patrolling the streets in Hsihchih,
Taipei County. One of the police officers was killed and the other
seriously injured in the attack.</P>
      <P>Under the current law, citizens will be required to be
fingerprinted when claiming the new version of the ID card which is
set to be launched July 1.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan recently proposed a package of revisions to
the household registration law to remove the fingerprint requirement
due to pressure from human rights organizations.</P>
      <P>Tsai stressed the importance of establishing a national
fingerprint data bank, saying that it would save costs and resources
in police work to track down criminals.</P>
      <P>"Human rights cannot be used as a pretext for not setting up such
a data bank, " Tsai said, adding that effective use of current
technology to secure personal information could prevent any potential
human rights abuses.</P>
      <P>"It is regrettable that the Executive Yuan wants to revise the
law to remove the fingerprint requirement when social order is
getting worse," Tsai said.</P>
      <P>While asking the Legislative Yuan to shelve the draft revision
package put forward by the Executive Yuan, Tsai said that it would
be better if the Executive Yuan itself withdrew the bill.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, William C.T. Lai, DPP party whip in the legislature,
called for a national conference on social order to be held to invite
experts to discuss and review ways to improve social order, including
revising laws, improving police forces and their equipment, and
promoting relevant education and the importance of family.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER VOWS TO HUNT DOWN COP KILLERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh on Tuesday expressed
his regret over the recent attack by two assailants on two police
officers in which one of the officers was killed and the other
seriously injured.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks while answering lawmakers' questions in an
interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan. He pledged to make
full efforts in hunting down the two assailants.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lin Yu-fang of the opposition People First Party
accused Hsieh of contributing to the police force's failure to
capture the assailants in the hours after the crime, claiming that
many police officers had been assigned to protecting the premier who
was taking part in a public activity nearby at the time. Lin's charge
was later denied by Taipei city police authorities.</P>
      <P>The two policemen, Hung Chung-nan, 30, and Chang Ta-hao, 31, were
stabbed from behind by two men while on patrol in Hsihchih, Taipei
County Sunday. Chang's gun and 12 rounds of ammunition were taken,
while Hung fought to defend his weapon. Hung bled to death after
being stabbed 15 times, and Chang was wounded badly.</P>
      <P>According to a surveillance video released Monday, the two
assailants, both of whom are about 170 cm tall, were wearing
full-face motorcycle helmets at the time of the attack. They sped of
on motorcycle after the attack.</P>
      <P>At the time of the attack, the premier was in Nankang, a Taipei
City district located next to Hsihchih township.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he believes that no Taipei County police officers were
summoned to protect him during his visit to the district.
Nevertheless, he said he will seek the relevant authorities'
confirmation in the matter. He stressed that as premier of the
country, he is responsible for maintaining social order.</P>
      <P>The premier said he will ask relevant law enforcement units to
carry out a general review of social order problems every three
months, noting that he is confident that the assailants in Sunday's
attack will soon be captured by police.</P>
      <P>Police are asking the public to come forward with any information
in the cop killing case and are offering a cash reward of NT$500,000
(US$15,873) for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
the suspects.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh will lead all Cabinet
members to take part in a three-day anti-terrorism drill starting
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The drill will be held at Hengshan command post, a tightly
guarded command center in Tachih on the outskirts of Taipei,
officials from a counter-terrorism action office under the Executive
Yuan revealed Tuesday. </P>
      <P>Officials said the drill will consist of a computer
simulation on the scenario of Taiwan being attacked by terrorists.</P>
      <P>Premier Hsieh said in an interpellation at the Legislative Yuan
Tuesday that the Presidential Office will announce if President Chen
Shui-bian will attend the anti-terrorism drill.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Minister of National Defense Lee
Jye said that the anti-terrorism drill will be conducted by the
Executive Yuan, with Premier Hsieh as the convener, in the first half
of the year, while the annual military drill -- the "Hankuang"
exercises -- will be held later this year, which will also include an
anti-decapitation strike drill.</P>
      <P>Asked whether "Hankuang" live-fire maneuvers will raise
cross-strait tensions, Hsieh said the annual drills are needed and
everyone should take them in stride.</P>
      <P>Decapitation strategies short-circuit command and control
systems, wipe out nationwide nerve centers and leave the opponent
hopelessly immobilized. Many military observers say the mainland is
very likely to use this strategy to invade Taiwan by seizing the
island's center of power, the capital, and its top leaders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>E.U. SEES DIFFICULTIES IN LIFTING ARMS EMBARGO AGAINST CHINA: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Union (E. U.) has seen
growing difficulties regarding a proposed lifting of its arms embargo
against mainland China following Beijing's enactment of the Anti-
Secession Law against Taiwan, an official from Taiwan's Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Larry Yu-yuan Wang, director-general of the MOFA's European
Affairs Department, said that the E.U. feels that it is more
difficult to make the move in the wake of the March 14 enactment of
the law which authorizes the use of "non-peaceful means" against
Taiwan should the island move toward formal independence.</P>
      <P>Citing public response in Britain to Beijing's enactment of the
law, Wang pointed out that the E. U. has changed its original stance
of aiming to lift the ban in the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>As Britain will assume the E.U.'s rotating presidency in the
second half of 2005, observers see a number of uncertainties standing
in the way of the E.U. lifting the ban due to Britain's close links
with the United States, Wang said, adding that the MOFA's outposts
will continue to closely monitor developments.</P>
      <P>Wang's comments came one day after a Hong Kong media report that
China will purchase 210 Mirage 2000-9CS fighters from France after
the E. U. lifts its ban on weapons exports to China. The ban was
imposed in the aftermath of the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in Tianamen Square in June 1989.</P>

      <P>The Non-Partisan Solidarity Union (NPSU)
said Tuesday that a package of constitutional amendments passed by
the Legislative Yuan last year will be detrimental to small parties.</P>
      <P>NPSU Chairwoman Chang Po-ya made the remarks when she introduced
her party's aspirants for the May 14 election of the mission-oriented
National Assembly and solicited public support for them.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that the NPSU was the only political party that was
opposed to a package of constitutional amendments passed by the
Legislative Yuan during an extraordinary meeting last August.</P>
      <P>A total of 300 delegates to the ad hoc National Assembly will be
elected on May 14, whose mission will be to approve a package of
constitutional amendments passed by the legislature -- including
cutting the 225-seat Legislative Yuan by almost half, changing the
election system to a "single seat, two votes" formula from the
present "multi-seat" one, abolishing the National Assembly and
redefining the right to hold a referendum which is in the
ROC Constitution.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the proposed new election system will squeeze out
the small parties that represent the voice of the underprivileged and
minority groups, which she said is not favorable to the pluralistic,
democratic development of the nation.</P>
      <P>Among the NPSU aspirants, the second generation political figures
are most noticeable, including Yen Kuang-heng, son of Legislator Yen
Chin-piao; Chen Hsiu-pao, daughter of Legislator Chen Chin-ting; and
Shih Nai-yuan, son of former Hsinchu Mayor Shih Hsin-chung.</P>

Taiwan's top technological research institute openly promoted the HD
DVD format to be the main format on behalf of Taiwanese firms.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the Industrial Technology Research Institute

      <P>Topics including progress, authorization and marketing strategies
of new DVD formats were also brought up during the ITRI-held meeting.</P>
      <P>Deputy Director of ITRI's Opto-Electronics &amp; Systems Laboratories

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government should take immediate steps
to improve public order after a spate of outrageous criminal cases
were reported in recent days, a group of opposition People First
Party (PFP) legislators said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The PFP lawmakers, including Lee Hung-chun, Chang Hsien-yao and
Wu Ching-che, suggested at a news conference that the National Police
Administration, the Coast Guard Administration, the National Fire
Administration and the proposed Immigration Administration be
integrated into a single agency under the direct jurisdiction of the
Executive Yuan to upgrade crime-fighting efficiency.</P>
      <P>At present, the National Police Administration is under the
jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior.</P>
      <P>Lee said that after two policemen were assaulted in broad
daylight while patrolling the streets in Hsihchih, Taipei County
Sunday, the government should call a national crime-fighting
conference immediately to hammer out effective measures to reduce
crimes and better protect the safety of police officers. In the
Sunday assault, one of the police officers was killed and the other
seriously injured.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Lee said 1,659 police officers were
either killed or injured between 2002 and 2004, accounting for 2.5
percent of the nation's total police force.</P>
      <P>"The ratio ranks among the world's highest, indicating that our
public order has worsened steadily, " Lee said, adding that the
government should pay more heed to the situation.</P>
      <P>In addition to upgrading the National Police Administration and
purchasing advanced crime-fighting equipment, Lee suggested that the
government set up a NT$3 billion police fund to care for injured
police officers and their families as well as bereaved families of
policemen killed in the line of duty.</P>
      <P>"By setting up the fund, we'll be able to offer better welfare
services to policemen who were injured on duty or the families of
police officers killed on duty," Lee said, adding that the measure is
also expected to help boost the morale of all police personnel.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A representative of the U.S.-based
Chinese-language New Tang Dynasty Television (NTDTV) station called
on the people of Taiwan on Tuesday to support the company's fight for
freedom of communication, which the representative claimed has been
jeopardized because of China's suppression.</P>
      <P>Liu Ying-chuan made the appeal ahead of the scheduled termination
on April 15 of a contract between NTDTV and European satellite
operator Eutelsat. NTDTV claims that Eutelsat has refused to renew
the contract under pressure from China.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, NTDTV has since March 2004 leased an Asian
satellite channel from Eutelsat to broadcast uncensored programs into
China.</P>
      <P>Liu said Beijing is unhappy with NTDTV's reporting on Chinese
persecution of dissidents and religious groups and has tempted
Eutelsat to end its contract with NTDTV in exchange for a deal to
broadcast the 2008 Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Liu argued that Chinese suppression of freedom of the media and
information will lead to internal conflicts in China and pose a
threat to the overseas Chinese community and the international
community.</P>
      <P>With the United States being a major client of Eutelsat, she
asked the Taiwan people to write to U.S. President George W. Bush or
support a NTDTV signature campaign to push Eutelsat to change its
decision.</P>
      <P>Beijing has denounced NTDTV -- whose staff include a number of
Falun Gong practitioners -- as a mouthpiece for the cult that has
been outlawed by China.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-hua, a professor of journalism at National Taiwan
University, who is also a leading member of the Falun Gong
organization in Taiwan, said while Taiwan's decision to temporarily
ban China's state-run Xinhua news agency and People's Daily from
posting reporters on the island has raised widespread discussions on
media freedom, the people of Taiwan seldom pay attention to
suppression of media freedom in China.</P>
      <P>Chang said the NTDTV incident is a typical case of suppression of
media freedom and she urged the Taiwan people to support NTDTV's
cause.</P>

      <P>An Olympic gold medalist in taekwondo who
had a sorted youth, shared her experiences of overcoming frustration
and finding a way toward a better path of life to 50 kids at a
reformatory school in a seminar Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Shih-hsin, 27, was invited by the Taichung District Court to
meet the juvenile delinquents, helping them learn to see the world
with the right view of life and values, and assist them to walk out
the shadow of their lives.</P>
      <P>Chen said that she was wild as a youngster, noting she ran away
from home and stayed away three years. During those years, she worked
as a betel nut vendor, and also once sold goods as a vendor on the
street; and thank God, she did not make mistakes large enough for her
to be sent to a reformatory school, Chen recalled.</P>
      <P>The star athlete told the kids that she decided to resume
taekwondo lessons that she had started at the age of five, after
discovering that all her wayward ways had done her no good. By that
time, she began to learn how to cherish her life and establish a good
career as a taekwondo athlete, Chen said.</P>
      <P>In the meeting with the youngsters now at a crossroads, the
Olympic medal-winner encouraged them to find out who they are and
what they can do, and not to be afraid of experiencing frustration
and failures while facing life's challenges.</P>
      <P>Chen won the women's under 49kg taekwondo gold medal at the 2004
Olympic Games in Athens, Taiwan's first Olympic gold medal.</P>

      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
remains firm in his decision to step down from the party's top post
in August, KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks came after an endorsement, launched by various city
and county council speakers and deputy speakers calling on Lien to
continue serving as KMT head by taking part in a party election for
the next chairman set for July 16, was made public earlier the same
day by the local media.</P>
      <P>The endorsement, initiated by Yunlin County Council Speaker Chen
Ching-hsiu, urged Lien to seek a second term through a vote in the
party for the sake of the party's unity and future.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, Lien is very grateful for the warm support from
the public. But he added that Lien "remains unchanged for the time
being on his decision to quit the post."</P>
      <P>The endorsement came at a time when the competition between
Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou

kicking off campaigning to seek greater backing from party members.</P>
      <P>After learning the news about the endorsement, Wang said earlier
the same day that he is willing to quit the race if Lien decides to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between the Republic of China
and its African allies have not been affected by a recent episode
involving decorative designs on soup cups used at a luncheon in honor
of their envoys stationed in Taipei, an official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) has apologized for the
incident, which has not affected our interactions and existing
relations with our African allies," said MOFA spokesman Michel Lu.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, ambassadors of the ROC's African
allies, including Swaziland, Malawi, Chad, Senegal and Sao Tome and
Principe, were annoyed by cartoon motifs on bouillon cups used at a
luncheon in their honor during their inspection tour of the Penchou
Industrial Park in the southern county of Kaohsiung April 7.</P>
      <P>The decorative designs featured a person playing with animals,
including a lion, a jellyfish, a starfish and a giraffe. Although the
person looked Oriental, the cup was printed with "African Natives."</P>
      <P>The ambassadors reportedly felt humiliated by the design. They
were especially irritated by the jellyfish decoration because
jellyfish is a pun for " men with no guts," media reports said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, Lu said the African envoys indeed
reacted unhappily upon seeing the motifs on the soup cups. But after
talking things out, Lu said they accepted the explanations given by
officials of the Kaohsiung County Government's information
department.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the luncheon was arranged by the county
government's media officials.</P>
      <P>"The table settings were used naturally and they didn't have any
ill intentions. They thought the decorative designs were interesting
and lovely," Lu said.</P>
      <P>The foreign envoys later accepted MOFA's apology and completed
their schedule, Lu said, adding that the episode didn't affect the
ROC's relations with its African allies.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh on Tuesday urged China
to hold ameeting with Taiwan to discuss details of exporting Taiwan's
agricultural products into the mainland in order to uphold Taiwanese
farmers' rights.</P>
      <P>During a question-and-answer session at the Legislative Yuan,

      <P>He made the remarks in response to an opposition Kuomintang

farmers make inroads into China's produce market, particularly as
Taiwan has a surplus of agricultural products this year.</P>
      <P>The premier in principle agreed with the idea, but stressed that
a meeting between Taiwan and China should be organized to ensure the
rights of Taiwanese farmers before going into the details, and that
government powers should be present in dealing with cross-strait
trade issues.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that his
Cabinet hopes that the media figures in Hong Kong and China who
understand and can help cross-strait issues can come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in the wake of a decision by the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) Sunday that China's state-run Xinhua news
agency and People's Daily newspaper will be banned from sending
journalists to Taiwan for the time being in an effort to protect
national dignity and the interests of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MAC said the coverage of Taiwan by Xinhua and People's
Daily is not conducive to enhancing understanding of the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, adding that some Chinese media groups have focused
only on the most extreme or radical opinions in Taiwan's political
spectrum.</P>
      <P>Refuting criticism by Legislator Lin Yu-feng of the opposition
People First Party who described the government's reason for
suspending the two ousted Chinese news media organizations as lame
and that it would only undermine journalistic freedoms and Taiwan's
image, Hsieh said he hopes that others will not mistakenly think that
the temporary ban will be an interruption of cross-strait journalist
exchanges or a regression of journalistic freedom.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first allowed Chinese media to post reporters in Taiwan in
late 2000. Besides Xinhua and the Peoples' Daily, three other Chinese
media outlets -- China Central Television, China News Agency and
China National Radio -- have also posted journalists in Taiwan. Each
of them is allowed to send two reporters to Taiwan, rotating them

    <TEXT>
      <P>The assets of offshore banking units
(OBUs) totaled US$69.22 billion as of the end of 2004, although
capital coming from Asia dropped while the capital from America
increased to 20 percent, the Directorate General of the Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS report on the situation of OBUs
operations, as of the end of 2004, 70 banks in Taiwan were engaged in
OBUs operations. Among them, 42 are domestic banks and 28 are foreign
banks.</P>
      <P>The assets of OBUs operations in 2004 totaled US$69.22 billion,
with the annual increase rate over the past five years averaging 10.9
percent.</P>
      <P>The source of capital came mainly from deposits of financial
institutions, accounting for 61.7 percent at the end of 2004.</P>
      <P>In terms of the sources of capital, Asia had been a major source
over the past years, accounting for more than 70 percent, but the
ratio has slipped since 2001. The ratio dropped to 64 percent in
2004, compared with the ratio of America and Europe, which had
increased to 20 percent and 11 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>In terms of capital destinations, Asia has been the major
destination over the years, accounting for 67 percent at the end of
2004, followed by America at 20 percent, and Europe at 10 percent.</P>
      <P>There has been an upward trend in Asia over the years, while a
downward trend for America, DGBAS officials added.</P>
      <P>OBU is a financial institution carrying out offshore trades.
Offshore banking has been regarded as an alternative to opening up a
local market to foreign banks. In effect, offshore banking enables an
institution to engage in banking and foreign exchange activities 
free of the regulations of the host country.</P>

      <P>The government will negotiate an
agricultural cooperation deal with Beijing to allow China to learn
from Taiwan's agriculture experience if cross-Taiwan Strait relations
improve, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman You Ying-lung said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>You said that problems with China's farmers, farming villages and
agricultural sector in general have become a factor that is likely to
lead to widespread social unrest in China.</P>
      <P>While the income of farmers, which number 900 million, lags far
behind that of urban residents in China, up to 26 million Chinese
farmers are living in absolute poverty, You pointed out.</P>
      <P>You said the government has never restricted exports of Taiwan's
agricultural products to China but it has to make careful
consideration before allowing the export of agricultural technology.</P>
      <P>According to You, although local farmers will increase their
profits in the short run by exporting agricultural products to China,
securing their long-term interests requires comprehensive planning.</P>
      <P>Calling the public's attention to the political motives behind
China's policies, You urged political parties and civic groups
interested in cross-Taiwan Strait affairs not to be deceived by
Beijing's united front tactics against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>You claimed that by welcoming Taiwanese agricultural products
into the Chinese market and Taiwanese agricultural investment in
China, Beijing is trying to win the favor of Taiwanese farmers and
agricultural groups in an attempt to absorb Taiwan's agricultural
technology and resources.</P>
      <P>By doing so, Beijing is also trying to create a false impression
that cross-strait exchanges continue to flourish despite the recent
enactment of its aggressive Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan,
which has invited widespread condemnation from the international
community, he said.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government decided Tuesday
to postpone a plan to invite Tokyo Governor Shintaro Ishihara to
serve as the spokesman of a Taipei travel journal's Japanese edition
following disputes concerning Japan, a city official said.</P>
      <P>The plan was formed in March when Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
visited Tokyo and invited Ishihara to tout Taipei tourism, the
official said, noting that the city government has been preparing for
the matter since Ma's return from Japan.</P>
      <P>However, right before the mailing of an official invitation to
Ishihara, two incidents concerning Japan's wartime actions sparked
anti-Japanese sentiment in Taiwan and China, the official said,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) will offer
a nutrient called "Lorenzo's Oil" to three local boys suffering from
a rare degenerative disease who are now receiving treatment in the
United States if U.S. physicians think that the nutrient will be
helpful to them, an official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Hsiu-chuan, director of the DOH's Bureau of Health Promotion
(BHP) , was responding to media reports that the father of the three
brothers, all of whom suffer from adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) had
complained in a news conference held in the United States about
Taiwan's reluctance to continue offering the nutrient to his sons for
free.</P>
      <P>According to media reports, American physicians said at the news
briefing that the three brothers need to be treated with Lorenzo's
Oil, which is said to be able to slow the deterioration of the rare
genetic disease, although its effects have yet to be scientifically
verified and remain speculative.</P>
      <P>Lin said the BHP has sent a letter to the three brothers'
American doctor asking for his affirmation that the three boys need
the nutrient.</P>
      <P>"Once we receive the affirmation, we'll offer the Lorenzo's Oil
to the three brothers," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan imports Lorenzo's Oil from the United States and according
to media reports, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration sets
stringent conditions for obtain prescriptions for it. Only those who
are under seven years of age and have not yet shown ALD symptoms can
secure a prescription from a designated physician in the state of
Maryland, according to the reports.
</P>
      <P>The father of the three boys, Chang Ming-hui, wrote to National
Taiwan University Hospital earlier this month asking for a free
three-month supply of Lorenzo's Oil.</P>
      <P>According to Taiwan's national health insurance regulations, the
three brothers are not entitled to free supplies of the nutrient
because they went abroad for medical treatment without the
endorsement of any local medical institution.</P>
      <P>The three ALD-afflicted brothers left for Minnesota in January
this year in the company of their parents to receive treatment for
their rare disorder.</P>
      <P>Local people donated a staggering NT$72 million (US$2.25 million)
in just a few days after their father, a Kaohsiung city government
staff member, appealed for financial help on the Internet.</P>
      <P>ALD is a rare genetic disorder in which the fatty myelin
"insulation" around the nerves breaks down. The disease was brought
to public attention largely thanks to the 1992 film "Lorenzo's Oil, "
which was based on the true story of an American couple's search for
a cure for their ALD-afflicted son.</P>

that the government had originally planned to set up the Committee
for Cross-Strait Peace and Development first before enacting a law
governing the committee.</P>
      <P>The legislature's Home and Nations Committee is scheduled to
start reviewing the bill Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to a draft law unveiled by the PFP, a special
cross-strait peace consultation committee would be established under
the law that would be able to negotiate with the Beijing authorities
without the president's authorization.</P>
      <P>Any cross-strait peace agreement signed by the committee and
approved by the Legislative Yuan would become effective after being
put to a public referendum, and any resolution and legislation
proposed by the committee and endorsed by the legislature would be
binding for government agencies, according to the draft.</P>
      <P>However, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator
criticized the PFP-proposed bill as unconstitutional a day earlier
and suggested that it be put off.</P>
      <P>This triggered strong retaliation from the PFP, which joined
forces with the opposition Kuomintang to bar more than 20
DPP-proposed bills from being included on the legislature's agenda
during Tuesday's procedures committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-ping, a whip of the PFP legislative caucus, said the PFP
will continue to boycott bills proposed by the DPP if the DPP
continues to call the PFP bill unconstitutional.</P>
      <P>Ker Chien-ming, head of the DPP's Policy Committee, said his
party has never opposed the cross-strait peace promotion bill and he
urged the PFP not to "damage the harmonious atmosphere" of the
legislature because of this case.</P>
      <P>Ker said the DPP will consult with the PFP to ensure that the
content of the bill is in conformity with the national interest and
the Constitution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET TO CONDUCT FIRST-EVER ANTI-TERRORISM DRILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet will conduct its first-ever
anti-terrorism drill starting Wednesday after more than three months
of preparations, Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The three-day drill has been planned in line with United Nations
resolutions passed in 2001 and 2004 that require all countries to
fight against terrorism, Cho said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the drill has been organized by the Cabinet's
anti-terrorism action control office, Cho said it has nothing to do
with any military exercises or anti-decapitation strike drill, a
reference to a strategy in which Taipei would be attacked by enemy
forces in order to cut the leadership off from the rest of the
country.</P>
      <P>"The exercise is mainly designed to test various administrative
agencies' abilities to cope with violent terrorist attack, biological
attack, chemical attack, radioactive attack and sabotage to
information and communication systems, " Cho explained, adding that
the ultimate goal of the drill is to establish standard operating
procedures and beef up the government's crisis management capacity.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan is not a U.N. member, Cho said, it must still
respond to the U.N.'s call to counter terrorism.</P>
      <P>Cho said Premier Frank Hsieh will lead the Cabinet in conducting
the anti-terrorism drill at the Tachi joint training center in
suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>As the drill has nothing to do with military exercises, Cho said
President Chen Shui-bian and national security officials will not
take part.</P>
      <P>Cho said the Cabinet will brief the press on the procedures and
results of the drill once it is completed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2005 TUNG BLOSSOM FESTIVAL TO KICK OFF SATURDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2005 Tung Blossom Festival will kick
off Saturday with a fun-filled ceremony at the West Lake Resort in
the northern Taiwan county of Miaoli, a Hakka stronghold, the Council
of Hakka Affairs (CHA) announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>This is the fourth consecutive year that the Cabinet-level
council has organized a tung blossom festival to boost tourism and
cultural development in Taiwan's major Hakka communities,
particularly those in northern parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Acting CHA Chairman Lee Yung-teh joined with representatives of
major Hakka communities from around Taiwan in staging a special
ritual in Taipei Tuesday to promote the program.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Lee said tourist groups from New
Zealand, Australia and various European countries will travel to
Taiwan to appreciate the tung flower season and take part in various
cultural activities to be staged during the month-long festival.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, May Day, a local pop group, has been
invited to help promote the festival. The group will sing Hakka songs
at the festival's opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>In 2004, Lee said, the Tung Blossom Festival attracted 2.7
million visitors and generated NT$500 million in business revenues.
This time around, he said, the festival promises to be bigger and
better than ever, with more than 600 cultural events to be held in 32
Hakka communities in Hsinchu, Taoyuan, Miaoli, Taichung, Nantou and
Taipei counties. This year's festival will last through May 15.</P>
      <P>Referring to the choice of tung flowers as the focus of the
festival, former CHA Chairwoman Yeh chu-lan said that as tung trees
are common in northern Taiwan Hakka communities, the council has
"adopted" the tung blossom as a symbol of Hakka culture.</P>
      <P>The trees, (aluerites fordii hemi, common name paulownia), used
to be an important source of income for the Hakka, Yeh said, adding
that through the festival, the CHA hopes that the trees will once
again bring prosperity to Hakka communities.</P>
      <P>With a view to cashing in on the thriving demand for wooden
furniture materials for export to Japan, farmers in the Taoyuan,
Hsinchu and Miaoli areas started planting wutung trees (firmiana
simplex, common name Chinese parasol) in the 1960s. But the
difficulty of growing these trees later forced many farmers to switch
to planting tung trees, which are much easier to take care of. Both
trees originate in the Yangtze River area of China.</P>
      <P>After Japanese customers discovered it was the wrong kind of wood
and stopped purchasing from local suppliers, the tung oil trees were
left unfelled.</P>
      <P>Three decades later, the trees are flourishing, with their
profuse spring blossoms making them a major tourist attraction in the
Taoyuan-Hsinchu-Miaoli area.</P>
      <P>The trees can still be used for carving, furniture and wood pulp.
The oil extracted from the seeds used to be used as a key ingredient
for varnish and it remains important for Hakka people, who produce
hand-made umbrellas made of oiled paper.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OFFICIAL OPTIMISTIC ABOUT TAIWAN'S ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 12 (CNA)
(By Wayne Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While many see China's Anti-Secession Law
as a step back for cross-strait commercial relations, an official
from the Council for Economic Planning and Development claimed
otherwise Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait trade is not a zero-sum game, " said Yeh Ming-feng,
the council's vice chairman. "Taiwan and China both have their unique
(economic) advantages and political situations will not affect either
side much," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Yeh's remarks came following a warning by the Eurochambers that
Taiwan will lose its competitiveness if it continues to impose import
restrictions on some 2,400 products from China. These items, however,
are allowed to be imported into the country if they are from other
WTO member countries.</P>
      <P>While some feel that China's Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan
will pose a potential threat for foreign investors wishing to enter
Taiwan's market, Yeh described China's rising nationalism as a great
opportunity for Taiwan to attract foreign investment.</P>
      <P>A recent protest in China against Japan's reluctance to face its
World War II history will turn the eyes of foreign investors,
particularly the Japanese, to Taiwan, he claimed.</P>
      <P>"Japanese enterprises are known to be very careful and often have
difficulty adapting to China's corporate culture. After the protest,
it is likely that they might re-examine their China investment plans
and begin to deal with the Taiwanese," Yeh speculated.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's well-developed business environment also
provides an incentive for those who are hesitating to invest in
China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been pushing to be a regional financial center in East
Asia for years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP SETS UP A 'LATIN GARDEN' NEAR PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu set up a "Latin
Garden" near the Presidential Office Tuesday and planted the national
tree of El Salvador -- a maquilishuat -- to welcome a visit by
Salvadoran Vice President Ana Vilma Albanez de Escobar.</P>
      <P>Heading a 14-member delegation, including Minister of Agriculture
and Livestock Mario Salaveria, and Vice Minister of Foreign Relations
Margarita Escobar, Albanez de Escobar, the first woman vice president
of El Salvador, arrived in Taipei Monday for a five-day visit.</P>
      <P>Lu said Albanez de Escobar's visit is to conduct detailed
discussions with Taiwan for the planned establishment of a "Taiwan
Park" in El Salvador that aims to lure Taiwan enterprises and is
designed to globalize Taiwanese companies' business operations
abroad.</P>
      <P>Albanez de Escobar's trip is also a response to Lu's March visit
to the Central American country to further strengthen bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Lu said that after further talks, she believes that the "Taiwan
Park" is not a dream but a viable plan.</P>
      <P>In addition to planting the national tree of El Salvador as a
witness to 70 years of the Republic of China-El Salvador ties, Lu
said national trees of more Central and South American countries will
be planted to signify the friendship between Taiwan and its Latin
American allies.</P>
      <P>During her visit, Albanez de Escobar will also meet President
Chen Shui-bian and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen, as well
as other high-ranking government officials.</P>
      <P>The Salvadoran delegation will visit several economic and
cultural establishments, including the National Palace Museum, the
Keelung Harbor Bureau and the Taipei World Trade Center, before
leaving Taipei April 15.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday he would
take pleasure in paying a visit to opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan if such as visit can help boost inter-party
reconciliation and passage of major bills in the legislature.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks during a Legislative Yuan interpellation
session where opposition People First Party (PFP) Legislator Chen
Chao-jung asked Hsieh whether he is will to meet with Lien to ease a
protracted standoff between the ruling and opposition camps and
whether all party leaders should report their China travel plans.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, Hsieh said, the government doesn't ban
any individual person to visit China.</P>
      <P>"But if Lien intends to sign a so-called "peace accord" with
Chinese authorities during his planned China visit as reported by the
news media, then he must report such a plan to relevant government
agencies prior to his departure for the mainland," Hsieh stressed.</P>
      <P>As the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP controls a
slim majority in the legislature, Hsieh said he would be willing to

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI TO PARTICIPATE IN APCS MEETING IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday
that the city will send a representative to attend the 2005 Asia
Pacific Cities Summit (APCS) to be held in China in October.</P>
      <P>However, Ma added that he was still not sure whether he can
attend personally, as "Taiwan has been very busy recently."</P>
      <P>Taipei city government officials have confirmed that Ma received
an invitation from Chongqing City, Sichuan Province -- the host of
this year's APCS scheduled for Oct. 11-14. According to Ma, more than
ten Taiwan cities are members of APCS.</P>
      <P>Noting that the APCS meeting is an international activity, Ma
said he is permitted to attend the meeting in accordance with the
Statute Governing the Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area
and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also taken the initiative in
urging the invited mayors to participate, Ma said.</P>
      <P>He added that he has participated in two earlier APCS meetings,
one in Seattle and the other in Brisbane.</P>
      <P>Recalling that he tried hard to win this year's sponsorship of
the APCS meeting when he attended the Brisbane summit four years ago,
Ma expressed regret that the then-organizer of the meeting gave the
2005 sponsorship to Chongqing City without public discussion.</P>
      <P>Ma said the Taipei city government will continue its efforts to
win the sponsorship of a future APCS meeting.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Acting Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party also confirmed that same day that the
Kaohsiung city government has also received an invitation to the
summit, but said he had not yet decided whether to attend.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPENING DIRECT CROSS-STRAIT NAVIGATION LINKS ROC POLICY: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 12 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh reiterated Tuesday
that opening direct cross-Taiwan Strait navigation links is a policy
of the government but that its implementation needs consultation
between the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions raised by lawmakers at an interpellation
session of the Legislative Yuan, Hsieh said that a statute governing
the establishment of free trade harbor zones approved by the
legislature has provided a primary framework for cross-strait
shipping.</P>
      <P>Also, the premier said, Kaohsiung Harbor in southern Taiwan,
which has been authorized to handle transshipments between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait through its offshore transshipment center,
should be allowed to expand its services for the cross-strait
transport links.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that it is up to the Beijing authorities in
this regard because the opening of the direct cross-strait navigation
links should be discussed by the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TOP TAIWAN NEGOTIATOR WITH CHINA LAID TO REST IN PINGTUNG COUNTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Pingtung, southern Taiwan, April 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Koo Cheng-fu, the late
top Taiwan negotiator with mainland China who died in early January,
was laid to rest in a cemetery on a scenic farm in southern Taiwan
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Koo -- who held a historic ice-breaking meeting with Beijing's
chief negotiator with Taiwan, Wang Daohan, in Singapore in April 1993
and concluded four agreements with him, marking an end to nearly half
a century of no contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait --
died of renal failure in a Taipei hospital Jan. 3 at the age of 88.</P>
      <P>Koo's coffin was moved Tuesday from Taipei to the Fukuangshan
Monastery in Kaohsiung County, southern Taiwan, where Buddhist master
Hsing Yun presided over a Zen funeral to commemorate the late Koo.</P>
      <P>In his memorial prayer, Rev. Hsing Yun lauded Koo as having lit
up the world and done everything in his power to benefit the people.</P>
      <P>Koo, a business tycoon who also had a talent for writing poetry
and singing Peking opera, was appointed in March 1991 by the Republic
of China government to be the chairman of the quasi-official
intermediary body, the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>Although Koo's family had tried to keep the burial ceremony
low-profile, a long funeral procession of about 100 vehicles,
including several tourist buses, produced a rare scene in the serene
Kaoshu rural township in Pingtung County Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to Koo's family, a memorial museum similar to the Koo
Museum located in Lukang, Changhua County will be built next to the
cemetery where Koo is buried.</P>
      <P>The farm on which the cemetery is located was reportedly part of
a 3,000-hectare tract that Koo's father, Koo Hsien-jung, bought when
Taiwan was still under Japanese colonial rule some 60 years ago. At
that time, Koo Hsien-jung was a successful businessman and a
"coordinator" between the Japanese and the Chinese from both Taiwan
and mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to Koo's family, Koo was still worrying about the
tension between Taiwan and mainland China even in his final days
after a long battle with kidney illness.</P>
      <P>Although the diplomatic tug-of-war between the two sides of the
strait continued unabated after the historic 1993 Koo-Wang talks in
Singapore, Koo visited the mainland in October 1998 and met with then
Chinese President Jiang Zemin as well as Wang, helping improve ties
between Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>In addition to being a successful businessman, Koo also served as
head of the Chinese National Federation of Industries and of the
Chinese National Association of Industry &amp; Commerce, contributing
greatly to Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>A senior adviser to both former President Lee Teng-hui and
incumbent President Chen Shui-bian, Koo was also Taiwan's top envoy,
taking part in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum's informal
leadership summits on behalf of the president from 1995 to 1997.</P>
      <P>Koo's passing was termed by some local political observers as
tantamount to the symbolic death of cross-strait relations, given
that the two sides had been at a complete political impasse since
July 1999 after then ROC President Lee Teng-hui described the
cross-strait relationship as "state-to-state" in nature.</P>
      <P>Condolences for Koo's passing came not only from around Taiwan
and mainland China, but also from the United States and Japan, where 
Koo had had prominent business and political connections.</P>

stands pat on 10% VAT

The Senate, after a closed-door caucus Monday
night attended by 17 members of the pro-administration
majority bloc and the political opposition, agreed
yesterday to stick to its position favoring a status
quo in the current 10 percent value-added tax (VAT)
sought by its ways and means committee chaired by
administration Sen. Ralph G. Recto but would put to a
vote on the Senate floor today the issue of whether or
not to lift the VAT-free status of the power sector,
Senate President Franklin M. Drilon said yesterday.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu said Wednesday that the MAC will allow more
independent-thinking mainland Chinese and Hong Kong media
organizations to post journalists in Taiwan so that the Chinese
people can get a more accurate picture of current events in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding to remarks earlier in the day by Lee Weiyi, a
spokesman of the Taiwan Affairs Office of Beijing's State Council,
that Taiwan has no justifiable reason for withdrawing permission for
two mainland Chinese state-run media organizations to post
journalists in Taiwan. Lee said the decision will affect cross-strait
journalistic exchanges and undermine the rights of Chinese news
media and journalists.</P>
      <P>The MAC on Sunday temporarily banned the Xinhua news agency and
the People's Daily newspaper from posting journalists in Taiwan,
claiming that their coverage of Taiwan has not been conducive to
enhancing understanding between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Wu said that cross-strait journalistic exchanges are extremely
unbalanced, noting that the Taiwan people can have access to mainland
China news and information, while mainland Chinese people don't have
access to accurate information about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the Xinhua news agency and the People's Daily have
focused on the most extreme or radical opinions in covering Taiwan's
political scene, which he said has distorted the picture of Taiwan's
actual situation.</P>
      <P>He said that there are still three mainland Chinese media
organizations -- China Central Television, China News Agency and
China National Radio -- that have journalists posted in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said the MAC will allow more other news organizations from
China and Hong Kong to post journalistic staff in Taiwan in order to
provide a more accurate picture of Taiwan to the Chinese people.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged local
business groups Wednesday to invest more in El Salvador which she
said has the potential to become a Latin American regional operations
hub.</P>
      <P>Lu made the appeal while accompanying visiting Salvadoran Vice
President Ana Vilma Albanez de Escobar on a tour of UPS Corp.'s
Pacific transshipment center at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International
Airport -- Taiwan's main gateway.</P>
      <P>Both Lu and Albanez de Escobar said they were impressed by the
UPS transshipment center's convenient and efficient air freight
delivery operations. They also expressed the common hope that the air
cargo volume between Taiwan and El Salvador will increase in the
future.</P>
      <P>Lu further said she came to a deep understanding during her visit
to El Salvador last month that the Central American country stands a
good chance of becoming a regional business hub in Central and South
America because of its strategic geographic position and economic
development potential. Hopefully, Lu added, more local companies can
launch investment projects in El Salvador.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Lu accompanied Albanez de Escobar on visits to
an air cargo transshipment park and an industrial park in Taoyuan
County, where Lu once served as magistrate.</P>
      <P>Heading a 14-member delegation, Albanez de Escobar, the first
female vice president of El Salvador, arrived in Taipei Monday for a
five-day visit.</P>
      <P>To welcome Albanez de Escobar's visit, Lu planted a maquilishuat
-- El Salvador's national tree -- in a "Latin Garden" near the
Presidential Office Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lu said on the occasion that Albanez de Escobar's visit is aimed
at discussing an ambitious cooperative plan to build a "Taiwan Park"
in El Salvador to lure investment by Taiwan enterprises and ethnic
Salvadoran businesspeople residing in the United States.</P>
      <P>With concerted efforts from both sides, Lu said she believes that
the "Taiwan Park" project is not be a pipe dream, but rather a viable
plan.</P>
      <P>In addition to planting the maquilishuat to mark the 70 years of
ROC-Salvadoran ties, Lu said the national trees of more Central and
South American countries will also be planted in the new "Latin
Garden" to signify the friendship between Taiwan and its Latin
American allies.</P>
      <P>During her visit, Albanez de Escobar will also meet President
Chen Shui-bian and Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen, as well
as other high-ranking officials.</P>
      <P>In addition, the delegation will visit several economic and
cultural establishments, including the National Palace Museum, the
Keelung Harbor Bureau and the Taipei World Trade Center, before
leaving Taipei April 15.</P>

      <P>The average rate for a hotel room in
Taiwan last year stood at NT$2,913 (US$92.77) per night, marking an
increase of 5.4 percent over the year-earlier level, the Directorate
General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>After compiling its own tallies with statistics from the Central
Bank of China and the Tourism Bureau, the DGBAS reported that
Republic of China citizens made 7.781 million trips abroad in 2004,
while Taiwan received 2.95 million person-visits from foreign
countries.</P>
      <P>These two figures marked an increase of 31.4 percent and 31.2
percent, respectively, over those posted in 2003, when the numbers of
both outbound and inbound tourists were relatively low due to an
outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), DGBAS officials
said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of 2004, there were a total of 20,407 rooms in
hotels ranging from international five-star hotels to low-end hotels
in Taiwan, with the average rate standing at NT$2,913 per night.
Occupancy rates hit 65.6 percent for 2004, up 9.2 percentage points
over the previous year, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>With the numbers of both outbound and inbound tourists rising
remarkably, Taiwan citizens' overall travel expenditures totaled
NT$8.17 billion (US$260.19 million) in 2004, compared with revenue of
NT$4.04 billion (US$128.66 million) generated from visits to Taiwan
by foreign nationals.</P>
      <P>These figures represented an increase of 26.1 percent and 35.7

      <P>The relations between Taiwan and China in

cross-Taiwan Strait trade relations can be rationalized, Taiwan's
permanent representative to the WTO Yen Ching-chang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yen made the remarks in response to a position paper released by
the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) on Taiwan's progress
in observing WTO obligations.</P>
      <P>In the paper, the ECCT again criticized Taiwan for failing to
relax its import restrictions on Chinese products and warned that the
situation will bring down the island's competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The ECCT pointed out that Taiwan has banned the import of more
than 2,400 Chinese products on the grounds that they might jeopardize
national security and the domestic industrial sector, which the group
says is in violation of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of
1994.</P>
      <P>Yen said the problem is mutual and that it is unfair to demand
Taiwan to take measures unilaterally.</P>
      <P>While there is room for Taiwan to improve its import restrictions
on Chinese products, China has also maintained some unreasonable
trade measures toward Taiwan, Yen noted.</P>
      <P>However, it seems impossible for Taiwan and China to sit down for

    <HEADLINE>POPULAR PFP LAWMAKER RETURN TO KMT FOLD TO BOOST CHANCE IN ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A popular People First Party (PFP)
legislator who had defected from the Kuomintang (KMT) in 2000 said
Wednesday that he has returned to the fold of the KMT.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chou Hsi-wei said he will take part in the KMT
primary and represent the opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT,
the PFP and the New Party to run for Taipei County magistrate in the
year-end election.</P>
      <P>Chou, said that the "pan-blue alliance" will have to integrate if
it wants to win the Taipei County magistrate election, one of the
most hotly contested constituencies.</P>
      <P>Chou stressed that a divided "pan-blue alliance" is doomed to
fail, and this is his reason to rejoin the KMT.</P>
      <P>The PFP splintered off from the KMT with James Soong as its
leader.</P>
      <P>He said that being the likely candidate for the magistrate race
if he were to stay in the PFP, this would only result in problems for
the "pan-blue alliance"; therefore, it is best for the alliance if he
returns to run under the banner of the KMT.</P>
      <P>Chou said that PFP Chairman Soong was aware of his decision and
told him he understood. Chou added that he respects and accepts
the PFP's decision to suspend his membership.</P>
      <P>Chou said that from now on he will join the KMT caucus in the
legislature and that even if he loses the KMT primary, he will remain
in the KMT.</P>
      <P>The parties of the "pan-blue alliance" are one family, Chou said,
and any candidate-hopefuls in the alliance should accept the rules,
and as such, he will abide by the result of the primary which will
determine whether he stands for the party in the election.</P>
      <P>Noting that the PFP has yet to create a nomination mechanism, and
that if the two parties have no common way to achieve this, he does
not want to be the "next Wang Chien-hsien" because of the late
integration of the two parties.</P>
      <P>The KMT endorsed the New Party's Wang at the eleventh hour for
the Taipei County election in late 1996, and Wang lost by a small
margin to Su Tseng-chang of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The KMT confirmed Wednesday that Chou has rejoined the party and
was welcome.</P>
      <P>Liao Feng-teh, director of the KMT Organization and Development
Committee, said the KMT embraces Chou with open arms, although Chou
still has to take part in the KMT primary before he can represent the
party to run for Taipei County magistrate.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng also welcomed Chou, who
added that he was not aware of any other persons from the PFP
interested in joining the KMT for the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Hung Hsiu-chu, a popular KMT legislator who has thrown her hat in
the ring for Taipei County magistrate, said she welcomed Chou to
return to the fold of the KMT, noting that the KMT and its splinter
party are like brothers and they need solidarity.</P>
      <P>But Hung questioned the timing of Chou's return at a sensitive
time ahead of the primary, which she said might give rise to doubts
if he really wants to embrace the KMT or if he has more personal
interests in mind.</P>
      <P>Hung said that the primary should be held in an open and
transparent manner so that everyone can give full support to the
primary result without having any doubts.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Yung-ping, caucus whip of the PFP in the
Legislative Yuan, said Wednesday the attitude of the PFP and the KMT
jointly recommending a candidate to run in local elections remains
unchanged.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Chang Hsien-yao said that whether there will be
KMT-PFP cooperation in the Taipei County magistrate election will
have to wait for a meeting between KMT Chairman Lien Chan and PFP
Chairman Soong.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the PFP is willing to support Chou under any
circumstances as long as it helps the "integration of the 'pan-blue
alliance.'"</P>
      <P>He stressed that Chou's case will not trigger a massive defection
of PFP legislators to the KMT, adding that factional integration and
the situation of each candidate varies from city to city and county
to county, and any PFP member who wants to vie for inclusion in the
year-end elections with dual party membership will have to get
approval from the central committees of the two parties.</P>
      <P>With Chou's announcement to rejoin the KMT, another PFP
legislator said that he will now solicit the PFP's endorsement to
enter the Taipei County magistrate race.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Hung-chun, who comes from a political family and
holds a Ph.D. in engineering, said that the grassroots of the KMT and
the PFP had previously asked him and his elder brother, Lee
Hung-yuan, former Director of the Water Resources Department of
Taiwan Provincial Government, to be a part of the elections.</P>
      <P>With Chou's active participation, Lee said he had originally
wanted to help Chou win, but now that the situation has changed, he
wants to join the race to contribute his professionalism in
construction works to Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Another PFP legislator, Liu Wen-hsiung, who has announced his bid
to run for Keelung mayor, said that he felt sad that the KMT is still
trying to lure back former party members, adding that the PFP "should
act in concert and not have individuals defecting."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WILLING TO RETURN TO TALK WITH CHINA BASED ON 1992 FRAMEWORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is willing to return to the
negotiating table and talk with Chinese negotiators using the "1992
meeting" as a basis as described by President Chen Shui-bian in his
2004 second-term inaugural address, a legislative whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lai Ching-teh said that the DPP does not oppose any private
cross-strait exchanges, such as those dealing with journalism or
agriculture.</P>
      <P>However, Lai noted, dealings that involve the exercise of public
authority, such as customs tariffs and quarantine, necessitate the
ruling parties from both sides to send their officials to "sit and
talk" before the results of any such exchanges can be implemented.</P>
      <P>Lai called for the Beijing leadership to show genuine goodwill
toward Taiwan instead of playing a two-handed game in its "united
front" scheme.</P>
      <P>Lai was speaking in response to remarks made earlier Wednesday by
Li Weiyi, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's
State Council, who said that China will actively push for closer
media exchanges across the Strait, expand imports of Taiwan's farm
products and will welcome delegates from Taiwan's agriculture sector
who wish to go to China for talks on sales.</P>
      <P>Li also said that China welcomes representatives of Taiwan
political parties and private organizations to come to China for
talks who recognize the "1992 consensus" -- a consensus reached by
Taiwan and Chinese negotiators in a meeting held in Hong Kong in
1992, at which both sides agreed orally that there is only one China
and both sides can have their own interpretation of that "one China"
-- and those who are firmly opposed to Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Li's remarks, Lai said that there was no "1992
consensus" since it was a mythical term invented by officials from
the former Kuomintang (KMT) administration in charge of China policy
and that the KMT had never reached any consensus with Chinese
officials in 1992.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Sharon Asks U.S. to
Pressure Iran to Give Up Its Nuclear Program.

Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel urged President Bush to
step up pressure on Iran to give up all elements of its nuclear
program, according to senior American and Israeli officials. Sharon
said Israeli intelligence showed Iran, though he gave no indication
that Israel was preparing to act alone to attack Iranian nuclear
facilities, a prospect that Vice President Dick Cheney raised
publicly three months ago. American officials said the evidence
Sharon presented, including aerial photographs of sites in Iran, was
neither startling nor new to Bush. But they said the prime minister
was clearly pressuring Bush not to allow the European negotiations
with Iran to drag on.

Wall Street Journal: New Relations, China's Growth Places Strains
On a Family's Ties.

For thousands of years, Chinese have made the family paramount,
with generations often living together, and younger members deferring
to their elders. Fathers were the head of the household. But
opportunities born of China's move to a market-based economy over the
past two dozen years are creating new wealth, new hierarchies and new
strains. The scramble to keep up with neighbors, or one's own
relatives, is testing family ties, contributing to a rise in social
problems. Some 1.6 million couples divorced in China last year, a 21
percent jump over the year before, according to China's Ministry of
Civil Affairs.</TEXT>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu suggested Wednesday that legislators from across Taiwan's
political spectrum refer to the 10-point agreement that President
Chen Shui-bian reached with opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong in February as a reference when trying to enact
a "cross-strait peace promotion law."</P>
      <P>It is believed that if the lawmakers use the statement of
agreed-upon points released by Chen and Soong on Feb. 24 -- in which
the two said that the Republic of China is a sovereign state and that
President Chen will not seek to change the status quo between Taiwan
and China during his term -- as the spirit and guiding principles of
a draft "cross-strait peace promotion law, " the legislators will
gain the greatest possible support from all the people of the
country, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Wu said that so far, the PFP version of a cross-strait peace
promotion draft law and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) version of
an "anti-annexation law" is not suitable enough to win the support of
the government since both versions have their shortcomings.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, the PFP included President Chen's "five
noes" commitment, including not to change the status quo between
Taiwan and China, and the "1992 consensus" as part of the draft
"cross-strait peace promotion law, " points that could spark
ceaseless arguments in Taiwan's political circles.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the "1992 consensus" is basically a myth as none of
the current governments across the Taiwan Strait has referred it as
any kind of "consensus" in terms of development of cross-strait
relations.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh demanded that local
government chiefs on Wednesday enforce government authority
effectively to improve public order, saying the shortage of police
officers should not be an excuse for the worsening situation.</P>
      <P>Hsieh issued the directive at a weekly Cabinet meeting in the
wake of two high-profile criminal cases.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said it was a major challenge to governmental authority
that two policemen were assaulted in broad daylight in Hsichih,
Taipei County over the weekend, adding that the case must be resolved
as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Speaking of a similar case occurring in Keelung on Tuesday, Hsieh
said authorities concerned should review if there is any loophole in
the current bail system because the criminal in this case had been
arrested on five occasions in three months before this but was never
kept in detention.</P>
      <P>Also, Hsieh said police must track down notorious gunman Chang
Hsi-ming to restore public confidence in Taiwan's law and order.</P>
      <P>The premier noted that he has ordered the Ministry of the
Interior to establish a set of criteria to evaluate the performance
of each locality in fighting crime every three months to push local
government chiefs and police authorities to shoulder their share of
the responsibility.</P>
      <P>Although the National Police Agency plans to recruit 1,315 people
to join the police force this year, the number will not be enough to
meet the demand in light of the fact that a similar number of
policemen quit every year, he said.</P>
      <P>However, he added, the shortage of police is no excuse for
worsening public order because it will made a great difference if
local government chiefs and police authorities consider improving
public order their top priority.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING'S COMMENTS ON 'SEVEN-POINT CONCLUSION' UNACCEPTABLE: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's comments on Taiwan's "seven-point
conclusion" on engagements across the Taiwan Strait in the wake of
Beijing's enactment of its anti-secession law are "unacceptable, " a
senior Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung made the remarks after Li Weiyi,
a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said in Beijing
earlier in the day that Taiwan's latest "seven-point conclusion" on
cross-strait exchanges marked a retreat in Taiwan's commitment to
boosting bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>The "seven-point conclusion" referred to the outcome announced at
the end of a high-level meeting chaired by President Chen Shui-bian
April 5 following a high-profile visit to China by opposition
Kuomintang Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang, who signed a so-called
"10-point consensus" with Chinese authorities during his stay in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>The "seven-point conclusion" accentuated the Democratic
Progressive Party administration's determination to "effectively
manage" cross-strait exchanges, including stressing that all
cross-strait interchanges should abide by the law and that anyone who
reaches an agreement with foreign governments, the other side of the
Taiwan Strait or the envoys they dispatch will be dealt with
according to the law by related agencies.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news briefing in Beijing Wednesday, Li claimed that
the "seven-point conclusion" tightens restrictions on cross-strait
trade and cultural exchanges. "Turning the clock back violates the
interests of Taiwan compatriots," he added.</P>
      <P>In response, MAC Vice Chairman You said Li's comments were
"unacceptable," but he didn't elaborate.</P>
      <P>During the Beijing news conference, Li also said private industry
associations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are welcome to
exchange views on the much-expected opening of direct cross-strait
charter cargo flights.</P>
      <P>Responding to a media inquiry about his opinions on Li's
overture, MAC Chairman Joseph Wu said he sees no sincerity in Li's
call for talks by private industry associations.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan is willing to negotiate issues regarding the
opening of direct cross-strait charter cargo flights, but he added
that at the moment, the government's top priority is to evaluate the
impact of China's recent enactment of its anti-secession law
codifying the use of "non-peaceful means" against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We must wait and see whether Taiwan's dignity and interests
would be affected by that legislation before we re-start any contacts
with China," Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, China has forced a noted Taiwan business tycoon
to issue a public statement endorsing its cherished "one China"
policy and its anti-secession law.</P>
      <P>"We must wait to see whether China will take any other steps to
restrict the speech of freedom of Taiwan business people with
interests in China or to force them to sign any documents, " Wu said,
adding that he is not sure at the moment how long the "observation
and evaluation" period will last.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Political party leaders should get prior
authorization from the government before they talk with China on
political issues, the nation's top China policy planner said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Joseph Wu, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), made
the remarks during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-an, a legislator of the opposition People First Party,
asked Wu if the MAC would find it acceptable if opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan visits China without government
authorization and reaches an agreement with China that it withdraws
its missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This would create internal problems, " he said, adding that KMT
Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang's visit to China was a highly political
exchange that should have required national consensus.
</P>
      <P>Chiang reached a 10-point consensus with Beijing during his
high-profile March 28-April 1 visit, covering a wide range of issues,
including cross-Taiwan Strait transportation, agriculture, tourism,
protection of Taiwan businessmen operating in mainland China and
further easing of China's financial market.</P>
      <P>If party leaders engage in highly political issues without a
national consensus and prior authorization from the government, this
would be "unthinkable" in any other democratic country, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has its own Constitution and laws that should
be honored, adding that anything that involves government authority
should follow the Constitution and abide by the rule of the law.</P>
      <P>If China wants to extend an olive branch by withdrawing the
missiles targeting Taiwan, it does not need to wait for a visit by
Lien, he pointed out. Also, Beijing should destroy the missiles
instead of just conducting the pointless exercise of withdrawing the
highly mobile and easily deployed weapons, he added.</P>
      <P>As Lien has claimed his China visit needs no endorsement from the
government, Legislator Lai Shyh-bao suggested that Wu call on Lien
privately.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said that consultations between the ruling and
opposition parties should be conducted by leaders of the respective
camps rather than by the MAC.</P>

      <P>Even though the mission-oriented National
Assembly election is coming up in just one month, more than half of
the people of Taiwan do not know the exact date it will be held,
according to the results of a poll released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The survey showed that many people are lukewarm about the May 14
election, which will choose members for the National Assembly. About
51 percent said they do not know when the election will be held,
while 81.6 percent said they do not know each political party's
stance in amending the Republic of China Constitution.</P>
      <P>From the poll's results, analysts doubted that the result of the
election will accurately reflect the opinions of those who choose to
vote. Only 65 percent answered yes as to whether they will vote.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by a private think tank, Taiwan
Advocates, April 8-10 and received 1,081 valid replies from eligible
voters.</P>
      <P>The National Assembly is to decide whether to endorse a
constitutional amendment package, which was passed by the Legislative
Yuan last year.</P>
      <P>The package consists of four amendment items: abolishment of the
National Assembly; a close to 50 percent reduction in the number of
seats in the Legislative Yuan; changing the existing legislative
election to a "single-seat, two votes" system, and detailing the
nature of holding referendums as laid out in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Regarding cutting the size of the legislature, 45.8 percent
support the amendment, with 30.1 percent saying it should be cut by
just 25 percent. Just over 14 percent think the number of seats
should remain the same.</P>
      <P>As to the change in the voting system, 33.5 percent think it will
only benefit major political parties.</P>
      <P>About 82 percent think the elected National Assembly members
should endorse each amendment item individually, rather than in a
package.</P>
      <P>Approximately 68 percent said they hope additional polls of
citizens will be conducted to decide whether the public supports
National Assembly members' decisions on endorsing the package.</P>
      <P>The poll had a margin of error of 2.98 percent with a confidence
level of 95 percent.</P>

      <P>China is not qualified to criticize
Taiwan's decision to temporarily ban two Chinese media outlets from
posting journalists in Taiwan due to their constantly biased reports
about local news events, Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cho made the remarks after a spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs
Office claimed at a news briefing in Beijing earlier in the day that
Taiwan's ban on the Xinhua news agency and People's Daily newspaper
marked a gross interference with freedom of the press.</P>
      <P>"As China itself doesn't respect the freedom of the press, it is
not qualified to use the term 'gross interference' to criticize
Taiwan's handling of the case. We have consistently protected freedom
of the press, and the temporary ban on correspondents from the two
state-run Chinese media outlets has nothing to do with freedom of the
press, " Cho said.</P>
      <P>Cho further pointed out that Taiwan has not imposed an
across-the-board ban on all Chinese media outlets.</P>
      <P>"We have only suspended the permission for the two named media
outlets to post journalists in Taiwan for the time being because they
have continuously published unfriendly, biased, distorted or
outrageous reports about Taiwan, " Cho said, adding that he hopes the
measure will inspire Chinese media organizations to improve the
quality of their news reporting and their journalists.</P>
      <P>Cho reiterated that the ban doesn't have anything to do with
freedom of press and would by no means affect Taiwan's respects for
journalists.</P>
      <P>"In the meantime, we hope Chinese journalists can learn to
respect the government and people of Taiwan," Cho added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first allowed Chinese media to post reporters in Taiwan in
late 2000. Besides Xinhua and People's Daily, three other Chinese
media outlets -- China Central Television (CCTV) , China News Agency

      <P>The state-funded Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) is eyeing potential business
opportunities in Bangladesh and is preparing to encourage local
businesses to invest there, a TAITRA official stationed in Kaohsiung
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>With a population of more than 140 million, Bangladesh enjoys an
abundant labor force, while its consumption market is seen as having
potential for expansion, the official said, noting that investment
opportunities exist in most of the South Asian country's business
fields such as textiles, mobile phones, leather products, bikes,
shoes, foodstuffs, plastics, machinery and electricity.</P>
      <P>Bangladesh is also the world's eighth-largest exporter of
ready-made garments, while every year it imports a large quantity of
textiles to supply the ready-to-wear production lines in the
Karnaphuli export processing zone in Chittagong, the nation's largest

      <P>Taiwanese textile businesses could forge cooperative alliances
with Bangladesh manufacturers to expand their overseas operations,

      <P>To assist local businesses to explore the South Asian market,
TAITRA has invited several organizations, including the Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>HK PRO-DEMOCRACY ACTIVISTS DEMAND DIRECT VOTE ON CHIEF EXECUTIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Mandy Wong and Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong
issued a declaration Wednesday demanding a direct vote to elect the
special administrative region's chief executive and Legislative
Council.</P>
      <P>The declaration was issued by a group of more than 50
organizations dedicated to the promotion of Hong Kong's democracy, at
a time when the National People's Congress (NPC) of China is to make
a legal interpretation on the term of Hong Kong's next chief
executive.</P>
      <P>Former Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa resigned in March due to his
low popularity.</P>
      <P>The declaration notes that although the Tung's resignation truly
reflects the opinions of the Hong Kong people, they are more
concerned about whether there will be a direct vote to elect their
future leaders instead of intervention by their Chinese rulers in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>"A popular vote to elect Hong Kong's chief executive and
Legislative Council is an important way to resolve the special
administrative region's political problems," the declaration says.</P>
      <P>In addition, the declaration also demands more cooperation
between the executive and legislative branches and the establishment
of partisan politics in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The pro-democracy activists expressed hope that the elections for
choosing a chief executive and a Legislative Council in 2007 and
2008, respectively, can move in this direction.</P>
      <P>They also suggested that the by-election to choose a new chief
executive to replace Tung should be transparent and fair and that
there should be more candidates allowed to compete in this post.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. ARMY MOVE A RESPONSE TO CROSS-STRAIT TENSIONS: LEGISLATORS</HEADLINE>

(By Wayne Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A move by the United States Army to
transfer a branch of its command headquarters from the United States
to Japan is to deal with any contingency across the Taiwan Strait and
on the Korea peninsula, two legislators said Wednesday. </P>
      <P>According to reports, the United States has confirmed that it
will transfer a branch of its command headquarters from a Washington
base to its Zama military camp in Japan's Kanagawa Prefecture just 40
km southwest of Tokyo. </P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lee Wen-chung
described the move as necessary to uphold both U.S. and Japanese
interests in the region.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan should take immediate action to counter any
threats from China and he urged the public to support the
government's weapons procurement plan.</P>
      <P>Opposition People First Party Legislator Ku Chung-lian agreed
with Lee's remarks, but claimed that the reason for the U.S. move is
because North Korea poses a more imminent threat than China.</P>
      <P>Ku claimed that cross-strait tension has "abated" and that Taiwan
should not act "excessively" to avoid upsetting China. He also said
he opposes the weapons procurement plan because "the weapons for sale
by the United States are too outdated to boost the nation's defense
forces and will cost too much for the country's future taxpayers."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The upcoming "Han Kuang 21" series of
military exercises will test the armed forces' combat prowess against
unlimited warfare tactics and decapitation strikes, according to a
Ministry of National Defense (MND) report released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The MND report, which was prepared for the reference of the
Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee, said the annual series of
exercises comprise two parts -- simulated war games and live-fire
drills.</P>
      <P>The computerized war simulations will be conducted at the
combined services operation command center, the combined services
training center and various tactical command centers. The simulated
war games will take place between late April and May. </P>
      <P>The weeklong war simulations will hone various combat strategies
and tactics, including anti-blockade strategies, airborne defense
control, naval forces' air defense and maritime control tactics, as
well as cyber-defense operations. The war games will be conducted
eight hours a day during the week-long maneuvering period.</P>
      <P>The live-fire drills are scheduled for June through August to
verify combat strategies and tactics hammered out during the
computerized war games. These maneuvers will include strategies to
cope with surprise attacks on a major local oil depot and undersea
cables.</P>
      <P>The live-fire exercises will also practice counter strategies
against unlimited warfare methods such as shockwave bombing,
infiltration, abduction, hijacking, computer virus attacks and
decapitation strikes.</P>
      <P>Decapitation strategies short-circuit command and control
systems, wipe out nationwide nerve centers and leave the opponent
hopelessly immobilized. Many military observers say China is very
likely to use this strategy in an invasion of Taiwan by seizing the
nation's center of power -- the capital -- along with its top
leaders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'319' INVESTIGATORS RETURN FROM U.S. TRIP TO CONSULT FORENSIC EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 13 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three members of a special law enforcement
team investigating the shooting of President Chen Shui-bian and Vice
President Annette Lu on the eve of the 2004 presidential election
have concluded a visit to the United States to consult a
world-renowned forensic expert about the case, a spokeswoman said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chen-ni, a chief prosecutor at the Tainan Prosecutors' Office
in southern Taiwan who concurrently serves as spokeswoman for the
investigative team, said that Dr. Henry Lee, a Chinese-American
forensic scientist who has assisted in forensic investigations of the
shooting, has offered counseling for further probes into the case,
particularly the cause of the death of the alleged shooter.</P>
      <P>Kuo and two other team members -- Cheng Hsiao-kuei, the Criminal
Investigation Bureau's forensic department chief, and Wang Sen-jung,
a prosecutor -- departed for the United States April 6 and returned
home Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Kuo, the team informed the U.S.
authorities about their travel plan prior to their departure. Kuo
said their main purposes was to seek Lee's counsel about
certain problems regarding the investigations.</P>
      <P>Lee was quoted as having told the trio that all the data
collected by the team so far is not sufficient to conclude that Chen
Yi-hsiung, a former chairman of the Tainan City Wrestling
Association, committed suicide 10 days after he allegedly shot and
slightly wounded Chen and Lu March 19 last year.</P>
      <P>"Dr. Lee asked us to further investigate the cause of Chen's
death. In terms of data and information available at the moment, it
remains unclear whether Chen killed himself or was murdered or fell
into the sea accidentally," Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Based on evidence collected by the team, Kuo said Lee thought
that the shootings were most likely carried out by the same gun.</P>
      <P>As investigations are still ongoing, Kuo would not reveal further
details about Lee's counseling.</P>
      <P>After nearly a year of grueling investigations of numerous clues,
the investigative team announced a breakthrough early last month by
identifying Chen Yi-hsiung as the shooter in the apparent
assassination attempt.</P>
      <P>President Chen and Lu were slightly wounded when two homemade
bullets grazed them as they campaigned in an open-topped jeep in
Tainan. After the Chen-Lu ticket narrowly won re-election the
following day, the sole challenging ticket of opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong
accused the president of having staged the shooting to win sympathy
votes and filed two lawsuits to challenge the election result. The
shooting is believed to have gravely aggravated hostility between the
ruling and opposition camps.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-hsiung, 63, was found dead in Anping harbor in the
southern city of Tainan March 29 last year -- 10 days after the
shooting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA RISING BUT NO THREAT TO U.S.: EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 13 (CNA)
(By Jorge Liu &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China is rising, with increasing clout
in Asia, but it is plagued by domestic and foreign problems and will
not be a threat to the United States in the long term, a
U.S. expert on Asian affairs said here Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Robert G. Sutter from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.,
said at a seminar sponsored by the Atlantic Council of the U.S. that
China is nothing but another Soviet Union or Japan, two countries
whose strength peaked in the 1970's and 1980's, respectively, but
fizzled out simultaneously by the turn of the century.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, China for the time being is busy with its domestic
affairs rather than expanding its clout among Asian states and it has
feet of clay -- none of its neighbors trust it and all of them view
its rise with misgiving, Sutter said.</P>
      <P>Perceiving neighboring states' misgiving about its emergence,
Sutter said China is going out of its way to emphasize that it is a
peace-loving state, has no intention of dominating the region and has
carefully avoided challenging the United States position in Asia.</P>
      <P>China's influence in Asia, if any, is minimal, Sutter claimed,
adding that China has historical complexity with Russia, although its
presence in Central Asia is eclipsed by Russia and the United States.
It has a fundamental conflict of interest with India that has not
been sorted out by its efforts to reach out to New Delhi.</P>
      <P>China might be considered a big power by its neighbors in
Southeast Asia, which rely heavily on it for their economic
development. However, China's influence in the area is limited because these
states are wary of China's emergence and their cooperation with the
United States to fight terrorism has diluted China's influence,
according to Sutter.</P>
      <P>Sutter further made the claim that China "has no influence over
Taiwan" and has turned to the United States for help, as it has done
with Japan.</P>
      <P>Facing the emergence of China, Sutter said, the United States is
trying to contain China's influence while engaging with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Sutter said Washington offers to cooperate with China, but at the
same time it demonstrates to China it has the power and determination
to stop war. This, coupled with President George Bush's reputation as
a leader who will punish his enemies, have effectively deterred
Beijing from embarking upon military adventures in Asia, he said.</P>
      <P>At the same seminar, Banning Garrett from the Atlantic Council of
the United States said China's rise is more an opportunity than a
crisis for the world.</P>
      <P>For the industrialized countries, Garrett said, China is a huge
potential market they cannot ignore. For China, the industrialized
countries have the technology it needs to develop its economy, and
these mutual beneficial relationships make war between them almost
impossible, he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will continue to seek to join
international organizations through its own efforts, a government
spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai said that Taiwan's aim is to
assume its responsibility as a member of the international community

      <P>Cho made the remarks when commenting on reports that Beijing is
willing to help Taiwan participate in World Health Organization (WHO)
activities.</P>
      <P>Beijing's move shows that what it has done to block Taiwan's
participation in the WHO is unreasonable and irrational, he said.</P>

      <P>Government officials shot back at
criticism by Chinese officials about Taiwan's decision to withdraw
permission for two Chinese media to post reporters in Taiwan and to
restrict opposition parties' associations with China.</P>
      <P>You Ying-lung, a spokesman for the Mainland Affairs Council, said
Beijing can easily improve its ties with Taiwan by dealing with
government rather than wooing the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>He accused Beijing of trying to split Taiwan by repeatedly
inviting opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan to visit China.</P>
      <P>The MAC spokesman also urged political parties to realize
Beijing's attempts and avoid playing into its hands to the detriment
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Government Information Office Vice Minister Yi
Rung-tsung said Taiwan withdrew its permission for the state-run
Xinhua news agency and People's Daily to station reporters in Taipei
because they never cover Taiwan's stories without political bias.</P>

(By Oliver Lin &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese enactment of its
Anti-Secession Law has backfired on the Chinese government, an
official from the State Department said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Under Secretary for Political Affairs R. Nicholas Burns, told the
Congress's Committee on Armed Services and Committee on International
Relations that the Anti-Secession Law is very much against the spirit
of what should promptly be the relationship across the Taiwan
Straits, and that's the peaceful means of resolving disputes, not the
threat of force or the use of force.</P>
      <P>Burns said the law had the impact of creating some doubt within
the European Union (EU) about whether or not the embargo of arms
sales to China should be lifted, and added US argument that the
embargo should be maintained.</P>
      <P>Burns said the EU has now taken the time to consider the larger
implications of lifting the embargo, and the US State Department
doesn't belief that the EU is close to a decision to lifting the
embargo.</P>
      <P>Burns said the US response to the Anti-Secession Law is vigorous
and very clear, and the Chinese government is aware of US interest in
seeing that the disputes across the Taiwan Straits are handled only
in a peaceful manner, and therefore there is no need at this point to
take any punitive action in the economic realm to express US
unhappiness with the Anti-Secession Law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA URGED TO TAKE ACTION BEFORE E.U. ARMS SALES BAN CAN BE LIFTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  April 15 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang and Y.S. Lo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn
said Friday that China's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law has
complicated the debate among European Union member states on whether
or not to lift the E.U. arms sales embargo on China.</P>
      <P>The minister also said since the foreign ministers of 25 E.U.
nations failed to reach a consensus on lifting the ban at an informal
meeting held in Brussels, the E.U. hopes Beijing will take this as a
sign that it needs to take concrete steps before the ban can be
lifted.</P>
      <P>Pointing to Article 8 of the Anti-Secession Law, that states, in
part: "If the Taiwan independence secessionist forces should act
under any name or by any means to cause the fact of Taiwan's
secession from China, or that major incidents entailing Taiwan's
secession from China should occur, or that possibilities for a
peaceful reunification should be exhausted, the state shall employ
non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to protect China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, " Asselborn said that this has
made the E.U. discussion on lifting the ban more complicated.</P>
      <P>Luxembourg currently holds the seat of the E.U.'s rotating
presidency until the end of June this year and all E.U. members have
expressed the hope that China can find a solution to problem.</P>
      <P>"Now, it's not up to the rotating presidency, the European
Commission nor each member state to make a decision on lifting the
ban. China should also take concrete actions, " the minister said,
adding that the E.U. hopes the Beijing government will release those
who are still in jail due to their participation in the 1989
democratic demonstrations in Tiananmen Square and to sign the U.N.
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</P>
      <P>The minister further said that if China signs the U.N. covenant
and puts it into practice, it will help toward having the arms sales
ban lifted.</P>
      <P>According to Asselborn, during the meeting, the foreign ministers
also expressed the hope that their countries can further strengthen
economic and political relations with China, but said that they would
also pass on to China the message of E.U. values, such as human
rights and the peaceful settlement of disputes.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said after the
meeting that China can make an important contribution to a consensus
that might be reached by the E.U. member states on lifting the ban,
pointing to its ratification of the U.N. human rights covenant and
its efforts to reduce tensions in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Criticizing the Anti-Secession Law that poses a threat to Taiwan,
Fischer said that the law is a "backward step of a non-constructive
nature."</P>
      <P>Fischer, a member of the German Greens, which is a ruling
coalition partner of German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Social
Democratic Party, is keenly opposed to lifting the ban.</P>

: MM Lee on casino: Can Singapore afford to say
no?

In the strongest indication yet that
Monday's answer will be yes, Minister Mentor Lee
Kuan Yew posed this question to Singaporeans:
Can the country afford to say no to a casino?

So, the Government had little desire to draw
in tourist attractions such as Fumula-One
racing, for example. And in the 1970s, when
entrepreneur Run Run Show asked about building a
casino, the answer was a flat no.

But the world has changed, said Mr Lee.
Today, Singaporeans travel and can go to casinos
elsewhere. Whether they want a casino or not,
the fact is that one will pop up in a
neighbouring.

Mr Lee shared these observations last night
at the Citibank Legacies of Leadership speaker
series, where he was the keynote speaker.

The Lianhe Zaobao: MM Lee: We have more
trouble if we don't have casinos.

Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's comments come
ahead of Monday's parliamentary sitting, when
the Government will announce its decision on a
casino. It comes after a year-long debate.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>KMT COULD BREAK LAWS FOR SIGNING 'PEACE ACCORD' WITH CHINA: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) may
violate the country's laws if it signs a "peace accord" with China
without the government's authorization, Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Joseph Wu said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wu was commenting on reports that KMT Chairman Lien Chan, during
his upcoming visit to China, might sign a peace accord with Chinese
President Hu Jintao -- who is also general-secretary of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) -- to officially end the KMT-CPC civil war that
lasted around two decades on China before the KMT fled to Taiwan in
1949.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government will not interfere in any forms of lawful
social exchanges between the KMT and CPC but the KMT could violate
certain laws if it is involved without the government's authorization
in activities concerning government or political affairs.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that such restrictions are not unique to Taiwan,
saying it is also unlawful in countries such as the United States and
France for any individuals or civic groups to negotiate with a
foreign government without their governments' permission.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, as the CPC is the ruling party of the People's
Republic of China, which controls political and military powers, the
signing of a cross-Taiwan Strait peace accord should be a
government-to-government matter.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan is a democratic country that deals with
political affairs according to the rules of democracy, Wu urged all
politicians and political groups in Taiwan to abide by these rules.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors have launched an investigation into KMT Vice Chairman
P.K. Chiang for alleged treason after he reached a so-called 10-point
consensus with Beijing authorities during his visit to China last
month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN TO REPORT TO NATION ON CHINA TRIP PRIOR TO VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Saturday that he will report to the nation before making
his "journey of peace" to mainland China</P>
      <P>Lien said that KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng is currently
arranging for his mainland visit, and after the plan is fleshed out,
he will report to the nation.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of KMT party elders, he also tried to
deflect criticism of the visit as one by "pro-communists" by Vice
President Annette Lu, saying that he had lived in Taiwan for more
than six decades without even once visiting China.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Lu visited the mainland for more than 20 days over a
decade ago, prompting Lien to ask, "Is it fair to say that she can
go, but that my visit is 'pro-communist?'"</P>
      <P>He also said that the KMT under the late party chairman and
President Chiang Chin-kuo allowed local residents to visit their
families on the mainland, terminated martial law, lifted the ban on
political parties, allowed more media to operate and moved the
country firmly along the path of democracy.</P>
      <P>"Should any cross-strait contacts be considered pro-communist? "
Lien asked, citing the Koo-Wang talks in 1993 as an example. The
talks took place in Singapore between the late Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's
former top negotiator with the mainland and former chairman of the
Straits Exchange Foundation, and his Beijing counterpart, Wang
Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>The Koo-Wang talks marked the first high-level meeting between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait after a hiatus of more than five
decades. The talks began a number of exchanges and dialogues between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait over the next few years before
relations stalled after former President Lee Teng-hui's "special
state-to-state" statement on cross-strait ties in 1999.</P>
      <P>Lien questioned Lu's way of thinking and vision, saying that he
was worried about "Taiwan's future if the island continues to move
along in such a closed-door mindset."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien said that he hoped that the fierce race for the
chairmanship of the KMT would not overshadow the important election
of members for the mission-oriented National Assembly.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the election of the delegates to the ad hoc
National Assembly will be crucial to the promotion of constitutional
amendments.</P>
      <P>He said the KMT has nominated 160 candidates to vie for National
Assembly seats. The delegates' mission is to pass a package of
constitutional amendments passed by the Legislative Yuan last August,
which include reducing the number of legislators in the 225-seat
Legislative Yuan by almost half, changing the electoral system from
"multi-seat" to "single seat and two votes, " and the abolition of
the National Assembly.</P>
      <P>Lien said that the party has long advocated these amendments as a
step toward realizing legislative and central government reforms.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed his earlier statement at the party's central
standing committee that every party member should focus on the
National Assembly election, adding that the upcoming election for KMT
chairman is not the most important issue now; most important is
the election for National Assembly members.</P>
      <P>The election for KMT chairman will be held on July 16, and
National Assembly members will be elected May 14.</P>
      <P>"Every party member, especially candidates for party chairman,
should keep this in mind, " he said, referring to two of the party's
vice chairmen -- Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou and Legislative Yuan
President Wang Jin-pyng -- who are vying for the party's top post.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu on Saturday
urged the public to show more concern and do more to create a healthy
society and healthier earth.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks at a learning camp held in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan, aimed at training teachers to promote a healthy
society.</P>
      <P>Lu said that a group of some 1,200 "rangers" will be formed in
May to safeguard the forests and mountains of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Among these "rangers, " 600 will be serving their alternative
military service, while the remaining will be aboriginal people, Lu
said, adding that they will also be dedicated to preventing
landslides which occur frequently in Taiwan following earthquakes and
typhoons.</P>
      <P>In addition to natural disasters, Lu said there are other kinds
of disasters that Taiwan must be aware of, such as China trying to
lure Taiwan investors to the mainland as an "economic landslide, " in
which she said Taiwanese investors will collapse when China suddenly
changes its investment policy.</P>
      <P>Lu described the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) as currently fawning
over China as being in contrast to its previous anti-communism
policy, calling it a "political landslide." Lu was referring to the
visits of several high-ranking KMT officials to China, including one
of its vice chairmen, P.K. Chiang, who reached a 10-point consensus
with Chinese authorities on a wide variety of issues, such as
agricultural cooperation, cross-Taiwan Strait transport, and the
opening of China's financial markets.</P>
      <P>Chiang's visit came under criticism by the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and has been discussed at length on the island,
with many saying that the KMT has no right to reach agreements with
Beijing, in which the government's authority is involved.</P>
      <P>Lu also criticized the deterioration of social order and lamented
that there is too much gossip on television news and newspapers,
classifying them as "social landslide."</P>
      <P>The vice president also talked about suicide and abortion
problems, suggesting that there should be better policies to allow

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Saturday
that the only time she visited mainland China was in 1990 when she
was a private citizen who did not hold any public office and
therefore didn't need to report to anyone about the visit.</P>
      <P>Lu was responding to a spokesman of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) while she was in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan, addressing a
training camp sponsored by the Taiwan Public Health Association.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung revealed earlier in the day that Lu
traveled to the mainland for a 26-day visit 15 years ago without
reporting to the then KMT-administration. Chang spoke after
government criticism about a planned visit by KMT Chairman Lien Chan
to China.</P>
      <P>Lu wondered how Chang found out about her trip to the
mainland, speculating that Beijing passed the information to him.</P>
      <P>The vice president took the chance to remind the public that
everything you say or do on a visit to China can be recorded, and
that you don't know when or how the information will be used.</P>
      <P>Lu said that she went to the mainland before taking part in
legislative elections in 1991, knowing that it would be inconvenient
for her to make such a visit after holding public office.</P>
      <P>She stressed that there was no law regulating citizens visiting
mainland China then. Besides, Lu said she didn't do anything that she
couldn't tell others.</P>
      <P>She claimed that China supplied the information of her mainland
visit to the KMT, which is tantamount to telling the people that
Beijing can use whatever information it has against people, and she
would like to remind Lien about this on his upcoming visit to the
mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian attaches great
importance to Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's upcoming visit to
China and would like to talk to the opposition leader on the phone
to express his concern about the visit, according to the Presidential
Office Saturday.</P>
      <P>Media reports have said that Lien will soon make a visit to
China and will meet with Chinese leaders during the visit.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu
Shyi-kun already contacted KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng Friday
to pass on the president's sincere message to Lien, the Presidential
Office said that Lin was also asked to help make arrangements for a
phone conversation between the two political leaders.</P>
      <P>The two secretaries-general did not reach any concrete
conclusions about the issue and the presidential office has not yet
received any response from KMT headquarters, it said, adding that it
will continue speaking with the KMT.</P>
      <P>Saying that Yu would very much like to meet with Lin, the
Presidential Office noted that it also hopes that a talk over the
phone can be arranged for Chen and Lien to exchange their views on
relevant matters before the latter's visit to China.</P>
      <P>It also expressed the hope that Lien will participate in an
inter-party leaders meeting pushed by the president to seek consensus
between ruling and opposition political parties on issues regarding
their cooperation about the nation's development and well-being of
the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Wen-Chung, director of the presidential office's
public affairs department, said Friday night that the presidential
office would actively make arrangements for a phone conversation
between the president and Lien if the KMT head wishes to talk to the
president.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks after KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung said the
same day that Lien does not exclude the possibility of talking to the
president by phone.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the KMT general-secretary contacted
Yu Friday and proposed to meet with him prior to proceeding to the
the phone conversation arrangements between the president and Lien.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Lin thinks that his meeting with Yu would
facilitate the Chen-Lien talk.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin said Saturday that he prefers to meet with Yu
after he returns from the mainland after next week's visit since it
would be better for them to discuss things after his consultations
with his Chinese counterparts on matters regarding Lien's trip.</P>
      <P>Touching on the future phone call between the president and
Lien, Lin said, "The president has this expectation and we won't

opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan from visiting China,
saying Lien's reported plan to sign a "peace accord" with Beijing is
"obviously unlawful."</P>
      <P>According to TSU Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming, a peace
accord should be an agreement between governments, and the KMT, which
is no longer in power in Taiwan, is not qualified to seal such a
document with the Communist Party of China (CPC) , which represents

      <P>Chen claimed that the KMT will obviously violate the country's
laws if it negotiates and seals a "peace accord" without the

is not suitable to act as a negotiator with Beijing unless he obtains

Beijing to change its political system and to practice democracy if

      <P>Without talking about issues regarding China's political

      <P>Wang, also a KMT vice chairman, revealed that Lien had invited
him to join a KMT delegation, to be led by Lien, to China in the near
future.</P>
      <P>Because of the "four prerequisites" premise, Wang said he has no
intention of accompanying Lien on the much discussed China trip.
Moreover, Wang said he feels that now is not an opportune time to
visit China. He did not elaborate on this point.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Lien would meet with President Chen Shui-bian prior
to his departure for a China trip, Wang said Friday's intra-party
discussions didn't reach a positive decision on the issue.</P>
      <P>"Participants to yesterday's meeting only decided to authorize
KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng to inform President Chen's chief
of staff, Yu Shyi-kun, of the exact time for Lien's China trip and
the topics to be addressed during the visit, " Wang said, adding that
to the best of his understanding, it remains uncertain whether there
will be a Chen-Lien meeting prior Lien's departure to China.</P>
      <P>While the race for the KMT chairmanship between Wang and another
KMT vice chairman, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, has continued to
gain momentum, some KMT party elders have been urging
Lien to continue in the top party post. Wang commented
that so long as Lien is willing to stay, he will throw his full
support behind Lien.</P>

    <DATELINE>Berlin,  April 15 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-li and Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's passage of its Anti-Secession Law
and the European Union's (EU) plan to lift its arms embargo against
China has put Taiwan in the spotlight of the German media, with a
major broadcasting company producing a special radio program about
Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>Several Taiwanese politicians and scholars were interviewed in
Taipei by a Bayerischen Rundfunks journalist for the program, titled
"Taiwan -- the Republic of China, " to discuss their opinions on the
issues.</P>
      <P>In the program, broadcast on Friday evening, Legislator Lin
Cho-shui of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party told the
German audience that Taiwan, like any other country in the world, is
independent with its own government and Constitution.</P>
      <P>Lin criticized China's Anti-Secession Law, which depicts Taiwan
as an unsolved problem in a civil war, arguing that the
interpretation of Taiwan as part of China is nothing but nonsense.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Shuai Hua-ming of the opposition Kuomintang
expressed concerns over the EU's plan to lift its arms embargo
against China. He explained that China's military budget has grown
annually, and the EU's planned move could lead to unrest in Asia.
Meanwhile, Taiwan will face the reinforced threat of China's
annexation.</P>
      <P>Vice Chairman Huang Wei-feng of the Mainland Affairs Council told
the German media that Taiwan dreams to be recognized and respected as
a country that can take part in any international activities without
being boycotted by China.</P>
      <P>When questioned about recent disputes generated by Beijing's
enactment of its Anti-Secession Law, which allows the use of
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan under certain circumstances, the
official said Taiwan will do all it can to settle any disputes in a
peaceful manner.</P>
      <P>Professor Tsai Wei of the Institute of International Relations of
National Chengchi University said that he hopes Taiwan can cooperate
with the United States and other strong powers in the international
community to push for changes in China's economic, political and
social fields.</P>
      <P>However, the scholar admitted Taiwan must first improve its
efforts to promote economic and political democratization, and then
seek support and acknowledgment from the international community.</P>
      <P>The program will be rebroadcast on Bayern 2 Radio on April 18 at
6: 30 p.m local time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NOW IS THE WRONG TIME FOR DPP COUNTY CHIEFS TO VISIT CHINA: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is not an opportune moment for ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) county chiefs and mayors to
visit China now, and the party should not and will not negotiate with
China on behalf of the government, a DPP official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>DPP Deputy Secretary-General Yen Wan-chin made the remarks in
response to media reports that Beijing has invited DPP members to
send a delegation to China for talks regarding cross-Taiwan Strait
agricultural exchanges, and extended an invitation to several DPP
county chiefs and mayors to attend the 2005 Asia Pacific Cities
Summit (APCS) to be held in China in October.</P>
      <P>Yen noted that the DPP has adopted an open attitude toward any
party official's China visit, if such visits are conducted without
preconditions and operated on an equal footing with China.</P>
      <P>He went on that according to the laws of the nation, county
chiefs and mayors should obtain the central government's approval
before their China visits.</P>
      <P>However, Yen thought it was not an opportune time for any DPP
county chiefs and mayors to visit China following the recent
enactment of the Anti-Secession Law by Beijing, which legalizes an
attack on Taiwan should the island seek formal independence.</P>
      <P>Turning to cross-strait agricultural exchanges, Yen stressed that
the DPP should not and will not replace the government to negotiate
with China for any issues that involve the exercise of government
authority.</P>
      <P>"Neither should other political parties [negotiate with China
about such issues], "Yen added. Yen was believed to be referring to
the recent visit to China by one of the opposition Kuomintang's vice
chairmen, P.K. Chiang, who reached a 10-point consensus with Chinese
authorities on a wide variety of issues, including agricultural
cooperation, cross-strait transport, and the opening of China's

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(by Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan would most likely still be breaking the law if he seeks to
circumvent the Criminal Code by signing an agreement with China using
the cover of a "party-to-party" model, ranking officials of the
Executive Yuan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The officials made the remarks amid reports that Lien will visit
China at the end of April and that Chinese President Hu Jintao will
meet with Lien in his concurrent capacity as the Chinese Communist
Party's secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Lien and Hu could sign an agreement to terminate the civil war
between the KMT and the CCP, and both could also touch on a framework
for cross-strait peace, a non-military zone and a "peace zone, " the
reports said.</P>
      <P>The officials said that they expect the agreement regarding the
termination of the civil war to be crafted by the KMT using a
"party-to-party" model to try to evade Article 113 of the Criminal
Code which stipulates that "for those matters that require prior
government approval, if a person without such approval signs an
accord with a foreign government or with those dispatched by a
foreign government, he or she is subject to life imprisonment or
imprisonment of no less than seven years."</P>
      <P>They reminded Lien that China is a communist country and its
constitution stipulates clearly that the Chinese Communist Party is
paramount and the line between the party and the government is
indistinguishable.</P>
      <P>"China is not a democratic country, " they said; therefore,
whether it is peace talks or an agreement between the KMT and the
CCP, odds are that the law will be violated and the KMT should
seriously rethink the matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT INSISTS '1992 CONSENSUS' NONEXISTENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Saturday
rejected a claim by the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) that
representatives of Taiwan and China reached a consensus on the "one
China" issue in their talks held in Hong Kong in 1992.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comment while addressing a meeting of the Rotary
International Taiwan's Taipei region, backing up his point with a
biography of late Straits Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu --
who acted as Taipei's chief negotiator with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen said Koo's biography notes that the so-called "1992
consensus" is a term coined by former Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman Su Chi in April 2000, less than one month before Chen's
first inauguration.</P>
      <P>The term has since been used by China to support its "one China"
principle, Chen pointed out.</P>
      <P>The KMT, which remained in power in Taiwan until May 2000, claims
that Taipei and Beijing agreed during the 1992 talks to allow either
side to interpret the meaning of "one China" freely, with Taipei
insisting that the "one China" referred to "the Republic of China"
and Beijing insisting that it meant "the People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Citing Koo's opinions, Chen said no conclusion was reached
between the two sides on the "one China" issue in the 1992 talks,
although Beijing accepted Taipei's proposal that both sides
maintained different interpretations of "one China."</P>
      <P>However, Beijing is now claiming that the two sides both agreed
on the principle of "one China" in 1992, which according to Beijing
means "one country, two systems, " a model that will downgrade the
status of Taiwan to a local government like Hong Kong, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president criticized the Anti-Secession Law enacted by China
last month as trying to provide a legal basis for its attempt to
invade Taiwan and as a violation of the principles of peace, justice
and civilization.</P>
      <P>The legislation has seriously hurt the feelings of the Taiwanese
people and pulled cross-Taiwan Strait relations back to a deadlock of
confrontation, he said.</P>
      <P>He urged Beijing leaders not to miscalculate the cross-strait
situation, especially the mainstream public opinion in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes the principle of peace and mutual respect
are the only feasible approaches leading to the resolution of
cross-strait differences and that the two sides should jointly create
a favorable climate for cross-strait peace and reconciliation.</P>

      <P>It is uncertain whether opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan will urge China to dismantle its
missiles targeting Taiwan during his planned visit to the mainland, a

      <P>KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung made the remarks in response to

on the mainland before the KMT retreated to Taiwan in 1949, Chang

the two sides of Taiwan Strait, Chang said when Lien visits China, he
will insist on upholding the country's dignity and maintaining an
equal footing with China while promoting cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>"His visit will help promote the welfare of the people of
Taiwan," Chang claimed.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed that Lien's upcoming China visit will focus on the

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday
that no individual political party can accomplish matters related to
national sovereignty when talking with China, urging opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan to talk with him first prior to a
planned visit to the mainland.</P>
      <P>President Chen made the remarks while attending an activity
organized by the Rotar International Taiwan's Taipei region.</P>
      <P>The president said that he supported Lien's visit to China and
could authorize him to talk with Chinese leader Hu Jintao on
something.</P>
      <P>But on matters related to the government's authority, there
should be prior consensus between the ruling and the opposition
parties in the best interests of the nation and the people, the
president said.</P>
      <P>Beijing's cherished "one China" formula is in fact "one country,
two systems, " which is an attempt to Hong Kongnize and localize
Taiwan, Chen said, adding that this is an issue that will involve a
gross change of national sovereignty.</P>
      <P>The president said that whether Lien wants to talk about a
cross-strait peace accord or an agreement to formally end the civil
war all involve matters of national sovereignty.</P>
      <P>"If one political party can unilaterally decide on matters
related to national sovereignty, it is turning a blind eye to the
government's authority,' he said.</P>
      <P>Any cross-strait consensus or agreement reached with China will
be rendered void and meaningless without the participation and
authorization of the governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait,
the president said.</P>
      <P>Also, any attempt or gimmick that seeks to denigrate or splinter
Taiwan will not bridge the distance between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait, but will allow both sides to drift further apart, he
said.</P>
      <P>The president pointed out that the number of China's missiles
targeting Taiwan increases by 120 every year. With the total number
of missiles now reaching 725, the president said that it is
meaningless to say how many could be removed to show goodwill, saying
that Beijing should instead remove and destroy them all.</P>

    <TEXT>The Times: End of the road as Rover rescue
collapses.

About 5,000 car workers in the West Midlands were left jobless
last night after the complete collapse of MG Rover as the last hopes
of a deal with a Chinese partner disappeared. 

They will receive redundancy notices this weekend and will be told
within a week about their chances of a job in other industries. It is the
biggest single loss of jobs for five years. The huge Longbridge plant in
Birmingham will now be mothballed with the 400-acre site probably
being redeveloped. 

Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, trying to soften the blow both to the
area and to their election campaign, rushed to Birmingham to announce
a &#xC2;&#xA3;150 million support package for retraining, redundancy pay and
helping Rover's suppliers. 



Financial Times: &#xC2;&#xA3;150m to aid Rover workers.

The final collapse of MG Rover brutally intruded on Labour's election
campaign on Friday, after the Chinese ended any lingering hope of a
rescue deal for the stricken carmaker.

Tony Blair and Gordon Brown abandoned their campaign schedules
to rush to the West Midlands. Their second emergency visit to Birmingham
in eight days came after the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation
sounded Rover's death knell by confirming unequivocally it would not buy
the company as a going concern.</TEXT>

that they may be impressed by the development in Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Shenzhen, but fail to notice that elsewhere in China,
development is still retarded.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen must not be fooled by the glamorous facade of
China, Wu said, adding that China's economy has kept on growing while
the development of the political front has been stalled, saying that
this is bound to conflict.</P>
      <P>Wu reminded Taiwan businessmen not just to look to cheap labor
and land when considering investing in China, saying that they should
diversify investments to reduce risk.</P>
      <P>China often says how much money Taiwan businessmen have earned
from the mainland, but it fails to mention how much foreign exchange
reserves they have earned for China, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The economic development of the mainland owes much to the capital
and equipment introduced by Taiwan businessmen, he added.</P>
      <P>Wu also pointed to the outstanding high-tech industry in Taiwan,
saying that 20 Taiwan high-tech products hold the No. 1 global market
share.</P>
      <P>But he also said that with high-tech industry firmly established
in Taiwan, the government has to reconsider whether to provide tax
incentives to the industry, adding that social justice must also be
factored in.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT-CHINA 'PEACE ACCORD' HARMFUL TO TAIWAN: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will
seriously damage the national interests of Taiwan and create
international misunderstandings if it is to sign a "peace accord"
with China, ruling Democratic Progressive Party Deputy
Secretary-General Yen Wan-chin said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yen was referring to an upcoming visit to China by KMT Chairman
Lien Chan, during which Lien reportedly might seal a "peace accord"
with the Communist Party of China (CPC) to officially end the KMT-CPC
civil war that lasted around two decades on China before the KMT fled
to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>Yen warned that Lien's trip -- expected to take place less than
two months after China enacted its Anti-Secession Law that threatens
the use of force against Taiwan -- is very inappropriate because it
will be tantamount to an endorsement of the aggressive legislation.</P>
      <P>To create a false impression of peace by signing a "peace accord"
with Beijing at this point will reduce the Taiwan issue to an
internal affair of China, he said.</P>
      <P>In particular, it will feed Beijing's bid to eliminate the
government of Republic of China and downgrade Taiwan to become a
locality under the People's Republic of China if the "peace accord"
is to be signed for the purpose of ending the "civil war, " he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN ON LECTURE TOUR OF SINGAPORE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan departed for Singapore Saturday for a brief visit at the
invitation of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.</P>
      <P>Lien kept a low profile on his Singapore visit, accompanied by a
small entourage whose members included KMT Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang
and Ting Yuan-chao, the director of Lien's office.</P>
      <P> KMT headquarters issued a news release after Lien's departure,
which said the main purpose of Lien's Singapore tour was to deliver a
speech at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.</P>
      <P>The school at the National University of Singapore was founded by
Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew to provide training to
enable students and practitioners a multi-disciplinary approach to the
development and implementation of policy alternatives.</P>
      <P>According to KMT sources, the Lee Kuan Yew School has invited
Lien and Chiang to give lectures and attend a seminar with the
school's faculty members and students because both of them used to
hold a number of important government posts during the KMT's 55-year
rule of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The sources said Lien and his small entourage are scheduled to
return to Taipei Sunday evening.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Lien's itinerary includes meetings with any
political figures, the sources said Lien has many old friends in
Singapore. "It would be natural if Lien meets with them during his
trip," a KMT official said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Lien's Singapore trip, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
spokesman Michel Lu said the ministry respects domestic political
party leaders' overseas visits.</P>
      <P>As Lien's Singapore visit came amid reports about his plan to
make a historic journey to China, local observers were concerned
about the possibility of Lien discussing his China travel plan with
Singaporean officials.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-chuan, director of the KMT's policy coordination
department, said Lien's Singapore trip is not expected to have
anything to do with his China travel plan.</P>
      <P>Chen Ching-jun, legislative whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, said the ruling party respects Lien's freedom of
travel. But he urged Lien to keep in mind national dignity and parity
if he touches on topics regarding relations across the Taiwan Strait
during his visit.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Lee Kuan Yew has tried hard to serve as a
go-between in cross-strait engagements in recent years.</P>
      <P>"If Lien talks about his planned China trip with Lee or other
Singaporean officials during his visit, he should take into account
national dignity. He should not claim that his party's stance
represents mainstream Taiwan public opinion. He should abide by
constitutional provisions and national consensus while addressing
cross-strait topics," Chen urged.</P>

      <P>In light of an increasing demand by Taiwan

    <HEADLINE>MAC URGES CHINA TO LIFT NEWS BLACKOUT AGAINST TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China should ease its news blackout
against Taiwan to promote constructive journalistic exchanges across
the Taiwan Strait, the nation's top mainland policy planner said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Joseph Wu made the call
at a seminar on Taiwan-Macau relations and cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>Wu said the MAC is mulling ways to help mainland Chinese people
obtain accurate information about Taiwan to forge mutual
understanding and trust.</P>
      <P>In the wake of its decision to temporarily ban China's
state-controlled Xinhua news agency and the People's Daily newspaper
from posting correspondents in Taiwan, Wu said, the MAC is now trying
to invite more independent-thinking mainland media outlets to
organize delegations to visit Taiwan and even post reporters in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Wu said, some of those media outlets will
send delegations to visit Taiwan in the near future to conduct news
coverage on specific themes.</P>
      <P>Wu further said the MAC is studying whether Hong Kong media
outlets can freely distribute their publications in China. Should
that be the case, Wu said, the MAC, will consider cooperating with
Hong Kong media outlets so that Taiwan-related information can be
accurately conveyed to mainland Chinese readers.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ban on Xinhua and People's Daily are temporary in
nature, Wu said the MAC will decide whether to lift the ban in terms
of China's response to Taiwan's call for constructive cross-strait
journalistic exchanges.</P>
      <P>"We'll watch whether China would allow mainland media outlets
that the MAC is inviting to organize delegations to Taiwan or post
journalists in Taiwan as well as whether China would ease its
blackout against Taiwan news outlets Internet online versions, " Wu
said, adding that if Beijing can make positive response to Taiwan's
call, the MAC could allow Xinhua and People's Daily to post reporters
in Taiwan again.</P>
      <P>Wu reiterated that the ban has nothing to do with suppression of
the freedom of press, saying that the named mainland news outlets'
reports had been distorted, misleading and unhelpful to boost
cross-strait mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Taiwan first allowed Chinese media to post reporters in Taiwan in
late 2000. Besides Xinhua and People's Daily, three other Chinese
media outlets -- China Central Television (CCTV) , China News Agency
and China National Radio -- have also posted journalists in Taiwan.
Each of them is allowed to send two reporters to Taiwan, rotating
them out each month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2005 TUNG BLOSSOM FESTIVAL KICKS OFF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2005 Tung Blossom Festival kicked off
Saturday with a fun-filled ceremony at the West Lake Resort in the
northern Taiwan county of Miaoli, a Hakka stronghold.</P>
      <P>Lee Yung-teh, acting chairman of the Council for Hakka Affairs
(CHA) , joined with Yeh Chu-lan, a senior adviser to President Chen
Shui-bian, other senior officials and representatives of major Hakka
communities from around Taiwan in staging a special worship ritual at
the resort in Miaoli's Sanyi township.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 Hakka cultural event will be staged in 50 Hakka
townships in northern and central Taiwan during the festival which
will last through May 15.</P>
      <P>In addition to arranging 21 "pathways" for appreciating white
tung blossoms, the CHA has also invited 108 Hakka cultural and
performing troupes to present musical, theatric and dancing
performances during the festival. Poem recitals and folk crafts
demonstrations will also be staged to attract tourists.</P>
      <P>This is the fourth consecutive year that the Cabinet-level Hakka
council has organized a tung blossom festival to boost tourism and
cultural development in Taiwan's major Hakka communities,
particularly those in northern parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Tourist groups from New Zealand, Australia and various European
countries will travel to Taiwan to appreciate the tung flower season
and take part in various cultural activities to be staged during the
month-long festival.</P>
      <P>In 2004, Lee said, the Tung Blossom Festival attracted 2.7
million visitors and generated NT$3 billion in business revenues.
This time around, he said, the festival promises to be bigger and
better than ever.</P>
      <P>Referring to the choice of tung flowers as the focus of the
festival, Lee said that as tung trees are common in northern Taiwan
Hakka communities, the council has "adopted" the tung blossom as a
symbol of Hakka culture.</P>
      <P>The trees, (aluerites fordii hemi, common name paulownia), used
to be an important source of income for the Hakka, Lee said, adding
that through the festival, the CHA hopes that the trees will once
again bring prosperity to Hakka communities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>E.U. SUPPORT CRITICAL TO TAIWAN'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Union's support will be
critical to Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) --
the World Health Organization's (WHO's) governing body -- as an
observer, the Department of Health (DOH) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on Taiwan's WHO bid, Chang Wu-hsiu,
director of the DOH's international cooperation department, said many
countries have become supportive of Taiwan's goal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has campaigned for joining the WHA as an observer
since 1997. Because of China's boycott, Taiwan has not made it so
far. But last year, the United States and Japan publicly voiced
support Taiwan's WHA observership. Hereafter, Chang said, the E.U.'s
attitude will be crucial in determining the fate of Taiwan's WHA bid.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by Chang, DOH Minister Hou Sheng-mao visited several
European countries, including Switzerland, France, Belgium and
Luxembourg, to seek their support for Taiwan's cause. </P>
      <P>"We mainly met with media outlets, think tanks and
parliamentarians during our visits to lobby their support. It
remains to be seen whether they can influence their governments to
throw support behind our WHO bid," Chang said.</P>
      <P>From the perspective of epidemic control, Chang said, Taiwan is
eligible to join the WHO-crafted health care mechanism. Otherwise, he
said the global epidemic control system will be incomplete and
flawed.</P>
      <P>Chang said the DOH has been actively promote "medical diplomacy"
in recent years to forge friendship with other countries through
medical services and cooperation. </P>
      <P>"The DOH has stepped up efforts to cultivate personnel
for medical diplomacy. We hope to seek the support of more than 30
countries with no diplomatic ties with Taiwan to support our WHO
bid through medical cooperation," Chang said.</P>

(By Emerson T. Lim &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is not a part of
China, and United Nations' Resolution 2758 of 1971 didn't say that
Taiwan is apart of China, Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
said in an interview published by the Philippine Star newspaper
Sunday.</P>
      <P>In the interview, conducted by the paper's publisher Maximo
Soliven in Taiwan on Thursday, Lu said it is unfair to force Taiwan
to unite with China, because Taiwan has been an independent country
for many many years.</P>
      <P>Likening Taiwan to a cat and China to a lion in the Taiwan-China
dispute, Lu said that pushing the cat to the lion would inevitably
result in the cat being eaten by the lion. "This is the law of the
jungle, not the law of human society," she added.</P>
      <P>In order to maintain peace in the world, Lu said, "predatory
animals should be confined to their cages while small and tame
animals should be allowed to roam free."</P>
      <P>"Now that the lion is waking up, the world should help tame the
lion" to ensure peace and stability in Asia, she continued.</P>
      <P>Lu disputed China's claim as brazen lie that the U.N. Resolution
2758 acknowledges that Taiwan is a part of China. She said the
resolution only granted mainland China the U.N. seat held by the ROC

    <TEXT>
      <P>The top aide to Taiwan's opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan on Saturday denied rumors that
Lien has met with mainland Chinese officials for talks during his
current brief visit in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Ting Yuan-chao, director of Lien's office, denied rumors late
Saturday that Lien met with Beijing officials during a dinner the
same day hosted by Singapore's Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew in honor
of Lien. Rumors had been circulating that Lien have talked with
Chinese officials during the dinner about matters pertaining to his
forthcoming visit to China.</P>
      <P>Lien delivered a speech at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public
Policy Sunday morning. As described by Ting, the speech was closed to
the media.</P>
      <P>The KMT head arrived in Singapore Saturday for a brief visit at
the invitation of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. Lien,
accompanied by a small entourage whose members include KMT Vice
Chairman P. K. Chiang. has kept a low profile during his visit.</P>
      <P>On President Chen Shui-bian's renewed calls in Taipei Saturday
for the KMT leader to meet with him before embarking on the China
trip, Lien said Sunday that he "has no particular opinions on this
concern."</P>
      <P>"Everything is being arranged, and I have no particular opinions
about President Chen's remarks, " Lien told reporters when he stepped
out of the Lee Kuan Yew School after delivering the closed-door
speech.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian reportedly said Saturday that "no
individual political party can accomplish matters related to national
sovereignty when talking with China."</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT and the Communist Party of China held
discussions regarding peace in 1945 before the KMT lost the mainland,
Chen asked if the KMT was prepared to lose Taiwan too. He urged Lien
to talk with him prior to his planned visit to the mainland.</P>
      <P>According to those who attended Lien's closed-door speech, the
KMT head mostly spoke about the situation and prospects regarding
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, the huge gap between Taiwan's ruling
and opposition parties in perspectives on cross-strait issues, as
well as problems Lien himself faces on related matters.</P>
      <P>The Lee Kuan Yew School at the National University of Singapore
was founded by Lee to train students in multi-disciplinary approaches
to the development and implementation of policy alternatives.</P>
      <P>Lien and his small entourage are reportedly scheduled to return
to Taipei Sunday evening.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Lien's Singapore trip, Republic of China Ministry
of Foreign Affairs spokesman Michel Lu said Saturday that the
ministry respects domestic political party leaders' overseas visits.</P>

comes too closely on the heels of Beijing's enactment of its
anti-secession law against Taiwan, ruling Democratic Progressive

mistakenly conclude that Taiwan's opposition politicians have

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian should be
open-minded regarding opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan's planned mainland China visit as the visit could help usher in
peace in cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the comments while answering questions from reporters
during a visit to eastern Ilan County regarding Chen's remarks a day
earlier that "Lien's China visit will enable the Chinese Communist
Party (CCP) to bring Taiwan into its fold."</P>
      <P>Stressing that an "opposition party has no power to sell Taiwan
out, " Ma said that President Chen should wish Lien success during
his China visit and help him complete the task that could bring peace
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Taipei mayor added that he will also consider visiting China,
if such a visit is determined to be beneficial to Taiwan, should he
win the election for the KMT chairmanship in July.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a KMT lawmaker said that Lien's upcoming visit to
China has gained strong support among the public.</P>
      <P>Chen Chieh, a caucus whip of the main opposition KMT at the
Legislative Yuan, said that the public is supportive of Lien's
"journey of peace" to help break the ice in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Lien's China visit is aimed at seeking the maximum
benefits for the people in Taiwan, Chen Chieh claimed that he has
strong confidence that the popular backing for Lien's visit will be
reflected in the mission-oriented National Assembly election set for
May 14.</P>
      <P>He called on the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and
its political ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, to be cognizant of
the KMT's efforts to build peace for Taiwan and urged the DPP to
bravely face up to the development for the sake of Taiwan's stability
and prosperity.</P>
      <P>The government should give its blessing to the KMT for its
peace-forging efforts because the Taiwan people hope that the
opposition camp can help the government achieve something that is
beyond its own reach, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lien is scheduled to visit China in late April or early May,
during which he will make stops in Xian, Shanghai, Nanjing and

    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) urged the government Sunday to maintain its perspective on the
issue of China amid the fiery disputes between the government and the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) over KMT Chairman Lien Chan's planned
China visit.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lo Chih-ming, the convener of TSU caucus at the
Legislative Yuan, said that his party is worried that the government
could lose its focus on domestic issues and the economy, which he
called the lifeline of Taiwan, in embroiling itself in the disputes
with the KMT.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong
are both scrambling to visit China, Lo said the government has played
into the hands of the two opposition parties by trying to line up
meetings between the president and the chairmen before their trips,
rather than trying to stop them according to the law.</P>
      <P>In order to lure Lien and Soong into consulting with the
president, Lo said the government even hinted that it may ask them to
negotiate with China on some issues on behalf of the country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will lose its sovereignty by authorizing opposition
leaders to talk with China, the TSU lawmaker warned, noting that
Beijing insists that there is only one China, that the People's
Republic of China is its sole legitimate government, and that Taiwan
is a part of its territory.</P>
      <P>Lo said China's recent enactment of the anti-secession law
against Taiwan has driven home to the world Beijing's hostility
towards Taiwan and has inaugurated a new chapter in Taiwan's
diplomacy.</P>
      <P>Instead of taking advantage of the opportunity to initiate
diplomatic offenses, Lo said, the government has squandered the
chance by arguing bitterly with the KMT over whether Lien should or
should not visit China.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to cool off the China fever among the
opposition parties and turn its attention to domestic issues and the

    <HEADLINE>DPP WHIP CONDEMNS CHINESE OFFICIALS FOR NOT PREVENTING LOOTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  17  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislative whip of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) condemned Chinese authorities
Sunday for not preventing protestors from looting a factory of a
Taiwanese-financed company in Guangdong Province a day earlier.</P>
      <P>Legislator William Lai said that the factory operated by B.B.
Battery Co., currently the third largest producer of dry batteries in
the world, was surrounded by thousands of protestors Friday and
looted the following day as public security officers stood by without
intervening or trying to defuse the situation.</P>
      <P>The protestors had gathered at the B.B. Battery factory in/near
Chaozhou City to protest what they claimed was damage to local
fishermen's livelihood caused by waste water discharged by the
Taiwanese battery maker into surrounding waters.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, sources from the Taiwan Business Association in
Guangdong quoted B.B. Battery management as stating Saturday that the
company's waste water discharge system was built in accordance with
official standards set by the Chaozhou Environmental Protection
Bureau and that waste water discharged by the company has been within
the allowable limits.</P>
      <P>The management denied that waste water from the company was the
real culprit and demanded that the local government and residents
produce evidence to back up their accusations.</P>
      <P>B.B. Battery reported damage and losses of 10 million renminbi
(US$1.25 million) resulting from the looting.</P>
      <P>Condemning Guangdong authorities and police for their
"negligence, " Lai said that Beijing's newly enacted anti-secession
law targeting Taiwan has not only provided China with a legal excuse
to use non-peaceful means against Taiwan, it has also provided a
convenient tool for corrupt Chinese authorities to blackmail Taiwan
businesspeople maintaining business operations in China.</P>
      <P>Nowadays, Lai claimed, mainland Chinese authorities have become
even more fearless or unbridled in their schemes against
mainland-based Taiwan businesspeople in light of an increasingly
divided Taiwan resulting from in-fighting triggered by the opposition
parties.</P>
      <P>Pointing a finger at opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan, who is reportedly going to China at the end of this month for a
"groundbreaking" visit, Lai urged the KMT to realize the nature of
the Chinese communists and what kind of country China is.</P>
      <P>Lai urged Lien to "stop and watch" how the Chinese authorities
are treating the mainland-based Taiwan businesspeople before he
embarks on his so-called "journey of peace."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S Q1 TRADE SURPLUS DOWN SHARPLY FROM 2004 LEVEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 17 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan posted a trade surplus of US$290
million for the first quarter of this year, marking a sharp decline
of 85 percent from the year-earlier figure, according tallies
compiled by Taiwan customs authorities.</P>
      <P>The tallies show that Taiwan exports and imports totaled US$42.85
billion and US$42.56 billion, respectively, in the January-March
period, giving the country a trade surplus of US$290 million -- down
by US$1.66 billion from the 2004 level.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) , the
Bureau of Foreign Trade and the Taiwan External Trade Development
Council unanimously pointed to surging prices of crude oil and raw
materials as the root cause for the trade surplus decline, which they
said was most pronounced for March.</P>
      <P>Rising prices for oil, energy and raw materials helped Taiwan
record larger trade deficits with Australia, Indonesia, Kuwait,
Malaysia and Saudi Arabia for the first quarter, the officials said,
noting that Taiwan's trade deficit with Saudi Arabia for March grew
by 28.2 percent year to year.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh said she is optimistic
that Taiwan's trade deficits with these countries will gradually
narrow, with the global oil price dropping to about US$50 a barrel
for the time being.</P>
      <P>According to Ho, Taiwan's export sector remains competitive
despite the trade surplus decline for the first quarter resulting
from increased imports. Taiwan exports still registered growth of 7.8
percent in value, she noted, attributing the increase to higher
prices of export goods.</P>
      <P>Citing MOEA statistics, Ho reported that the index in Taiwan
export product price rose by an average of 9 percent last year, ahead
of South Korea's 7 percent. She claimed this is an indication that
Taiwan has improved in making value-added products.</P>
      <P>Taiwan also posted trade deficits of US$7.93 billion and US$1.91
billion with Japan and South Korea, respectively, for the first
quarter, up by 13.8 percent and 31.9 percent over the 2004 levels.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Ruey-long said that it is
worth noting that South Korea has increasingly become a "second
Japan" for Taiwan in international trade, given that South Korea has
exported many daily consumption products to Taiwan in recent years,
such as petrochemical goods and mobile phones, as well as key parts
and components and machinery equipment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Anti-Japanese protests erupted
again Sunday as Japan's foreign minister arrived in Beijing, with
protesters in many Chinese cities clashing with police.</P>
      <P>Witnesses said over 1,000 protesters marched toward Japan's
consulate general in Shenyang, northeast China Sunday morning, with
some 60 of them breaking through a police cordon and throwing rocks
and bricks, and shouting "Go back to Japan!"</P>
      <P>The attackers clashed with police, but tensions were reduced as
some people yelled "Chinese don't beat Chinese." No arrests were
reported, except for several Hong Kong and Japanese media workers who
were taken away for questioning and then later released.</P>
      <P>Japanese officials based in Beijing said some cars parked inside
the Shenyang consular were damaged by the attackers.</P>
      <P>Earlier reports said thousands of people, mostly college and
university students, were dispersed as they gathered at a shopping
mall in Shenyang. Those who were not daunted then marched to Japan's
consulate general, where they put up anti-Japanese banners and called
on the public to boycott Japanese products.</P>
      <P>In southern China, thousands of protesters shouted "Boycott
Japanese products" slogans in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province as
anti-Japanese protests took place there for the third Sunday in a
row.</P>
      <P>Holding banners condemning Japan's glossing over of its wartime
atrocities in newly published history textbooks, the protesters
waved Chinese flags and sang their national anthem as they marched
toward Shennan Road, where Japanese-invested department stores were
targeted.</P>
      <P>Police were seen making way for the protesters while also
containing them to "designated areas" for the march. At one point,
marchers threw objects at Japanese stores, destroying Japanese signs
and trying to demolish advertisements for Japanese products, narrowly
escaping clashes with the police.</P>
      <P>Anti-riot police with shields and batons were guarding two big
Japanese department stores, each two or three meters away from the
other to stop protesters from swarming into the stores, whose names
were covered for fear of inciting Chinese anger.</P>
      <P>Still, the heavy police force failed to prevent windows at a
Japanese noodle house from being smashed, witnesses said.</P>
      <P>In Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, more than a dozen
protesters were chased away by police when they were trying to set up
anti-Japanese placards. Police also put up barricades around the city
gymnasium and checked people's identity documents to discourage them
from gathering.</P>
      <P>The police actions apparently did not stop some 10,000 people
from marching in the streets shouting anti-Japanese slogans.</P>
      <P>In Zhuhai and Dongguan, two other Guangdong cities, protesters,
totalling about 1,500 in each city, were seen shouting slogans such
as "Boycott Japanese products."</P>
      <P>In Dongguan, a Japanese-invested factory was surrounded by over
1,000 protesters, who damaged the factory's doors and windows.</P>
      <P>Similar anti-Japanese protests were also reported Sunday in
Nanning, Guangxi Province, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>In Hong Kong, Japan's Consul General Takanori Kitamura said he is
not worried about local protesters as he believes Hong Kong is a
multi-cultural society where reason prevails.</P>
      <P>Kitamura said he believes the Hong Kong protest will take place
peacefully and incidents of attacking Japanese consular offices will
not happen in Hong Kong, as they had in China.</P>
      <P>Organizers said between 5,000 and 8,000 people will march in Hong
Kong streets in protest against Japan later Sunday.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China is likely to launch offensives
against Taiwan on the propaganda, psychological and legal fronts this
year in its attempt to force Taiwan to surrender, according to a new
book released Sunday.</P>
      <P>The book, titled "An Assessment of Taiwan's Security and
Strategy, " warned that the three-pronged offensive is to stop U.S.
arms sales to Taiwan, by encouraging some forces in Taiwan to oppose
them, and to plant spies in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To deal with the three-pronged offensive, the book recommended
the establishment of a rapid-reaction force to address a possible
Chinese sneak attack on the island, the enhancement of Taiwan's
overall monitoring and early warning systems to give the country more
time to respond to abrupt attacks, the improvement of the capability
for information warfare, and the expansion of semi-military
cooperation with Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Lee Wen-chung of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
said at a ceremony marking the launch of the book that China will
invade Taiwan only if the island declares independence, or when
Beijing believes it is able to take over Taiwan before other
countries can come to the island's defense.</P>
      <P>He echoed the book's recommendation for the establishment of
special warfare forces capable of defending the capital for at least
two weeks to provide time for foreign military assistance to arrive.</P>
      <P>The book, published by the Cross-Strait Interflow Prospect
Foundation, a private non-partisan research organization, was
compiled by a team led by Ting Yu-chou, former secretary-general of
the National Security Council, and Chang Jung-feng, former deputy

Equipment plundered from dozens of sites in Saddam Hussein's vast

stormed the sites two years ago when Hussein's government fell, and
the fate of much of the equipment has remained a mytery. But on a
recent day near the Iranian border, resting in in great chunks on a
weedy lot in front of an Iraqi Iraqi Border Patrol warehouse, were
pieces of machine tools, some weighing as much as a car, that
investigators say formed the heart of a factory that made artillery
shells near Baghdad. Military equipment, including parts for obscure
armaments used by Hussein's army, is also turning up in Baghdad and

      <P>Taiwan should stay clear of the ongoing
strife between China and Japan, a group of former security officials
said unanimously Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ting Yu-chou, a former secretary-general of the National Security

not to mention not having the capability to interfere.</P>
      <P>Anti-Japanese demonstrations have taken place in several cities

some 100,000 protestors in Shanghai over the weekend should represent
the climax of the anti-Japanese rallies which he predicted will begin

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan called for peaceful exchanges between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait in a speech he delivered Sunday at the Lee Kuan Yew
School of Public Policy in Singapore, according to a news release
issued by the KMT headquarters.</P>
      <P>Peace and security in the Taiwan Strait area is an issue of
common concern to all people around the world, while the pursuit of a
better quality of life and living environment is a common aspiration
of the people on both sides of the strait, Lien stressed.</P>
      <P>Referring to the KMT position on the cross-strait issue, Lien
said that his party is opposed to Taiwan independence, to "one
country on each side of the Taiwan Strait" rhetoric, and to the "one
country, two systems" formula initiated by Beijing.</P>
      <P>"I'm opposed to everything that jeopardizes the cross-strait
peace," the main opposition party leader emphasized.</P>
      <P>He also criticized the government led by the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) for Taiwan's poor economic performance, which
he attributed to the DPP's populist leadership.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic success during the period of KMT rule of more
than 50 years was achieved by a universal education system, correct
policies, efficient government leadership, and the people's hard

      <P>In view of the sharp year-on-year slide in
Taiwan's trade surplus witnessed in the first quarter of this year,
the government is poised to help Taiwan companies increase their
exports through market exploration and the inking of free trade
agreements (FTAs) with friendly countries.</P>
      <P>Chen Ruey-long, vice minister of economic affairs, said that
exploring new markets is very important to help domestic companies
boost exports at a time when the global economy is widely forecast to
cool off and when the country's Q1 trade surplus contracted by 85
percent over the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Although the trade surplus decline was in large part due to a
sharp increase in imports, Chen said that the time has come for the
government to thoroughly examine Taiwan's export outlets and help
Taiwan firms edge into new markets as a means of increasing outbound
shipments.</P>
      <P>In cooperation with the semi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA), the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
has set its sights on Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Japan,
Russia, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, where it hopes to help
seize a large market share for Taiwan products, Chen said.</P>
      <P>A task force has also been set up in the hopes of helping curb
Taiwan's mounting trade deficits with Japan and South Korea, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that Taiwan's dwindling export sector may be partly
due to Taiwan companies' massive relocation overseas, the vice
minister said that the MOEA has swung into full gear in moving to
sign FTAs with friendly countries, such as those in Central and South
America.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan companies are good at market deployment across the
world, they will still be strong in foreign markets despite the fact
that their exports from Taiwan fall, Chen said.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Secretary-General Chao Yung-chuan said that the TAITRA,
Taiwan's leading non-profit trade promotion body, is planning to open
10 footholds offshore to help encourage domestic businesses to boost
exports through investment abroad via a more comprehensive and
effective network.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LIEN HAS YET TO EXPLAIN WHAT HE'S UP TO IN CHINA: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 17 (CNA)
(BY S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The president is pleased to see opposition
leader Lien Chan make a successful visit to China but Lien has yet to
explain to the people on Taiwan what he's up to while there, a
presidential spokesman said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's planned visit to China has
become Taiwan's top political story, with Taipei City Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou, who's eyeing Lien's post, joining the fray by saying the
ruling camp should be happy to see Lien possibly bringing peace back
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>An opposition party leader cannot possibly sell out Taiwan,
something only the ruling party is capable of, because opposition
parties do not have any public authority -- what they have is only "a
mouth," Ma said.</P>
      <P>If Lien can bring home a chance for peace across the Taiwan
Strait, President Chen Shui-bian of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party should feel happy about continuing the work by realizing the
chance, and should not have accused the KMT of possibly losing Taiwan
again, Ma added.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsung, director-general of the Department of Public
Affairs at the Presidential Office, countered Ma by stressing that
President Chen Shui-bian indeed would like to see Lien succeed in
making the visit and has publicly suggested talking with Lien over
the phone before he embarks on the trip, scheduled for later this
month or early next.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Chen Wen-tsung pointed out, the president also
repeated the government's position that anything involving public
authority or national sovereignty must have government authorization.
"This is the president's responsibility to all the people as head of
government," he emphasized.</P>
      <P>As the leader of the country, the president is responsible for
guarding national sovereignty, maintaining Taiwan's security and
protecting people's well-being, said the spokesman.</P>
      <P>In light of this, Lien should explain to the people on Taiwan
what subjects he's going to discuss with Chinese leaders in Beijing,
but as of now, "we only know from media reports that he may be
talking about a peace treaty between the two sides of the strait or
an armistice between the KMT and the Chinese Communist Party," Chen
said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, President Chen's willingness to make a
telephone call to Lien to discuss these serious national issues is
a clear indication of the president's sense of responsibility as the
national leader.</P>

      <P>A press secretary for Singaporean Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong confirmed Monday that the prime minister and
his father, Minister Mentor Lee Kwan Yew, met with Taiwan's
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan Sunday.</P>
      <P>The two Lees met with Lien at a luncheon after the latter
delivered a speech at the Lee Kwan Yew School of Public Policy in the
city-state, the secretary said, adding that it was "a meeting among
old friends."</P>
      <P>Media reports have said that Lien might discuss an "eventual
peace plan" between Taiwan and China in an expected meeting with
Chinese President Hu Jintao during his visit to China at the end of

      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong is likely to visit China in the near future at
the invitation of Communist Party of China (CPC) General Secretary Hu
Jintao, a PFP legislative whip said Monday.</P>
      <P>Lee Yong-ping quoted a Xinhua News Agency report as indicating
that Chen Yunlin, head of the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's
State Council, had been authorized by Hu, who is also concurrently
mainland Chinese president, to publicly announce an invitation to
Soong for a visit to the mainland.</P>
      <P>"Chairman Soong has been welcomed to lead a PFP delegation to
visit China," Chen was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>On this development, Lee said that as an opposition leader in
Taiwan, Soong has always advocated rational and peaceful means to
resolve cross-Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>The PFP legislative caucus welcomes the invitation extended by
the top CPC official, Lee said. It is believed that Soong will accept
the invitation and visit Beijing at the most opportune time,
launching an "ice-breaking" trip for cross-strait relations, she
added.</P>
      <P>According to a PFP official who wished to remain anonymous, Soong
will probably visit China in early May.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Fong-cheng, secretary-general of the opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) , departed Taipei for Beijing Monday to line up the
much-anticipated visit to China by KMT Chairman Lien Chan.</P>
      <P>KMT spokesman Chang Jung-kung, who was accompanying Lin, said
prior to departure that they will meet with officials from the Taiwan
Affairs Office under Beijing's State Council for talks on the dates
and agenda of Lien's forthcoming visit to China.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP -- a KMT splinter party -- formed the
"pan-blue alliance" several years ago. The Lien-Soong ticket
challenged President Chen Shui-bian in the 2004 presidential
election, losing by a razor-thin margin.</P>

      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh reiterated the
government's stance Monday on opposition political heavyweights'
China travel plans, saying that if their visits touch on issues
involving the exercise of public authority, they should obtain prior
government authorization</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the statement after opposition Kuomintang
Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng departed for Beijing earlier in the
day to flesh out KMT Chairman Lien Chan's planned China visit and a
senior Beijing official extended a public invitation on behalf of
Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Hu Jintao to another Taiwan
opposition leader, People First Party Chairman James Soong, to visit
China.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, a lawyer-turned politician, said opposition political
heavyweights' China visits can be addressed from three perspectives
-- legality, political ethics and personal freedom.</P>
      <P>From the legal perspective, Hsieh said, opposition leaders must
furnish the government with a prior report or obtain the government's
prior authorization if their China visits will touch on issues
involving the exercise of public authority. Otherwise, he added, they
may break existing laws, and any agreement they reach would be
invalid.</P>
      <P>From the political ethics perspective, Hsieh went on, it's up to
the opposition heavyweights themselves to decide whether they will
inform President Chen Shui-bian or relevant government authorities
prior to their departure for China.</P>
      <P>If opposition leaders' China visits are purely for sightseeing
and don't touch on any policy issues, Hsieh said, then the government
fully respects their freedom of travel.</P>

Party of China (CPC) General Secretary Hu Jintao, will indeed occur.</P>
      <P>Lai reminded Lien to make sure that he does not break Taiwan law

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  18  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
suggested Monday that People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong
hold a second meeting with President Chen Shui-bian to get government
authorization before he visits mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, a whip of the TSU at the Legislative Yuan, said the
move would enable Soong to "start talks with the Chinese side with
government authorization on behalf of Taiwan's 23 million people."</P>
      <P>The TSU is opposed to visits by political party leaders to China
without government authorization because such visits, although made
in the visitors' private capacities, will erode Taiwan's sovereignty
and indirectly hinder the president's legal status as head of state,
he claimed.</P>
      <P>Chen and Soong met on Feb. 24 and clinched a 10-point agreement
pledging to maintain the national title of the Republic of China and
not to declare Taiwan independence, in a concerted move to mitigate
tensions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Ho Min-hao called on political party leaders to
think twice before they prepare to go to China and urged the
government to deal with any visits that undermine the country's
sovereignty and interests.</P>
      <P>The TSU lawmakers' comments came after China's Xinhua News Agency
reported earlier the same day that Hu Jintao, general secretary of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) who is also the Chinese president,
issued a formal invitation to Soong to visit.</P>
      <P>According to a ranking PFP official, Soong accepted the
invitation and will most likely go to China in early May.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan is
also slated to pay a visit to China in late April or early May.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng left for China earlier
Monday to arrange for Lien's upcoming visit. Lien is scheduled to
visit Xian, Shanghai, Nanjing and Beijing and meet Hu -- a historic
first between the leaders of the two parties in more than 60 years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SOONG'S STATUS AS NEGOTIATOR IN CHINA UNCLEAR FOR NOW: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>It is unclear whether People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong will seek or be granted government
approval to negotiate with Chinese President Hu Jintao ahead of his
proposed trip, a local scholar said Monday.</P>
      <P>Noting that Soong formally accepted an invitation from Hu, who is
also general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, to visit
China, Huang Chieh-cheng, director of the Graduate Institute of
American Studies at Tamkang University, said how the government
perceives Soong's China visit and how it will affect the
relationships among Taiwan's major political parties are two things
that merit close observation.</P>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the ROC's largest opposition party, the
Kuomintang (KMT) , has also been invited to visit China. KMT
Secretary- General Lin Fong-cheng left for Beijing Monday to finalize
Lien's schedule.</P>
      <P>While Lien has refused to consult with President Chen Shui-bian
prior to traveling to China, Soong very likely will do more than just
talk with the president over the phone about his upcoming visit,
which is expected to take place in early May, Huang said.</P>
      <P>What subjects Soong will raise with his Chinese hosts, and
whether President Chen will authorize him to discuss them in the name
of the ROC government, are issues that remain open, Huang added.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, what will happen to the "pan-blue alliance," of the
KMT, the PFP and the New Party, and whether relations between the PFP
and Chen's Democratic Progressive Party will undergo a substantive
change, are also worth watching, he said.</P>
      <P>He emphasized that what is certain is that Beijing has extended
its hands into Taiwan politics. Beijing is playing the Asian style of
chess called "go, " not the traditional Chinese style called
"hsiangchi, " against Taiwan, so it must respond with caution, he
said.</P>
      <P>Many consider "go" a game requiring more strategy in close
quarters and one that can be lost by a single poorly executed move.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that currently Beijing is adopting a multi-pronged
strategy toward Taiwan, characterized by "initiative, flexibility and
a clearly defined line in the sand, " targeting Taiwan's opposition
party leaders, business people and farmers, among others.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Su Tseng-chang urged opposition political heavyweights
Monday to refrain from scrambling to visit China.</P>
      <P>Su made the call after opposition Kuomintang Secretary-General
Lin Feng-cheng departed for Beijing earlier in the day to organize
KMT Chairman Lien Chan's planned China visit and a senior Beijing
official extended a public invitation on behalf of Chinese Communist
Party General Secretary Hu Jintao to another Taiwan opposition
leader, People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, to visit
China.</P>
      <P>In his view, Su said top leaders of domestic political parties
should not scramble to visit China for partisan interests and should
instead give top priority to national interests and the common
wellbeing of all the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>If opposition leaders insist on visiting China, Su said, they
should respect the nation's law and keep in mind that a national
consensus is needed to address any issue involving popular interests.</P>
      <P>Asked whether a meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and PFP
Chairman Soong is needed before Soong's departure for China, Su said
it's not suitable for him to make any comment on this question before
Soong's decision becomes clear.</P>
      <P>As a ruling party, Su said, the DPP is more than willing to
engage and communicate with all other domestic political parties.</P>
      <P>After the Feb. 24 Chen-Soong meeting, Su said, the DPP and the
PFP have been on friendly terms.</P>
      <P>During their first meeting in February, Chen and Soong reached a
10-point consensus on the development of relations across the Taiwan
Strait and domestic constitutional reforms, including that the
nation's name -- the Republic of China -- will not be subject to any
changes in constitutional reform.</P>

      <P>Wu made the remarks while attending an APEC operations seminar

Taiwan has to keep abreast of the latest APEC developments and work

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is hosting a three-day
international academic workshop on HIV/AIDS prevention in the capital
city of Malawi, a long-standing Republic of China diplomatic ally in
southeast Africa, the Department of Health (DOH) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>The international AIDS workshop in Lilongwe is part of Taiwan's
accelerated efforts to help combat AIDS in Malawi, which has one of
the highest HIV infection rates in the world.</P>
      <P>According to a United Nations report, HIV/AIDS causes 50,000 to
70,000 deaths each year. The disease has created some 500,000 orphans
in Malawi since the first case was noted in 1984, and the number of
orphans is increasing by nearly 60,000 on a year-on-year basis.</P>
      <P>Taiwan began to funnel funds, resources and manpower into Malawi
in 1998 to help arrest the spread of HIV/AIDS. Over the years, Taiwan
medical missions have traveled to the country and built the Central
HIV/AIDS Hospital in Malawi's northern city of Mzuzu.</P>
      <P>As of January this year, the Central Hospital -- so far the only
AIDS hospital in Malawi offering all diagnoses and treatments for
free -- has treated over 1,200 AIDS patients and an average of 200
new cases have been referred to the hospital in recent months, DOH
officials reported.</P>
      <P>At the outpatient section of the Central Hospital, the Taiwan
medical service team is combining technology and medication. The
patient's treatment history as well as medication archive is recorded
and managed electronically after his or her fingerprint has been
keyed in during the patient's first visit to the hospital, according
to DOH officials.</P>
      <P>The story of Taiwan's medical teams operating in Malawi - jointly
authored by team leader Yu-Kuang Liao-liang and DOH ambassador in
Africa, Chen Chih-cheng -- is scheduled to be published soon in the
Lancet, an influential British medical journal, the officials said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan will
do his best to forge a consensus on building peace across the Taiwan
Strait during his upcoming visit to mainland China, but will not ink
any peace accords with the Chinese side, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
said Monday.</P>
      <P>Ma said that he strongly believes that Lien will not sign any
peace agreements with Communist Party of China (CPC) General
Secretary Hu Jintao during his upcoming China visit, since doing so
would first need government approval and the opposition camp can only
play the role of "pioneer."</P>
      <P>Stressing that Lien's visit is aimed at maintaining peace between
Taiwan and China, Ma said that Lien will speak for the people on
Taiwan while seeking to help lay a foundation for cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>The Taipei mayor is one of the five vice chairmen of the main
opposition KMT.</P>
      <P>Lien's planned China visit, in late April or early May, will mark
the first KMT-CPC contact in more than 60 years. The KMT chairman is
slated to meet Hu in Beijing, in addition to making stops in Nanjing,
Xian and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the legislative caucus of the Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) lashed out strongly at Lien's China trip as an apparent attempt
to challenge the nation's law and undermine Taiwan's sovereignty by
seeking to ink a peace pact with China without government approval.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, a TSU whip at the Legislative Yuan, questioned
whether Lien thinks that now is an appropriate time to visit China
when it still deploys more than 700 missiles targeting Taiwan and has
adopted an Anti-Secession Law to deal with Taiwan using "non-peaceful
means."</P>
      <P>Lo asked Lien to first return the preferential subsidies and stop
receiving the special security privilege granted by the government to
him due to his status as a former vice president before he travels to
China. He also demanded the government strictly handle Lien's China
visit in accordance with the nation's laws.</P>
      <P>TSU lawmaker Ho Min-hao urged Lien not to make the trip to China
to avoid becoming a "culprit of Taiwan."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing is inviting James Soong, chairman
of the opposition People First Party, to visit partly to induce a
change in the cross-Taiwan Strait atmosphere soured by China's
enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, a China analyst said Monday.</P>
      <P>Professor Byron Weng of National Chi Nan University also sees the
Chinese move as an attempt to lure those in Taiwan favoring
unification with China into cooperating with the Chinese regime.</P>
      <P>Beijing is finalizing a schedule for Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan to visit China. Since Soong had expressed interest in visiting,
it would be reasonable for Chinese President Hu Jintao to invite
Soong, too, Weng said.</P>
      <P>Although Soong had earlier reached a 10-point consensus with
President Chen Shui-bian, it would be "hardly imaginable" that Hu is
trying to use the Soong visit to convey some kind of message to Chen,
Weng said.</P>
      <P>He noted that Chinese leaders have explicitly laid out the
conditions for meeting with Chen: he must accept Beijing's "one
China" principle, and his Democratic Progressive Party must give up
its pro-independence platform.</P>
      <P>If Beijing indeed is trying to make an overture to Chen, then
Soong would just be "a tool, " which he is quite unlikely to allow
himself to be, the scholar said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Chen could not possibly ask Soong to speak for
him while meeting with Hu. Soong at best can act as a certain
"channel of contact," Weng said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong Kong,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Mandy Wong and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Lien Chan will ask Chinese authorities during his upcoming visit to
China to remove its missiles aimed at Taiwan, a lawmaker from
Taiwan's opposition party said in Hong Kong Monday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Wu Den-yih, who is also a member of the KMT's
decision-making Central Standing Committee, made the remarks after
attending a forum on relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Wu said Lien will bring up four
main topics during his China trip, tentatively scheduled for early
May.</P>
      <P>First of all, Wu said, Lien will ask mainland authorities to
eliminate barriers to cross-strait cultural and commercial exchanges,
such as exempting or reducing import tariffs on agricultural and
industrial goods from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Second, Wu said, Lien will urge China not to block Taiwan's entry
to the World Health Organization (WHO).</P>
      <P>"For the sake of epidemic prevention, Taiwan must be included in
the WHO-led global health care system. If China continues to block
Taiwan's WHO bid, it will draw a backlash from the Taiwan people and
hinder the development of cross-strait rapprochement," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Third, Wu said, Lien will push China to relocate the hundreds of
ballistic missiles deployed in the southeastern mainland province of
Fujian that target Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If China indeed wants to make peace with Taiwan, it should
relocate or dismantle its missiles aimed at Taiwan. Otherwise, the
people of Taiwan will have ill feelings and doubts about Beijing's
sincerity, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wu went on, Lien will ask mainland authorities to allow
mainland citizens to make sightseeing trips to Taiwan to promote
civilian exchanges and mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Wu said he is cautiously optimistic about the outcome of Lien's
forthcoming China trip. Lien will be the first KMT chairman to visit
the mainland since the party, which had ruled all of China before
retreating to Taiwan in 1949 after loosing a bloody civil to the
Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Wu further said the KMT is willing to do whatever is conducive to
Taiwan people's well-being and cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Wu delivered a speech on new developments in cross-strait
relations at the seminar, sponsored by a federation of Taiwan
business associations in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Addressing hundreds of Hong Kong scholars, experts and business
executives presen at the seminar, Wu said Hong Kong should strengthen
exchanges with Taiwan to maintain its pivotal role in cross-strait
engagements.</P>
      <P>Wu also said he believes that Taiwan, Hong Kong and Shanghai can
strengthen cooperation in transshipment, trade, industrial investment
and tourist development.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CBC OPTS FOR AVOIDING INFLATION AMID SLOWING ECONOMY: PUNDITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The central bank will opt for easing
inflationary pressure as its top priority amid a slowing domestic
economy that has been reflected in a sharp slide in Taiwan's trade
surplus for the first quarter of this year, economists said Monday.</P>
      <P>Citibank Taiwan Vice President Cheng Cheng-mount said that the
Taipei-based Central Bank of China (CBC) will choose to stem rising
domestic consumer product prices as its chief task by gradually
raising key interest rates, even though the economy has shown signs
of cooling.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the forecast on the grounds that Taiwan's economy is
still growing at a moderate pace and that the CBC's main mission is
to maintain stable consumer product prices rather than stimulating
economic growth.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the large decrease in trade surplus should be
just a short-term phenomenon owing to increased imports of machinery
equipment and construction materials and rising prices for oil,
energy and raw materials, the economist said Taiwan will not suffer a
trade deficit over the long term thanks to its relatively high
savings rate.</P>
      <P>However, he claimed that inflationary pressure is under control
in Taiwan and predicted that the CBC, following in the footsteps of
the U.S. Federal Reserve, will increase key interest rates by a
one-eighth percentage point by the end of June.</P>
      <P>A government official echoed Cheng's view by making it clear that
the prime mission of the central bank is to stabilize consumer
product prices despite the fact that Taiwan's economy has slowed.</P>
      <P>Singling out the sharp decline in the Q1 trade surplus -- down by
85 percent at US$290 million compared to the previous year's level --
he also contended that the CBC will make the rate hikes in late June.</P>
      <P>Wu Chung-shu, an economic researcher at Academia Sinica, called
on the government not to overreact to the trade surplus shrinkage, as
booming imports are an indication that domestic demand and investment
have not subsided.</P>
      <P>He said he also expects the CBC to lift interest rates in a
piecemeal fashion so as to reduce the gap with the U.S. levels.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing, April 18 (CNA)
(By Chen-yi Liao and  S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese and Japanese officials refused to
budge Monday on their respective demands that the other side
apologize first before actions can be taken to improve their frozen
ties.</P>
      <P>Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing and his Japanese counterpart
Nobutaka Machimura failed to break the ice as each asked the other to
apologize for a series of incidents leading to their hurriedly
arranged meeting in Beijing Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hatsuhisa Takashima, spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry, told
reporters Sunday that violence in recent anti-Japanese demonstrations
has affected exchanges between the two countries and Machimura
demanded that the Chinese government stop similar things from
happening again.</P>
      <P>Japan demanded that China apologize for allowing protesters to
vandalize Japanese diplomatic missions and businesses during three
consecutive weekends of demonstrations in several cities across
China.</P>
      <P>Only when China promises to beef up security measures for
Japanese diplomats and civilians in China can bilateral relations
return to normal and friendship between the two peoples be promoted,
Takashima said.</P>
      <P>On Monday, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Wu Dawei said Japan
should apologize first for whitewashing its wartime atrocities in
history textbooks and for paying respects to war criminals at the
Yasukuni shrine before China will apologize for the anti-Japanese
protests.</P>
      <P>Wu was lukewarm toward Japan's proposal for a summit meeting
between Japan's prime minister and China's president in Indonesia
during a conference of Asian and African leaders later this month,
saying only that "the Japanese have made such a request and we will
consider it."</P>
      <P>When Li met with Machimura Sunday, he told his guest: "The
Chinese government has never done anything for which it has to
apologize to the Japanese people, " adding that the main problem "is
that the Japanese government has done a series of things that have
hurt the feelings of the Chinese people."</P>
      <P>Li cited "the Taiwan issue, " referring to a recent policy
declaration by Japan that gave the impression it would join the
United States in defending the country in case of an attack by China.</P>
      <P>Machimura pressed Li on what he described as "violence toward
embassy activities and also toward Japanese people in China." He
repeated demands for an official apology, compensation for damages
and better security around Japanese institutions.</P>
      <P>Machimura said Japan's policies on Taiwan have not changed and
emphasized that his government had already expressed "remorse, regret
and apology" several times for its wartime past.</P>
      <P>"We are not opposed to demonstrations, even if the demonstrations
are anti-Japanese demonstrations, because we highly appreciate
freedom of expression... as long as it remains peaceful, " Takashima
said.</P>
      <P>The frosty to-and-fros between the two countries, particularly
when Li and Machimura refused to shake hands with each other, have
led Hong Kong media to conclude that bilateral relations have plunged
to an all-time low since the establishment of diplomatic ties in
1972.</P>
      <P>Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at the Renmin
University of China, told Hong Kong's Apple Daily that the two
governments will not easily change their positions with regard to
such issues as Taiwan, territorial disputes in the East China Sea,
history textbooks, and civilian protests.</P>
      <P>In the short term, Shi said there will be a lot of twists and
turns before Chinese-Japanese relations will return to normal.
However, he claimed that the Chinese government has the will and
determination to stop bilateral ties from worsening.</P>

After last week's market plunge - when America's three main stock

this week to see how optimistic corporate America is in its outlook
for the economy. But early earnings warnings from companies like

    <HEADLINE>PFP, KMT CHAIRMEN'S VISITS TO CHINA DIFFERENT: DPP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visit by opposition People First Party
(PFP) Chairman James Soong to China will be different from that of
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, a ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary General Lee Yi-yang was responding to news that the
PFP had accepted an invitation from Chinese Communist Party
Secretary General Hu Jintao for Soong to visit China.</P>
      <P>Lee said that in the wake of Beijing's adoption of an
anti-secession law targeting Taiwan, which has resulted in world
condemnation as well as Taiwan people taking to the streets, "the
timing is not right for opposition leaders to scramble to visit
China."</P>
      <P>But he said Soong's visit will be different from Lien's in that
Soong will be going with a 10-point consensus, including no change of
the official name of the nation and no change to the status quo in
the Taiwan Strait, reached with President Chen Shui-bian during a
meeting Feb. 24.</P>
      <P>Lee claimed that the consensus has national consensus and is one
on which the DPP and PFP share the most common ground.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Chen hopes to invite party leaders to a
meeting but that Lien has adamantly refused and has not sought
national consensus.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he said, Lien will be going on behalf of the KMT,
which accepts a so-called "1992 consensus" which, according to Lee,
means that there is but one China of which China is a part --
Beijing's interpretation of the consensus.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Lee said the 10-point consensus has no "92
consensus" but instead points out the sovereign, independent status
of the Republic of China, which is starkly different from the KMT's
interpretation of the "92 consensus," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed worry Lien's visit to China will be detrimental to
Taiwan's sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a DPP legislator said Lien's talks in China should not
encroach upon government authority.</P>
      <P>William Lai, DPP caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, was
responding to remarks earlier in the day by KMT Legislator Wu Den-yih
at a Hong Kong seminar.</P>
      <P>Wu said that during Lien's trip in early May, he will talk with
Beijing on a wide range of issues, including Taiwan's bid to join the
World Health Organization, China's missiles targeting Taiwan and
opening Taiwan to tourists from China, as well as the removal of
barriers to cross-strait cultural exchanges and trade.</P>
      <P>All these issues involve government authority and require
national consensus, Lai said, pointing out that two-time presidential
election loser Lien has no right to act on the nation's behalf.</P>
      <P>"Lien should not seek his own legacy in history and fall into
China's trap," Lai said.</P>

      <P>The seven state-run enterprises under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) had accumulated combined profits
of NT$8.7 billion (US$254.63 million) in the first three months of
this year, according to statistics issued Monday by the MOEA.</P>
      <P>All seven companies made profits except for the Taiwan Power
Company and the Aerospace Industrial Development Corp. (AIDC).</P>
      <P>Among the profit-makers, Chinese Petroleum Corp. led the pack
with pre-tax profits of NT$8.02 billion (US$253.05 million), which is
62.76 percent of the whole-year profit forecast.</P>
      <P>Following far behind was the Tang Eng Iron Works Co., Ltd. which
posted pre-tax profits of NT$529 million, or 75.57 percent of its
target profit for the whole year, and Taiwan Water Supply Corp., with
NT$269 million, Taiwan Sugar Corp., with NT$154 million, and China
Shipbuilding Corp., with NT$101 million.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan Sugar Corp. and Taiwan Water Supply Corp., their
performances are quite remarkable in light of the fact that they used
to be loss-makers. Taipower post a loss of NT$77 million because of
the sharp rise of international oil prices, but this took place in
January and the company has seen profits since February because of
the smaller-than-expected rise in the price of coal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT OPEN TO 2ND MEETING WITH PFP CHAIRMAN: SPOKESMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is open to a
proposal that he meet a second time with opposition People First
Party (PFP) James Soong prior to Soong's visit to China, a
Presidential Office spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-chung, director of the Presidential Office's public
affairs department, made the remarks after a senior Beijing official
extended a public invitation to Soong on behalf of Chinese President
Hu Jintao earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>"The Presidential Office's stance on visits to China by
opposition political leaders is crystal clear. We have no particular
opinion about party-to-party exchanges across the Taiwan Strait if no
public policy issues are involved in those engagements, " said Chen
Wen-chung.</P>
      <P>However, he added that if opposition political leaders want to
sign accords with China on issues involving national sovereignty or
the exercise of public authority, they must obtain the government's
prior authorization. "Only by so doing can we safeguard our national
interests and the common well-being of our people, " he stressed.</P>
      <P>According to Chen Wen-chung, Presidential Office
Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun talked with PFP Secretary-General Chin
Chin-sheng earlier that day.</P>
      <P>Chin was quoted as having told Yu that Soong will mention the
10-point consensus reached during a Feb. 24 Chen-Soong meeting in his
talks with Hu.</P>
      <P>Noting that the 10-point consensus embodies the bedrock of the
government's cross-strait policy, Chen Wen-chung said that if Soong
upholds the 10-point consensus, his talks with Hu will not go beyond
the government's basic policy line.</P>
      <P>As to whether a second Chen-Soong meeting can be held prior to
Soong's China trip, planned for the first half of May, Chen Wen-chung
said that so long as Soong thinks it is necessary, the Presidential
Office will be more than willing to line up such a rendezvous.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Joseph Wu said he
hopes Soong can meet with the president before departing for China.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the nation's top mainland policy planner said he hopes
Soong will abide by the law and give top priority to national
interests during his trip.</P>
      <P>China's official Xinhua news agency said Monday that Hu had
invited Soong to lead a PFP delegation to China. Hu issued the
invitation in his capacity as Communist Party chief.</P>
      <P>The invitation came as another opposition leader, Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan, prepared to embark on what the KMT is calling a
"journey of peace" to China in late April or early May.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the PFP, known locally as the "pan-blue alliance, "
both favor eventual unification with a democratic China, while the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) insists that Taiwan's
future -- independence or unification -- should be decided by the
country's 23 million people.</P>
      <P>Earlier Monday, KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng left for
Beijing to flesh out details of Lien's planned trip with China's
Taiwan Affairs Office.</P>
      <P>The DPP administration has expressed concerns about the flurry of
exchanges between opposition parties and China, urging delegations to
consult the government before going.</P>
      <P>The desire by opposition parties to wrest control of cross-strait
relations from the DPP administration has given Beijing an
opportunity to further its divide-and-conquer strategy by courting
Chen's opponents and weakening his hand, analysts said.</P>
      <P>"Beijing's strategy towards Taiwan is to divide the various
groups and use a carrot and stick method to deal with each, " said
Andy Chang, a China watcher at Tamkang University.</P>
      <P>"The aim is to cause division and confrontation within Taiwan, "

    <HEADLINE>U.S. WRITER COMPARES CHINA'S SELECTIVE MEMORY WITH THAT OF JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April  18 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin/S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As China's anti-Japanese protests
generated widespread attention, an American columnist questioned
Monday China's own "selective memory" on major historical events and
found it unable to stand the test of its own requirements for the
Japanese.</P>
      <P>Writing for the Washington Post, Fred Hiatt suggested China do
the same thing it demanded of Japan: "Face up to history squarely."</P>
      <P>He reminded readers that in Japan, issues of war guilt or
innocence, and of proper historiography, are debated endlessly and
openly in Japanese newspapers, magazines and universities.</P>
      <P>Some Japanese demonstrate against politicians who refuse to go to
the Yasukuni Shrine -- where Japan's war dead, including some who
were executed as war criminals, are honored -- while other Japanese
demonstrate against politicians who do go, he said.</P>
      <P>Compare this to the situation in China, where there is only one
acceptable version of history, at least at any given time; history
often changes, but only when the Communist Party decides to change
it, he pointed out.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, according to a report by Howard W. French
carried in the New York Times last December, many textbooks do not
mention that anyone died in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. One
1998 text notes only that "the Central Committee took action in time
and restored calm." Anyone who challenges the official fiction is
subject to harsh punishment, including beatings, house arrest or
imprisonment.</P>
      <P>And if the 300,000 victims of the Nanjing Massacre are slighted
in some Japanese textbooks, what of the 30 million Chinese who died
in famines created by Mao Zedong's lunatic Great Leap Forward between
1958 and 1962? No mention in Chinese texts, according to Hiatt.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that as the Times found in its review of
textbooks, Chinese children do not learn of their nation's invasion
of Tibet (1950) or aggression against Vietnam (1979).</P>
      <P>"Facing up to history squarely" isn't easy for any country.
Americans do not agree on how to remember the Confederacy. Russia
cannot yet admit to Soviet depredations in the Baltic republics and
Japan often sees itself purely as a victim of World War II, he said.</P>
      <P>But in countries that permit open debate, historical
interpretations can be constantly challenged, revised and maybe
brought closer to the truth. In dictatorships that use history as one
more tool to maintain power, there is no such hope, Hiatt said.</P>
      <P>China's communists used to find it useful to vilify Russia in
their history texts. These days, for reasons of China's aspirations
to lead Asia, Japan makes a more convenient villain. Next year might
be America's turn. The reasons may be complex, but none of them has
much to do with facing history squarely, he concluded.</P>

pitch for "ethnic symbiosis" of different ethnic groups Monday.</P>
      <P>After visiting the 228 Memorial Hall in Taipei, Hsieh said the
different ethnic groups in Taiwan should learn to live together by
understanding each others' historical backgrounds.</P>
      <P>Political symbiosis is already difficult enough, but the
symbiosis of various ethnic groups, which he described as a kind of
"hetero-symbiosis" because of the different backgrounds of various
ethnic groups, is even more difficult, he said.</P>
      <P>He urged each group to feel empathy with each other, starting
from learning and accepting the island's history, of which the 228

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior (MOI) has
stepped up preparations for new identification (ID) card replacements
in order to minimize inconvenience for local citizens, Minister of
the Interior Su Jia-chyuan said Monday.</P>
      <P>The ministry is scheduled to replace existing ID cards with a new
forgery-proof version from July 1 this year. The entire process is
scheduled to be carried out by June 30, 2006.</P>
      <P>Su said the ministry will arrange for local photo studios to
offer photography services at household registration offices. He
added that the service charge will not exceed NT$150 per person.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the minister went on, the government will cover the
photo costs for people from low-income families. Home delivery
services will be offered for those suffering from serious disease or
those who are otherwise incapacitated, he added.</P>
      <P>Su said the MOI is negotiating with local photo studio
associations to prevent their members from rigging market prices
during the ID card renewal period.</P>
      <P>"We'll also craft a detailed service mechanism to ensure that
local people can receive their ID cards within 30 minutes of having
their mug shots taken at the household registration offices, " Su
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO ALLOW TWO CHINA MEDIA TO RETURN IF BEIJING REFORMS PRESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 18 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As long as China displays a determination
to pursue press reforms, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) will
allow two banned major news media to station reporters in Taiwan, MAC
official said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials' remarks came after Reporters Without Borders
expressed concern about a temporary ban on Xinhua news agency and the
People's Daily from posting journalists in the country.</P>
      <P>The officials said the government temporarily banned the two
media outlets because they had no respect for journalistic
professionalism. China can no longer use its government mouthpiece to
distort news reporting from Taiwan, and the damage in the wake of
Beijing's passage of an anti-secession law March 14 will also not be
artificially widened, they claimed.</P>
      <P>The officials said that as long as Beijing demonstrates its
sincerity and determination to pursue press reforms, removes its
blockade of the Internet versions of Taiwan's United Daily News and
China Times, and does not deter its newspapers from sending
journalists to Taiwan, the MAC is willing to reconsider permitting
Xinhua and People's Daily to post staff to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MAC is planning to invite two other Chinese
newspapers -- Guangdong's Nan Fang daily and Shanghai's Diyi Caijing
daily -- to post staff in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MAC has inquired about their willingness to post reporters in
Taiwan "so that they can experience first hand Taiwan's respect for
press freedom and its professionalism."</P>

impartially.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the statement said, if China believes Taiwan's
decision is atravesty of press freedom, than Beijing should practice
what it preaches by giving Taiwan correspondents posted to China a
free rein in covering stories in China rather than corralling them
with restrictions.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China is the common asset
of the 23 million people in Taiwan, and the People's Republic of
China's recognition of this nation is extremely important to
cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Legislative Yuan Speaker Wang Jin-pyng
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Beijing's doing so would have a profound and
far-reaching influence on bilateral ties, Wang called on the Taiwan
people to treasure this nation, adding that this is his long-term
stance regarding the ROC-PRC relationship.</P>
      <P>Wang's comments came after a media report that Jia Qinglin,
chairman of the National Committee under the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, mentioned the ROC as Taiwan's
official title during a meeting with visiting Kuomintang (KMT) Vice
Chairman P.K. Chiang on March 31 in Beijing.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that a ranking Communist Party of China
(CPC) official mentioned Taiwan by using its official designation
amid along-standing hostility between the two sides of the strait,
which has recently escalated following Beijing's enactment in
mid-March of its Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The legislative speaker also called on the government to provide
adequate information regarding the PRC to opposition KMT Chairman
Lien Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong before
they go to China for visits, claiming that this would be ideal in
helping them make greater efforts for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wang said he strongly believes that both Lien and Soong will do
their best to seek the maximum benefits for Taiwan based on the
overall interests and security for the country during their

      <P>A leading German newspaper on Monday urged
European countries to pay proper heed to the increasing tensions
between China and Japan and not to sell weapons to China.</P>
      <P>In an editorial Monday on the current dispute between the two
Asian countries, the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" newspaper said
that the Beijing leaders' criticism of Japan for failing to undertake
soul-searching for its wartime atrocities represents China's attempt
to demonstrate its strength as a rising power.</P>
      <P>As many people consider the apologies made by Japanese leaders
for their country's wartime atrocities as not being sincere, Beijing
feels certain no neighboring countries will support Japan in the
Sino-Japanese dispute, according to the editorial.</P>
      <P>Although the attitude of those Asian countries which had been
occupied by Japan during World War II is understandable, the European
Union's silence regarding the current dispute is "unacceptable, " the
editorial said.</P>
      <P>"Is it really possible that Berlin, Paris and London are
preparing to strengthen China and sacrifice their old ally Japan?" it
asked.</P>
      <P>Regardless of how Japan treats its own history, the country
definitely has no intentions of attacking its neighbors, the
editorial said, adding that China, on the other hand, despite all its
talk of peaceful development, has never given up the option of the
use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the newspaper urged the European countries to pay
attention to the increasing tensions between China and Japan and not

    <HEADLINE>COA CAUTIONS LOCAL FARMERS AGAINST RASHLY MAKING INROADS INTO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) on
Tuesday cautioned local farmers against rashly making inroads into
mainland China.</P>
      <P>COA Vice Chairman Tai Cheng-yao's warning came after recent
reports that Chinese authorities promised to give tariff-free
treatment to Taiwan's agriculture products.</P>
      <P>Tai questioned whether this is part of China' "united front"
tactics to try to obtain Taiwan's superior agricultural technology.
In addition, the preferential treatment could be suspended at any
time as the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have not signed an
agreement, he added.</P>
      <P>Tai was speaking at a meeting convened by the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) legislative caucus, which is studying the
feasibility of Taiwan agricultural products making inroads into China
under the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>Tai expressed doubts about China's claimed intention of taking
care of Taiwan farmers, saying that Taiwan leads most other nations
in agricultural technology. He said that if China obtains Taiwan's
superior agricultural technology after contracting Taiwan farmers to
work in special zones opened for them on the mainland, then Beijing
might "turn from opening to controlling."</P>
      <P>Bureau of Foreign Trade Director General Huang Chih-peng said on
the same occasion that the chances of China giving preferential
treatment to Taiwan's agricultural products is minimal. He noted that
in line with the rules of the WTO, of which both Taiwan and China are
members, other member nation's have the right to request the same
treatment if China gives tariff-free treatment to Taiwan's
agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that Taiwan's agricultural products are highly
competitive and that exports to the global market have grown since
the island's WTO entry in January 2002 while exports to China have
decreased in the same period. He said this illustrates that China has
set up steep non-tariff barriers.</P>
      <P>"Those who are considering making inroads into the mainland
market had better be on guard, " he said, adding that "if they decide
to make inroads into China, they had better do so through legal
channels to cut the risks to a minimum."</P>
      <P>Fu Don-cheng, director of the Department of Economic Affairs of
the Mainland Affairs Council, expressed concerns that Beijing may
attempt a "political solution" to bypass the rules of the WTO to give
Taiwan agricultural products preferential treatment by claiming the
issue is an "internal affair." He said that in this scenario,
Taiwan's dignity would suffer and its sovereignty would be
undermined.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. State Department said Monday
that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is expected to discuss
issues regarding the European Union's arms sales ban on China with
NATO foreign ministers at a meeting of the organization to be held
later this week.</P>
      <P>State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at a media
briefing that Rice had a brief discussion earlier in the day with the
Belgian foreign minister about lifting the E.U. arms sales embargo
against China.</P>
      <P>"Our position hasn't changed. We believe it's the wrong decision,
both for the message it sends and for the potentially strategic
implications for us, " he said while touching on the stance of the
U.S. toward the European attempt to lift the ban.</P>
      <P>Rice is scheduled to leave Tuesday for Russia and Lithuania to
attend the NATO foreign ministers meeting.</P>
      <P>Although the E.U. arms embargo is not a topic of the NATO
meetings themselves, Boucher said that since the topic is frequently

    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To coordinate a worldwide campaign in
memory of the world's greatest physicist, Albert Einstein, the
Kaohsiung-based National Science and Technology Museum (NSTM) invited
the public to join in a "1,000 People Lighting Up Einstein" activity
slated for Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>According to the organizer, some 1,000 college students, teachers
and professors will gather at the museum square, with all of them
wearing Einstein masks and holding flashlights. Their lights together
will create the equation E = mc2 -- following the start of Taiwan's
nationwide lights-on campaign in Hualien on the east coast.</P>
      <P>The activity will then be relayed to Tainan City at a canal, the
Tainan County Government plaza, the Great Buddha Sculpture on Bagua
Mountain in Changhua County, the Taichung National Museum of Natural
Science, the Hsinchu Synchronized Radioactivity Center, Taipei 101
and the Lu-lin Observatory on Yushan -- the highest peak of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to the Physics Society of the Republic of China, the
worldwide Einstein commemorative activity, named "Let Physics Glorify
the World," was initiated by Austrian professors Max E. Lippitsch and
Sonja Draxler to mark the 100th anniversary of Einstein's publication
of the special theory of relativity and the 50th anniversary of his
death, both falling on April 18.</P>
      <P>By encouraging countries around the world to turn on their lights
at the same time on the special day, the scholars hope that the move
will arouse the world's attention to physics and support the study of
the science.</P>
      <P>Some 44 countries, including Japan and South Korea, have answered
their call to take part in the "lights-on" activity. At the same
time, a fund-raising campaign is to be kicked off to collect
donations to help Third World countries promote basic science
education.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Education has said that the public has
a variety of ways to participate in the global campaign. People can
log onto the Internet to "light up" online, or send a short message
with their cellular phones to "light up" Taiwan's light on a world
map.</P>
      <P>A series of other activities will also be held in locations
across Taiwan. Log onto http: //419.com.tw for more information about

    <TEXT>
      <P>After lengthy discussions with ranking
Communist Party of China (CPC) officials, visiting Kuomintang (KMT)
Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng said Tuesday that the itinerary of
Chairman Lien Chan's upcoming visit to the People's Republic of China
will be announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The KMT will make the announcement at the weekly meeting of its
policy-making Central Standing Committee, Lin said, adding that the
Beijing-based Taiwan Affairs Office under the State Council will also
give an explanation publicly on the same day now that Lien's PRC
itinerary has been fixed.</P>
      <P>Lin said that his talks with Taiwan Affairs Office Director Chen
Yunlin took eight hours in an effort to ensure a safe, smooth and
pleasant trip for Lien and relevant personnel and reporters.</P>
      <P>Reiterating that Lien will do his utmost to protect Taiwan's
dignity, seek benefits for the people on Taiwan and make peace in the
Taiwan Strait when he meets CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao in
Beijing, Lin revealed that the two men will discuss a broad range of
issues, which may also include the "one China" question.</P>
      <P>The KMT will staunchly safeguard the interests of the Republic of
China that it founded 95 years ago, he stressed, but denied
speculation that the KMT is preparing to sign a truce agreement with
the CPC.</P>
      <P>He also said that "everyone" is welcome to join forces to build
peace and create benefits for the people on both sides, referring to
the latest development that Hu also extended an invitation to People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong to visit.</P>
      <P>The KMT official arrived in Beijing a day earlier to arrange a

    <HEADLINE>DPP CALLS FOR 'CODE OF CONDUCT' AMID OPPOSITION VISITS TO CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) has drafted a "code of conduct" for all political parties as
the leaders of two major opposition parties are preparing to visit
China, trips that some fear might cause damage to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP's "basic code of conduct" is contained in a resolution
calling for "three noes and three yeses" when dealing with China.</P>
      <P>Chairman Lien Chan of the largest opposition party, the
Kuomintang, and Chairman James Soong of the second-largest opposition
party, the People First Party, have been invited to visit China. The
visits are scheduled for later this month and early next month.</P>
      <P>The first no in the DPP proposal is: "We are firmly opposed to
the 'one China' condition, in the form of the so-called '1992
consensus,' for party leaders to visit China."</P>
      <P>The second no: "Without government authorization, we are firmly
opposed to any negotiations over cross-Taiwan Strait affairs that
might involve national sovereignty or the exercise of public
authority."</P>
      <P>The third no: "We are firmly opposed to any Chinese government
move aimed at stripping Taiwan's national status and denying Taiwan's
national government so that Taiwan's government would appear like a
local or regional government."</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the DPP strongly advocates the following three
points on which an absolute majority of the people on Taiwan agree.
First, the Republic of China is an independent country whose
sovereignty is shared by its 23 million people, and they alone have
the right to change its status.</P>
      <P>Second, the Chinese government's attempt to resort to the use of
force against Taiwan must be vehemently condemned and cross-strait
disputes must be resolved with peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Third, the people on Taiwan strongly oppose China's enactment of
the Anti-Secession Law which authorizes Beijing to use "non-peaceful
means" to settle disputes with Taiwan; and Taiwan citizens' rights to
participate in international activities must not be suppressed.</P>
      <P>The DPP resolution says it is time that all sectors of Taiwan
society stood firmly together in the face of Chinese hegemony.</P>
      <P>"Different parties may have different positions and views inside
Taiwan, but all political parties should be unanimous in their
determination to maintain our free and democratic way of life, to
ascertain the ROC's sovereignty, and to safeguard the right of the 23
million people to decide on their own future," it says.</P>
      <P>The resolution was passed by the DPP Central Executive Committee
Tuesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-VATICAN TIES REMAIN SOLID: ROC FOREIGN MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between the Republic of China
and the Vatican will remain steadfast after the election of a new
pope, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lu was responding to concerns whether ROC-Vatican ties could be
affected following the election of a successor to the late Pope John
Paul II, who died earlier this month at the age of 84.</P>
      <P>Over the past 20-plus years, Lu said, China has on the one hand
sought to normalize its relations with the Vatican but has continued
to suppress religious freedoms and arrest Catholic clergymen and
followers on the other.</P>
      <P>Noting that religious freedoms and the well-being of all Catholic
followers around the world are the top concerns of the Vatican, Lu
said diplomatic ties or politics are just the means, not the end, for
the Holy See.</P>
      <P>If China fails to respect religious freedoms or allow its people
to enjoy the freedom of assembly, Lu said, it would be very difficult
for the Vatican to forge diplomatic ties with China anytime soon.</P>
      <P>In the foreseeable future, Lu went on, China is not expected to
adjust its policy and attitude toward human rights and religious
freedoms. Against this backdrop, Lu said he doesn't think that the
Vatican will forge diplomatic ties after a new pope is designated.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lu said the Vatican has consistently been satisfied
with Taiwan's contributions to international humanitarian aid. Over
the years, Lu said, Taiwan has established a steadfast, peaceful and
merciful partnership with the Vatican.</P>
      <P>In its long history, Lu said, the Vatican has never taken the
initiative to sever diplomatic ties with any other country.</P>
      <P>The world is waiting for 115 cardinals to elect a new
pope. The cardinals headed into their first full day of voting for a
new pope Tuesday after an inaugural ballot failed to find a successor
Monday.</P>
      <P>Asked who will serve as Taiwan's top envoy to attend the new
pope's inauguration, Lu said it's up to the Presidential Office to
decide.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian personally attended Pope John Paul II's
funeral in the Vatican April 8, making him the first serving ROC head
of state ever to set foot in Europe. Because of China's diplomatic
embargo, the Vatican is the ROC's only diplomatic ally in Europe.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO RESUBMIT BILL GOVERNING ASSETS OF POLITICAL PARTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) said Tuesday that it will again try to put a bill governing the
assets of political parties on the Legislative Yuan's agenda.</P>
      <P>William Lai, DPP caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, made the
remarks as the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) failed to attract bidders
for its sale of land used by the National Development Institute
(NDI), the party's school to nurture the nation's leaders.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT has repeatedly said that it will engage in
reforms, Lai said the attempted sale of the NDI shows that it is
impossible for the KMT to return its ill-gotten party assets
voluntarily.</P>
      <P>The DPP earlier tried to put a bill governing the assets of
political parties on the legislative agenda, but failed because the
opposition "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and its ally, the People
First Party (PFP), command a slight majority in the 225-seat
legislature.</P>
      <P>Lai expressed the hope that the PFP will support the DPP this
time and stand on the side of justice.</P>
      <P>Noting that the KMT closed the door on consultations earlier this
month in displeasure over judicial authorities' investigation of KMT
Vice Chairman P. K. Chiang's China visit -- in which he reached a
10-point consensus with Beijing, Lai said that draft statutes
concerning the 2008 Taiwan Expo, a major arms procurement, the
amendment to the organic law of the Executive Yuan, and confirmation
of members of the Control Yuan nominated by President Chen Shui-bian
have been stalled in the legislature.</P>
      <P>"The KMT is selling its party assets on one hand, and is
traveling to China to cooperate with the Communist Party of China on
the other," which is "unacceptable" to the DPP caucus, Lai said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Hsu Kuo-yung also said that the KMT had seized the
land occupied by the NDI by forcing people to sell their land
cheaply. Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who concurrently serves as one of
the party's vice Chairman, also worked with the KMT to rezone the 
NDI land to try to benefit the KMT, Hsu claimed.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen Chieh, KMT legislative caucus whip, said that
it is "regrettable" that the DPP is proposing to include the bill on
the agenda again.</P>
      <P>Chen Chieh said that the DPP's move is to try to whip up
confrontation between the ruling and the opposition parties, which he
said proves that the DPP government's advocacy of "reconciliation and
co-existence" is false and insincere.</P>
      <P>The NDI is located in the Wenshan district, Taipei, with 28 land
lots totaling 78,541 square meters. The KMT has said that it will
sell the property.</P>
      <P>Though the KMT has not revealed its asking price, according to
the published value of the land, it should be worth more than NT$5.2
billion (US$185.07 million).</P>
      <P>Lin Yung-jui, vice chairman of the KMT's Administration and
Management Committee, who presided over the bidding, said that three
potential buyers showed up Tuesday. But as no one submitted an offer,
the party will solicit bidding again later.</P>
      <P>A potential bidder also said that as the urban planning project
of the NDI has yet to be finalized, the risks are big, adding that he
was only looking without seriously considering submitting a bid.</P>

      <P>Opposition leaders should talk with the
government and seek domestic consensus on major issues before
visiting China so that they will not be used as a tool by Beijing in
its united front tactics against Taiwan, Presidential Office Deputy
Secretary-General James Huang said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang was referring to plans by opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan and opposition People First Party (PFP) Chairman
James Soong to visit China in late April and early May, respectively.</P>
      <P>Huang said the different attitudes adopted by the two parties in
dealing with their planned China trips will affect the public's
perception of them.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, the Presidential Office has encountered much
difficulty while trying to communicate with Lien over his trip
because the KMT does not pay heed to the government at all.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the Presidential Office has maintained close
contact with the PFP after President Chen Shui-bian and Soong
established a 10-point agreement during their last meeting on Feb.
24, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Huang pointed out that the PFP informed the Presidential Office
soon after receiving an invitation from Beijing for Soong to visit
China, which he said shows that the PFP is sincere and friendly
toward the government.</P>
      <P>He said the Presidential Office agrees with the PFP that Soong's
China trip should help bring about dialogue between the governments
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and believes that Soong will pass
on the opinions of the Taiwanese people to Beijing.</P>
      <P>However, he denied Soong is visiting China as a special envoy of
the president.</P>
      <P>He said the Presidential Office has not discussed with the PFP
arrangements for a second meeting between Chen and Soong but will
leave the possibility open.</P>

Tories grumble. 

Labour is heading for another big majority in the face of a faltering
Conservative challenge, a new poll suggested last night amid the first
serious sniping from the sidelines at the conduct of Michael Howard's
election campaign. 

A Populus poll for The Times, taken over the weekend, suggests that Labour
has strengthened its support since the election was called a fortnight ago, while the
Tories have slipped. 



Financial Times: Setback for Howard on tax.

Michael Howard is failing to convince voters that the Conservatives
are a low tax party which would spend public money more effectively
than Labour, according to a new poll for the Financial Times.

As prominent Tories pile pressure on Mr Howard to step up his
hitherto modest commitment to cut taxes in the next parliament, the
poll by MORI shows nearly seven out of 10 people believe a Conservative
government would increase taxes about three times more than the number
who think it would reduce them.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>KMT SHOULD SHOW SINCERITY IN LEGISLATURE BEFORE PRC TRIP: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visits by opposition leaders to the
People's Republic of China (PRC) are acceptable, but their lawmakers
should first cooperate with the ruling party to have important bills
clear the legislature, Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks while answering questions from opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) legislators Kuo Su-chun and Liu Cheng-hung, who
criticized the government's poor handling of KMT Chairman Lien Chan's
upcoming visit to the PRC by threatening to take court action against
the main opposition party.</P>
      <P>Denying the KMT lawmakers' accusation, Hsieh claimed that it will
be very hard for the public to buy their story that Lien's PRC visit
is to seek benefits for the people in Taiwan if the KMT lawmakers do
not work on pushing through bills at the Legislative Yuan, such as
the 2008 Taiwan exposition bill, a new five-year fiscal year budget
bill and a national health insurance reform bill.</P>
      <P>In addition to visiting the PRC, the KMT should engage in
screening bills at the Legislative Yuan for the benefit of the Taiwan
people, he said, stressing that political figures should be very
watchful with their words and deeds and always act in compliance with
the law to avoid becoming a bad example for society.</P>
      <P>Although Lien's PRC trip is well-intentioned, he warned that a
good thing might also be in violation of the law if it lacks a legal
process required by law.</P>
      <P>The premier reiterated that Lien must report his PRC visit to the
government before he goes there and that the KMT chairman must not
ink any agreements with the Communist Party of China without
government authorization, emphasizing that whatever accords Lien
signs involving government authority in the PRC will be invalid.</P>
      <P>It would be unnecessary for the government to exist should the
opposition camp, which controls more than half of the seats in the
Legislative Yuan, not act according to the law or amends the law
first, he opined, noting that it is the basic principle of a nation
ruled by law.</P>
      <P>The premier said he welcomes Lien to approach the Mainland
Affairs Council to make a report on his PRC trip or talk about
getting government authorization before he goes there.</P>
      <P>Turning to a planned visit by People First Party (PFP) Chairman

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lawmakers of the pro-independence Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) said Tuesday they are planning to ask the
legislature to pass a resolution forbidding politicians from visiting
China without the government's authorization until Beijing renounces
its threat to invade Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The proposal will be put forth next Tuesday ahead of opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's and opposition People First
Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong's planned trips to China.</P>
      <P>It will be raised in accordance with the Statute Governing the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland
Area, which stipulates that the Legislative Yuan can adopt a
resolution restricting Taiwan people from going to China during a
certain period of time in the event of "a major unexpected
circumstance undermining the primary interests of Taiwan or a
situation jeopardizing cross-strait interaction," they said.</P>
      <P>Such a ban can only be put into force once it is proclaimed by
the Executive Yuan, the law states.</P>
      <P>According to TSU Legislator Huang Shih-cho, the enactment of
China's Anti-Secession Law that threatens the use of non-peaceful
means against Taiwan should Beijing deem the country to be moving
toward independence has seriously impacted the security of Taiwan and
the Asia-Pacific region, which matches the definition of "a major
unexpected circumstance."</P>
      <P>Lien's and Soong's visits to China disregarding the situation
have seriously impaired the security and dignity of Taiwan, Huang
said.</P>
      <P>The TSU also strongly opposes Soong's plan to discuss with
Chinese President Hu Jintao a 10-point agreement reached between
Soong and President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, convener of the TSU's legislative caucus, claimed
that the move will be tantamount to recognizing the existence of the
so-called "1992 consensus" on the "one China" issue, which he said
will trap Taiwan in the "one China framework" set up by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lo said Soong must be prohibited from discussing the 10-point
agreement with Beijing without the government's authorization and
without a domestic consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>He proposed that the government hold a referendum at the end of
this year to consult the people on whether they would agree to
negotiating with China under Beijing's "one China framework."</P>
      <P>As part of his Feb. 24 10-point agreement with Soong, Chen
reaffirmed his "five-noes" commitment that he will not declare
independence for Taiwan, will not change the official name of the
country, will not include the "state-to-state" concept on
cross-Taiwan Strait relations in the Constitution, will not promote a
referendum to change the cross-strait status quo and will not abolish
the Guidelines for National Unification and the National Unification
Council.</P>
      <P>The TSU has accused Chen of betraying the Taiwanese identity by
forging his agreement with Soong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMPENSATION-DEMANDING CHINESE LOSE LAWSUIT IN TOKYO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  April  19 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang/S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tokyo's high court upheld Tuesday a
district court decision that war victims cannot demand compensation
from a country even if that country is guilty, in a ruling against a
lawsuit lodged by 10 Chinese citizens against Japan.</P>
      <P>It is beyond doubt that the Japanese army experimented on live
humans and committed the Nanjing Massacre during World War II.
However, according to international law, individual victims do not
have a right to demand compensation from the war-launching country,
Judge Masato Kadoguchi said in his ruling.</P>
      <P>Tokyo's district court in 1999 turned down the demand on the same
grounds, while recognizing the complainants' suffering. It also
acknowledged as "historical fact" that Japan's long-time occupation
of China caused severe harm to the Chinese.</P>
      <P>Japan occupied Manchuria in northeast China in 1931 and launched
all-out attacks on other parts of China in 1937. It surrendered in
1945 after being defeated by the Allied forces, ending World War II.</P>
      <P>Some of the 10 Chinese are survivors of the atrocities
perpetrated by the infamous Unit 731 of the Japanese army, which used
living humans as guinea pigs in weapons experiments, while the others
are family members of those killed in the 1937 Nanjing Massacre or
Japanese air raids.</P>
      <P>In their lawsuit, they demanded a total of 100 million yen in
compensation from the Japanese government. Seeing the suit defeated
in the second trial, they said they will appeal against the ruling.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An American military adviser group is
observing a computer simulation that is part of Taiwan's annual "Han
Kuang 21" military exercise, a legislator of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The remarks by DPP Legislator Lee Wen-chung, a member of the
defense committee in the Legislative Yuan and an expert in Taiwan
military affairs, came after Japan's NHK TV channel
reported that Dennis Blair, former head of the U.S.
Pacific Command, is leading a delegation of around 20 military
officers that is observing the computerized wargames that started
Monday.</P>
      <P>NHK commented that this was the first time that the U.S.
Defense Department has openly said it has sent military personnel to
Taiwan, which the TV channel claimed "strongly indicates" that it
wants to counterbalance China.</P>
      <P>Lee said that this is not the first time that the U.S. Pacific
Command has sent a military adviser group to monitor the computerized
wargames.</P>
      <P>But with the continued expansion of China's military might, he
claimed, military cooperation between Taiwan and the United States
will become even closer.</P>
      <P>He noted that in the past, the U.S. adviser group would only
observe some of the wargames, but this year they will observe
throughout the five-day period of the games.</P>
      <P>The five-day computerized war simulations are armed at honing
various combat strategies and tactics, including anti-blockade
strategies, airborne defense control, naval forces' air defense and
maritime control tactics, as well as cyber-defense operations.</P>
      <P>Live-fire drills -- another part of the "Han Kuang 21" annual
series of drills devoted to testing the armed forces' combat prowess
-- are scheduled for June through August to verify combat strategies
and tactics hammered out during the computerized wargames. These
maneuvers will include strategies to cope with blitz attacks on a
major local oil depot and undersea cables.</P>
      <P>The live-fire exercises will also practice counter-strategies
against warfare methods such as carpet bombing, infiltrations,

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has recalled from stores all
powered infant formula made by the French manufacturer Celia even
though Celia says the particular product suspected of being tainted
was not imported into Taiwan, the Department of Health said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Lu-hung, director of the health department's Bureau of Food
Sanitation, made the remarks after receiving a letter from the French
Institute in Taipei, which represents French interests in the absence
of formal diplomatic ties, that some infant formulas produced by
Celia were found to have been contaminated by salmonella, but that
the product was only sold in France and Italy, not in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The formula in question was all produced before March 22 and the
health department is checking if any of the contaminated formula was
in fact imported into Taiwan and whether the date is before or after
March 22.</P>
      <P>Formula made after that date has been found to be safe for
consumption.</P>
      <P>Thirty-five infants in Europe experienced diarrhea after
ingesting the formula in March, but none were seriously ill.</P>
      <P>Chen said that infant formula for under one-year-olds has been
taken off the shelves, and that sales for over one- year-olds is
being stopped and recall efforts will be complete by week's end.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that he will monitor
the situation.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was responding to Legislator Liu Cheng-hung of the
opposition Kuomintang who questioned the way the health department
has been handling the matter, saying that it notified the importers
to withdraw the products last week, but only told consumers of
the problem later.</P>
      <P>A local agent of the French infant formula stressed that most of
the product has been examined and proved to be uncontaminated, and
that the recall is only a precautionary measure.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
declined to comment Tuesday on a Japanese media report that a
delegation from the U.S. Pacific Command has arrived in Taipei to
observe Taiwan's "Han Kuang 21" series of military exercises.</P>
      <P>Japan's public television channel NHK reported earlier that day
that former U.S. Pacific Command Commander-in-Chief Adm. Dennis Blair
is heading a 20-member delegation that is observing Taiwan's ongoing
computerized war simulations.</P>
      <P>In response to press inquiries about the NHK report, MND
officials said it is the ministry's established policy to refrain
from commenting on such reports.</P>
      <P>The annual Han Kuang series of exercises comprise two parts --
computer war games and live-fire drills.</P>
      <P>The five-day computer war simulations kicked off Monday,
including a simulation of a Chinese missile and air attack on Taiwan
and a simulation of a naval invasion and air attack in the Taiwan
Strait, MND sources said.</P>
      <P>According to the sources, the computer war games this year will
continue to focus on joint operations and discovering the military's
shortcomings and deficiencies. The findings will have an impact on
the military's future arms procurement plans, the sources said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sources went on, a U.S.-developed joint
theater-level simulation system (JTLS) is being used in the Han Kuang
21 war simulations. The system uses computer images that resemble a
live-fire maneuver.</P>
      <P>The JTLS is capable of remotely linking up to the nation's top
military command, the sources said, adding that the military
personnel participating in the computer war-game exercises need no
longer gather at the maximum-security Hengshan Command in suburban
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The war simulations will hone various combat strategies and
tactics, including anti-blockade strategies, airborne defense
control, naval forces' air defense and maritime control tactics, as
well as cyber-defense operations.</P>
      <P>The live-fire drills are scheduled for June through August to
verify combat strategies and tactics hammered out during the computer
war-game exercises. These maneuvers will include strategies to cope
with surprise attacks on a major local oil depot and undersea cables,
as well as counter strategies against unlimited and asymmetric
warfare methods such as carpet bombing, infiltrations, abductions,
hijackings, computer virus attacks and decapitation strikes.</P>
      <P>Decapitation strategies short-circuit command and control
systems, wipe out nationwide nerve centers and leave the opponent
hopelessly immobilized. Many military observers say China is very
likely to use this strategy in an invasion of Taiwan by seizing the
nation's center of power -- the capital -- along with its top
leaders.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
Taiwan should not denigrate itself as just a "window" or
"springboard" to the vast Chinese market.</P>
      <P>With its abundant manpower, manufacturing technology and rich
foreign exchange reserves, Taiwan has great potential to become an
Asia-Pacific economic and trade hub and stronghold, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, crafting a Taiwan-centered industrial
development blueprint has been the government's top guiding principle
in formulating economic policy.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while inspecting the Far Glory Air Cargo
Park near Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan County,
some 40 km south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>In the face of ever-growing global competition, Chen said,
vitality and innovation are critical to Taiwan's competitiveness.
While some people claim that Taiwan should accelerate integration
with the Chinese market and serve as a "window" or "springboard" for
other countries to make inroads into the Chinese market, Chen said he
disagrees strongly with such views.</P>
      <P>"We should not look down upon ourselves as just someone else's
'stepping-stone' or 'springboard.' We should not draw up our future
national development policy based on such a near-sighted view. Taiwan
is absolutely not an isolated island or part of China's remote
hinterland. With our quality work force, technological know how and
bountiful foreign exchange reserves, we can be an Asia-Pacific
business hub and economic powerhouse, " Chen said, adding that his
administration has worked out Taiwan-centered development strategies.</P>
      <P>Chen also urged relevant government agencies to make concerted
efforts to ensure that the Far Glory Air Cargo Park project can be
completed in five years.

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Taiwan businessmen working
in China who have reported risk to their security and turned to the
Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) for help is steadily
increasing, according to statistics released by the SEF Tuesday.</P>
      <P>SEF officials said the number peaked at 124 in 2004, which
represents an increase of 15.88 percent over the previous year and
brought the total number of Taiwan businessmen who have asked the SEF
for help with personal security problems to 755.</P>
      <P>The SEF said in a statement accompanying the statistics that the
figures are just the tip of the iceberg because, it claimed, there
are "countless unreported cases" in which Taiwan businessmen have
been kidnapped, murdered, or robbed in China.</P>
      <P>The statement said the SEF is worried that Taiwan businessmen in
China, estimated at around 1 million, have become sitting ducks for
criminals in China.</P>
      <P>Personal security cases accounted for 57.67 percent of all
problems that Taiwan businessmen have asked the SEF for help with
since 1990 when the SEF was founded.</P>
      <P>The statement said the SEF is usually the last resort for Taiwan
businessmen trying to solve disputes and that they turn to the SEF
only after they have exhausted all other avenues.</P>
      <P>As China is a country without an independent judiciary and
without a transparent policy-making process, the SEF warned that
doing business there is fraught with risks and that Taiwan
businessmen should think carefully before venturing into that market.</P>

      <P>Opposition People First Party (PFP)
Chairman James Soong's plan to discuss with Beijing his 10-point
agreement with President Chen Shui-bian will not involve any legal
problems, Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun claimed
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, the concepts covered by the 10-point agreement
are all established government policies.</P>
      <P>As part of his Feb. 24 agreement with Soong, Chen reaffirmed his
"five noes" commitment, including no declaration of formal
independence for Taiwan, no change to the official name of the
country and no change to the cross-Taiwan Strait status quo during
his term.</P>
      <P>Soong, who is to visit China next month soon after a similar trip
by opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan set for late April, is
expected to raise the Chen-Soong agreement for discussion during his
meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Beijing officials said they welcome visits by Taiwanese
politicians who support the so-called "1992 consensus" on the "one
China" issue and who oppose Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>James Huang, deputy secretary-general of the Presidential Office,
said it is fair to say that the 10-point agreement represents Chen's
standpoints because he has repeated on many occasions the concepts
included in the agreement.</P>
      <P>However, Huang stressed that this does not mean that Soong is
holding talks with Beijing on behalf of the president.</P>
      <P>As to the "1992 consensus, " Huang insisted there was never any
consensus between Taipei and Beijing on the principle of "one China"

    <TEXT>New York Times: In Secret, Cardinals
Begin Their Balloting to Choose a Pope

Black smoke pirouetted Monday from a chimney ove r the Sistine
Chapel, signaling that the cardinals electing the 265th pope had
taken a first inconclusive vote two and a half hours after locking
themselves in their tradition-laden conclave since 1978, when John P
aul II was elected.

Wall Street Journal: Islam's Global Gains Pressure Catholics to
Rethink Strategy

For more than 40 years, the Roman Catholic Church has embraced a
seductive theory: By extending an olive branch, Christianity could
lay to rest its 1,400-year history of conflict with Islam. The church
created a new curial office dedicated to fostering a robust dialogue
with Islam, as well as other world religions, with the goal of
achieving mutual understanding and peace. It welcomed the building of
mosques in Europe and spoke out against religious discrimination of
Muslims. Now, as Catholic cardinals meet in the Vatican to choose the
next pope, there is a growing feeling that these efforts to reach out
to Islam have backfired. While some Muslims have embraced the call
for dialogue, many Catholics now fret that the conciliatory approach
has tied the church's hands, preventing it from keeping up with
Islam's rapid growth, particularly in parts of the world once
dominated by Catholicism. Some critics also believe the softer stance
should be more contingent on a reciprocal tolerance of Catholics in
the Muslim world.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The pro-independence opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) on Wednesday urged President Chen Shui-bian to
convene a summit meeting of the various political parties by April 25
so as to narrow their differences over China and forge a consensus.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, TSU caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, made the
remarks amid reports that opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan will depart for a visit to China next Tuesday and that People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong will travel there soon
afterwards.</P>
      <P>Lo pointed out that the leaders of the opposition parties
"scrambling to visit China" risks undermining the government's stance
and the national interests.</P>
      <P>If they go, they should have the endorsement of the public, and
the political party summit will provide a forum to forge a national
consensus and public trust, Lo added.</P>
      <P>He urged President Chen to convene a party summit meeting which
he said will enable the ruling and the opposition parties to express
to President Chen their stances on cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien, who Lo claimed has so far been unwilling to
report to the government about his upcoming mainland trip, can also
take the opportunity of listening to the will of the people expressed
through various parties taking part in the summit meeting.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Su Chin-chiang said that the upcoming China visits
by Lien and Soong are aimed at "getting even" for their losing the
last presidential election in 2004, adding that if the KMT and the
PFP really want to cooperate with mainland China, then they might as
well merge with the mainland.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese leaders will ultimately have
to talk with popularly elected leaders in Taiwan if they want their
engagements with Taiwan's opposition figures to be productive, a U.S.
State Department official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randall G. Schriver, who will
leave his job at the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs next
month, made the remarks while meeting with Taiwan journalists posted
in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Commenting on reports about Beijing's invitations to Taiwan's two
opposition heavyweights -- Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and
People First Party Chairman James Soong -- to visit China, Schriver
said dialogue is better than no dialogue at all.</P>
      <P>"As we've said on the record before, our view is that on the
margins, dialogue is better than no dialogue at all, and we think
talking is better than not talking," Schriver pointed out.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Schriver added that ultimately how these trips will
be viewed will depend on a number of variables.</P>
      <P>"Will this diplomacy be a mechanism for moving forward?
Subsequently, will it contribute eventually to dialogue broader
across the political spectrum in Taiwan? Or will it be limited to
just reaching out to the opposition in the tensely divisive mood
internally in Taiwan's domestic politics? We just don't know yet, "
Schriver said.</P>
      <P>"So we are watching this carefully. And genuinely, on the
margins, we think, dialogue is better than no dialogue. And we'll see
how this plays in Taiwan," he added..</P>
      <P>Ultimately, Schriver continued, "for this to be productive for
all parties, the leaders in Beijing will ultimately have to talk to
elected leaders in Taiwan and the government that's in power."</P>
      <P>As to the controversy surrounding KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang's

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  20  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh blamed the
opposition-controlled legislature on Wednesday for failing to pass
any legislative or budget bills in the nearly three months since his
inauguration.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said during a weekly Cabinet meeting that this is a problem
that the public should pay attention to, given that the Legislative
Yuan can be this slow when there has not been any conflict between
the legislative and administrative branches.</P>
      <P>Hsieh pointed out that urgent bills on the waiting list include a
special statute governing the Taiwan Expo 2008, which he called an
event much anticipated by both the government and private sectors.</P>
      <P>With the project having been put forth for nearly three years,
Hsieh urged the legislature to pass the bill soon because a lot of
things have yet to be done with only three years left before the
event is set to be held.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the government hopes the exhibition will succeed and
bring a lot of business opportunities to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with Hsieh, ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
legislators said the opposition Kuomintang and People First Party
should apologize to the 23 million people in Taiwan for repeatedly
blocking Cabinet-proposed bills from being included on the
legislature's agenda.</P>
      <P>According to DPP legislative caucus convener Chao Yung-ching, his
caucus has sought consultations with the opposition on many occasions
but has consistently been rejected.</P>
      <P>However, PFP legislative caucus convener Chen Chih-pin denied
that the opposition has blocked Cabinet-proposed legislation or
budgets, saying the PFP has been very friendly toward Hsieh.</P>
      <P>Chen claimed that it is very normal that no legislation or
budgets have been passed so far since the legislature has spent most
of its time interpellating the premier over the past months.</P>

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) -- Roman Catholic cardinals

      <P>Lien said that his visit to China next week will mark the first
meeting between the leader of the KMT and the Communist Party of
China since the KMT fled to Taiwan 56 years ago.</P>
      <P>Lien said that "56 years is not a short time. There might be some 
sadness, but there is also solemn significance" of his upcoming
visit.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait issues, Lien said that the "agenda doesn't have
to be big or grand, " adding that "as long as both sides can
rationally exchange views based on peace, goodwill and sincerity," he
is confident that both sides can explore some issues under the ideals
of "equal footing and a win-win situation."</P>
      <P>Noting that both sides of the Taiwan Strait have differences, but
Lien said that seeking common ground and trying to enlarge this
common ground will be what both sides will be striving for.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the hope that his trip will lay a favorable
foundation for cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lien, who will depart for China next Tuesday, said he will first
go to Nanjing to pay his respects to Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding
father of the Republic of China who helped found the first republic
in Asia.</P>

      <P>The leader of a pro-independence group
accused opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and opposition
People First Party Chairman James Soong Wednesday of seriously
damaging the interests of Taiwan over their planned visits to China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Society North Chairman Wu Shu-min noted that China
triggered widespread disapproval from the international community
following the enactment of its Anti-Secession Law that threatens the
use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan, but claimed that the China
trip by KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang last month undermined Taiwan's
efforts to win international support.</P>
      <P>The upcoming China trips by Lien and Soong will further damage
the national interests of Taiwan, according to Wu.</P>

goodwill toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed his opposition to Soong's plan to discuss with

      <P>The agreement, in which Chen reaffirmed his "five noes"
commitment including no independence for Taiwan and no change to the
cross-Taiwan Strait status quo during his term, has enraged

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday that
the government will listen carefully to the views of medical
professionals and the public on the national health insurance program
and give them serious thought.</P>
      <P>The premier's remarks came before a march by tens of thousands
doctors later of the day to protest against shrinking reimbursement
from the Bureau of National Health Insurance that they claimed
threatens their survival.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the government attaches great importance to
pluralism in society and for this reason, will take into
consideration the voice of the general public and the medical
professionals, with equal concern for their rights and interests.</P>
      <P>But in the end, there should be rational discussion, as the
national health insurance program involves pluralistic values and
multilateral interests.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the government has to consider the best
interests of everyone and the quality of medical care, as well as the
care of the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>The underprivileged should get prioritized medical care so as to
help create a more just society and lessen the gap between rich and
poor.</P>
      <P>On the cash-strapped finances of the national health insurance
program, Lien said that the government has adopted some emergency
measures, although these will not address the root of the problem,
which is still controversial because of the diversity of views on the
subject.</P>
      <P>The government's temporary remedial measures include a slight
adjustment of premiums and an increase in government spending of
NT$11 billion (US$349.2 million), which should be of some help to the
floundering national health insurance program, Hsieh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT REINING IN PFP HEAD WITH SOVEREIGNTY BOTTOM LINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) is right to use People First Party Chairman James Soong to
discredit Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan but that does not mean giving
Soong a "blank check" when he visits China, political analysts said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the analysts, the DPP has adopted a six-point "code
of conduct" to restrict Soong's mandate in negotiating with China.</P>
      <P>The government and DPP have been trying to discredit Lien while
authorizing Soong to talk to the Chinese leadership on the basis of a
10-point consensus he reached recently with President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>If the ruling camp does not come up with a firm position on the
imminent visits to China by the two opposition leaders, its
statements will be regarded as political mud-slinging and its actions
may be seen as proof that it is panicking, the analysts said.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the DPP has adopted its six-point "code of
conduct" for political parties dealing with China, the first point
being adamant opposition to Beijing's "one China" principle in the
form of the so-called "1992 consensus," they added.</P>
      <P>The code of conduct also affirms the Republic of China's
sovereignty enjoyed by the 23 million people of Taiwan, who alone
have a right to change the ROC's status and decide on its future.</P>
      <P>The code of conduct largely agrees with the 10-point consensus
reached between Soong and Chen, and so will have the effect of
reining in Soong, as he will be urged to recognize the idea that the
consensus reached in the 1992 negotiations in Hong Kong does exist.</P>
      <P>But that does not mean China is the sole legitimate party to
paraphrase the 1992 talks. Taiwan -- in this case Soong -- can offer
its version of the story too, the analysts pointed out.</P>
      <P>They said that if China insists on its version of "one China" as
a precondition for Taiwan politicians to negotiate cross-strait
affairs, the government will not accept.</P>
      <P>In short, the government and the DPP are using the Chen-Soong
consensus and the "code of conduct" as a line in the sand over which
Soong should not step when he visits China early next month, the
analysts said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD URGED TO RELAY TAIWAN MAINSTREAM OPINION TO BEIJING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan should voice Taiwan's mainstream public opinion to Communist
Party of China (CPC) General Secretary Hu Jintao when he visits
Beijing, a veteran China expert said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-ueh, a professor at the Institute of China Studies at
Tamkang University, urged Lien to do this as Beijing has publicly
declared that "it is willing to discuss with Lien a broad range of
issues of major interest and concern to the people on both sides (of
the Taiwan Strait)."</P>
      <P>Claiming that Beijing lacks an adequate understanding of a
democratic Taiwan, Chang said Lien should also express concern over
China's democratization to Hu and help him get a clear idea of
Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the KMT chairman should tell Hu that most of
the people of Taiwan are in favor of maintaining the status quo
across the Taiwan Strait to secure peaceful development on the two
sides. In addition, Lien should urge Beijing to recognize the
existence of the Republic of China, he said.</P>
      <P>Doing so would not be meddling in China's internal affairs,
rather it would be aimed at helping forge mutual understanding, he
said, adding that a majority of the people on both sides hope
fervently for a more open society based on freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations would develop in a more positive direction
if both sides uphold the same values, he said.</P>
      <P>Now that the KMT has designated Lien's visit to China as a
"party-to-party" encounter with the CPC, Lien should act as an
opposition leader, he said, calling on Lien to refrain from
discussing sensitive issues or inking pacts with Hu involving
government authority.</P>
      <P>Democracy is Taiwan's asset in its dealings with China and the
issue of how to turn party-to-party contacts into an asset for
cross-strait exchanges will be a task for the government, he said.</P>
      <P>The KMT announced earlier in the day that Lien will depart for
China April 26 and return May 3, marking an unprecedented meeting
between the top leaders of the two rival political parties since the
KMT retreated to Taiwan from mainland China in 1949.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan should emphasize the differences between Taiwan and China over
the meaning of "one China" when discussing with Beijing a consensus
supposedly agreed upon by both sides during talks held in 1992 in
Hong Kong, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ma, who also serves as a vice chairman of the KMT, made the
suggestion during a weekly meeting of the party's Central Standing
Committee. Lien is set to visit China from April 26-May 3, during
which he is expected to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the "1992 consensus" refers to an agreement
allowing Taipei and Beijing to interpret the meaning of "one China"
differently, with Taipei insisting the "one China" means "the
Republic of China" and Beijing maintaining it means "the People's
Republic of China."</P>
      <P>The KMT should focus on this spirit when discussing the issue
with Beijing, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Beijing has claimed that the so-called "1992 consensus" means
that both sides agreed to the principle of "one China."</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party has refused to recognize
the existence of the "1992 consensus, " which is said by the KMT to
have been established when it was ruling Taiwan, on the grounds that
doing so would trap Taiwan in Beijing's "one China" policy.</P>
      <P>Ma proposed that Lien address the concepts of freedom, democracy,
human rights and rule of law in a scheduled speech at Peking
University, which Ma called a good opportunity for Lien to exchange
dialogue with the Chinese people.</P>
      <P>Also, Ma said, Lien should address issues concerning Taiwan's
international participation.</P>
      <P>As an opposition party, the KMT should not try to dominate
cross-strait talks and should allow the involvement of the
government, Ma added.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The head of the Department of Health (DOH)
apologized Wednesday over the way the department handled the issue of
suspected tainted infant formula produced by French manufacturer
Celia that caused a scare among local consumers.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Ho Sheng-mao offered the apology during a Cabinet
meeting for not informing the public about Celia's products in a
timely manner.
</P>
      <P>Some of Celia's infant formula products were found to have been
contaminated by salmonella bacteria. Thirty-five infants in Europe
experienced diarrhea after ingesting the formula in March, but none
were seriously ill.</P>
      <P>The DOH asked the importer to take the formula in question off
the shelves last week, but only later informed consumers, although
the importer had been inundated by phone calls from worried consumers
about the safety of the product.</P>
      <P>Ho apologized to the public for the department's handling of the
matter and said the staff responsible will be disciplined.</P>
      <P>He admitted that the DOH first learned about the contaminated
infant formula from the World Health Organization in March, but
failed to keep abreast of all the information available, which caused
panic among local consumers.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the DOH failed to make the public its top priority and
failed to establish a partnership relationship with the Consumers'
Foundation.</P>
      <P>Lastly, Ho said, the DOH's crisis-handling mechanism should be
strengthened.</P>
      <P>Wu Rong-i, chairman of a consumer protection committee at the
Executive Yuan, said that after examination, the committee has found
none of the suspect infant formula on the shelves of Taiwan stores,
which he said also matched the findings of the DOH, suggesting that
none of the tainted formula has been introduced into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu also said that the DOH should have considered the feelings of
consumers in handling such matters and should have avoided causing
misunderstanding and uneasiness because of incomplete information.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's China policy goals are "goodwill reconciliation, active
cooperation and permanent peace," he said.</P>
      <P>However, these goals now look elusive as China's Anti-Secession
Law has severely damaged cross-strait relations, he said. Still, he
emphasized that Taiwan will never stop seeking peaceful dialogue with
China and will always work at maintaining peace and stability in East
Asia.</P>
      <P>The main problem with China's Anti-Secession Law lies in its
attempt to change the status quo -- trying to restrain Taiwan's
democratic development with vague provisions which authorize the use
of "non-peaceful means" to achieve its political goals.</P>
      <P>This is the reason why Japan, Europe, the United States and other
democracies have frowned on the law, not to mention Taiwan residents
who have taken to the streets in loud protest, he said.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that China's military build-up is
threatening not just Taiwan, but other Asian countries as well.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, he said, the biggest conflict between Taiwan
and China is not military, but diplomatic. "China has spared no
efforts to isolate Taiwan in the international community, trying to
stifle Taiwan's economic activities, even in the NGO
(non-governmental organization) area."</P>
      <P>Now Taiwan is closely watching what China will do following its
enactment of the much-hated Anti-Secession Law, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, there is room for improved relations. "We are
expecting China to negotiate with us over substantive issues such as
direct charter passenger flights," he added.</P>
      <P>If progress can be made in this area, both sides can step onto
the road toward cooperation, instead of being bogged down by the
current impasse, Wu said.</P>
      <P>He promised that Taiwan will work hard in that direction, because
only when both sides engage in sincere cooperation can they
realistically begin political discussions that hopefully will lead to
permanent peace.</P>
      <P>In addition to direct charter passenger flights, he cited other
areas of potential cooperation, including charter cargo flights,
currency exchange, an investment guarantee pact, a financial
monitoring mechanism, avoidance of double taxation, judicial
agreement on protecting Taiwan businessmen in China, repatriation of
Chinese stowaways, and jointly combating cross-strait crime.</P>
      <P>Given Taiwan's democratic system and peace-loving people, he said
the government will not reject any proposal for a permanent solution
to cross-strait disputes as long as his 23 million fellow citizens
assent.</P>
      <P>Wu flew into Japan Tuesday for a visit during which he will also
exchange views with Japanese leaders on Taiwan's China policy and
Taiwan-Japan ties.</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>New York Times: Benedict XVI, 78, Was
John Paul II's Strict Defender of the Faith.

Roman Catholic cardinals reached to the church's conservative
wing on Tuesday and chose as the 265th pope Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, a seasoned and hard-line German theologian who served as
John Paul II's defender of the faith. The unusually brief conclave
seemed to suggest that Cardinal Ratzinger was a popular choice inside
the college of 115 cardinals who elected him as a man who shared - if
at times went beyond - John Paul's conservative theology and seemed
ready to take over the job after serving beside him for more than two
decades.

Wall Street Journal: In Choosing Pope, Church Stakes Future on
Its Base.

The election as pope of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, a 78-year-old
German theologian who once jokingly referred to his reputation as the
Vatican's "grand inquisitor, " signals the Roman Catholic Church will
march, not tiptoe, down the traditionalist path blazed by the late
John Paul II. In his two-decade career as John Paul's unyielding
enforcer of church doctrine, Cardinal Ratzinger, now Pope Benedict
XVI, has combated what he views as the chief adversaries of God and
the church: secularism and moral relativism. Many leading Catholics
yesterday viewed the choice of Benedict as a decision by the
cardinals to stake the future of Catholicism on its base -- its
teachings about God and Jesus, and its most-committed believers. That
is what many within the church feel is most urgently needed: a pope
who wants to reassert Catholic identity.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>DIFFERENCES ASIDE, GOV'T WILL TREAT OPPOSITION TRIPS WITH EVEN HAND</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will handle the trips
to China by the heads of the two main opposition parties with an
even hand, but the tenor of the Kuomintang (KMT) in its dealings with
the government has been " disrespectful, " Cho Jung-tai, a spokesman
for the Executive Yuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>As both the KMT and the People First Party (PFP) have announced
that their chairmen will separately visit China, Cho said the
Executive Yuan will deal with both trips according to the law, which
applies to everyone who goes to China from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under this principle, Cho said, anyone who intends to conclude
any agreement with China on matters falling within the government's
jurisdiction should get the government's authorization or consent
beforehand.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan, however, has received opposite responses from
the two parties on the issue, with the KMT refusing to contact the
administration before its chairman leaves for China; whereas the PFP
head has been more accommodating in revealing the party's plans to the
government.</P>
      <P>Cho said the KMT's reluctance to comply with the government's
request is quite disrespectful.</P>
      <P>Traveling to China does not entail any legal constraints imposed
by the government, Cho said, but it is necessary that any political
party or individual who has the intention to act as if it were a
representative of the Republic of China to get approval for any
actions that may be deemed to undermine the integrity of the
administration and the sovereignty of the nation.</P>
      <P>The KMT's response reflects the party's carefree attitude toward
the authorities, he added.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Cho said, PFP Chairman James Soong has
promised to convey to China the 10-point consensus reached by
President Chen Shui-bian and himself on Feb. 24.</P>
      <P>Calling the 10-point consensus a concise and comprehensive
reflection of the president's attitude toward China, Cho said Beijing
leaders can easily understand the president's opinions through their
talks with Soong.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. HOPES TO SEE REAL PROGRESS IN TAIWAN'S WHO BID: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  April 19 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States looks forward to
seeing incremental progress in Taiwan's bid to join the World Health
Organization (WHO) , Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randall G.
Schriver said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Schriver, who will leave his job at the Bureau of East Asian and
Pacific Affairs next month, made the remarks while meeting with
Taiwan journalists stationed in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Beijing has shown any softening of its aversion to
Taiwan's WHO bid, Schriver said Chinese authorities have not
indicated that they have a new position on the issue.</P>
      <P>"We continue to work on it. We have not only approached Beijing
on this issue, but also worked with countries we regard as friends
and the like-minded. So we'll see if we can achieve our ultimate
objective, which is observership for Taiwan in the WHO, and see if we
can make incremental progress in that direction," Schriver said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has sought to attend the annual World Health Assembly
(WHA) -- the WHO's decision-making body -- as an observer since 1997.
Due to Beijing's obstruction, Taiwan has yet to realize its goal.</P>
      <P>At last year's vote, the United States and Japan gave "yes"
votes, but China still managed to use its diplomatic clout to block
the bid.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan would ask for a vote at this year's World
Health Assembly scheduled for May in Geneva, Schriver said the United
States and Taiwan have discussed a range of options to be adopted
this year, including a vote.</P>
      <P>"The vote, we did that last year. We know the outcome. If our
friends in Taiwan want to pursue that again, they know they can count
on our support. But we are interested really not so much in a
symbolic move of any kind. We want to see real progress towards
meaningful participation for Taiwan in the WHO," Schriver said.</P>
      <P>"[An] example would be, if not observership, then Taiwan's
ability to participate in the work of the WHO, contribute to the WHO
in ways without any obstacles from Beijing," he explained.</P>
      <P>As to whether the European Union has shown support for Taiwan's
WHA observership, Schriver said: "The E.U. is part of our
consultations, but you'd better ask the E.U. on their position."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The time is not yet ripe for Taiwan and
mainland China to conduct political negotiations and it is better for
the two sides to hold talks on civilian exchanges to break the
present impasse across the Taiwan Strait, a political analyst said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Juan Ming, a senior advisor at the Taiwan Research Institute,
called on Lien Chan, head of the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT), to
hold talks on bolstering private-sector interactions when Lien visits
China April 26 to May 3 as a means of helping break the ice between
the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>It is not feasible for Lien to discuss political issues regarding
a peace accord or China's removal of its more than 700 missiles
targeting Taiwan at this juncture, he contended, suggesting that Lien
start two-way talks focusing on coordinated crime-fighting, direct
transportation and trade links and economic issues with Communist
Party of China (CPC) General Secretary Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>He reminded the KMT chairman not to be used as a tool in
Beijing's propaganda machine at a time when Beijing has passed its
Anti-Secession Law legislating "non-peaceful means" to deal with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also urged People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong, who
will also visit China in early May, to convey the opinions of the
people of Taiwan to CPC leaders that they will never accept Beijing's
Anti-Secession Law or give in to its military threats against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Juan, however, did not think that Soong would end up being
Beijing's stooge since the CPC approved of the 10-point agreement
signed Feb. 24 by Soong and President Chen Shui-bian that promises to
maintain the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>The anticipated Lien-Hu meeting will be the first tete-a-tete
between the top leaders of the KMT and the CPC since 1949, when the
KMT retreated to Taiwan after losing a civil war to the Chinese
Communists on the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA URGED NOT TO CHEAT WORLD COMMUNITY ABOUT TAWAIN'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 20 (CNA)
(BY Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 23 million people of Taiwan are
eligible to take part in the World Health Organization (WHO) in a
"direct, separate, complete and immediate" manner, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>If China is sincerely concerned about Taiwan people's health
rights, the ministry said, it should not block Taiwan's bid to join
the annual World Health Assembly -- the WHO's governing body -- as
an observer any more.</P>
      <P>China should also refrain from making hypocritical
statements to cheat the world community over its concern about
Taiwan's WHO participation, the ministry said in a news release.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to recent remarks by Li Weiyi, a
spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State Council,
that China is concerned about Taiwan people's health rights and has
come up with four basic principles regarding Taiwan's WHO
participation. Li claimed that Taiwan has so far not made any
response to China's proposals and he added that Beijing is willing to
discuss with the WHO Secretariat to work out a "special arrangement"
for Taiwan's to participate.</P>
      <P>The ministry said Chinese authorities have never clearly fleshed
out its so-called "four basic principles."</P>
      <P>Probably, the ministry said, the "four basic principles" referred
to statements made by China's deputy health minister at the 2004
World Health Assembly in Geneva. According to the statements, only
Taiwan's medical and health-care personnel would be allowed to take
part in the WHO's technical activities. Moreover, China would treat
Taiwan as a local government under its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The ministry said Beijing's such principles are
absolutely unacceptable to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Stressing that interaction between Taiwan and the WHO should
be based on reciprocity, the ministry said such interaction should
not be denigrated as technological exchanges between Taiwan's medical
personnel and the WHO.</P>
      <P>The ministry pointed out that Taiwan's jurisdiction covers 1.5
million sorties of flights over its flight information zone, 220,000
sorties of takeoffs and landings at its international airports with a
combined traffic volume of more than 21 million passengers, and more
than 50,000 inbound and outbound cargo ships.</P>
      <P>Given such heavy international traffic volume, the
ministry said, Taiwan should be included into the world health and
disease control system. Without Taiwan's participation, the
ministry said, the WHO-initiated global health system will be
flawed and handicapped.</P>
      <P>Noting that the soon-to-be-completed International Health
Regulations are aimed at regulating epidemic control and public
health affairs amid ever-growing international interactions,
the ministry said the WHO should admit Taiwan into its fold
to realize its noble goal of "health for all."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 20 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 20,000 medical professionals from
around the island gathered in downtown Taipei Wednesday afternoon to
stage a noisy protest against a government decision to impose a limit
on health care finances, a measure they claim threatens their
survival.</P>
      <P>Many well-known doctors, hospital executives and fellow workers
in the health care industry were petitioning the government and the
legislature to rescind the decision to limit the total reimbursement,
demanding a more "reasonable" reform of the health care system.</P>
      <P>Organizers said the number of participants broke the 20,000-mark
because as many as 70 percent of clinics shut down, and even family
members of the health providers joined in the march, affecting up to
200,000 patients.</P>
      <P>The protesters' loud cries apparently reached the ears of Premier
Frank Hsieh, who promised to take into account the views of medical
professionals as well as the general public as to what to do about
the cash-strapped national health insurance program.</P>
      <P>Minister of Health Hou Sheng-mou said it was sad to see some of
his former colleagues taking to the streets over an issue that can be
solved through robust dialogue. "The government's door to negotiation
is always wide open," he said.</P>
      <P>Jao Yung-ching, convener of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party's legislative caucus, called on the medical workers to be
patient and wait for the government to come up with a comprehensive
reform proposal.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Health-care Reform Foundation did not quite agree with
the protesters, saying individual hospitals and clinics must open
their books for public review so that people will know whether they
are really poor or just hypochondriacs.</P>
      <P>Besides opening up their accounting books, all hospitals must
also have their quality of service examined and meet the same
standards, so real solutions can be found to ease the financial
crisis of the health care system, it added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO IMPACT ON TAIWAN AGRICULTURE SMALLER THAN EXPECTED: COA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  12 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The impact of Taiwan's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) has been smaller than expected, proof
that the government has adequately handled the thorny issue to date,
Council of Agriculture (COA) Chairman Lee Chin-lung said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in a speech delivered at a seminar held
jointly by the COA and National Chung Hsing University in northern
Hsinchu County. More than 140 representatives from the government and
the academic sector took part.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the COA has been doing all it can to advocate a
competitive, high-quality and eco-friendly agriculture sector in
recent years to help Taiwan farmers sell more in the global market
after the country joined the WTO in Jan. 2002.</P>
      <P>Noting that the core function of the COA is to protect and boost
interests of local farmers and fishermen, Lee reported that the
government increased the COA's budget to NT$122 billion (US$3.87
billion) for 2005 in order to better take care of these people.</P>
      <P>Statistics made public April 18 by the COA's Fisheries
Administration show that the average wholesale price of marine
products in the domestic market was NT$53 per kilogram last year, a
slight increase of 0.2 percent over the 2002 level.</P>
      <P>Both the inbound and outbound shipments of fishery goods
decreased in volume but grew in value in 2004 compared to the
previous year's levels, according to the same tallies.</P>
      <P>Last year, 114,155 metric tons of marine delicacies worth
US$311.2 million were imported to Taiwan, down by 1.3 percent and up
by 2 percent compared to the 2003 figure, respectively. Frozen tuna
and crustacea were the mainstays.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 531,572 metric tons of seafood valued at US$1.463
billion were exported, off by 6.6 percent and up by 12.2 percent year
to year, respectively.</P>
      <P>According to Fisheries Administration officials, Taiwan's fishery
industry has come under fiercer foreign competition after the country
entered the WTO. To help it grow sustainably, the administration has
been actively exploring markets offshore for domestic fishermen and
encouraging the public to eat more seafood, they said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's health officials and medical
workers took heart Wednesday upon hearing of a United States
official's public support for the country's bid to join the World
Health Assembly (WHA).</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-hsiou, the director for the International Cooperation
Bureau under the Department of Health said he appreciates U.S.
Deputy Assistant Secretary Randall Schriver's Tuesday statement in
Washington that his department has approached Beijing and is working
with friendly countries to help Taiwan participate in the WHA.</P>
      <P>Noting that this is the second time in one week that Schriver has
voiced U.S. support for Taiwan on the issue, Chang said he is
optimistic about the prospect of Taiwan's eventually participation in
the WHO.</P>
      <P>In addition to counting on friendly states' support, Chang said,
the Department of Health is trying to enhance the country's
international presence by generously providing medical aid to
countries in need, such as Indonesia, Thailand and the Maldives after
these countries were ravaged by tsunamis on Dec. 26 last year.</P>
      <P>The more actively Taiwan joins international rescue operations,
the easier it will be for Taiwan to win support for its WHA bid,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Dr. Deng Jou-fang, the president of the Taiwan International
Medical Alliance, which has campaigned for Taiwan's involvement in
international bodies for years, said Washington's support will boost
Taiwan's WHA attempts on the international stage and will facilitate

the dialogue will help the two sides of the Atlantic Ocean to sort

democratizing trend in Southeast Asia, Rice said.</P>
      <P>Citing the conflicting views between the United States and Europe
on whether the EU should lift its arms embargo on China, Rice said it
stems from the two sides' different understanding of the security

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian called for
support for a "reading" promotion project launched by the Ministry of
Education (MOE) to help disadvantaged children or those residing in
remote areas enjoy the pleasure of books and reading.</P>
      <P>Noting that books can offer knowledge and inspiration for young
children, Chen said he hopes local parents can accompany their
children in exploring the "wonderful world of reading."</P>
      <P>Chen made the appeal in an article appearing in the latest
edition of an online weekly that bears his nickname, "A-bian."</P>
      <P>The president recalled that he took the initiative last June to
help school children in remote regions discover the joys of reading.
In line with his directive, Chen said, the MOE has since launched a
"Reading 300" campaign aimed at recruiting volunteers to guide school
children at 30 selected elementary schools in remote mountainous
regions over three years to read books.</P>
      <P>To the best of his understanding, Chen said, conscripts
performing alternative service, retired school principals and
teachers, housewives, college volunteers, and social group members
have joined the project to accompany and guide disadvantaged children
in exploring the pleasures of reading.</P>
      <P>With the advent of the April 23 World Book Day, designated by
UNESCO, Chen said the MOE will sponsor a "Book Is the Best Gift"
campaign Friday to promote reading. The activity will include
inviting 40 school children from remote regions to listen to stories
at a Taipei bookstore and presenting awards to volunteer mothers who
have devoted their leisure time to assisting disadvantaged school
children in reading.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese dissident living in the United
States recently issued a public letter, urging Taiwan's opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan to raise questions regarding China's
democratization while meeting with Beijing leaders during his
upcoming visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lien will visit mainland China next week at the invitation of
Chinese Communist Party Secretary General and Chinese President Hu
Jintao.</P>
      <P>According to a Voice of America report, Wang Dan, a former leader
in the 1989 democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, said in the
letter that he and other Chinese dissidents abroad would like to see
any ideas and actions that would help reduce cross-Taiwan Strait
tensions and promote democratic development on both sides of the
strait.</P>
      <P>The key problem in the cross-strait relationship is the different
systems on the two sides, Wang said, stressing that the lack of
democracy on the mainland is the main factor that has prevented the
two sides from reuniting.</P>
      <P>Wang said that if mainland China cannot democratize, then "the
KMT's unification idea will remain unrealistic."</P>
      <P>Since the KMT has an opportunity to hold face-to-face talks with
the Chinese Communist Party, it has the responsibility to let the
Beijing leaders realize the Taiwan people's hope to see
democratization on the mainland, he added.</P>
      <P>"I hope that Lien will not avoid raising the issue, otherwise,
his visit to the mainland will be meaningless," Wang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. State Department looks
favorably on Taiwan opposition leaders' upcoming visits to China,
deputy spokesman Adam Ereli said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ereli made the remarks at a routine news briefing when asked
about the State Department's views on the forthcoming visits to China
by two Taiwan opposition heavyweights -- Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, Ereli said, the United States believes that
dialogue is the best way to reduce tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"We look favorably on and welcome steps in that direction. Recent
travels to China by Taiwanese individuals are positive steps, " Ereli
said.</P>
      <P>Asked whether such visits could complicate cross-strait
relations, Ereli said he wouldn't get into the politics of it because
the politics of it is not the issue for the United States.</P>
      <P>"The issue for us is people on both sides of the strait taking
steps to come to understandings that are acceptable to both sides and
that work to reduce tensions," Ereli added.</P>
      <P>Chinese President Hu Jintao has invited Lien and Soong to visit
China in his capacity as general secretary of the Communist Party of
China. Lien is scheduled to depart Taipei April 26 for what he calls
an eight-day "journey of peace" to the Chinese mainland. Soong is
scheduled to travel to China in the first half of May.</P>
      <P>U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randall G. Schriver said
Tuesday that Chinese leaders will ultimately have to talk with
popularly elected leaders in Taiwan if they want their engagements
with Taiwan's opposition figures to be productive.</P>
      <P>"As we've said on the record before, our view is that on the
margins, dialogue is better than no dialogue at all, and we think
talking is better than not talking," Schriver pointed out.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Schriver added that ultimately how these trips will
be viewed will depend on a number of variables.</P>
      <P>"Will this diplomacy be a mechanism for moving forward?
Subsequently, will it contribute eventually to dialogue broader
across the political spectrum in Taiwan? Or will it be limited to
just reaching out to the opposition in the tensely divisive mood
internally in Taiwan's domestic politics? We just don't know yet, "
Schriver said.</P>
      <P>"So we are watching this carefully. And genuinely, on the
margins, we think, dialogue is better than no dialogue. And we'll see
how this plays in Taiwan," he added..</P>
      <P>Ultimately, Schriver continued, "for this to be productive for
all parties, the leaders in Beijing will ultimately have to talk to
elected leaders in Taiwan and the government that's in power."</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) announced Thursday that he will withdraw from the KMT primary
for the Taipei County magistrate election to throw his weight behind
another strong contender.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Lee Chia-chin made the announcement at a press
conference jointly held by himself and Chou Hsi-wei, a legislator of
the opposition People First Party (PFP) who recently returned to the
KMT fold to boost his chances of winning the year-end election.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that the "pan-blue alliance" of the KMT and the PFP has
lost the Taipei County magistrate election the last four times, which 
he attributed mainly to the divisions within the alliance.</P>
      <P>He said that he has had frequent contact with the "pan-blue's"
grass-roots supporters recently and has learned that their biggest
aspiration is to see the alliance win the Taipei County magistrate
election.</P>
      <P>After careful thought, Lee said, he has decided to withdraw from
the race to "make the first move toward the solidarity of the
'pan-blue alliance.'"</P>
      <P>Lee expressed his appreciation for his supporters, but said with
emotion that "the battle has been fought" and that he hopes his
withdrawal will contribute to the solidarity of the "pan-blue
alliance."</P>
      <P>He also lauded Chou as a talented person, saying that the two of
them had developed a close relationship during the 2004 presidential
election race when the KMT and PFP fielded a joint ticket and he was
the KMT whip and Chou was the PFP whip.</P>
      <P>Chou's election as magistrate would benefit Taipei County, Lee
claimed, adding that he has promised to serve as Chou's campaign
manager.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chou said that Lee took the initiative to call him
about withdrawing from the race due to concerns that bickering in the
KMT primary might lead to divisions in the "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>Chou also said that Lee supports him because Lee thinks he has a
better chance of winning the Taipei County magistrate. Noting that
Lee had prepared for the election for quite some time, Chou said he
admires Lee's courage for quitting the race now.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, another KMT aspirant for the Taipei County magistrate
post, Legislator Hung Hsiu-chu, said she is "perplexed" by Lee's
abrupt announcement of withdrawal. Nevertheless, she added that she
will continue to run in the race with a "spirit of sportsmanship."</P>

organizations to station staff in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang Legislators Wu Ying-yi, Ker Chun-hsiuang and Chang

Taiwan's politics, which it said has not contributed to cross-strait

a universal value championed by President Chen Shui-bian and a value
which "should not be compromised for any reason."</P>
      <P>Hung Hsi-ming, president of the Taipei-based Chinese Senior
Reporter Association, said the association regrets the MAC's
decision, adding that the ban has hurt cross-strait journalistic
exchanges and resulted in controversy in the international community.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) raised a "five noes" proposal Thursday, asking
two opposition leaders who will soon pay visits to mainland China
separately not to forget to protect the interests of the people on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>TSU legislative whip Lo Chih-ming urged Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Lien Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong to let
Communist Party of China (CPC) General Secretary Hu Jintao know how
the people of Taiwan feel when the two meet Hu, also the Chinese
president, in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Reminding Lien and Soong that their social status and fame came
from public support in Taiwan, Lo said that the two men should spell
out the "five noes" to Hu: the people of Taiwan denounce Beijing's
military threats, do not agree with its diplomatic blockade of
Taiwan, do not accept its Anti-Secession Law, cannot accept its
concept of the disputed "1992 consensus" and cannot condone its more
than 700 missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although President Chen Shui-bian and Soong signed Feb. 24 a
10-point agreement promising to maintain the cross-Taiwan Strait
status quo, Lo claimed that the Chen-Soong accord failed to help
consolidate and forge a consensus in Taiwan society regarding
Taiwan-China relations.</P>
      <P>Asking Soong not to kowtow to Beijing regarding the 10-point
Chen-Soong accord, TSU lawmakers wanted Soong to sign a pledge to vow
that he will not recognize the "1992 consensus" before he leaves for
China in early May.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien has decided to visit China April 26 to May 3, a
move that is expected to end the long-standing hostility between the
KMT and the CPC that has existed over the last 70 years.</P>
      <P>The TSU and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party form the
pro-independence "pan green camp, " while the "pan blue alliance" of
the KMT, the PFP and the New Party back maintaining the cross-strait
status quo prior to eventual unification with a democratic China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Election Commission (CEC) held
a draw Thursday to assign numerical designations to each of the
various political parties and groups participating in the May 14
National Assembly election.</P>
      <P>Seizing the opportunity to drum up support, ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) candidates chanted the slogan "everybody go,
constitutional reform go go go" after the party drew No. 8.</P>
      <P>DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang and senior presidential adviser
Yeh Chu-lan, who tops the party's candidate list, presented a
carnation garland to each DPP candidate and handed out carnations to
onlookers to play up the party's campaign theme, namely "Carnation
Constitutional Reform."</P>
      <P>Not to be outdone, candidates of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, led
by Secretary-General Chen Chien-ming, brought along the party's
mascot -- an ant -- and promoted their bid to draft a new
constitution and change the official name of the country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Democratic Action Alliance staged a demonstration
at the scene to express their opposition to what they called a
"harebrained constitutional reform" and ask for a public debate on
the issue.</P>
      <P>The 300 seats for the ad hoc National Assembly will be allotted
to the various parties and groups based on the proportion of votes
they each garner in the upcoming election.</P>
      <P>The mission of the National Assembly will be to consider a
constitutional amendment package adopted by the Legislative Yuan last
August. Items in the package include reducing the number of
legislative seats from the present 225 to 113 and adopting a "single
seat, two votes" legislative electoral system starting with the
seventh legislature to be elected in 2007, as well as phasing out the
National Assembly to allow for popular referendums on future
constitutional amendments.</P>
      <P>Also on Thursday, opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
reaffirmed his party's support for the proposed amendments while
presiding over the inauguration of a campaign mission for the
election.</P>
      <P>Lien insisted that amending the Constitution is the only way to
achieve constitutional reform, saying the KMT opposes any attempts by
any pro-independence groups to abolish the Constitution to create a
new one.</P>
      <P>In an effort to boost the voter turnout rate in the election, the
CEC will hold a "lucky draw" for people who go to the polls. The top
prize will be NT$1 million (US$31,556) in cash, while notebook
computers will be given to three second prize winners. Other prizes
up for grabs include five digital cameras, eight mobile phones, 10
translation machines and 15 MP3 players.</P>

Anti-Secession Law and Its Aftermath, " which was sponsored by the
University of California at Los Angeles and the Asia Society's branch
in southern California.</P>
      <P>Liu said that since China's passage of the law, which codifies
the use of force against Taiwan should it move formally to
independence, the United States, Japan and Australia have expressed
strong opposition to the legislation. Other countries in Asia and the
European Union also disagree with the law, Liu added.</P>
      <P>She cited the example of the EU, saying that some EU members who
had originally wanted to lift the EU arms embargo against China have
decided to delay taking such a move after Beijing's passage of the
law and the strong opposition from the United States.</P>
      <P>Liu also told participating U.S. scholars about a massive march
in Taiwan on March 26, in which hundreds of thousands of people took
to the streets to express their displeasure over the law, and the
Legislative Yuan also passed a resolution to oppose it.</P>
      <P>Beijing's defense budget increasing at a double-digit rate in
recent years is a clear indication that the threat to Taiwan is
growing, Liu said. In addition, Beijing has always adopted
two-pronged tactics, using the rivalry between the ruling and the
opposition parties to drive a wedge within the island.</P>
      <P>Liu cited as an example how Beijing has recently overlooked the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) to talk directly with
opposition parties, which is an attempt to force President Chen
Shui-bian to come to terms with its cherished "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>She said that opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan has been
opposed to President Chen for years, and has not recognized the
ruling position of President Chen and the DPP.</P>
      <P>For this reason, when Lien goes to China next Tuesday for a visit
at the invitation of Chinese leaders, he will only "represent
himself, " adding that his words and deeds will not stand for Taiwan
or the nation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN SHOULD MEET WITH PRESIDENT PRIOR TO CHINA VISIT: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan should meet with President Chen Shui-bian prior to his departure
for a historic visit to China, according to a majority of respondents
to a recent survey, said pollsters Thursday.</P>
      <P>The survey of 1,117 adults was conducted April 11-12 to explore
local people's opinions about the latest developments in the
situation across the Taiwan Strait. The findings will be presented to
Cabinet members for reference in policy formulation.</P>
      <P>According to the poll results, 58.8 percent said they thought
that Lien should meet with President Chen prior to his China visit
and discuss themes of his agenda; only 19.1 percent said they were
opposed to such a proposal.</P>
      <P>A cross analysis of the survey findings showed that even among
the "pan-blue alliance" supporters, proponents of the proposal
outnumbered opponents, 49.7 percent to 34.6 percent; the ratio even
reached 59.2 percent among those without party affiliations or
preferences. The "pan-blue alliance," referring to the KMT and its two
splinter groups -- the People First Party and the New Party,
advocates a more conciliatory approach toward China and wants
Taiwan's eventual unification with a democratic China.</P>
      <P>Among the 740 respondents who said they were aware of KMT Vice
Chairman P. K. Chiang's March 28 to April 1 visit to China without
prior consultations with the government and his signing of a 10-point
consensus with Beijing authorities, 59.7 percent said they felt that
Chiang's moves were inappropriate, compared to 21.9 percent who
supported Chiang.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 46.2 percent said they supported prosecution
authorities' probes into Chiang's moves to determine whether they
broke any existing laws, but 36.1 percent disagreed with any judicial
probes.</P>
      <P>Lien, heading a large KMT delegation, is scheduled to depart for
what he bills as a "journey of peace" to China April 26. He will be
the first KMT chairman ever to visit China since the party, which
once ruled all of China, retreated to Taiwan after losing a bloody
civil war to the Chinese Communists in 1949.</P>

      <P>A People First Party (PFP) mission led by
Secretary-General Chin Ching-sheng is expected to leave for mainland
China this coming Saturday to arrange for a visit by party chairman
James Soong, a key party official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Hsien-yao, director of the PFP's Policy Center, who is
currently in Beijing to exchange views with Communist Party of China
(CPC) officials regarding Soong's planned visit slated for early May,
told the Central News Agency in a telephone interview that he fully
sensed the CPC's goodwill and sincerity and added that the PFP group
should be able to go to China Saturday.</P>
      <P>The CPC has expressed the hope to get a better understanding of
Soong's viewpoints on Taiwan-China relations, he said.</P>
      <P>PFP spokesman Hsieh Kung-ping said a day earlier that the PFP has
never deviated from its stance regarding the cross-Taiwan Strait
relationship that advocates "no war, no Taiwan independence and
maintaining the status quo of the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>According to PFP officials, Soong will not act as an envoy for
President Chen Shui-bian or relay any messages from Chen when he
meets CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Soong is likely to discuss practical issues regarding
agriculture, security and direct trade, transport and postal links
with CPC officials, they said.</P>
      <P>Apart from Soong, main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien

    <HEADLINE>GRAPES CULTIVATED UNDER POWER-SAVING LIGHTS SAVE MONEY FOR GROWERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  21 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Grapes that will grow in commercial
quantities in greenhouses under artificial power-saving lights have
been successfully developed by the Taichung District Agricultural
Improvement Station, the Council of Agriculture (COA) reported
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Technology used in the indoor cultivation of grapes, developed by
the COA' s Taichung station and claimed to be the first of its kind
in the world, has enabled Taiwan grape growers to produce the
delicious fruit almost all year round, as opposed to only one harvest
a year as in most other countries, COA Taichung station researchers
said.</P>
      <P>In addition to using fluorescent, power-saving lights at the
greenhouses, the COA researchers have also adopted other botanical
technologies, including tree-by-tree pruning and germination, to
adjust and shorten the grape trees' production period.</P>
      <P>According to the researchers, production of grapes from
greenhouses where no artificial lighting was provided averages about
600 to 700 kilograms from each quarter acre of land, but the
production can be increased to 800 to 1,000 kilograms if additional
lights are used.</P>
      <P>Until recently, many grape growers, mostly in central Taiwan,
have still been using mercury lamps during winter in their grape
greenhouses, which use a great deal of electricity.</P>
      <P>However, according to the researchers, using fluorescent or
power-saving lights can cut costs significantly -- by 30 percent to
50 percent -- consequently helping lower the growers' production
overhead.</P>

      <P>The number of fake VISA credit cards in
Taiwan plunged to a four-year low of 0.04 percent in December 2004,
from a high of 0.34 percent at the end of 2000, according to a recent
report by VISA International Service Association.</P>
      <P>According to a VISA executive, the number of counterfeit VISA
cards in Taiwan decreased sharply in the past four years, making
Taiwan the best example in clamping down on card forgery.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's fake card rate still stood at 0.34 percent at the end of
2000, triple the average in the Asia-Pacific region, while the value
of losses incurred from transactions with doctored cards also slid by
83 percent, the VISA executive noted, praising Taiwan for outshining
other countries in the region by making the most outstanding progress
in countering forged cards.</P>
      <P>He said that VISA will continue cooperating with Taiwan's
card-issuing banks and the police to further step up smart card
payment security in stores and wipe out counterfeiting, despite the
fact that the Taiwan credit card market is quite mature and strong in
terms of risk management.</P>
      <P>To achieve the goal, VISA has started to introduce EMV VISA cards
around the world, with the number of multi-application, multi-purpose
chip cards having reached 3 million in Taiwan as of the end of 2004,
a rise from around 1 million in the middle of that year, a VISA
Taiwan executive said.</P>
      <P>For the time being, nearly all VISA member banks in Taiwan have
had their franchise stores install reading machines certificated by
VISA and based on EMV specifications to secure a safer payment
environment, VISA statistics show.</P>
      <P>VISA forecast that the number of transactions made with EMV VISA
cards in Taiwan will grow to 5 million per month in 2005, well up
from the current monthly level of 2 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD URGED TO DESCRIBE TAIWAN AS INDEPENDENT IN CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan should clearly state to Chinese leaders that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait are independent of each other during his upcoming
visit to China, the nation's top China policy charter said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The statement, issued in a news release by the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) , was in response to Lien's remarks the previous day
that he will use the phrase "separate rule" to describe the present
status between the two sides of the strait.</P>
      <P>The MAC noted that China's recently enacted Anti-Secession Law
clearly states that Taiwan is part of China and that Taiwan can enjoy
a high degree of autonomy under the "one country, two systems"
formula.</P>
      <P>Lien also said Feb. 17, 2000 when he was vice president that the
"special state-to-state" cross-strait relations conform with the de
jure "separate rule, independent" reality of both sides of the
strait, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>If Lien advocates only "separate rule" during his April 26-May 3
visit to China, he will fall into Beijing's cherished "one China"
trap, according to the MAC.</P>
      <P>If Lien does not clearly state that the Republic of China is an
sovereign, independent state and that its sovereignty belongs to the
23 million people of the country, and that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait are under separate rule and independent of each other,
then "it will undermine the national sovereignty of the Republic of
China," the statement said.</P>
      <P>The MAC said that since President Chen Shui-bian first assumed
the presidency in 2000, he has promoted cross-strait relations under
the principles of peace and development, and his stance has always
been insistence on a sovereign, independent ROC.</P>
      <P>The MAC stressed that the Taiwan people want cross-strait peace
with dignity and that they strongly oppose China's use of the
Anti-Secession Law as an excuse to use "non-peaceful means" against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It expressed the hope that any political figures visiting China
will express unequivocally to the Chinese leadership the mainstream
public opinion in Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT CONTACT KEY TO CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff
urged China Thursday to open government-to-government contact across
the Taiwan Strait to boost bilateral exchanges.</P>
      <P>Yu Shyi-kun, secretary-general to the president, made the call
ahead of visits to China by two opposition leaders at the invitation
of Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of this year, Yu said, the two sides had
friendly engagements, including the opening of non-stop cross-strait
charter flights during the Chinese New Year holiday and the arrival
of three Chinese officials to attend the funeral of the late Straits
Exchange Foundation Chairman Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>However, Yu said, the amicable atmosphere faded after China's
enactment of its anti-secession law that codifies the use of
non-peaceful means against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since the enactment of that legislation, cross-strait relations
have been stalled, Yu said, adding that Taiwan does not like this
retreat or setback in cross-strait engagements.</P>
      <P>If China has goodwill and sincerity, Yu said, it should
immediately start government-to-government consultations.</P>
      <P>"Government-to-government contact is the right way for
cross-strait engagements and only by so doing can cross-strait
exchanges, peace, reciprocity and cooperation make headway for mutual
benefits," Yu said, adding that official cross-strait engagements are
the core of regional and international concerns about the
developments in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>If China insists on ignoring Taiwan's ruling party while engaging
its opposition parties, Yu said, this will not only cause divisions
in local society but will also draw different opinions from the
international community.</P>
      <P>For instance, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Randall G.
Schriver said Tuesday that the Chinese leadership will ultimately
have to talk with popularly elected leaders in Taiwan if they want
their engagements with Taiwan's opposition figures to be productive.</P>
      <P>Hu has invited opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and
People First Party Chairman James Soong to visit China, separately,
in his capacity as general secretary of the Communist Party of China.
Lien, a former vice president of the Republic of China, is scheduled
to depart for what he bills as a "journey of peace" to China April
26, while Soong plans to visit China in the first half of May.</P>

      <P>Two Taiwan medical groups are scheduled to
depart for the Dominican Republic Friday to provide week-long free
medical services to people in the Central American ally of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Some 20 doctors, nurses and pharmacists with the Taiwan Roots
Medical Peace Corps and the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation of
Taiwan are scheduled to stay at the Taiwan Hospital -- the first
medical institution that the Republic of China government built for
the Dominican people -- located in a rural township some 4 hours from
capital Santo Domingo, said Liu Chi-hsiang, chairman of the Taiwan
Roots Medical Peace Corps.</P>
      <P>During their stay, the two groups will treat some 50 patients
with harelips as well as burn victims, said Liu, who visited the
country last August with another Taiwan Roots mission.</P>
      <P>The two groups are making the trip at the invitation of ROC
Ambassador to the Dominican Republic John Feng, who was largely
instrumental in making possible the establishment of the Taiwan
Hospital, which became operational April 1.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the

    <TEXT>New York Times: Pope May Color Debate in
U.S. Over 'Life' Issues Like Abortion.

The election of an unstintingly conservative pope could inject a
powerful new force into the intense conflicts in American politics
over abortion and other social issues, which put many Catholic
elected officials at odds with their church. Pope Benedict XVI
ascends to power at a tumultuous time for his church in American
politics: Catholic voters, long overwhelmingly Democratic, have
become a critical swing vote. Republicans have become increasingly
successful at winning the support of more traditional Catholics by
appealing to what President Bush calls the "culture of life" issues,
including abortion, euthanasia and research on embryonic stem cells.
Bush carried 56 percent of the white Catholic vote in 2004, up from
51 percent in 2000 - a formidable part of his conservative coalition.

Wall Street Journal: Cram Sessions, For High Schoolers, Summer Is
High Time to Polish Resumes.

Getting into America's elite colleges has neverbe en tougher, and
now, in addition to grades and test scores, essays, recommendations
and class rank, there's this for teens and their parents to worry
about: summer. "Summers are import ant, big time, " says Lloyd
Peterson, vice president of College Coach LLC, which charges $3,499
for its college-counseling services. "The more prestigious the
school, the more important the summers are." A record 16.7 million
students are expected to enroll in college next fall, 1.2 million
more than five years ago. The U.S. education department expects up to
18.8 million enrollees eight years from now. At the same time,
ambitious high-school students are loading up on advanced-placement
classes and taking prep courses to boost their scores on
college-admissions tests, heightening the competition. With the glut
of high-scoring applicants, colleges are paying closer attention to
factors such as community service, artistic talent, leadership -- and
summers. "There's more demand than we can accommodate at the
selective institutions. What do you do? You need some tie-breakers, "

    <HEADLINE>EXPORT ORDERS IN MARCH REACH RECORD HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Elisa  Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The value of export orders received by
Taiwan manufacturers reached a record high of US$20.89 billion in
March, according to statistics released by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) Thursday.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials attributed the growth mainly to the stable
economic recovery in Europe, the United States and several Asian
countries.</P>
      <P>Cumulatively, the value of export orders received by Taiwan
manufacturers in the first quarter totalled US$55.51 billion, a
growth of 20.13 percent over the same period of last year.</P>
      <P>In March, the value of export orders received from Hong Kong --
one of the major outlets for Taiwan products -- reached US$5.07
billion, also a record high.</P>
      <P>Among the export items, electronic products registered a US$610
million growth in March on a year-on-year basis, while the transport
equipment increased by US$540 million, thanks to several big orders
received by China Shipbuilding Corp.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials estimated that export orders received in the
second quarter will also enjoy double-digit growth over the same
period of last year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the results of a recent survey show that 27.26 percent
of the manufacturers polled believed that export orders will increase
in April, while 23.26 percent thought orders will decrease, with
49.48 percent believing that export prospects will remain the same.</P>
      <P>Chang Yaw-tzong, director-general of the MOEA's Statistics
Department, noted that China's plan to cool off its economy and its
just promulgated Anti-Secession Law, as well as the prosperity of the
American market, will be the factors affecting Taiwan's exports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN ISSUE SHOULD BE SOLVED BY FOUR COUNTRIES: EX-PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui accused two
opposition leaders who are set to visit China of "trying to connive
with China to sell out Taiwan" Thursday, arguing that the Taiwan
issue should be solved by the United States, Japan, China and Taiwan
rather than by talks between Chinese leaders and the two opposition
figures.</P>
      <P>Flanked by groups of pro-independence activists, Lee told a news
conference that the planned trips to China by Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong
and their expected meetings with Chinese President Hu Jintao in
Beijing are wrong in regard of time, place and form.</P>
      <P>Lee, who served as president and KMT chairman concurrently
between 1988 and 2000, claimed that the Taiwan issue is an
international issue and its solution depends on international talks
involving Taiwan, China, United States and Japan and in a place other
than Beijing -- preferably the United States.</P>
      <P>Talks in Beijing about the Taiwan issue, such as the ones to take
place between Lien and Hu and Soong and Hu, will only result in
Taiwan's annexation by China, Lee claimed without elaborating.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, the timing of the trips, slated for late this month
and early next month, respectively, is especially inappropriate in
light of China's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law March 14 that
provides the legal basis for use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Their visits will send the wrong message to the world that Taiwan
people who rallied in Taipei March 26 to protest against the
Anti-Secession Law do not really care about the Chinese threat,
according to Lee.</P>
      <P>He added that any talks with China should be conducted by the
government rather than political parties.</P>
      <P>He claimed that Lien and Soong are ignoring the country's dignity
and people's interests, and risking national security, and called on
President Chen Shui-bian to stop them.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government is investigating KMT Vice Chairman
P.K. Chiang for reaching a consensus with Chinese officials during
a visit he made to Beijing in March, Lee urged the government to serve
justice rapidly in Chiang's case, which will deter other
politicians from following suit.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan should
bring to the attention of Chinese President Hu Jintao the concerns of
the Taiwan people, particularly the deleterious effects that the
Anti-Secession Law created, a leading Taiwan think tank members said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lai Yi-chung, the director of Taiwan Thinktank's International
Department said Lien should take the chance to protest against
China's Anti-Secession Law and its practice of forcing Taiwan
businessmen operating in China to rally behind Beijing in its dispute
with Taipei.</P>
      <P>Also, Lai said, Lien should explain to his Taiwan compatriots his
stance on Beijing's "one China" principle before he heads for China
on May 26.</P>
      <P>No one will oppose what the KMT claims to be Lien's "journey for
peace, " Lai said, but Lien owes his people an explanation about his
view of Taiwan-China relations and dispel any doubts about his tour.</P>
      <P>He dismissed Lien's trip as only a political attempt by the KMT
to bring itself back into the center of the political arena after
being sidelined by the reconciliation of People First Party Chairman
James Soong and President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>However, Lien's attempts were foiled in this regard because Hu
Jintao followed his invitation to Lien with a similar invitation to
Soong, whose trip is sure to outshine that of Lien's because he will
convey to Beijing leaders a 10-point consensus he reached with
President Chen during a Feb. 24 meeting, Lai went on.</P>
      <P>Compared with Soong's planned trip, Lien's tour of China will be
much less significant, Lai claimed.</P>

freedom of speech, Yu said that as the head of state and a "balancer
of diverse voices, " Chen has listened to Lee with sincerity.</P>
      <P>When asked by reporters whether there will be a meeting between
Chen and Lee in the near future, Yu said that Chen and Lee used to
maintain "smooth" channels of communication, but added that he had no
idea whether the two will meet again soon.</P>
      <P>Lee fired a broadside Thursday at opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong -- who are
scheduled to embark on visits to China April 26 and early May,
respectively -- calling them "traitors to Taiwan."</P>

officials estimated Thursday that Taiwan's manufacturing production
will show slight growth in the second quarter following a decrease
recorded in the first quarter.</P>
      <P>MOEA statistics show that the industrial production index stood
at 130.38 in March, a drop of 0.78 percent over the same month of

      <P>Chang Yaw-tzong, director-general of the MOEA's Statistics

was mainly because of the less-than-expected global economic

    <TEXT>
      <P>With a 100-year history in terms of its
private corporate development, India is a better destination than
China for Taiwanese investment, an Indian official based in Taiwan
claimed Thursday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a Taipei seminar on investment and trade in India,
India-Taipei Association Director-General Vijay Gokhale noted that
India has a vast potential market with a middle-class population of
150 million that is expected to grow to 300 million by 2009.</P>
      <P>Compared with China, India enjoys more advantages because the
policies of the Indian government are stable and its direction is
clear, Gokhale said.</P>
      <P>While the two major political parties in India both agree that
economic openness is the only path for the country, the trade
openness policy has remained unchanged since its implementation in
1993, Gokhale pointed out.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, the industrial sectors of Taiwan and
India complement each other. For example, Taiwan is a major supplier
of machinery in the world and can meet India's demands, he said.</P>
      <P>According to Gokhale, the soaring international oil prices and
the rise of the Indian currency have not impacted the country's
imports and exports.</P>
      <P>India has signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with Thailand and
is currently holding FTA talks with Singapore and China, he added.</P>

Hou said the special team has not been daunted by criticism about its
identification last month of Chen Yi-hsiung as the shooter.</P>
      <P>Hou said the team has been working in the right direction. "We
have been tracing the suspect by pinpointing the source of the two
homemade bullets found at the crime scene," he said.</P>
      <P>Because Chen Yi-hsiung is dead, many people have said the team's
claim is not convincing. However, Hou claimed it is a fact. He said
the team has continued to work hard to find more evidence to prove
its claim and clarify suspicious points.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-hsiung, 63, was found dead in Anping harbor in the
southern city of Tainan March 29 last year -- 10 days after the
shooting.</P>
      <P>President Chen and Vice President Annette Lu were slightly
wounded when two homemade bullets grazed them as they campaigned in
an open-topped jeep in Tainan March 19, 2004. After the Chen-Lu
ticket narrowly won re-election the following day, the sole
challenging ticket of opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and
People First Party Chairman James Soong accused the president of
having staged the shooting to win sympathy votes and filed two
lawsuits to challenge the election result. The shooting is believed
to have gravely aggravated hostility between the ruling and
opposition camps.</P>
      <P>After nearly a year of grueling investigations, the investigative
team announced a breakthrough early last month by identifying Chen
Yi-hsiung as the shooter in the apparent assassination attempt.</P>
      <P>Three investigative team members traveled to the United States
early this month to seek renowned Chinese-American forensic expert
Dr. Henry Lee's counsel about certain problems regarding the
investigations.</P>
      <P>Lee was quoted as having told the trio that they should further
investigate the cause of Chen Yi-hsiung's death because the data
collected by the team so far is not sufficient to conclude that Chen
Yi-hsiung, a former chairman of the Tainan City Wrestling
Association, committed suicide 10 days after he allegedly shot and
slightly wounded Chen and Lu.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 100 pro-Taiwan independence groups
issued a joint statement Thursday criticizing opposition leaders'
planned visits to China for trying to connive with China to sell out
the nation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Society North Chairman Wu Shu-min read the statement at a
news conference jointly called by former President Lee Teng-hui and
the 100 groups formed by pro-independence activists on the planned
visits to China by Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First
Party Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>Lien is scheduled to leave April 26 for an eight-day visit, while
Soong plans to travel in early May.</P>
      <P>Neither Lien nor Soong are entitled to represent either the
people or the government of Taiwan in talks with the Chinese
authorities because they are not in power, the statement notes.</P>
      <P>Also, it goes on, any statement or move that puts Taiwan under
the "one-China" principle is abandoning its sovereignty and is not
acceptable to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is inappropriate for any political leaders to hold talks with
the Chinese authorities at the moment, as Beijing enacted its
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan not long ago, the statement adds,
explaining that holding talks with Beijing now will mislead the
international community into believing that the people of Taiwan have
accepted the law that authorizes the Chinese authorities to use
non-peaceful means in dealing with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The statement also urges the government to exercise its authority
and deal with Lien's visit and to look into KMT Vice Chairman P.K.
Chiang's recent visit to China to ascertain whether there has been a
possible violation of the Statute Governing the Relations between the
People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT LAWMAKER REBUTS EX-PRESIDENT'S CALL FOR TALKS ON TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui should not
expect the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) to do what even the government
cannot do, KMT lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lai, who is the deputy secretary of the KMT caucus in the
Legislative Yuan, made the remarks in response to Lee's call earlier
in the day that the issue between Taiwan and China should be settled
in an international conference involving the two parties, the United
States and Japan rather than through talks between Taiwan's
opposition leaders and Chinese president Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Lee's call was intended to stop KMT Chairman Lien Chan and People
First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong from visiting China to talk
with the Chinese leadership.</P>
      <P>Lai said Lee should practice what he preached during his
presidency from 1988 to 2000, adding that if he could not do it, he
should not expect the KMT, which is only an opposition party, to do
it.</P>
      <P>The KMT lawmaker said Beijing always claims that the Taiwan issue
is an internal affair and resists any efforts to discuss the question
in an international context and he pointed out that there is no
indication that it has changed its position.</P>
      <P>Saying that Lee resorted to secret contacts with China through
emissaries during his term as president, Lai said Lien's proposed
engagement with the Chinese leadership under the public eye will be
much better.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and its
ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), embraced Lee's call.</P>
      <P>DPP lawmaker William Lai, the DPP caucus whip in the Legislative
Yuan, said his caucus supports Lee's call, especially his claims that
Lien's and Soong's trips are wrong with regard to their timing, place
and form.</P>
      <P>But he disagreed with Lee's criticism of the government that it
is failing in its duty by not stopping Lien and Soong from making the
trips, arguing that the law does not give government the power to
prevent crimes that have not yet been committed.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Mark M. H. Ho of the opposition TSU, which considers Lee
as its "spiritual leader, " echoed Lee's call for an international
conference, claiming that it is the only way to solve Taiwan's
disputes with China once and for all.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. State Department press officer
said Thursday that the United States considers that direct dialogue
is the best way to solve problems between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Deputy spokesman Adam Ereli made the remarks at a press briefing
in response to questions regarding former Republic of China President
Lee Teng-hui's suggestion that the United States would be a better
place to hold a cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Lee said the same day that cross-strait problems should be
resolved with the international community taking part since such
problems are issues related to world peace.</P>
      <P>Saying that he is not aware whether the suggestion is being
actively considered in the United States, Ereli, however, reiterated
Washington's stance of pushing for direct cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>"I think certainly the United States, by its public stance and in
its dealings with officials on both sides of the strait, has made it
clear that we believe that direct dialogue between them is the best
way to resolve the tensions, and that obviously we'd welcome steps by
both sides that contribute to that end," he said.</P>
      <P>The deputy spokesman also said that he does not think that the
people of Taiwan and China need to look to the United States to solve
their problems as "it resides first and foremost in the will and
commitment of the people directly concerned."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. State Department on Thursday
declined to comment on the French government's stance on China's
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan, saying only that Washington's
position on the law is clear and won't be affected by France.</P>
      <P>According to wire service reports, French Prime Minister
Jean-Pierre Raffarin made a statement at a joint press conference
held with his Chinese counterpart, Wen Chapao, during his current
visit to Beijing that Paris does not oppose the Anti-Secession Law
and that the law is completely consistent with the French position.</P>
      <P>In response to media questions touching on Raffarin's remarks at
a routine briefing, State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli said
that he does not have any comment on what the French position is on
the Anti-Secession Law since he had not seen those reports about
France throwing its support behind the law.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that he can only talk about the United States'
stance on the law, Ereli said that Washington has made its position
clear and that the French stance on the law "certainly does not
affect our position."</P>
      <P>Asked whether the French stance on the law contradicts the U.S.
position, he said: "People don't agree with everything that we've
said. I'm not saying that it's the case here, because again I don't
know. I can't speak for the French government."</P>
      <P>According to a Agence France-Presse report from the U.S. capital
Thursday, a State Department official reiterated the same day
Washington's opposition to the Anti-Secession Law after France voiced
its support for the legislation.</P>
      <P>The official said on condition of anonymity that "France has the
right to its position....Our view is the Anti-Secession Law is not
helpful. If France has a different view, then it is France's
business," according to the report.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian exhorted the
country Friday to "save a little more and waste a little less" in
order to live up to the resolution to "love the Earth and cherish
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony of the 2nd NGO National
Environmental Policy Forum -- an event marking International Earth
Day -- Chen called on his fellow compatriots to be more
environmentally conscious so that people now and future generations
can live in a better place.</P>
      <P>Chen said that 2004 was an "environmentally turbulent year, "
culminating with the Dec. 26 tsunami tragedy that claimed some
200,000 lives in South and Southeast Asia and caused extensive damage
to the environment.</P>
      <P>He noted that although Taiwan is not a signatory to the
U.N.-initiated Kyoto Protocol, which came into force Feb. 16 this
year, Taiwan will have to face the realities and global demands for
greenhouse gas emission reduction.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that by squarely implementing measures under new
laws, including a statute governing recycled energy development and
the greenhouse gas emission control law, Taiwan's industrial
development will continue to flourish while the environment is not
compromised.</P>
      <P>On arguments and controversies surrounding the building of new
nuclear power plants, cross-mountain highways and big steel-refinery
plants, Chen said that the outdated "development leads the economy"
view should be cast off and replaced with a new "support development
with conservation" concept.</P>

      <P>Hu, who made known his intention to seek another term long ago,

      <P>Hu said that attending the forum is a rare opportunity, adding
that if he does attend it, he won't be able to return to Taiwan in

      <P>Hu had originally planned to register himself when he returns
home May 2, but his campaign team strongly advised him against this.

      <P>The United States has had a consistent
stance on issues relating to Russian arms sales to China and on a
possible lifting of the European Union's arms embargo against China,
the U.S. State Department said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Media reports have said that during Secretary of State

sell arms to China because this might undermine stability in the

      <P>It is a "long-stated U.S. policy, " he said, adding that he

      <P>"As we've articulated before, we don't want to see a

    <HEADLINE>MAC WELCOMES LIEN PHONE CALL TO PRESIDENT CHEN PRIOR TO CHINA VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
expressed welcome Friday to the promise that opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan will telephone President Chen Shui-bian
before Lien embarks on his China visit slated for April 26.</P>
      <P>Both the Democratic Progressive Party administration and the KMT
authorities have confirmed that Lien will telephone Chen at 4:10 p.m.
next Monday to inform the president about his forthcoming visit to
China, which will mark the first time that a KMT chairman sets foot
on mainland Chinese soil in more than five decades.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung welcomed the scheduled Lien-Chen
telephone conversation, saying that Lien will demonstrate the
courtesy and responsibility of an opposition political party leader
when making the phone call to President Chen.</P>
      <P>It is believed that Lien's China visit will be smoother and more
rewarding if the opposition leader communicates with the
administration beforehand, You noted.</P>
      <P>You said that it is a democratic norm that political parties
compete among themselves, although he added that the national
interests should be put ahead of party gains. He said this
competition is to the benefit of the country only when the opposition
parties bear the nation's dignity and the people's wellbeing in mind
and cooperates with the government, You added.</P>
      <P>He said that after China enacted its anti-secession law targeting
Taiwan, the Republic of China government was forced to rearrange its
priorities regarding its cross-strait policies in consideration of
national security and the people's interests.</P>
      <P>You renewed calls for Beijing officials to return to the
negotiating table with their Taiwan counterparts, saying that if
China intends to recognize cross-strait political reality and reduce
hostility toward Taiwan, it must resume official talks with Taiwan's
authorities.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PATROL OF EAST CHINA SEA COMPLIES WITH LAW: COAST GUARD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The dispatch of two vessels to patrol the
Republic of China's exclusive economic zones in the East China Sea is
in compliance with the domestic law, a Coast Guard Administration
(CGA) official said Friday.</P>
      <P>CGA Deputy Director Yu Chien-su was responding to a media report
that the CGA urgently dispatched the "Ho Hsing" and "Mo Hsing" patrol
ships to disputed waters in the East China Sea Thursday to affirm the
ROC's sovereignty over the region.</P>
      <P>According to the media report, Japan and China have had disputes
over oil exploration in the East China Sea, and parts of the disputed
oil fields are located in Taiwan's 200-nautical-mile exclusive
economic zones. In addition to asserting the nation's sovereignty
claim, the report said, the CGA patrol ships have also been directed
to look into the two neighboring countries' actions in the region.</P>
      <P>Yu would not explain whether the dispatch of the two patrol ships
was aimed at asserting the ROC's sovereignty. Instead, he said the
CGA has regularly sent patrol ships to keep guard in waters off
Taiwan's northern and southern coasts in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>Noting that the CGA is obligated to police the nation's
territorial seas and exclusive economic zones, Yu said the CGA has
sent patrol ships twice a month to police waters north and south of
Taiwan. The latest patrol "is not the first of its kind," he added.</P>
      <P>In 2004, the Ministry of the Interior published a list of CGA
patrol routes in the nation's exclusive economic zones, including
waters 200 nautical miles north of its territorial sea base lines
surrounding the islet of Pengjia.</P>
      <P>Chen Li-tung, dean of National Taiwan Ocean University's graduate
school of maritime law, said he supports the CGA's dispatch of patrol
ships to the East China Sea to protect the nation's legitimate
rights. He also urged the government to adopt more active steps to
assert the ROC's exclusive rights in its economic zones.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The pro-independence opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) objected Friday to President Chen Shui-bian's
plan to hold talks over the telephone with opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan over Lien's upcoming visit to China.</P>
      <P>The TSU urged Chen not to endorse the trips by Lien and
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong, or to lean toward
the "one China" principle espoused by Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lien is expected to telephone Chen Monday to report on the
purpose and details of his China trip, set for April 26 to May 3.
Soong will visit China in May.</P>
      <P>According to Lai Hsin-yuan, a whip of the TSU legislative caucus,
Chen and Lien should communicate face to face under media scrutiny
because cross-Taiwan Strait policy is a disputed issue.</P>
      <P>Lai accused Chen and Lien of not taking the matter seriously by
allowing such discussion to take place over the phone.</P>
      <P>Lai also asked the president to clarify if his talks with Lien
mean that he supports the so-called "1992 consensus" on the "one
China" issue that Lien is planning to discuss in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chen had previously insisted that there was never any consensus
between Taipei and Beijing on the issue during talks held in Hong
Kong in 1992 during the rule of the former KMT government.</P>
      <P>Lai accused Chen of being inconsistent in terms of his
cross-strait policy, claiming that Chen has been swaying over the
past five years between his "five noes" commitment and the "one
country on each side" concept and between endorsing the campaign to
change the official name of the country and denying it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DRIVERS URGED NOT TO OCCUPY PARKING SPACES FOR DISABLED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic group urged drivers Friday to
respect the rights of the physically disabled by not occupying
parking spaces designated for them.</P>
      <P>The Free Universe Education Foundation said
government-designated parking spaces for the disabled are already far
from sufficient, but able-bodied drivers often encroach into their
spaces partly because fines are so insignificant.</P>
      <P>People who do not have a permit are fined only NT$1,200 (less
than US$40) if they park in spaces reserved for the disabled, while
fines plus towing fees for parking alongside a red-lined no-parking
curb total more than NT$2,000.</P>
      <P>Tang Feng-cheng, chairman of the foundation's organizing
committee, quoted the Taipei city government as saying that as of the
end of March, it had issued nearly 26,000 parking permits for the
disabled, while the city has only 1,800 disabled parking spaces.</P>
      <P>Director Hsueh Cheng-tai of the city's Bureau of Social Affairs
said he supports a proposal to raise the fines. However, he said he
preferred to use "moral persuasion" to advise drivers not to infringe
upon the rights of the disabled.</P>
      <P>City Councilman Li Keng Kui-fang urged the government to crack
down on violators and she called on the public to respect the rights
of the disabled.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO LAW BARRING OPPOSITION LEADERS FROM VISITING CHINA: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 22 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Friday there is
no law prohibiting opposition leaders from visiting China.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was responding to Legislator Cheng Chao-ming of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) during an interpellation session in
which Cheng asked the government to prohibit opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong from
visiting China.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the law only prohibits military personnel
and specific kinds of people from making such visits.</P>
      <P>The law does not bar anyone from visiting China for tourism or
tombsweeping, he said, referring to Lien's plan to sweep his
grandmother's tomb during a visit to Xian, one of the stops on his
April 26-May 3 visit.</P>
      <P>He also said that Lien's talks as a party leader on exchanges
with the Communist Party of China (CPC) may not involve the exercise
of government authority, but claimed that it is "normal" in other
countries to first report to the government and the president prior
to such visits.</P>
      <P>On whether a telephone conversation between Lien and President
Chen Shui-bian prior to his China visit can be construed as reporting
to the government will hinge on the content of the talks, he said.</P>
      <P>The premier was responding to questions by DPP Legislator Chen
Chao-lung on whether Lien's scheduled phone call to Chen is
considered reporting to the government, and on whether Lien's visit
to China comes at an appropriate time.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if Lien and Chen quarrel over the phone, it will
not be considered a report, but added that if Lien mentions his trip,
the government will give him leeway, saying that the phone call will
at least show respect to the existence of the president and the
government.</P>
      <P>On former President Lee Teng-hui's criticism of the China visits
by Lien and Soong as wrong in terms of timing and venue, Hsieh said
that the timing is indeed inappropriate.</P>
      <P>But as Taiwan is a country governed by law, the government still
cannot prohibit them from going, he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that hundreds of thousands of Taiwan people took to the
streets March 26 to show their displeasure over China's enactment of
the Anti-Secession Law, which has translated into pressure for
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Because of the pressure, China wants to extend an olive branch to
Taiwan, which is why it is welcoming visits by the opposition.</P>
      <P>He said that Lien's invitation to China is not because Beijing
welcomes him but because it refuses to talk to the Taiwan government.</P>

      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) said
Friday that a batch of swans imported from Hungary has been destroyed
and there is no possibility that any disease they might have been
carrying has leaked into Taiwan's poultry.</P>
      <P>Officials from COA's Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection

Hungary, which were put into quarantine in Keelung Jan. 28.</P>
      <P>Five of the swans died between Feb. 8 and March 12. The dead

      <P>Although the viruses themselves were not detected, the bureau
decided to destroy the swans March 14 for safety reasons, they added.</P>
      <P>They said the killed swans were put into sealed containers after

    <HEADLINE>CHINA `UNINHABITABLE FOR MANKIND': MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China has become one of the world's most
uninhabitable countries and the people of Taiwan must guard against
all kinds of risks when traveling there, Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) Vice Chairman You Ying-lung said Friday.</P>
      <P>You issued the call at a news conference when reminding people
from Taiwan to be extremely cautious if traveling to China for
business, pleasure or settlement.</P>
      <P>Citing a report made public by the Development Program affiliated
to the United Nations, You said that 16 of the world's 20 most
uninhabitable cities were in China in 2004 as a result of poor
performance in public order, environmental protection, religious
freedom and human rights.</P>
      <P>The MAC vice chairman further pointed out that studies carried
out by Taiwan experts show that acid rain falls in one-third of
China's territory, while problems related to counterfeit drugs,
garbage and drinking water are so rampant they are claimed to kill
thousands of people per year.</P>
      <P>More than 60 percent or even 80 percent of China's 10 million
deaf-mute population are victims of counterfeit drugs, while as many
as 300 million people have difficulty getting potable water, he said,
adding that only 50 percent of the garbage is handled in China's
cities.</P>
      <P>All these problems have led to a serious deterioration in overall
living environments in Chinese cities, making "China one of the
world's most uninhabitable countries," he claimed.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, religious freedom is also strictly
limited in China under pretext of national security. </P>
      <P>Since China initiated its reform drive in the early 1990s, more
than 2.7 million people have been arrested without conviction. Some
400,000 people have been sent to labor camps, around 200,000 have
gone missing and tens of thousands have been abused to the point of
brain damage or death, he said.</P>
      <P>According to an assessment on social order carried out by a
Chinese research unit, only five or seven out of China's 132 cities
meet its safety requirements and standards, the MAC vice chairman
noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'TAISHANG' IS EXTENSION OF TAIWAN'S POWER: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen operating in China and
elsewhere around the world -- better known as "taishang" -- represent
an extension of the power of Taiwan, President Chen Shui-bian said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Taishang's growth and expansion overseas, including China, also
mark the accumulation of Taiwan's economic and trade strength,
according to Chen.</P>
      <P>He noted that people should bear in mind that if there was no
Taiwan, there would be no Taishang. Stressing that Taiwan is the home
and the mother of Taishang, Chen claimed that the world looks up to
Taishang because they have a strong back-up in Taiwan. He claimed
that if Taishang lose Taiwan, they will not only lose reliance and
back-up, they will even miss their positions in the world.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he was addressing a
groundbreaking ceremony in Tainan County to mark the beginning of the
development of an LCD television and optoelectronic industrial park.</P>
      <P>The park, part of the Southern Taiwan Science-based Industrial
Park, will be an industrial processing zone housing TFT-LCD
manufacturers and processors of related up-stream and down-stream
industries.</P>
      <P>Construction is scheduled to kick off next month with a
preliminary development budget of NT$15 billion (US$476 million).</P>
      <P>Chen noted that production of the Southern Taiwan Science-based
Industrial Park was around NT$1.58 billion in the first year of the
park's operations in 1999. The output grew remarkably to NT$259.4
billion by 2004, he added.</P>
      <P>Despite its brisk growth, Chen said, the Southern Taiwan
Science-based Industrial Park has been unable to secure land to
accommodate support or satellite industries for the park.</P>
      <P>The development of the LCD television and optoelectronic
industrial park will be a new, sounder design in Taiwan's
high-technology industrial development, with principal and supporting
industries being housed in the same location, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>Output of the TFT-LCD processing industry -- one of the three
"trillion-class" industries in Taiwan -- is expected to reach NT$1.37
trillion in 2006, Chen said, adding that Taiwan's TFT-LCD production
commanded 42.02 percent of the entire world market in 2004, about the
same level as that produced by South Korea, the world leader in the
TFT-LCD industry.</P>
      <P>Due to severe competition, Taiwan's TFT-LCD makers have had no
choice but to diversify into production bases worldwide, including
China, to help reduce production overheads. This is also an
unavoidable challenge that Taiwan's TFT-LCD industry faces, Chen
said.</P>

views on Lien's April 26-May 3 visit to China, " Chang said at a news
conference held at the KMT's headquarters.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, Lien briefed Paal on the KMT's basic stance
on handling cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>"We have explained to the United States that peace is the bedrock
of our fundamental stance on cross-strait relations. We don't support
Taiwan independence and our advocacy of increased cross-strait
exchanges conforms with the U.S. stance," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the United States attaches great importance to
Lien's forthcoming China visit. In addition to the Lien-Paal meeting,
Chang said, other AIT officials have also met with KMT cadres to
boost mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Since KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang's March 28-April 1 China
visit, Chang said, the U.S. authorities have on two public occasions
and one private occasion affirmed that any dialogue is better than no
dialogue at all as far as cross-strait relations are concerned.</P>
      <P>Chang said the KMT is fully aware of the U.S. expectations for
official cross-strait dialogue. But before official contact across
the Taiwan Strait can take place, Chang said, opposition Taiwan
politicians' dialogue with the Chinese authorities are helpful to
maintaining peace and stability in the region.</P>
      <P>"While in China, Lien will certainly defend Taiwan's dignity,
promote cross-strait peace and aver parity in bilateral engagements,"
Chang said, adding he is convinced that Lien will receive recognition
both at home and in the international community for his historic
visit.</P>
      <P>As to whether Paal presented any demands in the course of his
talks with Lien, Chang said the United States is unlikely to demand
anything from the KMT since the party is not in power.</P>
      <P>Chang further said the KMT's China policy is enshrined in its
official documents and that Lien and all other KMT officials
accompanying him on the visit will abide by the law and will not
usurp the government's power.</P>
      <P>Lien, heading a large delegation of KMT officials and
journalists, will depart next Tuesday for what he bills a "journey of
peace" to China that will take him to four cities -- Nanjing,
Beijing, Xian and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Lien, who was the Republic of China premier from February 1993
through February 1998 and vice president from May 1996 to May 2000,
will be the first KMT chairman to visit China since the party, which
once ruled all of China, fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a bloody
civil war to the Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>Lien, who lost two presidential bids in 2000 and 2004, is
scheduled to meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao, who is also
general secretary of the Communist Party of China.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislators from across the political
spectrum are still divided on the upcoming visits to China by the
leaders of the nation's two major opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), and James
Soong, chairman of the opposition People First Party (PFP) , are
expected to visit China later this month and early next month,
respectively, at the invitation of Chinese President Hu Jintao, who
is also secretary-general of the Communist Party of China (CPC).</P>
      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lin Chung-mo
claimed that Lien and Soong will just be taken by China as puppets
used to manipulate Taiwan's politics. "People should not overestimate
Lien and Soong's ability in political manipulation, as Beijing will
also despise their fawning attitudes," Lin claimed.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kao Chien-chih noted that many people fear that
the visits might undermine Taiwan's sovereignty and that if they
really want to promote peace across the Taiwan Strait, they should
ask the Chinese authorities to dismantle their missiles targeting
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tzen Tsan-teng, also from the DPP, criticized the KMT
for straying from its previous anti-communist policy.</P>
      <P>In contrast, KMT Legislator Kun Wen-chi hailed Lien's visit,
describing it as a move to create dialogue and promote peace, which
the United States also wants to see.</P>
      <P>KMT lawmaker Lai Shyh-bao said Lien will not damage Taiwan's
interests as some people fear, because he is not in power. He said
the visits will lead to less tense cross-strait ties, which will be
beneficial for the country's economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY TO LAUNCH 'PUBLIC TRIAL' ON TIAOYUTAIS SOVEREIGNTY ISSUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming
said Friday that his party will initiate a "public trial" by "all the
people of Taiwan" May 15 should the administration fail to respond to
controversy surrounding the sovereignty issue of the Tiaoyutai island
group before that time.</P>
      <P>Yok said at a press conference that the Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) government has made no effort to protect the Republic of
China's sovereignty over the Tiaoyutais in the first place, while
former President Lee Teng-hui has claimed that the Tiaoyutais, known
as the Senkaku Islands in Japan, are part of Japanese territory.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lee slammed opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
and People First Party Chairman James Soong a day earlier for their
planned visits to China and accused them of "colluding with China to
sell Taiwan, " Yok claimed that Lee was "colluding with Japan to sell
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Arguing that the Tiaoyutais are part of Republic of China
territory, Yok said that if the DPP government continues to condone
Lee's nonsense and makes no response to the controversy regarding the
Tiaoyutais sovereignty issue, the New Party will initiate a "public
trial" May 15, supposedly to "let the Taiwan people decide" who is
"colluding with Japan to sell Taiwan."</P>
      <P>New Party Legislator Joanna Lei said that the Chun Xiao oil and
gas field -- China's southernmost offshore oil and gas field in the
East China Sea, only 4 km from the median line with Japanese
territory and currently the heart of an ongoing Chinese-Japanese
dispute -- is located within the ROC's 200-nautical-mile economic
zone and is also part of the Tiaoyutai reef area.</P>
      <P>The DPP government, however, has not uttered a word on Japan's
recent sovereignty claims over the Chun Xiao oil and gas field,
giving away mammoth interests equal to NT$8 million (US$254,000) for
each of Taiwan's citizen for nothing, Lei said.</P>
      <P>Lei claimed that the Tiaoyutai island group is part of ROC
territory, saying that the Ilan county government in northeastern
Taiwan formally registered the uninhabited Tiaoyutai island group as
territory under ROC jurisdiction last April in accordance with a
Ministry of the Interior plan and priced the Tiaoyutai land at NT$100
per square meter.</P>
      <P>Since the Chun Xiao oil and gas field is located within the
Tiaoyutai area and within the ROC's 200-nautical-mile economic zone,
the DPP government should move to claim it and protect the nation's
interests, Lei said.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutai, located between Taiwan and Okinawa, are claimed by
Taiwan, China and Japan.</P>
      <P>China ceded the island group to Japan in 1895 at a time when the
last Chinese imperial dynasty, the Qing, was in sharp decline and
losing territory to aggressive foreign powers.</P>
      <P>After World War II, the islands were put under U.S. control, at
which time the ROC government demanded their return. In 1972,
however, the United States returned the islands to the Japanese
government -- a decision that governments and patriotic groups on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait continue to protest.</P>
      <P>The Ilan County Land Administration Office incorporated the
Tiaoyutai islets under the jurisdiction of the Toucheng township
government in the northeastern county of Ilan in February 2004 to
signify the ROC's sovereignty claim.</P>

for the 2008 Taiwan Expo and a statute governing major arms
procurements.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks during an interpellation session at the

      <P>Legislator Tsai Chia-fu of the opposition Kuomintang asked
whether there are scenic spots to attract tourists when Kaohsiung

      <P>Hsieh said the government's policy is to have each city and
county promote one international activity, with Chiayi County
focusing Alishan while Nantou County will focus on Sun Moon Lake,
adding that the policy has borne fruit, with the number of Japanese
tourists coming to Taiwan reaching 800,000 recently.</P>
      <P>The premier also said it is necessary for Taiwan to commission a
public relations company to lobby for Taiwan in the U.S. Congress.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was responding to questions by Legislator Fu Kun-chi of the
opposition People First Party who cited reports that Taiwan spent
US$1.08 million over two years to commission Cassidy &amp; Associates to
lobby the U.S. Congress and asked if the money spent was worth it.</P>
      <P>The premier said it is necessary to pay a PR company to lobby in
the U.S. Congress, noting that the policies set by Congress have
global influence. He added that the Minister of Foreign Affairs

      <P>Taiwan is expected to become the world's
largest supplier of display panels in 2005 after the 5.5 and 6.0
generation lines enter mass production, Chi Mei Optoelectronics (CMO)
Chairman Frank Liao said in southern Tainan County Friday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ground-breaking ceremony for an industrial zone
designated for the liquid-crystal display (LCD) television industry
in the Southern Taiwan Science Park, Liao noted that the production
value of Taiwan's display panels is now far ahead of that of Japan.</P>
      <P>Liao said the LCD television and thin-film transistor
liquid-crystal display (TFT-LCD) technologies are very valuable to
Taiwan's economic development and that the industrial zone will help
integrate the country's optoelectronics industry.</P>
      <P>According to the Industrial Development Bureau under the Ministry

display industry amounted to NT$715 billion (US$22.69 billion) in
2004, up 71 percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>The production value of display panels accounted for NT$545
billion, while parts and components accounted for NT$170 billion.</P>
      <P>The bureau has predicted that the production value of the flat
panel display industry will climb further to NT$950 billion this
year.</P>
      <P>Tainan Magistrate Su Huan-chih, who was also present at the
ceremony, pointed out that the idea of establishing the industrial
zone was first put forth by CMO founder Shi Wen-long in January 2004
and is now being followed by leading South Korean manufacturers such

      <P>The spokesman of the main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) called Friday for peace and calm among
pro-independence supporters over KMT Chairman Lien Chan's visit to
mainland China, saying that every citizen in a democratic society is
free to voice his or her opinion, but in a peaceful way.</P>
      <P>Chang Jong-kung made the remarks at the KMT headquarters in
Taipei after the Human Chain Alliance of Taiwan said earlier the same
day that they will mobilize supporters to see Lien off at Chiang Kai-
shek International Airport next Tuesday or even "intercept" Lien on
the highway to the airport to express their opposition to his China
visit.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Lien's visit is to help build peace between Taiwan

the harvest as it will represent major progress in cross-Taiwan

      <P>KMT officials and supporters will also see Lien off at CKS

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
leader's planned China visit is not a bad thing, it will not help
promote economic and trade exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, a
professor claimed Friday.
</P>
      <P>Lin Hsiang-kai, a professor at National Taiwan University, said
that negotiations concerning cross-strait economic and trade
exchanges should be conducted with dignity and on an equal footing
and that without the authorization of the government, even if the
opposition parties reach consensus with China, it will be just an
"opinion from the civil sector."</P>
      <P>Citing the example of KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang's visit to
China in March, during which the Chinese government promised to sign
an agreement to further protect the interests of Taiwanese
businessmen with operations in China, Lin said the issue concerning
the huge interests of Taiwanese businessmen in China should be
negotiated on a government-to-government basis.</P>
      <P>During Chiang's China trip, he reached a 10-point consensus with
Beijing on a wide variety of issues, including cross-strait
transport, agricultural cooperation and the opening of China's
financial market.</P>

liquid-crystal display (LCD) television industry will be increased by
NT$200 billion (US$6.34 billion) after an industrial zone designated
for the industry is completed in Tainan, southern Taiwan, the

      <P>The industrial zone, which broke ground Friday in the Southern
Taiwan Park, covers 247 hectares with a development budget of
NT$14 billion and will be opened to manufacturers by the end of May.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) under the MOEA noted that
Taiwan has produced around 1.8 million LCD units last year and that
after the establishment of the industrial zone, the annual production
value is expected to increase by more than NT$200 billion, creating
30,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>IDB officials said that 1.95 million digital TV (DTV) and LCD TVs
were produced last year with a production value of around US$54.4
billion, up 320 percent and 212 percent, respectively, from the

      <P>The officials also said that the production value of the flat
panel display industry showed remarkable growth last year, reaching
NT$715 billion. But as 90 percent of the investment on equipment has
to rely on imports, many manufacturers have to delay their
next-generation plant expansion projects when the price for flat
panel displays is down.</P>
      <P>This will affect Taiwan's competitive edge, they said, adding

Wall Street Journal: Facing Vioxx Trials, Merck Prepares to Fight
Each Case.

As Merck faces Vioxx liability that some analysts have estimated
could top US$20 billion, it says it is committed to fighting every
case against it with a legal war chest of US$675 million. Vioxx was
withdrawn from the market last Sept. 30. after a study suggested it
doubled the risk of heart attack in those taking the drug for more
than 18 months. In the lawsuits, Merck is now combing patients' pasts
for evidence that their unhealthy habits, not the drug, caused heart
problems. And its lawyers have won some important procedural
victories, driving up the costs for plaintiffs' lawyers. Merck still
faces a daunting task in winning over juries. Plaintiff lawyers plan
to stress how multiple studies suggested Vioxx was a problem years
before the withdrawal. Many experts who raised questions have said
Merck tried to squash their views. At one point, the Food and Drug
Administration sent a warning letter telling Merck to stop making
unsupported claims about Vioxx's cardiovascular safety.</TEXT>

      <P>Once the proposed amendments are passed, the official said, the
IHR will stipulate that its provisions will be applicable to all
humans to protect them from being infected with internationally
communicable diseases.</P>
      <P>The official said the IHR revisions are mainly aimed at admitting
Taiwan into the WHO because WHO officials have come to understand the
global disease control and health care system cannot afford to
exclude Taiwan any longer.</P>
      <P>The WHO is expected to pass the proposed IHR revision package at
the annual World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the WHO's decision-making
arm -- to be held in Geneva in May. The official said the government
has kept close contacts with the United States and other pro-Taiwan
countries over the issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has sought to join the WHA as an observer since 1997. Due
to China's boycott, Taiwan's bid has made little progress. At last
year's WHA, a vote was held on Taiwan's bid. The United States and
Japan gave "yes" votes last year, but China still managed to use its
diplomatic clout to block the bid.</P>
      <P>This time around, the official said, the government has decided
to adjust its strategy after consultations with the United States and
other allies.</P>
      <P>"We'll give the top priority to actually taking part in WHO
activities as our initial goal, " the official said. But he didn't
elaborate.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
Randall G. Schriver said the United States looks forward to seeing
real progress in Taiwan's WHO bid this year.</P>
      <P>"We continue to work on it. We have not only approached Beijing
on this issue, but also worked with countries we regard as friends
and the like-minded. So we'll see if we can achieve our ultimate
objective, which is observership for Taiwan in the WHO, and see if we
can make incremental progress in that direction, " Schriver told a
group of Taiwan reporters stationed in Washington, D.C.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan would ask for a vote at this year's World
Health Assembly scheduled for May in Geneva, Schriver said the United
States and Taiwan have discussed a range of options to be adopted
this year, including a vote.</P>
      <P>"The vote, we did that last year. We know the outcome. If our
friends in Taiwan want to pursue that again, they know they can count
on our support. But we are interested really not so much in a
symbolic move of any kind. We want to see real progress towards
meaningful participation for Taiwan in the WHO," Schriver said.</P>
      <P>"[An] example would be, if not observership, then Taiwan's
ability to participate in the work of the WHO, contribute to the WHO
in ways without any obstacles from Beijing," he explained.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VISIT TO CHINA IS A BETRAYAL OF TAIWAN, SAYS PRES. ADVISOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior Presidential Advisor Peng Ming-min
said Friday that the upcoming visits to China by two opposition
leaders are a " betrayal of Taiwan" as such visits could derail a
government bill to buy weapons from the United States (U.S.).</P>
      <P>Peng said James Soong of the People First Party (PFP) reached a
10-point consensus with President Chen Shui-bian, agreeing to support
the government in passing major bills at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out, the president's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the PFP have not been able to put such
major legislative items as the arms purchase bill, or Control Yuan
members' list to committee screening, much less pass them. Peng
attributed this to Soong's failure to honor his words.</P>
      <P>The president gained only a nominal score -- having Soong calling
him "Mr. President, " but lost heavily as Soong has done nothing to
fulfill his promise for legislative cooperation with the DPP,
according to Peng.</P>
      <P>The president now looks as if he is "being strangled by his
10-point consensus with Soong," and he has been scorned by supporters
of Taiwan independence, Peng said.</P>
      <P>Now Soong and his Kuomintang counterpart Lien Chan are to visit
China, Peng is worried that the chances of passing the arms purchase
bill will become even slimmer.</P>
      <P>Turning to the visits to China, which have been the subject of
much discussion, he said the two opposition leaders are trying to
play Taiwan politics using the "China card" with a view to
discrediting President Chen.</P>
      <P>While the rest of the world is giving a thumbs-down to China's
Anti-Secession Law, China is able to use the two visits to tell the
world that Taiwan is "not that angry" at the law, he said.</P>
      <P>He accused Lien and Soong of disregarding Taiwan's national
interests by making the visits, as they will be seen as evidence of a
division inside Taiwan and will help to relieve China from world-wide
pressure, Peng said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he added, the visits can be clarified as a betrayal of
Taiwan which he believes will not produce any concrete results.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui has alleged that both Lien and
Soong "are working with the Chinese Communists to betray Taiwan."
However, Peng stated that it is still too early to come to this
conclusion as the opposition leaders have not yet landed in China.</P>
      <P>Peng supports Lee's proposal for four-party talks to solve the
Taiwan Strait issue which would involve Taiwan, China, Japan and the
U.S. but noted the U.S. would not be interested in such a proposal.</P>
      <P>The U.S. has always advocated that cross-strait disputes should
be settled by direct and peaceful dialogue between Beijing and
Taipei, Peng said, adding he does not see any likelihood of the U.S.
changing its position and intervening.</P>

      <P>Hatsuhisa Takashima told foreign press that if neighboring

    <HEADLINE>ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP ASKS GOVERNMENT TO SUBSIDIZE HYBRID CARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local environmental protection group
called on the government Friday to subsidize the cost of hybrid cars
to encourage people to replace their traditional automobiles with the
environment-friendly vehicles.</P>
      <P>According to Environmental Quality Protection Foundation
Secretary-General Liu Ming-lung, hybrid cars, which are powered
alternately by electric and gasoline, can save gasoline consumption
by nearly 50 percent and reduce emissions by more than 90 percent.</P>
      <P>However, the vehicles are not popular in Taiwan mainly because of
their high prices, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Liu pointed out that the battery systems used in the hybrid cars
are very expensive and that government subsidies are required even in
foreign countries to encourage consumers to buy the vehicles.</P>
      <P>Without such subsidies, the prices of hybrid cars in Taiwan are
almost double that of foreign countries, Liu noted.</P>
      <P>For example, Liu continued, a Prius hybrid car manufactured by
Toyota sells NT$1.3 million (US$41,269) in Taiwan, when it costs less
than NT$700,000 overseas.</P>
      <P>Liu proposed that the government follow the tax deduction
measures adopted by the United States, Japan and European Union and
cut the commodity tax of hybrid cars by 50 percent, which he said
will save consumers at least NT$100,000 per car.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) should also
provide subsidies to bus operators for the purchase of hybrid buses,
he added.</P>
      <P>In response to the issue, EPA officials said providing subsidies
and incentives for the purchase of hybrid vehicles is a policy the
EPA will follow but that the EPA still needs to coordinate with other
agencies to work out details, for example the subsidy amount.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 22 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park
in northern Taiwan generated a revenue of NT$495.8 billion (US$15.7
billion) from exports in 2004, and the figure accounted for 8.5
percent of Taiwan's total exports that year, according to statistics
released Friday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year the industrial park, which was
established in 1980, housed a total of 384 companies and statistics
showed that the amount of investments poured into the facility
reached about NT$1.5 trillion.</P>
      <P>Most of the companies are in the business of integrated circuits,
computers and their peripherals, opto-electronics, communications,
precision machinery, and biotechnology, according to the tallies,
which also indicated that the number of workers in the park has been
increasing since 2002.</P>
      <P>Some 113,000 persons were employed in the Hsinchu industrial park
last year, 10 percent of whom worked at research departments. Over a
half of the researchers were in the integrated circuit industry. The
DGBAS said that as a result of growing economic recovery in the
worldwide markets, the science-based industrial park received an
operational turnover of NT$1.1 trillion last year, posing a growth of
26.6 percent from the level of the previous year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the companies in both the Hsinchu industrial park and
the Southern Taiwan Science-based Industrial Park in Tainan County
spent NT$50.4 billion totally in research programs in 2003, a number
accounting for 5 percent of the companies combined turnovers, higher
than the average 1.2 percent of local manufacturers outside the
parks, according to the DGBAS</P>
      <P>Thanks to efforts to develop new products, the number of patented
items in the industrial parks has increased. In 2003 it was recorded
at 3,026 items, and has increased to 12.6 percent over the level of a
year ago, the DGBAS said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP URGES OPPOSITION LEADERS TO DEFEND ROC'S DIGNITY ON CHINA VISITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu urged two
opposition leaders Friday to deliver on their promises to protect the
Republic of China (ROC) during their upcoming visits to the People's
Republic of China (PRC).</P>
      <P>Lu made the call while attending a seminar on social justice,
happiness and human rights.</P>
      <P>The outspoken vice president said both Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong have on
numerous occasions vowed to defend the ROC's national dignity and
sovereignty.</P>
      <P>"Now is the time for them to substantiate their pledge," Lu said,
adding that Lien and Soong should ask the Chinese authorities to play
the ROC's national anthem and hoist the ROC's national flag to
welcome their arrival in Beijing for talks with PRC President Hu
Jintao.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lu said, all Taiwanese people hate the Chinese military
threat. "We hope the two opposition leaders can ask Hu on behalf of
the 23 million Taiwanese people to dismantle and destroy China's
hundreds of ballistic missiles which are pointed at Taiwan," Lu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Lu said, major countries around the world have
condemned China's enactment of its anti-secession law targeting
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Lien and Soong should ask Hu during their talks to phase out or
revise the ill-intentioned legislation that codifies the use of
non-peaceful means against Taiwan," Lu said.</P>
      <P>If Lien and Soong really do bring up these demands during their
stay in China, Lu said, the people of Taiwan will give them a warm
welcome when they conclude their visits and return to Taipei.</P>
      <P>Hu invited Lien and Soong to visit China, separately, in his
capacity as general secretary of the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>Lien, heading a large delegation of KMT officials and
journalists, will depart next Tuesday for what he bills a "journey of
peace" to China that will take him to four cities -- Nanjing,
Beijing, Xian and Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Lien, who was the ROC's premier from February 1993 through
February 1998 and vice president from May 1996 to May 2000, will be
the first KMT chairman to visit China since the party, which once
ruled all of China, fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a bloody
civil war to the Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>Lien, who lost two presidential bids in 2000 and 2004, is
scheduled to meet with PRC President Hu in Beijing April 29.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of the Latin American
Consortium for Integrated Services (LACIS) will visit Taiwan in May
to investigate the viability of sending students from their countries
to learn about Taiwan's advanced information technology.</P>
      <P>The LACIS, formed by Latin American universities and research
organizations with the help of Taiwan and the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) , is aimed at accelerating the
development of the information industry and nanotechnology in Latin
American countries.</P>
      <P>The Latin American high-tech consortium admires Taiwan's advanced
information technology, and has always been interested in forming
cooperative ties with the island, according to Professor Wu Chung-yu
of the National Chiao Tung University.</P>
      <P>Under the arrangement of Wu, who is also an IEEE executive, a
delegation from LACIS, to be headed by Professor Pedro Julian of
Argentina, will come to Taiwan on May 27 to conduct a four-day visit.</P>
      <P>During their stay here, the LACIS delegation will visit the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Education and Academia
Sinica to explore the possibility of sending some 1,000 or 2,000
university students each year to study in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The LACIS delegation will also seek the exchange of visits among
high-ranking government officials in charge of education in Taiwan
and Latin American countries to further strengthen the substantial
ties and academic exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Wu noted that the standard of Latin American students is good,
and therefore many Taiwanese universities are happy to attract them
to study here.</P>
      <P>He revealed that the National Chiao Tung University has been
interested in receiving foreign students, and he hoped that other
schools will also join the program.</P>
      <P>If everything goes smoothly, Wu added, Latin American students
could pursue advanced courses here from the start of early next year.</P>
      <P>Wu went on that if Latin American students can stay in Taiwan to
work for the island's high-tech industries after finishing their
studies here, it will boost Taiwan's high-tech development, and will
also strengthen the academic, business and cultural exchanges between
Taiwan and Latin American countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORSENING SITUATION IN CHINA HINDERS TAIWAN'S WILLINGNESS TO INVEST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 22 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A worsening political and economic climate
in mainland China has hindered Taiwanese businesses' willingness to
invest, according to some Taiwanese businessmen based in China.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-chun, secretary-general of the Taiwan Businessmen's
Association in Shanto City, southern Guangdong Province, said that
the recent changes in China's political and economic stance has
affected the willingness of Taiwan business people to invest in China
more than Beijing's March 14 enactment of the Anti-Secession Law.</P>
      <P>Chang claims that it will take approximately six months to gauge
the impact of the law on Taiwanese companies. He also stated that the
pace of Taiwanese investment in the Zhujiang Delta area has slowed
down.</P>
      <P>The falling status of Taiwanese businessmen may be another reason
behind the decrease in investment in China by Taiwan, Chang said. He
noted that local Chinese governments and officials now have a cooler
attitude towards Taiwanese companies and show little interest in
their operations -- a marked difference to their warm attitude in the
past.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the newest statistics compiled by the Investment
Commission under the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) showed that
Taiwan' s China-bound investment in the first quarter of this year
declined both in project numbers and value.</P>
      <P>The government approved a total of 289 China-bound investment
projects worth US$1.207 billion in the Q1, down by 47.83 percent and
6.57 percent, respectively, compared to the previous year's levels.
There were 169 projects each valued at less than US$200,000.</P>
      <P>Around 40 percent of the Q1 capital funneled into China by
Taiwanese businesses went to the electronics and electrical
manufacturing sector, ahead of 10 percent to the chemical
manufacturing sector and 9.4 percent to the basic metal processing
sector. Jiansu, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces absorbed 86.3
percent of the overall capital.</P>
      <P>Commission officials ascribed the decrease to China's drive to
turn down its economic heating, its Anti-Secession Law against Taiwan
as well as intentional tax-investigation moves by local Chinese
authorities.</P>
      <P>According to Commission officials, the frequency of
tax-investigation and the number of blockades, and intrusions into
factories run by Taiwanese businessmen by local mobster's increased
after Beijing adopted the Anti-Secession Law. Taiwanese investors
pointed out that they now face greater political and economic risks
in China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN DONATES US$1 M. TO GLOBAL FUND TO FIGHT 3 DEVASTATING DISEASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  April 22 (CNA)
(By C.H. Lu and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China on Friday donated
US$1 million to the Geneva-based Global Fund to Fight AIDS,
Tuberculosis, and Malaria as promised to express its concern for
global health.</P>
      <P>The island's former minister of the Department of Health under
the Executive Yuan, Chen Chien-jen, made a commitment during last
year's annual meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the highest
decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO) , to
donate US$1 million to the fund.</P>
      <P>The donation, which was made in the name of "Health Authorities
of Taiwan, "represents the improvement in relations between the
island and the fund over the past three years. The island was only
able to use the designation "the People of Taiwan" when it made its
first donation to the fund in 2002 through a representative of the
organization in the United States.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the fund, former U.S. Health and Human Services
secretary and chairman of the Global Fund, Tommy Thompson, received a
check from Shen Lyushun, director of the Taipei Economic and Culture
Office in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Expressing his gratitude for Taiwan's concrete contribution and
assistance to the fund, Thompson, a longstanding supporter of
Taiwan's bid to join the WHA, said that he hopes the island can
provide relatively more support to the fund and the world health
community in the future, implying that the island's economic strength
give it the ability to do better in this regard.</P>
      <P>He also said that he will continue to help Taiwan in pursuing its
goal of joining the WHO.</P>
      <P>In response, Shen said that besides making the donation to the
fund, Taiwan has also provided various countries around the world
with medical and health assistance through bilateral and multilateral
channels, stressing that active participation in the global health
system and making a better contribution to the system have always
been objectives of the island.</P>
      <P>The Global Fund was created to dramatically increase the
resources for the fight against three of the world's most devastating
diseases as well as to direct those resources to the areas in
greatest need.</P>
      <P>In close cooperation with the WHO and the Joint United Nations
Programme on HIV/AIDS(UNAIDS) , the Global Fund has also played an
important role in AIDS prevention around the world. It is also the
main financial resource of the "3X5" AIDS-Prevention Programme.</P>
      <P>So far, the fund has attracted more than US$6 billion in
contributions from governments, institutions and individuals around
the world. It hopes to raise US$21 billion in 2007.</P>
      <P>It has been learned that staff of the Global Fund are well aware
of the difficulties that Taiwan has encountered in its bid to join
the international health community and would like to strengthen
cooperation relations with the island as well as attract more
donations from the country.</P>
      <P>The Global Fund elected the same day Dr. Carol Jacobs, chairman
of the National Commission for HIV/AIDS of Barbados, as the new
chairman of the board of the fund.</P>

oil-importing countries. 

The Philippine Daily Inquirer: Higher power rates

    <HEADLINE>LOCAL PEOPLE URGED TO EAT MORE FISH PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  23  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official from the Council of
Agriculture (COA) on Saturday urged local people to eat more fish
products to improve health and reduce the nation's medical burden.</P>
      <P>Hsien Wen-ta, director of COA's Fisheries Administration, made
the appeal in a symposium on the country's marine policy held at
National Sun Yat-sen University in Kaohsiung, southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Noting that the fishing industry has played an important role in
the economic development of many countries, Hsieh said Taiwan's
fishing industry has also contributed significantly to the island's
economic development, supporting the livelihood of many fishermen and
providing a good source of protein to the people.</P>
      <P>At a time when Taiwan has become an aging society, Hsieh urged
the public to eat more fish products like the people of Japan and
northern European countries do. Hsieh added that the fact that people
of these countries are healthier and have longer life spans is
absolutely related to their preference for fish products.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's fishing industry must be run without
harming the island's ecosystem, Hsieh urged the public to monitor the
industry while showing support for it.</P>
      <P>Referring to the petitions from fishermen and fishery operators
for less stringent regulations, bigger tax cuts and the introduction
of more mainland Chinese fishermen, Hsieh said the government will
undertake a thorough evaluation during which it will take sustainable
development of the fishing industry and overall social costs into
consideration.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) official said Saturday that the party has yet to discuss who
will represent the party in the 2006 Taipei mayoral election.</P>
      <P>The official was responding to a local media report saying that
President Chen Shui-bian met with Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan in
March to discuss the possibility of nominating him to run for Taipei
mayor.</P>
      <P>According to DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan, the party is currently
busy dealing with the May 14 National Assembly election and the
year-end local elections and has not started to discuss matters
concerning the Taipei mayoral election, which is still nearly two
years away.</P>
      <P>Cheng said the DPP has never given up on the idea of regaining
the mayoralty from the Kuomintang and that it will definitely not be
absent from the next election.</P>
      <P>An unnamed DPP official said the party needs to find a candidate
who is able to attract "pan-blue" voters in order to win the
election, given the fact that "pan-blue" supporters outnumber
"pan-green" supporters in the capital city.</P>
      <P>Although Su displayed excellent performance in his former post as
Pingtung magistrate and in dealing with last year's opposition-led
demonstrations during his term as interior minister, he needs to work
harder to improve the country's public order in his current position
before joining the Taipei mayoral election, the official said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, former Council for Hakka Affairs Chairman Luo Wen-jia,
who is vying for the DPP's nomination for the year-end Taipei
magistrate election, said that Su is a good candidate for Taipei
mayor but that it is still too early to talk about the subject.</P>
      <P>Luo said that changes are taking place in Taiwan's political
scene faster than anyone can imagine and that no one can predict what
will happen next in the Taipei mayoral campaign.</P>

      <P>The tourism bureau of the Canadian

      <P>The bureau considers Taiwan a potentially lucrative source of

      <P>Yang said the office will first set up a Chinese-language Web

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT VISITS 'SELF-STRENGTHENING' YOUTH AT HER HOME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian paid a visit
Saturday to a Hualien middle school student recently cited as a young
"self-strengthening" heroine for her courage demonstrated in the face
of adversity.</P>
      <P>Chen visited Yu Ya-meng at her home in Hualien County, eastern
Taiwan to "help her realize a dream of youth."</P>
      <P>The middle school student was one of eight youths, ranging in age
from 12-16, decorated with a "self-strengthening" award by the Taiwan
Fund for Children and Families (TFCF) March 27 in recognition of
their vitality and endurance in the face of challenges and hardships
that their counterparts from normal families could never imagine. She
is also a beneficiary of the non-profit organization's aid program
for children from impoverished homes.</P>
      <P>Last year, Yu won an education award from the president because
of her excellent academic performance. While receiving the award, she
pledged that she would buy an air conditioner for her grandparents in
the future after she earned her first pay check from work. However,
Yu didn't have to wait long to fulfill her promise as President Chen
brought an air-conditioner with him on his visit to Yu's family.</P>
      <P>Chen said that he was also born into a poor family which he said
could not even afford a television set. Recalling that he had spent
his first student scholarship on a TV set, the president said he
understands Yu's dream and ambition to help her family live well.</P>
      <P>Chen encouraged Yu to maintain her efforts to achieve her dreams,
as he had done in his youth.</P>
      <P>In return, Yu presented Chen with a stone tea pot as a gift. She
said that she hopes the stone pot can work like "Aladdin's magic
lamp" by bestowing on Chen strength to protect Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu, a student of Hua Jen Middle School in the township of Chian,
expressed her wish to pursue higher education and said someday she
will serve in the military. For now, Yu said, all she can do is study
hard to achieve her goal.</P>
      <P>The TFCF -- a Taiwan version of the U.S. Christian Children's
Fund (CCF) -- has been lauded by Chen as "a driving force enabling
the government to strenuously and undauntedly work to administer the
country" for the unconditional care it provides for disadvantaged
children.</P>

      <P>Pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU) lawmakers on Saturday put forth a series of questions to test
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan according to what they
call the "love Taiwan index" ahead of his planned visit to China.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislators Huang Shih-cho and Tseng Tsan-teng said the test
is designed to evaluate whether Lien is fit to make the trip,
scheduled for April 26 to May 3.</P>
      <P>In the test, Lien is asked to answer what the relations between
Taiwan and China are, whether he will ask Chinese President Hu Jintao
to promote democratization in China, whether he will rebuke China for
enacting the Anti-Secession Law that threatens the use of force
against Taiwan, and whether he will fight for Taiwan's sovereignty
and its right to participate in the international community.</P>
      <P>Huang and Tseng said they fear Lien will damage the national
interests of Taiwan because Lien has refused to report to the
Democratic Progressive Party government before the trip and has
consistently confronted the government.</P>
      <P>They called it a "disgrace" for Lien to accept Beijing's
invitation to visit under the condition of recognizing the so-called
"1992 consensus" on the "one China" principle.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday that he
believes opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan will abide by
Taiwan law during his upcoming trip to China.</P>
      <P>Calling Lien a well-educated intellectual, Hsieh said Lien should
be able to differentiate between what is lawful and what is unlawful
and should be aware that signing an agreement with China requires the
government's authorization.</P>
      <P>Previous reports suggested that Lien might sign a peace accord
with the Communist Party of China (CPC) to officially end the KMT-CPC
civil war that lasted around two decades in China before the KMT fled
to Taiwan. The KMT has denied the reports.</P>
      <P>On the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union's plan to stage a
demonstration against Lien's China trip, Hsieh said the expression of
different opinions through lawful means is acceptable in a
pluralistic society.</P>
      <P>Hsieh urged the people to remain rational toward Lien's China
trip and avoid resorting to violence during the demonstration, saying
that doing otherwise would undermine the spirit of democracy.</P>
      <P>On a local media report that Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan
might represent the ruling Democratic Progressive Party to run in the
2006 Taipei mayoral election, Hsieh said that he has not heard
anything about it and that it is still premature to discuss the
subject.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan should take concrete steps, instead
of just offering empty rhetoric, to atone for its World War II
atrocities, an aboriginal lawmaker said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Legislator May Chin of the Non-Partisan Solidarity Union made the
call a day after Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi apologized
for his country's World War II aggression in Asia.</P>
      <P>Addressing a summit of Asian and African leaders in Jakarta,
Indonesia Friday, Koizumi acknowledged that imperial Japan's
occupation of much of East Asia "caused tremendous damage and
suffering for the people of many countries."</P>
      <P>"Japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of
humility, " Koizumi told representatives of dozens of nations
assembled to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first
Asia-Africa conference.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Koizumi's remarks, Chin said at a news conference
that the Japanese prime minister's expression of "deep remorse" was
not enough to make amends for its wartime atrocities.</P>
      <P>"Actions speak louder than words, " Chin said, adding that
Japanese leaders should kneel while apologizing to show their sincere
repentance and offer financial compensation for Taiwanese "comfort
women" who were forced into prostitution to serve Japanese soldiers
during World War II and bereaved families of a number of aboriginal
tribesmen who were forced to join the war in the 1940s when Taiwan
was still under Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>Chin pointed out that Koizumi's remarks didn't go beyond what
former Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama said in 1995 in
commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, Chin said, the Japanese government has only
offered rhetorical apologies while doing little to make amends for
its past mistakes.</P>
      <P>Worse still, Chin said, the Japanese government has approved
history textbooks compiled by rightist scholars that whitewash or
even distort Japan's militarist past and wartime atrocities.</P>
      <P>Chin said she will lead 60 representatives of Taiwanese
aboriginal citizens who died during World War II to Japan June 13 to
stage a protest at the controversial Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The Shinto shrine is dedicated to 2.5 million Japanese war dead,
including convicted war criminals. It also lists the names of
28,000-plus Taiwanese and 21,000 Korean soldiers, most of whom were
forced into military service under Japan's colonial rule.</P>
      <P>"We'll ask the Japanese government to withdraw the tablets
bearing the names of our aboriginal cousins and compensate their
bereaved families," Chin said.</P>

Research (CIER) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan posted a trade surplus of just US$290 million in the first
quarter of this year, with trade deficits registered for January and
March. The figure was US$1.66 billion lower than the year-earlier
figure.</P>
      <P>Exports rose 7.8 percent year-on-year to US$42.84 billion during
the three months to the end of March, marking the first time a growth
rate of less than 10 percent has been recorded since the final
quarter of 2003.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, imports amounted to US$42.55 billion, up 12.6 percent
over the year-earlier figure.</P>
      <P>Data provided by customs authorities indicates that the import of
transport vehicles saw the highest growth, at 60 percent, with the
import of trains for the high-speed railway system contributing most
to that growth.</P>
      <P>CIER analysts predicted that the import growth rate is likely to
slow down after the demand for high-speed trains is met.</P>
      <P>However, they said it will be unfavorable to Taiwan's economic
growth if the government does not try to enhance export growth,
especially when export orders are declining while the new Taiwan
dollar continues to rise against the U.S. dollar.</P>

Four Top Officers Cleared by Army in Prison
Abuses

A high-level investigation of the U.S.
Army has cleared four of the five top Army
officers overseeing prison policies and
operations in Iraq of responsibility for the
abuse of detainees there, Congressional and
administration officials said Friday. The
findings, which provoked outrage from some
civil rights groups and Democratic aides, came
nearly a year after shocking photographs of
American military police officers stacking naked
Iraqi prisoners in a human pyramid and of other
abuses first telecast nationally. So far, only a
small number of soldiers, mostly from the
enlisted ranks have faced courts-martial for
their actions at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere.
Dozens of others have faced administrative
discipline for abusing captives at other
detention sites and battlefield interrogation
stations across Iraq.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>LAWMAKERS URGE MND NOT TO COMPROMISE ON LAFAYETTE COMMISSION CASE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two lawmakers familiar with military
affairs urged the Ministry of National Defense (MND) Saturday to
defend national interests in negotiating the Lafayette frigate
kickback case with French authorities.</P>
      <P>Legislators Lee Wen-chung of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party and Lin Yu-fang of the opposition People First Party made the
call after the French daily Le Monde reported Friday that the French
government has named a former finance ministry official to negotiate
with Taiwan over compensation for a Lafayette frigate commission
scandal.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the French government hopes to resolve
the case through negotiations instead of a court verdict. And if the
international arbitrary court handling the case rules that France
must compensate Taiwan for illegal kickbacks in the Lafayette frigate
deal, the report said, France is hopeful that a fugitive Taiwan arms
broker can be made to pay part of the amount.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased six Lafayette-class frigates built by French
defense contractor Thomson-CSF for US$2.8 billion in 1991. The
contract signed between the ROC Navy and the French firm clearly
stipulated that no kickbacks were allowed in the deal.</P>
      <P>However, allegations about kickbacks over the deal emerged after
the death of Navy Captain Yin Ching-feng, head of the navy's arms
acquisition office, whose body was found floating in the sea off the
east coast of Taiwan in late 1993.</P>
      <P>It has been alleged that Yin was murdered to prevent him from
blowing the whistle on rampant corruption in the military --
including the Lafayette deal. Kickbacks involved in the Lafayette
deal allegedly reached an estimated US$500 million.</P>
      <P>The ROC Navy has filed an appeal with an international commercial
arbitrary court in France in August 2001 to seek compensation from
French authorities. Moreover, the Navy asked for an additional US$99
million in damages to its reputation.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the latest French media report, the two legislators
said it is understandable that France would seek to consult with
Taiwan over the Lafayette kickback issue.</P>
      <P>Lee and Lin further said they believe that the court ruling would
very likely be unfavorable to France. They urged the MND and other
relevant government agencies to start preparations for possible
negotiations with France over the kickback issue.</P>
      <P>The two lawmakers also said the MND should stand firm on its
stance and defend national interests in future negotiations.</P>
      <P>As to whether the MND should agree to the reported French
proposal that Andrew Wang, an arms broker who fled Taiwan in 1993 and
has been wanted since September 2000 for suspected involvement in the
alleged Lafayette kickback scandal and the subsequent murder of Navy
Captain Yin, be made to pay part of the compensation, the two
lawmakers said it should depend evidence presented by France.
According to the contract, France alone is liable to pay the
compensation.</P>
      <P>A Swiss federal court has ruled that Taiwan, France and the
Principality of Liechtenstein should be given access to Swiss legal
files, particularly documents regarding the Andrew Wang family's bank
accounts in Switzerland, to facilitate investigations into the
alleged Lafayette kickback scandal.</P>
      <P>Swiss judicial authorities have frozen Wang's Swiss bank
accounts, which contain some US$600 million in suspected slush funds
used as kickbacks from the Lafayette frigate deal, according to
previous press report.</P>
      <P>Wang and his son, Wang Chia-hsing, might also have bank accounts
with deposits totaling US$100 million in Liechtenstein and the
British-administered Cayman Islands in the Caribbean Sea.</P>
      <P>Since Aug. 1, 2000, an ROC special investigative team has been
probing arms procurement scandals allegedly connected with the death
of Navy Captain Yin under suspicious circumstances.</P>
      <P>No major breakthrough has been achieved because key suspect Wang,
who is believed to be deeply involved in the Lafayette kickback
scandal, remains at large, reportedly residing in London.</P>
      <P>The investigation team has not yet discovered any hard evidence
of alleged Lafayette kickbacks paid to Taiwan officials.</P>
      <P>To speed up the investigations, the team has recently recruited
several prosecutors versed in financial and banking affairs to assist
in tracking the money trail.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh on Saturday lauded a
multiple job creation program initiated by the Council of Labor
Affairs (CLA) for successfully helping more than 50,000 people land
jobs since it's implementation four years ago.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks while addressing the opening of an
exhibition to demonstrate the results of the job creation program at
the Red Playhouse square in Taipei's bustling Simending district.</P>
      <P>The premier said the program is part of the government's efforts
to take care of Taiwan's aboriginal people, who make up roughly 2
percent of the island's overall population. He noted that some 15
percent of the people who have found employment through the program
are aboriginal.</P>
      <P>CLA Minister Chen Chu, speaking on the same occasion, explained
that the program was launched mainly with the aim of helping
middle-aged and elderly citizens as well as aboriginal people find
employment. With the cooperation of more than 1,000 private
organizations around the island, the council has helped many
unemployed people find work in their hometowns, she said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SOFTENS TONE ON OPPOSITION LEADERS' CHINA VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Saturday he
would offer his blessing for the two opposition leaders' forthcoming
visits to China if they faithfully abide by the domestic law
throughout their trips.</P>
      <P>Chen was quoted as having made the remarks while lecturing at the
Ketagalan Institutem, which was founded by Chen to nurture a new
generation of leaders for public service.</P>
      <P>Under the present law, Chen said the government cannot ban the
two opposition "pan-blue alliance" leaders -- Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party Chairman James Soong --
from traveling to China.</P>
      <P>"They are leaders of civic groups. None of our existing laws
prohibit them from visiting China. So long as they abide by law
during their visits, we can offer our blessing, " Chen said, adding
that they might be able to offer the government first-hand
information after they exchange views with senior Chinese officials.</P>
      <P>Probably, Chen said, their China visits could offer inspiration
or guide for future development of relations across the Taiwan
Strait. Chen further said he has never opposed the two "pan-blue"
leaders' China visits. "What I wants to stress is that during their
visits, they should refrain from touching on anything involving
national sovereignty or public authority without prior government
authorization, " Chen said, adding that he is pleased to see that KMT
officials have repeatedly stressed in recent days that Lien would not
sign any agreements during his China visit.</P>
      <P>Lien is scheduled to talk with Chen over phone Monday about his
China visit.</P>
      <P>Chen said it will mark the first time in more than four years
that Lien is willing to talk with him.</P>
      <P>"I appreciate his decision. The phone call will mark the first
step for constructive interaction and reconciliation between the
ruling and opposition parties after all these years of standoff and
confrontation. We should welcome and recognize this move," Chen said,
adding he will not insist that Lien address him as "president" during
their scheduled phone conversation.</P>
      <P>For many years, Chen said, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
have no direct contact and have to rely on indirect channels or media
reports to know the other side's views on many issues. The two
opposition leaders' China visits can offer opportunities for direct
dialogue with top Chinese leaders and thus provide first-hand
information for government reference in policy formulation, he added.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former ROC premier and vice president, is scheduled to
depart Taipei April 26 for what he bills a"peace of journey" to
China. He will be the first KMT chairman ever to set foot in china
since the party, which one ruled all of China, retreated to Taiwan in
1949 after losing a bloody civil war to the Chinese communist. He
will meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao April 29.</P>
      <P>Lien lost his presidential bids in 2000 and 2004. He has been
unwilling to address Chen as president since losing the 2004
presidential election by a slim margin. He filed two lawsuits to
challenge Chen's re-election victory. The two lawsuits have both been
rejected by the Taiwan High Court.</P>

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff

      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun is scheduled to

      <P>Yu made a low-profile visit to Japan earlier this month. His

China's enactment of its anti-secession law targeting Taiwan and two
opposition leaders' visits to China.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Saturday
that if the European Union lifts its ban on arms sales to
China, it would hurt Taiwan's freedom and human rights.</P>
      <P>Such a move would also be a stark irony to E.U. countries
which have been known for their advocacy of freedom,
democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks in a videotaped speech delivered to more
than 300 members of the International Society for Human Rights
(ISHR) , who were gathering in Germany for the non-government
organization's annual congress. The society is headquartered in
Frankfurt, Germany.</P>
      <P>Noting that China's recently enacted anti-secession law
codifies the use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan, Hsieh said
if the E.U. lifts its arms embargo against China would be tantamount
to endorsing such an ill-intentioned legislation.</P>
      <P>It's immoral to force a liberal, democratic Taiwan to unify
an undemocratic China, Hsieh said, adding that the E.U. should
refrain from throwing weight behind China by lifting its arms ban.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. BEEF BACK ON THE MENU IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. beef is back on the menu in Taiwan
after being banned for a year-and-a-half because of the discovery of
a single case of mad cow disease in Washington State.</P>
      <P>A 2,170 kilogram shipment of U.S. beef in 166 cartons arrived at
the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport Sunday morning, and
quarantine officials from the Council of Agriculture (COA) and the
Ministry of Economic Affairs took random samples for testing. Results
of the examinations are expected in two weeks.</P>
      <P>Importers are eager to fill the backlog of orders for the meat
from local restaurants and supermarkets.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced in late March that
Taiwan will conditionally reopen its market to U.S. boneless beef
from cattle under 30 months of age beginning April 16.</P>
      <P>Meat from U.S. cattle under 30 months old, clear of bones, offal
and specific risk materials, including brain, trigeminal ganglia,
dorsal root ganglia and spinal marrow, and with certificates issued
by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) , can now be imported
into Taiwan. Ground beef is not included in the opening list, bureau
officials added.</P>
      <P>The DOH Bureau of Food Safety, meanwhile, has asked the USDA to
provide Taiwan with a list of the names of legal, contracted U.S.
slaughterhouses to be used as a reference to compare with the sources
of the newly imported beef.</P>
      <P>COA officials said last month that an import ban on live cattle
from the United States will remain in place in line with regulations
set forth by the World Animal Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Taiwan suspended beef imports from the United States in December
2003 due to safety concerns over bovine spongiform encephalopathy
(BSE), also known as mad cow disease, after the discovery of a single
case of mad cow disease on a ranch in the U.S. state of Washington.</P>
      <P>Taiwan health and agriculture officials have traveled to the U.S.
to conduct on-site inspections of the implementation of U.S.
safeguards against mad cow disease and have recently completed the
necessary reviews for resuming the beef trade.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased US$325 million worth of U.S. beef and beef
products in 2003 and was the sixth-largest importer of U.S. beef
before Taiwan imposed the ban in December 2003. Since then,
Australian beef has replaced U. S. beef in the Taiwan market.</P>
      <P>More than 40 countries, including Japan, the largest importer,
banned U.S. beef in the aftermath of the mad cow disease scare,
seriously affecting the U.S. beef export trade, which is worth at
least US$3.8 billion a year. Big names in the beef export trade,
including Tyson Foods, Inc. and Cargill, Inc., have exerted great
pressure on the USDA for an early resumption of exports to these
countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SHOULD NOT CAVE IN TO NAME GAME FOR WHO BID: THINK TANK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  24 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should join the World Health
Organization (WHO) under its own name rather than "Taiwan, China, "
which would downgrade it into a part of China's territory, the head
of a private think tank said Sunday.</P>
      <P>At a seminar organized by the Taiwan New Century Foundation on
ways of participating in the WHO, the foundation's president, Chen
Lung-chu, said the prospects for Taiwan's WHO bid this year are
better than in the past because China, which has gone out of its way
to shut Taiwan out of any international group, might soften its
attitude somewhat to try to quell the international flap that has
ensued after its enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, which legalizes
China's use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, however, should not accept any name that suggests it is a
part of China for membership in the WHO; rather, it should insist on
a name that reflects its status as an independent country separate
from China, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The first choice for Taiwan, of course, would be to join as a
full member. Since that is impossible as only U.N. members can enjoy
this states, the next choice is to participate in the organization as
an observer under the name of the Republic of China, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan, China," which indicates that Taiwan is a part of China,
is not a viable option, Chen added.</P>
      <P>Citing the WHO's promise during the 2005 World Health Day on
April 7 to make every mother and child count, Chen said the promise
will never be delivered with Taiwan excluded from the WHO.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will try for the ninth time in a row to have its
observership bid in the World Health Assembly (WHA) put on the WHA
agenda for discussion at its annual conference on May 16 in Geneva.</P>
      <P>For the ROC to join the WHA as an observer, a majority in the
assembly must support such a motion.</P>

will continue to seek to join the WHA -- the WHO's decision-making
arm -- as an observer this year, while seeking to participate in
operations of the International Health Regulations (IHR).</P>
      <P>Still based on a "health entity" concept, Taiwan will continue to
push for WHA observer status this year, the ninth consecutive year
since 1997, with international support also expecting to increase,
Liao said.</P>
      <P>Due to China's recalcitrance, Taiwan's bids have largely gone
nowhere. At last year's Assembly, the United States and Japan voted
in favor of putting the issue on the agenda, but China and its
satellites kept the motion off the agenda.</P>
      <P>This time around, Liao said, the government has decided to adjust
its strategy after consultations with the United States and other
allies.</P>
      <P>"We'll give top priority to actually taking part in WHO
activities in a two-pronged approach as our initial goal," Liao said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will use the influence of the United States and Japan's
"yes" votes last year to encourage the European Union's to follow
suit this year, Liao noted.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also seek support from its diplomatic allies as well
as pro- Taiwan countries to have revisions to the IHR articles passed
by the WHA, he added.</P>
      <P>The revised IHR will adopt a "universally applicable" principle
to allow for Taiwan's participation in WHO activities.</P>
      <P>Once the proposed amendments are passed, Liao said, the IHR will
stipulate that its provisions will be applicable to all humans to
protect them from being infected with internationally communicable
diseases.</P>
      <P>The WHO is expected to pass the proposed IHR revision package at
the annual World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva on May 16.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An eight-member delegation of the People
First Party (PFP) left for Beijing Sunday via Hong Kong to arrange
for a visit by party Chairman James Soong to mainland China planned
for early next month.</P>
      <P>PFP Secretary-General Chin Ching-sheng, who led the group, said
that Soong will not represent the government or any other individual
when he visits China and talks with Communist Party of China (CPC)
officials, including CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao, who is also the
Chinese president.</P>
      <P>Soong will make the visit in his capacity as PFP chairman and
will talk with Hu based on the 10-point accord that Soong inked with
President Chen Shui-bian Feb. 24 to seek common ground and build
peace across the Taiwan Strait, Chin said, adding that the PFP very
much hopes to help in pushing for government-to-government dialogue
between Taiwan and China and make great contributions in cross-strait
peace.</P>
      <P>Brushing aside the controversial "1992 consensus" and the
disputed "one China" question, he said that the PFP respects the
president's stance in this field as everyone has his or her own
interpretation. But he claimed that the public is quite aware of the
outcome of the 1992 meeting attended by Taiwan and Chinese officials
in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>He added that the 10-point Chen- Soong accord will form part of
the government's China policy in the future since 90 percent of the
people in Taiwan approved of the agreement that pledges to maintain
the cross-strait status quo and rules out Taiwan independence during
President Chen's tenure.</P>
      <P>The PFP mission is slated to return to Taiwan next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The PFP is Taiwan's second-largest opposition party, which
comprises the pro-unification "pan blue alliance" with the main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the New Party countering the
pro-independence "pan green camp" of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan is also scheduled to leave for China next

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
supports a proposal to hold three local government elections
simultaneously by the end of this year, but complementary measures
should be in place to ensure that everything goes smoothly, party
Chairman Su Tseng-chang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>One day after President Chen Shui-bian threw his weight behind
the Executive Yuan's plan to hold the elections of the chiefs and
councilors of counties and cities, and the chiefs of townships near
the end of the year on the same day, the DPP chairman, who initially
opposed the idea in a rare conflict between the DPP government and
the party, softened his attitude by saying that the plan would need
to be carefully thought out to avoid chaos.</P>
      <P>Citing warnings by Minister of Justice Shih Mao-lin that holding
the three elections at the same time would give corrupt politicians a
good chance to rig the elections, Su said it would be an enormous
task for election and law enforcement officials to prevent fraud.</P>
      <P>"Complementary measures should be in place to ensure that the
president's plan of reforming the country's electoral system does not
go awry." Su argued.</P>
      <P>Su, who will be responsible for the party's performance in
various elections, had criticized the "three-in-one election" as a
political ploy to ensure the defeat of the DPP in the local elections
when Premier Frank Hsieh unveiled it on March 30. The premier had
said that the move was to shave costs incurred from holding separate
elections.</P>
      <P>Su dismissed as nonsense speculation that the president's
decision to support the premier in the dispute was an indication of
the president's personal preference for Hsieh over Su as Chen's
possible successor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RED CARPET FOR LIEN A SMOKE SCREEN FOR UNITED FRONT: DISSIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  April  23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The red carpet treatment that
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan will receive in
Beijing will be nothing more than window dressing by the Chinese
Communists as a united front against Taiwan, democracy activist Wang
Dan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Wang, a former leader of the pro-democracy demonstration that was
crushed by the Chinese military in Tiananmen Square in 1989, who now
lives in the United States, said that another reason that China will
be falling over itself to embrace the KMT delegation is to curry
favor with Washington, which has long advocated that cross-Taiwan
Strait issues be resolved peacefully or via dialogues.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered to a group of overseas Chinese in Los
Angeles, Wang suggested that Lien, who is scheduled to embark on his
self-styled "journey of peace" to China April 26, should make it
clear to Chinese President Hu Jintao that change must come to the
China's political regime, including democratization and freedom of
speech. Lien must also speak on behalf of Taiwan to protect the
island's long-term interests, he said.</P>
      <P>Wang, a Harvard University doctoral candidate who is currently on
a research project on the West Coast, said that even if the KMT
chairman signs an agreement with his Beijing hosts, it would be "just
rubbish, " given the true colors of the Communist Party of China
(CPC).</P>
      <P>Noting that every written accord that the KMT and the CPC reached
in the past ended up in the trash can of history, Wang, a history
major at Beijing University before the 1989 Tiananmen Square
Massacre, said that the Chinese Communists are untrustworthy and not
interested in matters that only benefit others.</P>
      <P>Wang, the founder of the Chinese Constitutional Reform
Association in the United States, has visited Taiwan many times since
he first set foot on the island on March 18, 1999.</P>
      <P>He was in Taipei in January 2003 to launch his two new books
written in Chinese -- one a collection of poems and the other a work
of prose -- both published by Taipei's Locus Publishing Co.</P>
      <P>He was in Taipei again in July 2003 for six weeks at the
invitation of the Taipei City Government as an artist-in-residence.</P>
      <P>Wang was jailed in July 1989 for his part in the pro-democracy
demonstration and was released in February 1993. He was arrested
again in October 1996 and sentenced to a further 11-year prison term.</P>
      <P>In April 1998, he was released on parole on medical grounds and
permitted to travel to the United States for treatment -- a move that
effectively sent him into exile.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FACING DOWNWARD PRESSURE IN H2 ECONOMIC GROWTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(BY S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If China continues to macro-manage its
economy and the global economy keeps slowing down, Taiwan's economic
growth in the second half of this year is expected to be adjusted
downward, economists said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research on April 14
lowered its 2005 estimate of Taiwan's economic growth rate from 4.37
percent to 4.05 percent, and the government's Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics also adjusted its forecast down to
4.21 percent.</P>
      <P>Foreign banks in Taiwan have set their forecasts of Taiwan's 2005
economic growth at between 4.0 percent and 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's economy, Cheng Chen-mao, an economist at Citibank,
said that second quarter growth may be even lower than the first
quarter, though many have predicted it will improve in the second
half. Two factors must be taken into account for this, Cheng said: to
what extent China macro-manages its economy, and how strongly the
U.S. economy recovers.</P>
      <P>A third factor affecting Taiwan's Q3 and Q4 performance will be
how strongly Taiwan's electronics industry recovers, Cheng added.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's foreign trade surplus has shrunk mainly because
its electronics industry has not recovered well, idling a large
portion of production facilities. Therefore, he said, increases in
orders for and prices of Taiwan's electronics products will be a key
indicator of Taiwan's economic performance in the second half of the
year.</P>
      <P>China has been an important market for Taiwan, absorbing Taiwan's
electronics output in step with the world market. Over the past few
years, however, Taiwan has increased steel, petrochemical and other
exports to China. If China keeps implementing its macro-management
policy, Taiwan's export businesses will definitely be affected, Cheng
said.</P>
      <P>Citibank has forecast that China's economy will grow 8.5 percent
this year, but the Chinese government recently announced that the
growth rate for the first quarter was 9.5 percent. Therefore, Cheng
said, China will likely take further steps to cool down its economy.</P>
      <P>An economist with Taiwan's Standard Chartered, Li Chang-tai,
agreed that the Chinese and U.S. economic situations will affect
Taiwan's performance in the second half of 2005.</P>
      <P>As the two major economies are doing quite well, as is Taiwan's
domestic demand, and the government is seeking to boost the economy,
Standard Chartered Taiwan remains optimistic about the island's
growth in the second half, Li said.</P>
      <P>Li attributed the poor first quarter trade surplus -- a mere
US$290 million -- to slow export growth of semiconductors and rising
oil prices that brought up the total value of imports and slowed down
export businesses.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he pointed out, strong domestic demand and real
estate investments have been buttressing Taiwan's economic
development.</P>
      <P>He warned that oil price fluctuations and the island's growing
dependence on the Chinese market are "risk factors" that Taiwan must
face.</P>
      <P>Professor Chu Hao-min of National Chengchi University in Taipei
said as the global economy has been slowing, import demand in such
major markets as Europe and the U.S. -- Taiwan's major export markets
-- has naturally affected Taiwan's export performance.</P>
      <P>"If not for the Chinese market, Taiwan would have long ago
suffered a trade deficit," Chu said.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that Taiwan's current account surplus has
been shrinking, capital outflows have exceeded inflows, and the
international balance of payments is feared to worsen.</P>
      <P>But this may also signal an increase in the import of production
machinery and equipment, which would mean a boom in investment. "That
would be a good thing for the long-term growth of the economy, " he
said.</P>
      <P>Chu did not agree with Standard Chartered's upbeat view on
Taiwan's real estate market, saying housing prices in Taiwan are
approaching their ceiling.</P>
      <P>What will have a critical effect on Taiwan's second-half economic
performance is business investments, domestic consumption and the
government's measures to stimulate the economy, in addition to the
Chinese and U.S. economies, he said.</P>

      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) will not condone Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien's actions if he
intends to yield to Beijing's "one China" principle in talks with
Communist Party of China (CPC) officials, DPP lawmaker William Lai
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lai, a DPP caucus whip at the Legislative Yuan, said that the DPP
would give its blessing to Lien only when it is fully confident that
the KMT chairman will not do anything that might infringe upon the
government's authority in talks with CPC officials during his visit

      <P>If Lien does something that is in violation of the Republic of

strictly by the book, he said.</P>
      <P>Although President Chen Shui-bian said the previous day that he
would give Lien his blessing if the KMT head promises to observe
Taiwan's laws and denounces Beijing's "one China" principle when
talking with CPC officials, Lai claimed that the president has never
changed his position on this point and that he was trying to do his
best to remind Lien never to hurt Taiwan's interests during his China
visit.</P>
      <P>In the face of Beijing's united front tactics, Taiwan's
opposition and ruling camps should unite and not be fractured, he

      <P>He also called for calm among pro-independence supporters who

International Airport before his departure for China Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that everyone in a democratic society is free to

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR ADVOCATES CROSS-STRAIT 'CONFEDERATION OF STATES'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 24 (CNA)
(By Debbie Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou advocated a
"confederation of states" concept Sunday that was spearheaded by
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan in 2004 as a "more
realistic" solution to cross-Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>Noting that "many people favor the confederation idea, " Ma,
concurrently a KMT vice chairman, said that one of Lien's goals in
his forthcoming visit to China is to stress to the Beijing leadership
the fact that Taiwan and China are two independent political entities
under separate governmental systems.</P>
      <P>In his book published prior to the 2004 presidential election,
Lien said that "on the possible ways of future integration between
the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, a confederation system is an idea
worthy of consideration, inasmuch as it can maintain the momentum of
both sides moving toward the direction of unification."</P>
      <P>Ma noted, however, that Lien's "confederation system" concept may
not be acceptable to the sitting Beijing leadership at present since
this system is a "commonwealth" system under which Taiwan and China
are two separate states with their own sovereignty.</P>
      <P>Even so, he said, it would not be an obstacle barring the KMT
chairman from seeking to meet with Beijing leadership to end the long
political impasse across the Strait.</P>
      <P>Ma said that although the two sides do not recognize each other,
private cross-strait exchanges have been so frequent and has been
close to a level surpassing the one that the two Germanys enjoyed
before they were unified.</P>
      <P>He said the two rival sides should first seek to defuse tensions
and military threats before they can talk about cooperation, followed
by the signing of a peace agreement and economic cooperation and
development accords.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu followed
President Chen Shui-bian's lead in giving her blessing Sunday to
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's proposed trip to China, but was
reserved about the impact of Lien's visit.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Hsinchu, northern Taiwan on the sidelines of a
conference of a local Lion's Club, Lu said that any act within the
law will be protected; those that are not will be punished, adding
that she hopes Lien succeeds in his trip, which is not prohibited by
law.</P>
      <P>The vice president, who is known as an outspoken critic of China,
said it is difficult to predict whether Lien's trip will be helpful
or harmful to the country.</P>
      <P>She cast into doubt Lien's claims that his trip will promote
peace between Taiwan and the mainland, asking, "Can anyone believe
that one person's single trip to Beijing can bring peace across the
Taiwan Strait, especially in light of the KMT's past unsuccessful
dealings with the Communist Party of China?"</P>
      <P>Lien's trip, set for April 26, a month-and-a-half after China's
enactment of a law to provide it with a legal basis to use force
against Taiwan, will inevitably cause Taiwan's forces to relax their
guard and will cause soldiers to question the wisdom of confronting
China, Lu claimed.</P>
      <P>The vice president said she hopes Lien does not compromise the
country's sovereignty, dignity, and that he will respect the Republic
of China's Constitution and its leaders.</P>
      <P>Citing the fact that Lien addresses her as "Miss Lu" and
President Chen Shui-bian as "Mr. Chen, " the vice president said: "He
is setting himself up to be the butt of international jokes by
continuing to address us in this way."</P>
      <P>Lien, who lost to Chen in the 2004 presidential race by a slim
margin, has never admitted defeat. Instead, he filed two lawsuits to
have the election overturned. Both cases were thrown out of court.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar is likely to go on
rising slightly against the U. S. dollar this week on renewed
speculation that mainland China is set to allow its renminbi to
freely float against the greenback in a narrow band, banking experts
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>But experts predicted that the local currency will only fluctuate
marginally in a narrow range between 31.40 and 31.55 against the U.S.
unit due to weak momentum because of a slowed influx of foreign
capital due to a sliding stock market.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar ended at 31.503 against the U.S. dollar
last Friday on the Taipei foreign exchange, up by NT$0.196 compared
to the week-earlier level.</P>
      <P>A fresh market anticipation for an appreciation of the renminbi
will still prop up Asian currencies in a piecemeal fashion, which
bankers said will not be as strong as in the first quarter of this
year.</P>
      <P>Their analysis came after Zhou Xiaochuan, central bank governor
of China, said Saturday that there were no serious political or
technical obstacles to the reform of the rigid peg of the renminbi to
the U.S. dollar. But Zhou did not spell out any exact time on the
move, saying only that a timetable for any changes was still under
review.</P>
      <P>Cheng Cheng-mount, Citibank Taiwan vice president, forecast that
the local currency will not markedly pick up in value until the end
of the year, which is traditionally the peak season for many
businesses.</P>
      <P>Although the New Taiwan dollar's strong appreciation in the first
half sparked grave concern in the export sector, Cheng said that the
U. S. economy and the effects of China's drive to stem its economic
overheating, rather than the currency exchange rate, will have
greater leverage on Taiwan's economy in the second half.</P>
      <P>Hsu Chang-tai, an economist with the Standard Chartered Bank in
Taipei, opined that the U. S. dollar's depreciation may have come to
an end after an adjustment period of more than two years in terms of
value against other major currencies.</P>
      <P>As the U. S. dollar is gradually stabilizing, Taiwan's central
bank will also make the local currency stay little changed to secure
Taiwan's competitive edge, Hsu said, pointing out that the currency
exchange rate will thus not be a major element affecting Taiwan's
economy in this year's second half.</P>
      <P>Hsu expected the renminbi to be freely exchanged within a narrow
band between 3 percent and 5 percent against the greenback this year.
There will be a small effect to help push up the new Taiwan dollar
over the short term, but its overall impact will not be conspicuous,
he contended, forecasting that the local currency will move between a
range of 31.3 to 31.8 for the rest of this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EUROPE CONCERNED ABOUT CHINA VISITS BY LIEN, SOONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Berlin, April 24 (CNA)
(By Yu-li Lin/S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>European countries are concerned about the
aftermaths of visits to China by leaders of Taiwan's two opposition
parties, a ranking Republic of China official told German media.</P>
      <P>Kau Ying-mao, vice foreign minister who is visiting Europe, said
European officials and academics have questioned the timing and
motivations of visiting China by Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and
People First Party Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>He said the European elite wondered if all parties concerned in
Taiwan have reached a consensus on the two's China visits, saying
they will monitor how Taiwan's government is going to handle the
issue.</P>
      <P>Talking about European response to China's enactment of the
Anti-Secession Law, Kau said European officials have privately
expressed their puzzle as to why China has repeatedly emphasized its
interest in increasing exchanges with Taiwan and yet at the same time
authorizing the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The European officials unanimously agreed that China's
Anti-Secession Law is a challenge to peace in Asia-Pacific, and so it
is highly probable that Europe will put off a decision to lift arms
embargo against China, according to Kau.</P>
      <P>Kau was leading a delegation exchanging views with German
officials, researchers and politicians. He left Berlin Sunday for
Brussels, where he will continue his visit to Europe.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: Medicare Change Will
Limit Access to Claim.

A new federal policy of the United States will make it
significantly more difficult for Medicare beneficiaries to obtain
hearings in person before a judge when the government denies their
claims for home care, nursing home services, prescription drugs and
other treatments. Under the new policy, Medicare official s said,
most hearings will be held with videoconference equipment or by
telephone. A beneficiary who wants to appear in person before a judge
must show that "special or extraordinary circumstances exist, " the
rules say. The policy chan ge comes as Bush administration officials
are predicting an increase in the volume of cases, with the creation
of a Medicare drug benefit expected to generate large numbers of
claims and appeals. But in a recent study, the Government
Accountability Office, an investigative arm of Congress, questioned
the heavy reliance on videoconferences, saying that "beneficiaries
are often uncomfortable using videoconference facilities and prefer
to have their cases heard face to face."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic growth for this year is
likely to be lower than previously forecast due to factors at home

Monday.</P>
      <P>TIER researchers adjusted their overall growth forecast downward
from 4.67 percent to 4.41 percent for 2005.</P>
      <P>The private economic think-tank researchers said the adjustment
was made because of lower-than-expected global economic expansion and
slower growth in Taiwan's export trade over the past two months. They
said the situation is not expected to pick up significantly in the
months to come.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen
Shui-bian has turned the People's Republic of China's anti-secession
law to his political advantage, and Beijing is now attempting to
isolate the Taiwan leader by wooing his political foes, according to
a report to appear in Newsweek magazine's May 2 edition.</P>
      <P>"China wants Taiwan back, but doesn't quite know how to make it
happen, " the report, entitled "Taiwan Bitter Friends", says, adding
that cross-strait tensions seemed to be easing earlier this year
until China's enactment of a tough anti-secession law in March
authorizing the use of force against the island to prevent a
permanent break between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Touching on issues regarding opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan's upcoming meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao and
Beijing's invitation extended to the leader of Taiwan's other major
opposition party, People First Party Chairman James Soong, for a
visit to the mainland, the report says that "Beijing is even tempting
the island's fruit farmers -- largely pro-independence supporters
with scrumptious trade terms for their produce."</P>
      <P>"It's a stick-and-carrot strategy, " the report quotes Emile
Sheng, a political science professor at Soochow University in Taipei,
as saying.</P>
      <P>"Not all Taiwanese are impressed by Beijing's overtures. Despite
Lien's talk of achieving 'peace for both sides of the Taiwan Strait,'
any negotiations need Chen's blessing, his party still holds more
sway with Taiwanese voters than the KMT," the report says.</P>
      <P>"Lacking any real power, Lien's bid for a cross-strait
breakthrough may turn into another cross-strait breakdown, " it
also says.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPINIONS MIXED IN TAIWAN ON KMT CHAIRMAN'S CHINA VISIT: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan's upcoming China visit has drawn mixed reactions from the people
in Taiwan, according to the results of a public opinion poll released
Monday.</P>
      <P>In the poll, conducted on randomly selected adults around the
island April 21-23 by Focus Survey Research at the commission of the
Taiwan Thinktank, 45 percent of the respondents said they approve of
KMT Chairman Lien Chan meeting with the Beijing leadership during his
visit in China, while 42 percent said they disapprove. Lien's visit
will mark the first by a KMT chairman to the mainland in more than
five decades.</P>
      <P>A total of 71 percent of the respondents said it would be
"inappropriate" for Lien to reach any consensus or enter any kind of
agreement with Beijing without the authorization of President Chen
Shui-bian, according to the Taiwan Thinktank.</P>
      <P>Some 64 percent of the respondents said they think Lien does not
have the authority to represent the people of Taiwan, the Taiwan
Thinktank reported. Even some 40 percent of supporters of the
"pan-blue alliance" of the opposition KMT and the People First Party
(PFP) had the same opinion, the pollsters said.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether Lien and PFP Chairman James Soong, who
is also scheduled to visit China in early May at the invitation of
mainland Chinese President Hu Jintao, should meet with President Chen
prior to their visits to China for talks, 66 percent said Lien and
Soong should call on President Chen beforehand, compared with 24
percent who said "it's not necessary," the poll found.</P>
      <P>About 54 percent of the respondents said they approve of Soong
talking with the Beijing leadership about the 10-point consensus on
cross-strait relations that he reached with President Chen recently,
compared with 30 percent who disapprove.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the poll found that 50 percent of the respondents
think the communist Chinese regime is now more hostile toward Taiwan
than a year ago, while only 20 percent think the opposite is true.</P>
      <P>A total of 39 percent think that cross-Taiwan Strait relations
will turn for the worse over the coming year, while 31 percent think
the opposite will occur.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the poll findings, Chen Ming-tong, a professor at
National Taiwan University and former vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, said that Beijing's
anti-secession law targeting Taiwan has turned cross-strait relations
sour and that the Taiwan general public is now more pessimistic about
the prospects regarding the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Hung Yu-hung, chairman of the private think-tank Taipei Society,
said that the results of the poll reveal two significant points,
namely that the people of Taiwan identify strongly with their country
regardless of their political affilition, and that they have a
highly-developed sense of democracy and political reasoning.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,075 valid samples were collected in the survey which
is said to have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.99 percentage
points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE TO ISSUE NEWS  RELEASE AFTER CHEN-LIEN CALL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian and opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan will talk by telephone Monday at
4: 10 p.m. ahead of Lien's trip to China the next day, and the
Presidential Office will issue a news release shortly after the call,
a spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsung, director of the Public Affairs Department under
the Presidential Office, said Presidential Office Secretary-General
Yu Shyi-kun had talked with KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng by
phone earlier in the day about the way to handle the news release
after the Chen- Lien phone conversation this afternoon.</P>
      <P>In line with Presidential Office custom, Chen Wen-tsung said, the
Chen-Lien phone conversation will be recorded. Nevertheless, he said
the Presidential Office will not publicize the contents of the call.
Instead, he said, the Presidential Office will issue a news release
outlining what was said.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsung said only Lien knows what the nature of the
discussion will be and that the Presidential Office will respect the
KMT's decision if it wishes to make public the transcript of the
call.</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-tsung said President Chen's conversations with guests
from home and abroad are always recorded and put into the government
archives. The practice has been in place since the KMT
administration, which lasted for more than five decades until May
2000.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former ROC premier and vice president, is scheduled to
depart from Taipei April 26 for what he calls a "journey of peace" to
China. He will be the first KMT chairman to set foot in China since
the party, which one ruled all of China, retreated to Taiwan in 1949
after losing a bloody civil war to the Chinese Communists. He will
meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao April 29.</P>
      <P>Lien lost his presidential bids in 2000 and 2004. He has been
unwilling to address Chen as president since losing the 2004
presidential election by a slim margin. He filed two lawsuits to
challenge Chen's re-election victory. The two lawsuits have both been
rejected by the Taiwan High Court.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP URGES MEMBERS NOT TO STAGE PROTEST AGAINST KMT HEAD'S CHINA TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth  Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As pro-independence groups prepare to
stage a demonstration at Chiang Kai-shek Airport against opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan's visit to China April 26, the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) chairman urged party members
Monday not to mobilize and not to break the law.</P>
      <P>Everyone in a democratic society enjoys the right to express
their opinions, but they are not allowed to break the law, Su
Tseng-chang said, urging DPP members not to oppose Lien's China trip
in a violent manner.</P>
      <P>Su made the call while campaigning in Miaoli for party candidates
in the mission-oriented National Assembly election to be held May 14.
He reiterated that now is a bad time for such visits to Beijing after
millions of Taiwanese people took to the streets to protest against
China's passage of its Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan in early
April.</P>
      <P>However, he added that opposing Lien's China visit is one thing,
while mobilizing to oppose the trip is something different, saying it
is not necessary for DPP party members to mobilize.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsan noted that the party will not
mobilize to oppose Lien's China trip and that it is banning its
members from taking part in similar rallies in the name of the DPP.

    <HEADLINE>LIEN AND SOONG WELCOMED TO CHINA WITH OPEN ARMS: M'LAND POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 25 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly all of the respondents in a recent
survey in mainland China said that the visits by the chairmen of the
two largest opposition parties in Taiwan will be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan will go to China on April 26
and James Soong, the head of the People First Party (PFP), a splinter
group of the KMT, will make a similar trip in early May.</P>
      <P>The Social Survey Institute of China interviewed 1,000 people
with phone in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Xian, Fuzhou,
Wuhan, Xining, Zhengzhou, and Shenyang.</P>
      <P>The results, quoted by Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po newspaper Monday,
showed that 69 percent of respondents think the visits mean
cross-strait relations are "coming out of winter and entering into
spring, " with 96 percent saying that the two men are welcome to
visit China.</P>
      <P>Those polled in China were optimistic about future relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, with 71 percent saying
Lien and Soong's discussions with Chinese leaders will "broaden" the
channel of dialogue between China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Seventy-six percent said the two visits will have a crucial
effect on the economic development in China and Taiwan as both sides
will strengthen economic cooperation, something that is needed for
their "joint development."</P>
      <P>The results of the Chinese survey were in stark contrast with a
Taiwan Thinktank survey that showed that 42 percent of those polled
in Taiwan did not support the two opposition leaders' visits to
China, while 45 percent approved.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD HOPES CHINA VISIT WILL HELP CROSS-STRAIT PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Monday that he hopes his upcoming visit to China will help
push cross-Taiwan Strait relations forward to a new era of peace.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that his visit is mainly aimed at reflecting the
Taiwan people's expectations, stressing that he will discuss a
variety of topics with his Chinese hosts during the visit.</P>
      <P>The chairman made the remarks at a news conference held by the
KMT.</P>
      <P>Lien, at the head of a KMT delegation consisting of three vice
chairmen as well as ranking officials and members of party think
thanks, is scheduled to leave Tuesday for Nanking, the first leg of
his eight-day tour in China.</P>
      <P>Seeing his visit as an opportunity to free both sides of the
Strait from their history, Lien said that he hopes that the two sides
can work together and help each other move forward to a peaceful
future and adopt practical measures to jointly create an interactive
relationship.</P>
      <P>The chairman said he hopes to better his understandings of
China's huge changes in the fields of politics and economic
development, as well as to hold talks with Chinese leaders on issues
relating to cross-strait peace, economic and cultural exchanges, and
the wellbeing of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Noting that he will not restrain himself from discussing any
topic with Chinese leaders, Lien, however, said that he neither
represents the government nor is authorized to negotiate with China.</P>
      <P>The KMT head will reportedly urge Taiwan and China to abandon
their policy of independence and the use of force, respectively. Lien
is also expected to push for the signing of a 50-year cross-strait
peace agreement and to establish "three communications" between the
two sides to expand cross-strait economic and trade exchanges.</P>
      <P>He also said that promoting cross-strait peace has been his own
and his party's longstanding policy and stance that has never
changed, and that during the visit, he will try to better understand
Beijing government's ideas to create a promising future and a win-win
situation for both sides of the Strait.</P>
      <P>As he considers his meeting with Hu a significant matter, the
chairman revealed that the KMT's efforts in promoting peace in the
Taiwan Strait have been affirmed publicly by the United States and by
leaders of various countries in Asia and Europe in private.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he will discuss issues regarding human rights and
democracy during his meeting with Hu or in his speech to be delivered
at Beijing University, Lien said that he will not forget the
importance of human rights and democracy since these issues are with
universal values. However, he emphasized that "how to promote a
peaceful future is the most important cross-strait issue."</P>
      <P>As to questions regarding whether he will request that China
dismantle missiles targeting Taiwan and sign a peace agreement with
Taiwan, the KMT head declined to give a reply, saying only that he
has not met with Hu yet.</P>
      <P>Talking about People First Party Chairman James Soong's visit to
China next week, Lien said that he would like to see leaders of other
political parties engage in dialogue with China, noting that the
PFP's mainland policy is similar to that of the KMT's and that visits
of other political parties to the mainland can strengthen mutual
understanding and harmony between the two sides of the Strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh
said Monday that opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and
People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong should consult with
President Chen Shui-bian or the Democratic Progressive Party
administration prior to their visits to China.</P>
      <P>Lien and Soong must consult the government before they embark on
their China visits, the head of Taiwan's top research institute said,
adding that only after the country has a consensus on this matter
will the two opposition leaders' visits have any meaning or benefit
for the people.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former ROC premier and vice president, is scheduled to
depart Taipei Tuesday for what he calls a "journey of peace" to
China. He will be the first KMT chairman to set foot on Chinese soil
since the party, which once ruled all of China, retreated to Taiwan
in 1949 after losing a civil war to the Chinese Communists. He will
meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Beijing this Friday.</P>
      <P>Soong is scheduled to head to China May 5. He is also visiting
China at the invitation of Hu.</P>
      <P>Soong was formerly a Taiwan provincial governor and a KMT
secretary-general. He also ran on the loosing ticket with Lien in the
2004 presidential election.</P>
      <P>The Academia Sinica president said that he has no idea what Lien
and Soong might be thinking about regarding their "historic" China
visits, but since President Chen has said that he would offer his
blessing for the two opposition leaders' forthcoming visits to China
if they faithfully abide by domestic laws throughout their trips,
Lien and Soong should fully exchange their opinions with the
president beforehand.</P>
      <P>President Chen said recently that their China visits could
possibly offer inspiration or be a guide for the future development
of relations across the Taiwan Strait, adding that he has never
opposed the two "pan-blue" leaders' China visits. "What I wants to
stress is that during their visits, they should refrain from touching
on anything involving national sovereignty or public authority
without prior government authorization," the president said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRONESIAN-SPEAKING PEOPLE ORIGINATED FROM TAIWAN: AUSSIE PROF.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taitung,  eastern  Taiwan,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Austronesian-speaking
people across the Asia-Pacific region originated from Taiwan, an
Australian academic said Monday.</P>
      <P>Prof. Peter Bellwood, director of the School of Archaeology and
Anthropology of Australian National University, said that it was
archaeologically proven that ancestors of today's
Austronesian-speaking people, numbering about 300 million, migrated
from Taiwan to Pacific Rim areas.</P>
      <P>Bellwood said he backed up this theory after he completed
archaeological fieldwork recently in Batan Island in the northernmost
part of the Philippines, and the Yer Bac prehistoric site in northern
Vietnam, where, he said, he found pieces of penannular jade rings and
earthenware that were related to the people who lived in prehistoric
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a speech delivered at the National Museum of Prehistory in
Taitung, Bellwood said that jade was not produced in most of the
Austronesian-speaking areas except for Taiwan and the pieces of
penannular jade rings found in both Batan and Yer Bac were similar to
those found in Hualien, eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the earthenware unearthed in the
Philippines is similar in pattern to the pieces unearthed in Hualien
or Taitung, eastern Taiwan, which date back 4,700 to 3,500 years.</P>
      <P>According to Bellwood, the Austronesian-speaking people began to
emigrate downward from the north to the Philippines about 4,000 years
ago, gradually to Vietnam and the Polynesian islands. Across the more
than 2,000 kilometer migratory travels, Taiwan and Austronesian
countries might have maintained interactions for as long as 3,000
years, he added.</P>
      <P>Discounting Bellwood's theory, some local academics who listened
to the speech argued that Bellwood's evidence, only pieces of jade
rings and pottery, was "too weak, " saying that those relics were not
necessarily the things that Austronesian-speaking people of the past
used. The relics could be brought to those areas by traders in
later years, they said.</P>
      <P>The academics said Bellwood should prove his theory with more
evidence.</P>
      <P>On a related note, a theory developed in Australia and New
Zealand in recent years has it that from genetics and linguistics
points of view, Taiwan is the place where the Austronesian-language
people originated from.</P>
      <P>Professor Geoffrey Chambers of Victoria University in Wellington
believes that Maori people and other Polynesian peoples of the
Pacific "island-hopped" from Taiwan through the Philippines and
Indonesia to West Polynesia. From there, he said, they traveled to
the islands of East Polynesia and then southwest, eventually settling
in New Zealand.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenous people as a whole are believed to belong to
the Austronesian-language group, which probably underwent the widest
physical dispersion of a single language family prior to the European
colonial expansion following Columbus, from the island of Madagascar
off the east coast of Africa all the way to the tiny, isolated Easter
Island (Rapa Nui) and extending to Taiwan, Vietnam, Northern
Australia, New Zealand and most of the Melanesian and Polynesian
islands.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's indigenous people -- the native groups that predate all
other ethnic groups in Taiwan -- could have originated either from
the southern part of China or from a vast Austronesian-language
region.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's aborigines are considered the northernmost Austronesian
people. Among them, the government currently divides them into 12
major mountain tribes and 10 Pingpu groups. While elements of the
languages and cultures of the 10 mountainous races have been
maintained, most of the native languages of the Pingpu people have
died out and no traces remain.</P>
      <P>Among the mountainous aborigines, the Saisiat and the Atayal are
believed to have migrated to Taiwan some 3,000 years ago.</P>
      <P>Anthropologists have no idea what exactly happened, or when, to
cause some of Taiwan's earliest natives to die out or disappear, but
efforts to seek traces of the original natives' existence via
anthropological, linguistic and historical studies have been
continuing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TIER LOWERS ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE FORECAST TO 4.41 PERCENT FOR 2005</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
(TIER) Monday lowered its growth forecast for Taiwan's economy in
2005 to 4.41 percent, due to a less-than-vibrant foreign trade sector
and a slowing global economy.</P>
      <P>TIER acting President David Hong said that Taiwan's gross
domestic product this year will grow less than last year's 5.71
percent but hailed an annual expansion of more than 4 percent a sound
performance for a nearly mature economy like that of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hong predicted that the domestic economy will begin to gain
greater momentum in the second quarter and will peak in the fourth
quarter. TIER economic growth rate forecasts for each quarter are
4.09 percent, 4.19 percent, 4.63 percent and 4.71 percent in that
order, he reported.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will enjoy a trade surplus of US$13.1 billion for the
whole of this year, up from the 2004 level of US$6.1 billion thanks
to an export sector that is estimated to increase by 9.09 percent
this year -- almost twice the growth forecast for the import sector
of 5.29 percent.</P>
      <P>The growth rate in private sector investment will drop to 8.09
percent in 2005 due to sliding domestic demand, while private sector
consumption will rise by 2.87 percent as a result of rising consumer
product prices at home and surging oil prices in the world market,
according to Hong.</P>
      <P>The TIER also predicted that the new Taiwan dollar will average
NT$30.73 against the U.S. dollar for the whole of 2005, an upward
adjustment from an earlier forecast of NT$31.65 that represents an
appreciation of NT$2.84 over the 2004 average.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar will still face pressure to appreciate this
year on a firm anticipation that mainland China will allow its
renminbi to be traded flexibly amid repeatedly strong requests from
the United States and the European Union, TIER researchers said.</P>
      <P>They opined that it is unlikely that the U.S. dollar will go up
in value over the short term if the United States fails to make
noticeable improvements in its long-standing deficits in federal
budgets and foreign trade.</P>
      <P>As the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to continue raising key
interest rates in the near future, Taiwan's Central Bank of China
(CBC) will follow in the footsteps of the U.S., although at a slower
pace, to reduce the gap in interest rate levels between the two
countries, they said.</P>
      <P>They pointed out that the CBC will adopt a neutral policy to
stabilize consumer product prices while gradually picking up interest
rates to help rational allocations of assets to secure a sound
financial market over the long term.</P>

their meeting have yet to be worked out.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Soong will deliver a speech at Tsinghua University.
His itinerary will also include visits to his hometown in Hunan
province's Hsiangtan City, Nanjing and Shanghai where he will meet
with Taiwan business people operating in China.</P>
      <P>PFP officials said Chin's mission is scheduled to return to
Taipei April 27.</P>
      <P>The officials further said Soong will be visiting China in his
capacity as PFP chairman, not as someone else's special envoy.</P>
      <P>The PFP is a splinter group of the main opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) . Both parties support a more conciliatory policy toward China
than the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and favor eventual
cross-strait unification.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Soong's upcoming China visit will mark an historic
rendezvous between the PFP and CPC leaderships, PFP officials
said, Soong will take advantage of his visit to help break through
the lingering cross-strait impasse.</P>
      <P>Soong's China visit will come on the heels of KMT Chairman Lien
Chan's April 26 to May 3 journey to China.</P>
      <P>Soong served as Taiwan provincial governor from 1993 to 1998. The
Taiwan Provincial Government has since been marginalized as part of
the government's political reform.</P>
      <P>Soong also once served as KMT secretary-general. He ran as an
independent in the 2000 presidential election, but lost to DPP
candidate Chen Shui-bian by a narrow margin. Shortly afterwards, he
founded the PFP. He served as KMT Chairman Lien's running mate in the
2004 presidential election, but the Lien-Soong ticket lost to
the DPP ticket of Chen and Vice President Annette Lu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Fund for Children and Families,
a Taiwan version of the U.S. Christian Children's Fund (CCF) and thus
known as CCF/Taiwan, has recently set up an operational center in
Mindanao, the Philippines, to help impoverished children there, an
organization official said Monday.</P>
      <P>CCF/Taiwan is the largest child and family welfare organization
in Taiwan and has helped over 100,000 local children living in
impoverished families to grow up into self-reliant citizens under its
sponsorship programs. It is at present sponsoring more than 27,000
needy local youths.</P>
      <P>CCF/Taiwan Executive Director Chen Pang-hung said that as Taiwan
has prospered economically, the number of sponsors contributing to
the fund has risen to the extent that the charity can now branch out
into other poverty-stricken nations.</P>
      <P>Besides sponsorship programs, the CCF/Taiwan center in Mindanao
will also assist women in the families being sponsored by the center
to receive vocational training, while it is also planning to set up a
day care center for kids as part of its efforts to help improve the

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's divorce rate grew by nearly four
fold in 12 years, according to the latest statistics released by the
government Monday.</P>
      <P>The tallies compiled by the Population Administration Department
under the Ministry of the Interior show that in 1983, 160,288 couples
married and 17,528 couples divorced, with the marriage number sliding
to 131,453 and the number of divorces rising sharply to 62,796 in
2004.</P>
      <P>The 2004 divorce number reflects a 3.6-fold growth over the 1983
figure, the same tallies show.</P>
      <P>There were 55,460 divorced men in Taiwan in 1983, accounting for
1.1 percent of the country's total male population in that year, but
the number of divorced men had surged by nearly five-fold to 224,934
last year, representing 5 percent of Taiwan's males.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the divorce number among Taiwan's women increased from
63,526 in 1983 to 391,090 in 2004, with the percentage rising from
1.3 percent to 6.2 percent, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Taiwan's men and women are marrying older, with
the average marrying age for men and women advancing to 30.7 and 26.8
years at present, largely up from 28.2 and 24.6 years in 1983,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's birth rate also dropped to a record law of 1.24 per
couple last year, prompting grave concern from the government sector
over Taiwan's competitive edge over the long term, ministry officials
said.</P>
      <P>To tackle the serious problem of a fast aging population, the
ministry is slated to work out a demographic white paper in June that
will suggest more handsome incentives and subsidies to encourage
Taiwanese to have more children.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC WARNS OPPOSITION LEADERS AGAINST FORGING AGREEMENTS WITH CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 25 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>No political party in Taiwan is allowed to
forge any agreement, either in verbal or written form, with China
without the government's authorization, Mainland Affairs Council
Chairman (MAC) Joseph Wu warned Monday.</P>
      <P>Political parties must also obtain the government's authorization
before negotiating with China on issues concerning government
affairs, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The warning was issued ahead of opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan's and opposition People First Party Chairman James
Soong's planned visits to China. While Lien's trip is set for April
26 to May 3, that of Soong is scheduled for May 5-12.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, it is the government's policy to promote
normalized exchanges across the Taiwan Strait to enhance mutual
understanding, and the government supports any civic exchanges that
meet this purpose.</P>
      <P>However, Wu said political parties are different from average
civic organizations and that their visits to China cannot be
considered average civic exchanges because political leaders have
their due responsibilities for the country, society and the people.</P>
      <P>Any political parties supported by Taiwanese voters are
responsible to pass on to Beijing leaders the strong objections of
the Taiwanese people toward the Anti-Secession Law that threatens the
use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan and its 23 million people,
Wu said.</P>
      <P>They must also tell Beijing leaders that the Republic of China is
a sovereign state independent of the People's Republic of China and
that only the 23 million people in Taiwan have the right to decide
the fate of their country, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, as a former vice president and an opposition leader,
Lien should assume his responsibility and convey to Beijing the
objections of the Taiwanese people toward the Anti-Secession Law
during his trip, Wu said.</P>
      <P>As to Lien's Monday talk with President Chen Shui-bian over the
telephone to report the purpose and details of his China trip, Wu
said this does not have any legal effect, because only an
"authorization" issued through a formal process is legally binding.</P>

The Bush administration has pressed Iraqi leaders in recent days
to end their stalemate over forming a new government, with Secretary
of State Condoleezza Rice and Vice President Dick Cheney personally
exhorting top Kurdish and Shiite politicians to come together. The
White Hous e pressure was a change in the administration's hands-off

negotiations had emphasized that the Iraqis needed to form their own
government without interference. Rice on Friday telephoned Iraq's new
president, Jalal Talabani, a Kurd, to urge him to complete the
government "as soon as they could" and "to get a status of where
things were."

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian was so moved by
the stories of three blind young people in a documentary titled
"Chasing Dreams in the Dark" that he donated NT$200,000 immediately
after watching the film Monday, hoping to arouse more interest in the
life of the disabled.</P>
      <P>It took Professor Wan Ming-mei, a special education expert, 10
years to record the stories of the three blind students, all of whom
also have to struggle with other physical disabilities. The
documentary was screened at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Lu Wen-kui is blind and mentally challenged, yet he is gifted
with a superb sense of music and can play any song on the piano after

      <P>He also thanked their parents and teachers for their endless love

      <P>"The courage and hard work of the three brave young people have
made up for the shortfalls of the government, of the law and of the

powerful explosion while removing landmines on the Republic of
China-held Kinmen Island, according to police.</P>
      <P>The police report also listed another technician, also a

adding that it remained unclear what triggered the explosion.</P>
      <P>A British firm has sent 12 experts, all from Zimbabwe, to clear
landmines at the site near Liaoluo Bay, where a reservoir is to be
built.</P>
      <P>Kinmen, which is controlled by the Republic of China but lies
closer to Taiwan than to China, was heavily mined in the 1950s to
fend off communist Chinese attempts to seize Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With tension easing between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
the Ministry of National Defense has demined 16 areas of Kinmen since
1998 in response to demands from Kinmen residents.</P>

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
will embark on a European trip Tuesday, visiting Finland, Sweden and

three countries, a ministry spokesman said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesman, the three countries complement Taiwan
in different fields and Ho will take part in private sector economic
meetings and visit top companies to search for cooperation
opportunities for Taiwan businesses and lure investment to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Slovak is rich in high-quality labor and has vast amounts of
cheap land, and Ho is hoping to help forge two-way business
opportunities for Taiwan's makers of car accessories and parts and
components, as Slovakia is particularly strong in the machinery and
automobile industries and has an ideal location to edge into the vast
European Union market, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Sweden and Finland are both advanced in eco-friendly and
knowledge-intensive industries and Ho is slated to visit Nokia in
Finland and Volvo and SKF in Sweden, he said, noting that the two
countries' highly advanced information and telecommunications sectors
should provide many exchange and investment opportunities for Taiwan
companies.</P>
      <P>Since European countries have been keen on exploring Asian
markets in recent years, Ho will also invite European pension fund
managers to invest in Taiwan, which is the reason behind her decision

      <P>The administration is in no position to
prohibit two opposition leaders from visiting China simply on the
assumption that they will breach the law during their trips, but
their behavior is governed by the law, Premier Frank Hsieh said
Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking to leaders of the World Federation of Taiwanese Chambers

opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and People First Party
Chairman James Soong are free to do what they like but beyond that
boundary, they cannot forge any valid pacts with their Chinese hosts
without the government's authorization.</P>
      <P>Noting that some critics of the opposition leaders are worried
that they could betray the country during their association with
China, the premier said his administration cannot stop their proposed
visits simply because of concern on the part of such critics.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said it is not appropriate for Lien and Soong to visit
China at the present time, because they will undermine the country's
protest against China's enactment of the Ant-Secession Law, which
gives it an excuse to use force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The visits will also provide Beijing with a much-needed
opportunity to ease the backlash caused by its enactment of the law

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan emphasized during talks with President Chen Shui-bian over the

be personal and civic in nature and will not involve any government
affairs, according to a statement released by the KMT.</P>
      <P>During the conversation, Lien also offered to provide details of
his discussions with Beijing leaders for the government's reference
after his return, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The 11-minute discussion, which the KMT described as being
conducted in a natural and peaceful atmosphere, took place one day
before Lien is set to leave for China for an eight-day trip during
which he will meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Lien expressed his gratitude for Chen's support for his China
trip and assured the president that the visit will be beneficial to
cross-Taiwan Strait peace and Taiwan's development. The statement
added that the KMT has always had a complete and clear policy toward
China.</P>
      <P>Lien reiterated that it is the KMT's long-standing China policy
to safeguard the country's dignity, protect the well-being of the
people and defend the constitutional system of the Republic of China
and that he will follow these principles during his trip.</P>
      <P>On the differences between the ruling and opposition parties over
the so-called "1992 consensus" that the KMT claims was established
between Taipei and Beijing during talks held in Hong Kong in 1992,
Lien said it is a normal phenomenon in a democracy for different
opinions to exist.</P>

at a 10-point consensus reached between KMT Vice Chairman P.K. Chiang

Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan Monday that the government
attaches great importance to Lien's upcoming visit to China and that
he looks forward to discussing cross-Taiwan Strait policy with Lien
when he returns home.</P>
      <P>The president exchanged views with the opposition leader over the

scheduled April 29 to meet Communist Party of China General Secretary
Hu Jintao, who is also China's president.</P>
      <P>Chen wished Lien "every success" during the trip and reminded
Lien that he has pledged to abide by the laws of the Republic of
China, in addition to safeguarding national sovereignty, dignity and
security, as well as seeking the maximum well-being for Taiwan's 23
million people.</P>
      <P>Chen thanked Lien for understanding that he has not been
authorized by the government to sign any deal with China that might
involve national sovereignty or the exercise of public authority.</P>
      <P>The president reaffirmed that the ROC is an independent,
sovereign state whose jurisdiction covers an area different to that
of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>When it comes to the ROC's position toward the PRC, Chen said, it
has always been clear: The ROC hopes to improve relations with the
PRC based on the principles of democracy, equality and peace. "We are
looking to see if there is a chance of resuming dialogue that would
lead to the establishment of a framework for cross-strait peace and
stability," he added.</P>
      <P>If Lien has the pleasure of sharing with Chen his observations
and personal feelings about his China tour, slated for April 26-May
3, Chen said he will be more than glad to meet with him after his
return.</P>
      <P>If and when they do meet, "we can discuss cross-strait policy and
ways of building a consensus between the ruling and opposition
parties," said the president.</P>
      <P>He acknowledged that there are many differences of views between
the ruling and opposition camps in Taiwan but added that if both
parties can do their best to reach a consensus on cross-strait
policy, "we will be able to show greater strength."</P>
      <P>To this, Lien responded by saying: "Let's work hard together.
Let's make our efforts together."</P>
      <P>Before they finished the rare conversation, Chen wished Lien a
happy journey and a safe return.</P>
      <P>Throughout the conversation, Lien did not call Chen "president."
Instead, he used the Chinese-language term -- "Brother Shui-bian" --
a term of endearment.</P>

      <P>More than 1,100 police officers will be
mobilized to maintain order at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International
Airport Tuesday when opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan is
scheduled to leave for what he bills a "journey of peace" to China,
officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-hsuan, deputy director of the Aviation Police Bureau,
said police authorities have tightened security at the airport
complex in Taoyuan County, some 40 km south of Taipei, in
anticipation of protests by pro-independence activists against the
visit.</P>
      <P>Huang said the main goal of the police authorities is to protect
inbound and outbound passengers' rights and safety. Vehicles entering
the airport complex will be subject to traffic controls between 7
a.m. and noon, Huang said, adding that buses carrying protesters will
be directed to a parking lot on the east wing, while buses carrying
Lien's supporters will be ordered to park at the Aviation Science
Museum parking lot.</P>
      <P>Huang urged demonstrators to remain calm and refrain from acting
"irrationally" during the rally. He reminded demonstrators that
banners, signboards, posters, eggs, loudspeakers and other articles
that can be used as weapons are banned at airport passenger
terminals.</P>
      <P>An estimated 5,000 protestors are expected to join the rally to
be organized by pro-independence groups, while about 2,000 of Lien's
supporters are also expected to turn up at the airport to see Lien
off.</P>
      <P> Lien, heading a large delegation of KMT officials and
journalists, will depart for Nanjing Tuesday for an eight-day China
visit during which he will meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>The trip will be the first time in 56 years that a leader of the

      <P>His tour will mark one of the biggest political ironies in the

and most dynamic democracies.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former ROC premier and vice president, lost his
presidential bids in 2000 and 2004. He has been unwilling to address
Chen as president since losing the 2004 presidential election by a
slim margin. He filed two lawsuits to challenge Chen's re-election
victory, both of which have been rejected by the Taiwan High Court.</P>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICAL PARTIES LAUD OPPOSITION LEADER'S CALL TO PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A phone call made by opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan to President Chen Shui-bian to brief the
president about Lien's visit to China was lauded Monday by all
Taiwan's political parties but the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
(TSU).</P>
      <P>Lawmaker William Lai, the legislative caucus whip of Chen's
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), described the call as a
sign of goodwill between the KMT and DPP that bodes well for future
reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Citing press releases issued separately by the offices of Chen
and Lien about their talk on the phone, Lai said the call was more an
exchange of views between the president and an opposition leader than
an appeal made by a subordinate to his superior for permission or
authorization for a trip.</P>
      <P>Lai said the president, who initially insisted that Lien should
visit him in person but later settled for a phone call, simply
prodded Lien to keep the interest of the 23 million Taiwan people in
mind during his dealings with his Chinese hosts.</P>
      <P>The 11-minute phone call has, more than anything else, laid the
groundwork for the two parties to have friendly engagements with each
other, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Lawmaker Tseng Yung-chuan, the director of the KMT's
Policy Coordination Commission, said Lien's call proves that the KMT
chief's itinerary and the party's stance toward China are transparent
and consistent.</P>
      <P>He quoted Lien as promising in his call to Chen that he will
visit China as a private citizen and will not usurp the government's
power in his dealings with the Beijing authorities.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the KMT has never wavered in its China policy, which
he claimed has long open to the public and has been "proved" to serve
the best interests of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) described the call as
"better than nothing."</P>
      <P>PFP lawmaker Chen Chih-ping said the call signifies a good start
for Lien's trip.</P>
      <P>The TSU was the only party to see the call in a bad light. Its
party convener at the Legislative Yuan, Lo Chih-ming, said the
president made a mistake in giving his blessing to Lien's trip,
because Lien believes there was an understanding reached in 1992
between Taiwan and China on "one China, " an understanding that the
president denies exists.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. State Department on Monday
declined to provide details of a recent meeting between opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and American Institute in Taiwan
(AIT) Taipei Director Douglas Paal, saying only that the AIT chief
frequently meets with Taiwan leaders.</P>
      <P>"American Institute in Taiwan Taipei Director Paal meets
frequently with leaders and senior representatives from Taiwan,
including a number of recent meetings, to discuss a broad range of
issues and current developments. We are not in a position to provide
details, " the State Deparment said in a written answer.</P>
      <P>The answer came after questions raised at a routine press

any role in Lien's upcoming visit to China and what did Lien and Paal
discuss.</P>
      <P>During the briefing, State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli
said that he is not aware of the Lien-Paal meeting, promising that he
would see if he could get any information on the meeting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A prominent mainland Chinese dissident said
Monday in Paris that "now is not a good time" for opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan's visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wei Jinsheng, who is currently visiting Europe to lobby member
states of the European Union not to lift their ban on arms sales to
China, made the comments in an interview with the Central News
Agency.</P>
      <P>Lien is scheduled to depart Tuesday for mainland China for an
eight-day visit which he has billed as a "journey of peace."</P>
      <P>Wei, who now lives in the United States, said the timing of
Lien's China visit is very bad as it is taking place only weeks after
Beijing's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan. Wei
said the visit might demonstrate that divisions exist among the
Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Lien will have the chance to push for cross-strait
dialogue during the visit, Wei said that this depends on the will of
both sides of the Taiwan Strait, adding, however, that "it is no use
since China has no intention to treat Taiwan well."</P>
      <P>Claiming that Chinese President Hu Jintao does not have a firm
grip on power, the dissident said that Hu will try to consolidate his
power by means of waging war.</P>
      <P>"People should not think that war in the Taiwan Strait ahead of
the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games is impossible," Wei warned.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People First Party (PFP) Chairman James
Soong will hold talks with Communist Party of China (CPC) officials
based on the principle of recognizing and respecting the status quo
across the Taiwan Strait, PFP Legislator Lee Yong-ping said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee, one of the members of a PFP delegation that headed to
mainland China Sunday to arrange a visit for Soong in early May, made
the remarks at the Legislative Yuan after returning to Taiwan late
Monday.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, the Chinese side has made it clear that talks
between Soong and CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao will be held based
on that principle.</P>
      <P>Noting that recognizing and respecting the existing situation
between the two sides of the strait echoes the strong desire of the
majority of the Taiwan people to maintain the status quo in terms of
Taiwan-China ties, Lee said that the respective visits by Soong and
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan will help China better understand
public opinion in Taiwan and that everyone should wish them a good
trip.</P>
      <P>A wide range of topics will be touched on during the Soong-Hu
meeting, including the disputed "1992 consensus" and the 10-point
agreement signed by Soong and President Chen Shui-bian following
their Feb. 24 meeting, she said, adding that the results of the
Soong-Hu meeting will be documented in written form but that the two
will not ink any accord.</P>
      <P>Soong is slated to depart for China May 5.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien left for China Tuesday morning for a visit
through May 3. He will make stops in Nanjing, Beijing, Xian and
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Lien's meeting with Hu set for April 29 in Beijing will mark the

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan departed for China Tuesday for what he has billed as a "journey
of peace" aimed at creating a "win-win situation" for both sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In a pre-departure speech delivered at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS)
International Airport, Lien said he looks forward to getting a better
understanding of China's latest developments and exchanging views
with Chinese leaders on a range of issues of mutual concern,
including cross-strait peace, trade and cultural exchanges, during
his China visit.</P>
      <P>The trip marks the first time a KMT leader will set foot on the
mainland since the party, which once ruled all of China, lost a
bloody civil war to the Chinese Communists and fled to Taiwan in
1949.</P>
      <P>For himself, Lien said, this is the first time in 59 years that
he will visit the mainland.</P>
      <P>"I left the mainland 59 years ago. It's a long period of time.
This was not the result of distance, but rather of our country's
'very heart-rending history,'" Lien said.</P>
      <P>"We hope our friends on both sides can grasp this opportunity to
move forward for our mutual benefit, peaceful coexistence and
prosperity," Lien said before stepping on the plane.</P>
      <P>Lien further said his aim is to help Taiwan avoid a disastrous
war with communist China, located just 160 kilometers to the west.
Beijing has repeatedly threatened to invade Taiwan if it refuses to
unify and seeks a permanent split.</P>
      <P>The eight-day journey will take Lien to four mainland cities --
Nanjing, Xian, Beijing and Shanghai. While in Beijing, Lien will
deliver a speech at Beijing University and meet with Chinese
President Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Lien is being accompanied by his wife and four children as well
as a delegation of KMT officials on the historic China trip.</P>
      <P>Many KMT politicians, including the party's five vice chairmen --
P. K. Chiang, Wang Jin-pyng, Ma Ying-jeou, Wu Po-hsiung and Lin
Cheng-chih -- saw Lien and his entourage off. Also among the
well-wishers was opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong.</P>
      <P>Lien's visit also marks one of the biggest political ironies in
the past decade of dizzying change in Taiwan -- one of Asia's most
dynamic democracies.</P>
      <P>Pro-independence activists, angry over the opposition's
engagement with Beijing, held up placards saying "Lien Chan is
selling out Taiwan" and "Lien Chan get out". They also hurled insults
at the KMT leader and pelted the airport building with eggs. About
1,000 police with batons and shields helped protect Lien as he
boarded a jet for his eight-day journey.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former ROC premier and vice president, lost both of his
presidential bids, in 2000 and 2004. He has been unwilling to address
Chen as president since losing the 2004 presidential election by a
slim margin. He filed two lawsuits to challenge Chen's re-election
victory, both of which have been rejected by the Taiwan High Court.
However, he gave a rare phone call to President Chen Monday afternoon
to brief Chen on his China trip.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINESE DISSIDENT LOBBYING AGAINST LIFTING OF E.U. ARMS SALES BAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  April 25 (CNA)
(By Y.S. Lo and P/C/Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A renowned mainland Chinese dissident now
living in the United States said Monday that he is actively lobbying
German politicians to change their stances in support of a lifting of
the European Union's arms sales ban on China.</P>
      <P>Wei Jinsheng, who is currently in Paris on his way back to the
United States after his visit to Germany, where he had met with
members of various political parties to explain the dangers of
lifting the ban, also said that in order to prevent a lifting of the
ban, the larger E.U. member states must voice their opposition,
adding that the smaller members will then follow suit.</P>
      <P>The dissident, who made the remarks in an interview with the
Central News Agency, said that his current strategy is to do his
utmost to try to influence German politicians, with the goal of
having German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder withdraw his support for a
lifting of the ban.</P>
      <P>Saying that he thinks a lifting of the ban has been postponed by
the E.U. until next year, Wei noted that the work of persuading the
E.U. not to lift the ban should continue.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Schroeder and French President Jacques
Chirac are keen on supporting a lifting of the E.U. arms sales ban,
the dissident, however, said that many people in Europe are opposed
to a lifting the ban.</P>
      <P>"If the opinions of those who do not agree with a lifting of the
ban cannot be voiced at a time when they should be expressed, such
opinions could be useless," Wei added.</P>
      <P>Claiming that the E.U.'s intention of helping China rebuild its
position in the world and normalizing its relations with China by
lifting the ban is not logical, Wei said that lifting the ban would
cause a division between the United States and Europe.</P>
      <P>"China might use this division to stir up trouble in the region
as both the United States and the E.U. would be unable to immediately
react," he added.</P>
      <P>Wei was a leader of Beijing's "Democracy Wall Movement" in the
late 1970s. He was imprisoned for more than 14 years for speaking out
against China's lack of democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER HSIEH HAS NO PLANS TO VISIT CHINA NOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Tuesday that he
neither has plans to nor wants to visit mainland China for the time
being as there are a variety of domestic affairs important to the
people's livelihood that need to be handled.</P>
      <P>Hsieh made the remarks while answering questions from lawmakers
during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan regarding
the violent scuffles between "pan blue" and "pan green" supporters at
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport earlier in the day as
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan departed on his China trip.</P>
      <P>Ruling out the possibility of a visit to China for the time
being, Hsieh said he feels that it is more important to focus on
issues of major concern and interest to the people, such as public
order and government budgets.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the government will deal with those who caused
the violent scuffles at the airport according to the law, Hsieh
asserted, adding that Lien's China visit is not in violation of the
law and that Lien is entitled to go there under legal protection.</P>
      <P>In a pluralistic society like Taiwan, the rule of law is a
principle that everyone must follow, he said, adding that society
would break down if people with different opinions handled their
differences in an irrational way. </P>
      <P>Lien's trip to China will run through May 3, during which he will
make stops in Nanjing, Beijing, Xian and Shanghai. The high-profile
but controversial visit has been praised by "pan blue" supporters but
has backfired among "pan green" backers who accuse Lien of selling
Taiwan out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CONDEMNS AIRPORT VIOLENCE AS LIEN BEGINS CHINA TRIP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh on Tuesday condemned
the sporadic violence at CKS International Airport that broke out as
ruling and opposition parties scuffled while waiting for opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's departure for China.</P>
      <P>Lien left for Nanjing via Hong Kong in the morning. Law enforcers
made up of soldiers doing alternative military service tried in vain
to separate frequent, but brief clashes between protestors mobilized
by the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), an ally of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and supporters from the
pro-unification New Party and other opposition members at the
departure lobby.</P>
      <P>The New Party is a minnow party that forms part of the "pan-blue
alliance " that is primarily made up of supporters of the opposition
KMT and its splinter group, the People First Party.</P>
      <P>During the fracas, DPP Legislator Wang Shih-chien jumped onto a
passenger advisory counter and shouted that Lien was "a traitor of
Taiwan" to cheering protestors, while New Party supporters lambasted
aviation police for allowing Wang to enter the off-limits area.</P>
      <P>Police were clearly overwhelmed by the number of protestor and
supports who showed up at the airport.</P>
      <P>The premier condemned the outbursts of "irrational and violent"
behavior, saying that any party, irrespective of its stance, will be
dealt with equally by the law, and democracy on the island should be
strengthened to mitigate such incidents.</P>
      <P>The premier, speaking at a general interpellation session, said
that the people who fought were part of the unfortunate few who are
unruly and that they do not represent the people in general. "These
people should be condemned for their actions and others should not be
coerced into taking part in violent activities," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming, TSU secretary-general, took the New Party to
task for deliberately creating disturbances by attacking TSU
supporters.</P>
      <P>Chen said that police failed to maintain security at the scene.
The TSU people stayed in their designated areas, but "pan-blue"
supporters had unceremoniously attacked them, Chen claimed, adding
that it was quite clear that a number of gangsters were there to
foment trouble under the banner of the "pan-blue" supporters.</P>
      <P>Chen said that several people were hurt in the melee, and that
five TSU members were injured after being sliced by people's rings as
they were assaulted.</P>
      <P>The KMT caucus in the Legislative Yuan asked the Ministry of
Justice to deal seriously with those politicians who created
disturbances at the airport.</P>
      <P>KMT whip Chen Chieh said that aviation police had not handled the
confrontation properly; the result was that DPP Legislator Wang and
TSU Legislator Lo Chih-ming were able to lead their supporters into
the airport terminal.</P>
      <P>Tseng Yung-Chuan, a legislator and executive director of the
KMT's Central Policy Committee, noted that Presidential
Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun assured KMT Secretary-General Lin
Feng-cheng the previous day that Lien would have a smooth departure
without incident.</P>
      <P>Lien did in fact skirt both demonstrators and supporters by
entering the airport via a different route. He greeted party
luminaries in a section of the terminal unavailable to the public.
Lien made a brief statement reiterating previous descriptions of his
trip and then boarded his flight.</P>
      <P>William Lai, DPP caucus whip, said that the party regretted the
clashes at the CKS Airport, but Lien should shoulder the bulk of the
responsibility.</P>
      <P>Lai said that the DPP had stressed that Lien's visit to China,
the first time for a KMT leader to visit China since the party fled
the mainland in 1949, should first get the approval of the public.
Failing that, his visit to China was bound to incite violence, he
added.</P>
      <P>On DPP legislators taking part in the protest, Lai said that the
party had told them that they must not go in the name of the party,
and that individual participants must abide by the law. The party
will try to find out if these instructions were disobeyed.</P>
      <P>New Party Chairman Yok Mu-ming condemned the violence, adding
that the TSU and the aviation police should take full responsibility.</P>
      <P>Yok said that the New Party will "from this day on declare war on
the TSU and there will be no end to the struggle."</P>
      <P>Lee Sheng-feng, New Party secretary-general, echoed Yok's words
that aviation police should take full responsibility because they
couldn't stop people from taking banners, eggs, rocks, sticks and
firecrackers into the airport, which contributed to the ensuing
violent clashes.</P>
      <P>Lee said that New Party supporters converged outside the airport
terminal, but that aviation police had allowed protestors led by DPP
and TSU political figures to enter the airport terminal.</P>
      <P>When Lien returns from his eight-day visit in China on May 3, the
New Party will again mobilize people to greet him, Lee added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense gave a
passing grade Tuesday to the fighting power of the ROC Navy's
Kidd-class destroyers after a computer simulation showed that a
single vessel stopped the assaults of an entire enemy fleet and
enabled the nation's armed forces to withstand Chinese attacks for at
least two weeks.</P>
      <P>The part of the "Hanguang No. 21" military exercise that ended on
April 22 entailed two virtual Kidd-class destroyers in the sea north
of Taiwan, the defense ministry announced Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Director Lee Hao of the Joint Operations, Training and Exercise
Center told the media that the Kidd-class destroyer successfully
engaged 40 enemy fighter planes, bringing down 16 of them and
intercepted 19 enemy missiles before being fatally hit by SU-30
warplanes.</P>
      <P>The sunken warship saved the other destroyer, achieving its
tactical goal of holding back enemy attacks and ensuring the security
of a large part of the Taiwan Strait; therefore, Lee said, "[The loss
of the destroyer] was absolutely worth it."</P>
      <P>During the initial period of conflict, he said, 40 percent of
China's amphibious forces were destroyed and its landing attempts
were thwarted.</P>
      <P>Minister of National Defense Lee Jye had previously claimed that
Taiwan's armed forces could withstand Chinese military attacks for at
least two weeks. Lee Hao said the war games showed that the People's
Liberation Army would need at least two weeks to regroup along the
Chinese coastline before launching a new round of assaults on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "Hanguang No. 21" was an improvement over its annual
counterpart last year, which was criticized for lacking in command
performance and poor decision-making. The purpose of the latest war
simulation was to enhance the joint combat capabilities of the armed
forces, according to Lieut. Gen. Wu Sz-huai, deputy chief of he
general staff for operations and planning.</P>
      <P>The "Hanguang No. 21" will continue with live fire exercises from
June to August that are are aimed at countering China's "unlimited or
asymmetric warfare," Wu said.</P>

      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and

Republic of China, to a warm welcome by Chinese officials Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lien was a little emotional when he stepped into the city, which

use his "belated" visit to pursue a mutually beneficial, win-win
situation for both sides of the Taiwan Strait. It was over 60 years

      <P>For the KMT, now an opposition party in Taiwan, Lien said
Nanjing is the location of the Nationalist (KMT) government as well

      <P>On Wednesday, he will lead the KMT delegation to pay respects to
the memory of Dr. Sun at his mausoleum, an act that he said has "long

precious chance to be able to make the visit.</P>
      <P>Lien, who departed Taipei in the morning on what he calls "a

    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Police Administration (NPA)
said Tuesday that it is investigating if aviation police properly
handled the sometimes violent clashes between supporters of the
ruling and opposition parties at the CKS International Airport over
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's visit to China.</P>
      <P>An NPA spokesman said that NPA Director-General Hsieh Ing-dan was
miffed with the way that aviation police handled the scuffles that
erupted between the two camps.</P>
      <P>Hsieh wants to know as soon as possible if any of the aviation
police were negligent, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Several legislators have expressed their discontent over the way
aviation police handled the scuffles between the rivaling supporters,
noting that some people carried banners, sticks and firecrackers into
the airport terminal, a violation of the law and a smirch on the
image of the nation.</P>
      <P>The medical aid station of the airport estimated that 15 people
were injured during the melee, mostly head injuries, while two more
seriously injured persons were taken to a hospital for observation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Aviation Police Office expressed its sorrow to
people who were injured in the incident, adding that it would track
down those who triggered the disturbances by reviewing video tapes
and photos taken during the fracas.</P>
      <P>Chen Juei-tien, head of the Aviation Police Office, said that as
the airport is an open space, it was not cordoned-off in
consideration of the rights of passengers.</P>
      <P>This was why some carried hazardous items, such as eggs, sticks
and even a long-handled ceremonial knife, into the departure lobby,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>He admitted that there might have been negligence and lapses in
the management of the situation.</P>
      <P>Stressing that they had prior communication with all civic groups
and had hoped that they would exercise self-restraint and that their
supporters would be rational, he said that because of the lapses in

into the airport terminal.</P>
      <P>Supporters mobilized by the pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) , an ally of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), and the pro-unification New Party and other opposition members
converged at the airport well ahead of Lien's departure at 10:55 a.m.</P>
      <P>Police deployed a large contingent of officers on peripheral
traffic control, but because of the numerous hallways and corridors
in the airport, they couldn't effectively enforce the law by
separating the two rival camps.</P>
      <P>Aviation police had originally hoped to have the "pan-blue
alliance" stay outside of the departure lobby, while the "pan-green
camp" was to stay in a parking lot in the west wing, but Legislator
Wang Shih-chien of the DPP and his supporters were able to break
through the police line and enter the departure lobby from the
basement at the airport.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Ho Mei-yueh
said Tuesday that economic cooperation between Taiwan and Germany is
mutually beneficial and it will open avenues into the global market.</P>
      <P>Ho made the remarks at a seminar hosted by the German Trade
Office in Taipei to tout Taiwan investments in Germany, the largest
single market in the European Union.</P>
      <P>German Federal Vice Minister of Transport, Building and Housing
Iris Gleicke and Taiwan Committee of German Economy President Michael
Fuchs also took part in the seminar, which focused on introducing the
investment climate in Germany and the legal process and tax
system.</P>
      <P>Praising Germany as a superpower in both high technologies as
well as traditional sectors including automobiles, medicines,
chemistry and basic metal industries and green businesses, Ho said
that two-way cooperative ventures between Taiwan and German
industries will create a win-win situation for the two sides, as the
Taiwan and German economies are complementary in many fields.</P>
      <P>She pointed to a company jointly set up by the Taiwan-based Nan
Ya Technology and the German-based Infinion Technologies as an
example and called the company the best example in the IC industries
of the two countries.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade totaled US$10.3 billion last year, with US$5.8
billion in inbound shipments from Germany and US$4.5 billion in
outbound shipments to that European country, Ho said. Germany is
Taiwan's largest trading partner in Europe, while Taiwan is Germany's
fourth-largest trading partner in Asia.</P>
      <P>Since March 1952, German investments in Taiwan have to date
amounted to US$1.22 billion, the third-largest investor from Europe
in Taiwan. At the same time, Taiwan investments in Germany totaled
US$120 million from some 230 companies.</P>
      <P>On the same occasion, Ho also conferred a medal on Hans-Jurgen
Muller, managing director of the Taiwan Committee of German Economy,
in recognition of his great contributions to economic exchanges and
investment cooperation between the two countries.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
expressed regret Tuesday over the Hong Kong government's prohibiting
Taiwan's envoy from greeting opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Lien Chan at Hong Kong International Airport earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>According to MAC Vice Chairman You Ying-lung, Pao Cheng-kang,
Taiwan's representative in Hong Kong, was barred from entering a VIP
room to greet Lien when Lien arrived in Hong Kong for a transit stop
en route to China for his self-styled "journey of peace."</P>
      <P>Lien, heading a large KMT delegation, arrived in Hong Kong at
12: 30 p.m. He was greeted by Xing Kueishan, director of the Taiwan
Affairs Department under China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong, and
Stephen Lam, director of Hong Kong's constitutional Affairs Bureau.</P>
      <P>Pao, who is known as managing director of Chung Hwa Travel
Service in Hong Kong, also went to the airport to welcome and offer
assistance to Lien and his entourage. However, You said, Pao was
barred by Hong Kong government staff from meeting Lien.</P>
      <P>"We are baffled and regretful at Hong Kong authorities' handling
of the matter, " You said, adding that the MAC, which deals with
affairs related to China, Hong Kong and Macau, will seek an
explanation from the Hong Kong government over the incident.</P>
      <P>Lien departed Taipei at 11: 06 a.m. for an eight-day China visit
via Hong Kong. The journey will take him to four mainland cities --
Nanjing, Beijing, Xian and Shanghai. He will deliver a speech at
Peking University and meet with Chinese President Hu Jintao during
his stay in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lien is the first leader from the once staunchly anti-Communist
party to set foot in China since the KMT retreated to Taiwan 56 years
ago after losing a bloody civil war to the Chinese Communists on the
mainland.</P>
      <P>His visit also marks one of the biggest political ironies in the
past decade of dizzying change in Taiwan -- one of Asia's most
dynamic democracies.</P>
      <P>Violent clashes erupted between supporters and opponents of
Lien's China trip at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Tuesday
extended his gratitude to the World Medical Association (WMA) for its
support for the name change of Taiwan's membership in the
international organization.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remark while meeting with visiting chairperson of
the WMA Council Yoram Blachar at the Presidential Office. He also
said that he hopes the WMA will continue to support Taiwan in its bid
to take part in the World Health Assembly (WHA), which is the highest
governing body of the World Health Organization (WHO) . The WHO will
meet in Geneva May 16-25.</P>
      <P>The WMA approved of changing the name of its Taiwan branch from
the Chinese Medical Association Taipei to the Taiwan Medical
Association during its general assembly in Tokyo Oct. 5-9 last year.</P>
      <P>Every year the WMA has passed a proposal to support Taiwan in its
bid for WHA entry as an observer, Chen said, adding that he believes
the global representative body for physicians will submit a similar
proposal to the WHA this year based on the idea that medical
treatment knows no boundaries.</P>
      <P>The president indicated that many countries in the international
community have noticed the fact that no political issues can erase
the importance of "global medical treatment, " noting that many
countries, including the United States and Japan, voted for Taiwan's
bid for WHA observership last year.</P>
      <P>The U.S., Japan and 23 of Taiwan's official allies voted for the
"Taiwan issue" to be on the WHA agenda last year, but was met with
harsh resistance from China. It marked Taiwan's eighth setback in a
row.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will relaunch its observership bid during the upcoming WHA
meeting in May, Chen said.</P>

      <P>Vice President Annette Lu said Tuesday
that human rights should be on the minds of everyone in Taiwan and
that the true history of how the Kuomintang (KMT) trampled human
rights when it ruled Taiwan with an iron fist must be made clear.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference called by the Council for Cultural
Affairs to mark the 50th anniversary of the first batch of political
prisoners being send by the KMT government to the notorious jail on
Green Island off the coast of eastern Taiwan, Lu urged the country to
come to terms with the country's past poor human rights record.</P>
      <P>Lu, who spend several years behind bars as a political prisoner
during the KMT's rule, said the news conference is all the more
significant because it coincides with KMT Chairman Lien Chan's
departure for China.</P>
      <P>Lu said it is ridiculous that Lien, whose party has claimed to be
a firm defender of the Republic of China (ROC) , dared not carry ROC
flags with him on his trip to China, while protesters at the airport
where Lien departed Taiwan, who are mainly followers of the
pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity Union, waved ROC flags.</P>
      <P>She said the KMT, which fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war
to the Communist Party of China (CPC) , has turned around its
political stance to befriend the CPC after losing power in Taiwan in
a desperate attempt to save its political life.</P>
      <P>Without naming anyone, Lu said some people are good at
undermining democracy under the cover of democracy, and therefore are
posing a serious challenge to the country, which might not prompt
disaster, but will develop into a big problem.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HAS SPENT US$87.8 MILLION ON POST-TSUNAMI RELIEF AID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has spent US$87.8 million
on relief aid for countries affected by the tsunami disaster of last
December, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokesman Michel Lu said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The government announced Jan. 2 that it would offer US$50 million
in humanitarian aid to South and Southeast Asian countries devastated
by a magnitude-9.0 earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra
and subsequent tsunami Dec. 26, 2004, including Indonesia, Sri Lanka
and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Lu said the government has so far spent or committed to spend a
total of US$87.8 million on various post-tsunami relief projects that
can be grouped into three categories -- food aid, medical assistance
and community reconstruction.</P>
      <P>With the extent of the devastation in various countries becoming
ever clearer, Lu said, the affected countries have adjusted their
post-disaster rehabilitation projects accordingly and donor countries
have also adjusted their aid projects in line with the recipient
countries' needs.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, all short-term aid projects, such as dispatching
of medical service missions and disinfection missions, as well as
cooperation with private groups in delivering relief goods, have been
completed.</P>
      <P>For mid- and long-term aid projects, Lu said, the Department of
Health will be responsible for assisting recipient countries in
setting up community medical service centers, while the Public
Construction Commission will help with community reconstruction
projects.</P>
      <P>Lu said the government will evaluate recipient countries'
reconstruction plans before deciding the order of donations in order
to make best use of the limited relief resources from the national
coffers and private donors.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, the government has received US$24.21 million in
cash for the post-tsunami relief projects, with US$1 million from the
MOFA's annual budget, US$10 million from the Cabinet's reserve funds,
US$9.83 million in private donations and the remaining funds coming
from various public agencies.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Council of Agriculture provided US$20
million-worth of food aid.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Lu said the Government Information Office launched a
project to sponsor 10,000 orphaned children in disaster zones over
three years. The program was not included in the original US$50
million aid project, Lu went on, adding that the MOFA will earmark
NT$50 million annually from a special bank account opened last year
to receive private donations for tsunami victims.</P>
      <P>Lu said joining the global post-tsunami relief projects is
conducive to the promotion of bilateral relations with recipient
countries, participation in multilateral cooperative mechanisms and
expression of humanitarian concern for the tsunami victims. He added
that the MOFA will continue to closely monitor the implementation of
the various aid projects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CALLS FOR 3-PARTY TALKS TO BUILD NATIONAL CONSENSUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  26  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian proposed
three-party talks Tuesday between himself and the leaders of Taiwan's
two major opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT) and the People
First Party (PFP), in order to build a national consensus on China.</P>
      <P>He made the suggestion during a meeting at the Presidential
Office with officials of the World Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce, on
the same day KMT Chairman Lien Chan led a large opposition delegation
on a visit to China.</P>
      <P>Soon after Lien completes his China tour May 3, PFP Chairman
James Soong will also embark on a trip to China, supposedly also to
seek peace for Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Chen wished both Lien and Soong well in their historic visits and
suggested that all three of them sit down as soon as possible for
candid discussions about building a consensus on the country's
cross-Taiwan Strait policy.</P>
      <P>There can be only one voice from Taiwan when dealing with China,
Chen said. Only when the ruling and opposition camps reach a
consensus can the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reach a consensus,
he claimed.</P>
      <P>He said it will not be possible for Taiwan's political parties to
bridge their differences in a short time, given the fact that they
have been fighting each other over the past two decades.</P>
      <P>Only through constant communication and negotiation can they
begin to have faith in each other, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen reiterated his "absolute sincerity" in seeking rapprochement
and cooperation with all opposition parties. His 10-point consensus
with Soong Feb. 24 is an initial result of the joint efforts of all
parties concerned, and his telephone conversation with Lien a day
earlier marked a new beginning, he said.</P>
      <P>He admitted that "many people" have told him they are "extremely
anxious" about the recent internal and external pressures on the
government, particularly the possibility that Taiwan's opposition
parties are using cross-strait relations as political tools to deal a
blow to the government, giving Beijing even more advantages to
"divide and conquer" Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I fully understand such worries and anxieties, " said Chen, who
stressed that Taiwan must unite in the face of the ever-increasing
threats and challenges from across the strait, and "this must be the
common knowledge of all 23 million people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He said democracy and peace must be the guiding principles of the
government's cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>"The two principles not only serve the maximum interest of the
people of Taiwan but also agree with the expectations of the
international community," he said.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the president said, he welcomes any effort that will
help normalize relations and reduce tension across the strait.</P>
      <P>He also repeated no political party or individual can sign a
binding deal with China without prior authorization from the
government.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The municipal governments of Taiwan's two
largest cities -- Taipei and Kaohsiung -- joined with a private
intellectual property rights association in sponsoring a seminar
Tuesday to mark the April 26 World Intellectual Property (IP) Day.</P>
      <P>Addressing the seminar, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said big cities
are hotbeds for the circulation of counterfeit goods. If the Taipei
and Kaohsiung city governments can cooperate in crackdown on
commercial piracy, Ma said, intellectual property rights issues in
Taiwan could be largely resolved.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the United States' reluctance to sign a free
trade agreement with Taiwan lies in its perception that Taiwan has
not yet made sufficient efforts to eradicate commercial piracy and
protect intellectual property rights (IPR).</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, he said, the public and private sectors
should step up concerted efforts to eliminate counterfeiting to
facilitate trade and economic cooperation with other countries.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, John Eastwood, IPR section chief
with the European Chamber of Commerce in Taipei, said Taiwan has made
significant progress in IPR protection since its admission to the
World Trade Organization. Taiwan has ranked fourth in terms of the
number of patent applications approved by the U.S. government in
recent years, he said, adding that the government has also revised
copyright, patent and trademark laws to tighten IPR protection.</P>
      <P>Eastwood said he hopes the government and people can work even
harder to further improve IPR protection and clear Taiwan's name as
one of the world's major piracy havens.</P>

which have been kept, while he is still working on the other 58.
"Even easy ones will take time to complete," he said.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he has heard comments that his efforts in seeking
"rapprochement and symbiosis" with the opposition parties have gone
nowhere, as the ruling and opposition camps remain divided on almost
all issues, as seen from the legislative floor.</P>
      <P>Now that the interpellation session has come to an end, Hsieh
said, legislators should spend more time screening government bills
and passing more non-political laws that affect people's daily lives.</P>
      <P>He said he has seen many lawmakers putting forward "very
progressive ideas" while others have shown their concern for the less
privileged in society.</P>
      <P>These lawmakers give him reason to feel happy about Taiwan, he
said, saluting especially those "who have done their jobs well out of

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT SHOULD WAIT BEFORE TALKING WITH KMT, PFP HEADS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An opposition People First Party (PFP)
legislator said Tuesday that President Chen Shui-bian should wait
until opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan and PFP Chairman James
Soong have returned from China before discussing cross-Taiwan Strait
issues with them.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-ping, PFP caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, made the
remarks after the president expressed the hope of discussing with
Lien and Soong the establishment of a peaceful and stable
cross-strait interchange framework and to formulate a consensus
between the ruling and opposition on cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>"It maybe a bit too late" for the three-party talks, Chen said,
adding that it would be better to wait for their return from China
and that former President Lee Teng-hui should also join such talks.</P>
      <P>Lien left for China earlier in the day for an eight-day visit.
He will meet with Chinese President and Communist Party of China
(CPC) General Secretary Hu Jintao Friday, marking the first meeting
of KMT-CPC leaders since the KMT fled China in 1949.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the president should have invited opposition
leaders for talks before China's March 14 enactment of the
Anti-Secession Law targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he claimed, the important thing in the cross-strait
issue is not whether to talk with opposition leaders, but whether the
government wants reconciliation or confrontation with the other
side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, PFP Secretary-General Chin Chin-sheng returned to
Taipei that day after marathon consultations with Chen Yunlin, head
of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, to arrange for Soong's itinerary in
China.</P>
      <P>Soong will depart for Xian May 5, and then visit Changsha,
Xiangtan, Nanjing, Shanghai and Beijing before returning April 12.</P>
      <P>Chin said that Soong met with President Chen Feb. 24, during
which they reached a 10-point conclusion including no declaration of
independence, no change of the nation's official name and no change
of the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, which he said entails
government policy.</P>
      <P>Chin expressed the hope that China will understand Taiwan's
mainstream views through a meeting between Soong and the Beijing
leadership.</P>
      <P>The main issue for Taiwan is cross-strait relations, Chin said,
and Soong's visit to China aims to bring new hope for the wellbeing
of the people, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AVIATION POLICE OFFICE CHIEF APOLOGIZES OVER AIRPORT CLASHES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chief of the Aviation Police Office
apologized to the public Tuesday in the wake of the violent clashes
at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, Taiwan's main gateway
to the world.</P>
      <P>Chen Juei-tien's apology came after supporters of the
pro-independence opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union and
pro-unification New Party rioted while waiting for opposition
Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan's departure for an eight-day visit to
China.</P>
      <P>Legislators questioned whether there was negligence on the part
of aviation police in maintaining order and security at the airport
and Premier Frank Hsieh has instructed the Ministry of the Interior
to file a report on the clashes in the shortest possible time.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the departure lobby was in good order before 8
a.m. until a group of people rammed through the east gate into the
airport terminal, carrying with them weapons and firecrackers and
triggering five or six rounds of clashes between rival supporters
that left 15 people injured.</P>
      <P>He reaffirmed that he had prior communications with the
representatives of civic groups planning to go to the airport for
Lien's departure and was given promises that they would "exercise
self-restraint." He expressed regret that police failed to stop the
clashes and asked for discipline for himself to his superior,
National Police Administration Director-General Hsieh Ing-dan.</P>
      <P>Chen also said his office is tracking down the people who
triggered the disturbances by reviewing video tapes and photos taken
at the scene.</P>
      <P>On questions whether public officials -- councilors or
legislators -- violated the law by leading their supporters into the
departure lobby, Chen said only that the office is checking related
information and will deal with the issue according to the law.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD'S CHINA TRIP MARKS SERIOUS BLOW FOR ROC DIPLOMACY: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan's
visit to China has dealt a serious blow to the Republic of China's
diplomacy, Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan Sun Chen claimed Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks after Lien, a former ROC premier and vice
president, departed for China earlier in the day on a self-styled
"journey of peace."</P>
      <P>Although President Chen Shui-bian has thrown his support behind
Lien's China trip, the foreign minister said he personally opposes
Lien's visit at this critical moment.</P>
      <P>The trip comes shortly after Beijing's enactment of its so-called
anti-secession law that codifies the use of non-peaceful means
against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"While our diplomatic staff are busy explaining our stance on
that ill-intentioned legislation to their host countries to win their
support for our national cause, Lien's China visit has baffled those
same countries, " he said, adding he is afraid that Lien's pandering
to Beijing will make foreign officials wonder what exactly is
Taiwan's stance toward the law.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lien once served as minister of foreign affairs,
premier and vice president, Tan Sun Chen said he simply cannot
believe that Lien is unaware of how grave an impact his China visit
could have on the nation's diplomatic work.</P>
      <P>As an opposition leader, he went on, Lien is free to visit China.
"But he should have considered the timing of his visit, " the
minister said, adding that Lien's China visit at this moment has hurt
Taiwan's national interests and international image.</P>
      <P>He also said that American officials are divided over Lien's
visit.</P>
      <P>While some U.S. officials have made positive comments, Tan Sun
Chen said some others have voiced negative opinions.</P>
      <P>During the Vietnam War, he continued, some U.S. congressional
members also traveled to then-North Vietnam in their private
capacities. At that time, the American government criticized their
acts as "a piece of showmanship" for personal limelight.</P>
      <P>While the United States hopes to see direct dialogue across the
Taiwan Strait, he said, it would be meaningful only if Lien were
representing the government in his talks with the Chinese
authorities.</P>
      <P>The minister urged Lien to uphold the ROC's national dignity
during his China visit and to courageously discuss the problems of
the anti-secession law with the Chinese leadership.</P>
      <P>"Only by so doing can our foreign friends continue to voice
support for us in the international arena, " the foreign minister
said.</P>
      <P>Lien's visit also marks one of the biggest political ironies in
the past decade of dizzying change in Taiwan -- one of Asia's most
dynamic democracies. Violent clashes erupted between supporters and
opponents of Lien's China trip at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport in northern Taiwan prior to Lien's departure.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh has condemned the
violence that took place Tuesday at the Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport and vowed to bring those responsible to justice, according to
Cho Jung-tai, the spokesman for the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>Cho said the premier also ordered a review of the policing at the
airport after learning that the supporters of opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan's trip to China and demonstrators angered by his
decision to make the visit clashed in the terminal building, despite
the deployment of 3,031 policemen in addition to 640 police aides.</P>
      <P>Offenders will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law
regardless of their political position, the premier was quoted as
saying.</P>
      <P>Police officers found to have been derelict in their duties will
also be punished, the spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Saying that the airport is off limits to any public gathering,
Cho said the premier was surprised that the police failed to take
action to preempt the clashes despite learning from news reports that
Lien's supporters would appear in force to see the KMT chief off at
the airport while the protestors threatened to pack the airport to
stop him from leaving.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Cho went on, many dangerous objects such as sticks
and firecrackers, which are forbidden in the airport, were carried
into the terminal building and used as weapons.</P>
      <P>Although the security of Lien and his entourage was not
threatened, the incident caused inconvenience and panic among other
passengers and resulted in chaos that exposed the defects in the
police efforts, Cho went on.</P>
      <P>Citing a preliminary police report, the spokesman said the
policemen on the scene were put off their stroke when a large group
of people in the airport's parking lot dashed into the terminal to
take refuge from a sudden rain shower before the riots erupted.</P>
      <P>Also, Cho said, the police report pointed out that many young men
bearing resemblance to habitual troublemakers in other political
rallies were seen at the airport, which he described as more than
mere coincidence.</P>

Chairman Lien Chan, on the second day of his historic visit to China,
called for both sides of the Taiwan Strait to answer Republic of
China founding father Sun Yat-sen's will expressed 80 years ago for
"peace, striving and saving China."</P>
      <P>Lien, the first KMT chairman to visit Sun's mausoleum in Nanjing
in nearly 60 years, said Wednesday that at this crucial juncture in
history when Taiwan and mainland China remain in political deadlock,
people from across the Taiwan Strait should follow Sun's will by
"grasping the moment to create a brighter future for the Chinese
people."</P>
      <P>Addressing thousands of spectators at the Chuangshan Mausoleum,
Lien exhorted the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to follow
the ROC founding father's will by "enabling Taiwan to become a
society of equal wealth and allowing the mainland to continue to
flourish economically."</P>
      <P>Lien said that it is of special significance for him to lay a
wreath at Sun's tomb this year as it marks the 80th anniversary of
the ROC founding father's death and the 60th anniversary of the end
of Chinese fighting against the Japanese invasion.</P>
      <P>Nanjing is the first leg of Lien's historic "journey of peace" to
China, which began Tuesday. At the top of his itinerary will be a

      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) apologized to the public Wednesday
for the clashes between "pan-green" and "pan-blue" supporters a day
earlier at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport.</P>
      <P>DPP caucus whip Lai Ching-teh said the caucus apologizes for the
damage to the country's image caused by the incident. He also urged
judicial authorities to conduct an investigation and track down the
troublemakers.</P>
      <P>A demonstration at the airport organized by individual
politicians from the "pan-green camp" of the DPP and Taiwan
Solidarity Union to protest opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan's China trip turned violent as the protesters clashed with
supporters of the opposition "pan-blue alliance."</P>
      <P>Lai claimed that it is unfair for the opposition to point the
finger solely at the "pan-green camp, " especially at DPP Legislator
Wang Shih-Chien, for starting the scuffles.</P>
      <P>Lai said judicial authorities must determine the identity of a
group of people dressed in black, suspected of being gangsters, who
attacked "pan-green" protesters at the scene.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Deputy Secretary-General Yen Wan-chin said the
party strongly condemns the incident, which he said has seriously
damaged the democratic image of the country.</P>
      <P>Yen called on judicial authorities to act against any
organizations or individuals who were involved in inciting the
violence and pledged to take disciplinary action against any DPP
members or public office holders who engaged in any unlawful
activities.</P>
      <P>Yen said members of the underworld must not be allowed to take
advantage of demonstration activities to make trouble.</P>
      <P>According to Yen, the DPP had prohibited its members and public
office holders from participating in the demonstration in the name of
the party and had asked them not to resort to violence or other
unlawful means in expressing their opinions.</P>

(By Mike Chang/S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mass-circulation Japanese daily
Mainichi Shimbun urged China Wednesday not to use Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan's visit as a "political tool to divide Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Instead, Beijing should use the historic meeting between Lien and
Hu Jintao, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) ,
as a "strategic tool to enter into peaceful dialogue with Taiwan's
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , " the daily said in an
editorial.</P>
      <P>If the KMT-CPC summit can develop into cross-Taiwan Strait
dialogue -- that is, the resumption of bilateral talks that have been
suspended since the DDP came to power, then this will create a
"win-win" situation not only for both sides of the strait, but also
for the United States and Japan, the daily said.</P>
      <P>The editorial said that Taiwan by no means has the capability to
attack China and that it is China's Anti-Secession Law, which
authorizes Beijing to use non-peaceful means to settle disputes with
Taiwan, that has created tensions across the strait.</P>
      <P>It is undeniable that China's "non-peaceful law" has invited
world-wide condemnation, and so, the best way to settle cross-strait
disputes is for China to resume talks with Taiwan's ruling party, the
editorial said.</P>
      <P>Besides the KMT's Lien, who is currently on an official visit to
China, People First Party Chairman James Soong is also due to visit
China. Indeed, there is public support for the opposition parties'
China visits, but for Beijing, the most significant visit would be
one by the ruling DDP, it said.</P>
      <P>The editorial said that in order to avoid "unnecessary storms,"
China and Taiwan should shake off the "old pattern" of KMT-CPC
dialogue and adopt a "new pattern" of formal dialogue between the two
governments.</P>

      <P>The Presidential Office has "three bottom
lines" for the enactment of a proposed "cross-strait peace promotion
law, " President Chen Shui-bian's chief of staff Yu Shyi-kun said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At a party in honor of members of the media, Yu said that the
bottom lines are that there is no "92 consensus" on soverignty or
"one China" issues; that if there will be an office responsible for
the implementation of the "peace law, " it is acceptable that the
office be established under the Presidential Office; and that the
contents or stipulations of the "peace law" should not infringe on
the purview of the president and should comply with the principles of
the Republic of China Constitution.</P>
      <P>This marked the first time that the Presidential Office had made
any statement on the proposed "cross-strait peace promotion law"
initiated by the opposition People First Party and currently under

      <P>Yu, secretary-general of the Presidential Office, reiterated that
so long as the draft law complies with the three bottom lines, the

      <P>The Taipei City Zoo will be able to
complete all necessary preparations in six months if China is willing

Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to a local media report that China's President

Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan, who is on a visit to China and is set

      <P>According to Ma, workers at the zoo have had contact with Chinese
zoologists in the past and have undergone some basic training related
to the care of pandas.</P>
      <P>They will be ready to handle the job if given a further few
months of intensive training, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Ma said bamboo grown in Chutzuhu on Yangmingshan will supply food
for the pandas, although more will have to be planted to meet the
demand.</P>
      <P>However, as the panda is one of the imperiled species protected

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the
People First Party (PFP) on Wednesday requested that elected
representatives who had caused disturbances in the bloody clashes
at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport the previous day be brought
to justice quickly.</P>
      <P>The KMT and PFP legislative caucuses made the request at a
breakfast meeting with National Police Administration (NPA) Deputy
Director General Liu Shih-lin and Acting Aviation Police Office chief
Hu Ya-ping.</P>
      <P>They also requested that Interior Minister Su Jia-Chyuan and
National Police Administration Director-General Shieh Yin-tang resign
from their posts to take responsibility for the violent clashes.</P>
      <P>Violence erupted at the airport between supporters of KMT
Chairman Lien Chan, who departed for China Tuesday morning for a
historic visit, and demonstrators protesting Lien's China visit.</P>
      <P>The opposition legislators asked why the elected representatives 
involved in inciting the scuffles were not included on the first list
of troublemakers published by law enforcement authorities Tuesday
evening.</P>
      <P>They claimed that the NPA had coordinated with Legislator Wang
Shih-chien of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) before
the incident, but they wondered if the NPA was trying to "give it a
go" to the "protege of Premier Frank Hsieh" -- referring to
Legislator Wang.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-ping, PFP caucus whip in the legislature, said that the
administration is either incompetent or condoned the incident, saying
that to condone those who had caused the scuffles at Taiwan's main
gateway to the world will only keep foreign investors at bay.</P>
      <P>"Premier Hsieh should deal with the bloody clashes at the airport
resolutely," Chen urged.</P>
      <P>Acting Aviation Police Office chief Hu said that more than 1,400
police were deployed at the terminal building, and the office had
prior consultations with Legislator Wang that no one should carry
weapons into the terminal building, but unfortunately, the police
line was broken through during the demonstration.</P>
      <P>Hu and Liu said that they are reviewing the surveillance camera
videotapes as well as photos taken during the melee, and that they
will interview the second list of troublemakers, which they said
should have included Legislator Wang.</P>
      <P>However, the Aviation Police Office said that those who broke
through the police line to enter the terminal building via the
basement, which foiled the police's original plan to keep the rival
"pan-green" and "pan-blue" supporters separated, were not "recorded"
by the surveillance cameras.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the NPA's decision to transfer Aviation Police
Office chief Chen Juei-tien to another post is to show responsibility
for the airport violence.</P>
      <P>Chen Chieh, KMT caucus whip in the legislature, then read a joint
statement by the KMT and the PFP, in which they requested that DPP
Legislators Wang and Hsu Kuo-yung as well as lawmakers Lin Kuo-ching
and Lo Chih-ming of the Taiwan Solidarity Union, an ally of the DPP,
be brought to justice and that the government promise that a similar
incident will not occur when Lien returns from his China trip May 3
or when PFP Chairman James Soong departs for his China visit May 5.</P>

      <P>The pro-independence Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) apologized Wednesday over the bloody clashes that erupted
between supporters of the "pan-green camp" and the opposition
"pan-blue alliance" a day earlier at the Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport as opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
left for a visit to China.</P>
      <P>A massive police presence deployed at the airport utterly failed
to separate demonstrators protesting against Lien's visit and those
who supported his historic trip, resulting in several waves of
clashes that left 15 people injured.</P>
      <P>Several TSU legislators called a press conference to condemn the
violence. National Police Administration (NPA) Deputy Director
General Liu Shih-lin and Acting Aviation Police Office chief Hu
Ya-ping also attended.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Liao Pen-yen pointed out that the bloody clashes
at the airport have damaged the nation's image and he also urged the
NPA to handle the aftermath properly and visit those who were
injured, claiming that they were the victims of "gangsters."</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Huang Tsung-yuan claimed that the fights were
caused by "gangsters" collaborating with the "pan-blue alliance," and
he slammed the police incompetence, pointing out that the aviation
police office had been warned in advance about possible disturbances,
but failed to keep any form of control whatsoever.</P>
      <P>Liu said that this was a painful incident for the police and he
admitted that the police made a gross mistake by allowing the
demonstrators to converge at off-limits areas in the airport.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC OUTLINES CONDITIONS FOR REOPENING DOOR TO CHINESE MEDIA OUTLETS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan would be willing to reopen its
doors to two Chinese media outlets so long as Beijing lifts its
blackout against the online versions of two Taipei-based newspapers
and refrains from blocking its local press groups from posting
reporters in Taiwan, a senior official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>David Wei-feng Huang, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), made the remarks while delivering a report on
the current state of journalistic exchanges across the Taiwan Strait
at a Legislative Yuan Education Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>The MAC suspended April 10 permits allowing China's
state-controlled Xinhua news agency and People's Daily newspaper to
post correspondents in Taiwan on the grounds that the two media
outlets had repeatedly abused their privileges by turning out
misleading reports about Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Huang said the bans are temporary in nature and that the MAC will
decide whether to lift the bans in terms of China's response to
Taiwan's call for constructive cross-strait journalistic exchanges.</P>
      <P>If China removes its blockade against the online editions of the
Taipei-based China Times and United Daily News and refrains from
obstructing its local newspapers from sending correspondents to
Taiwan, Huang said, the MAC would be willing to consider resuming its
permits for the two Chinese media outlets.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Pasuya Yao, head of the Government
Information Office (GIO) , said the Chinese authorities still regard
their media outlets as party organs or propaganda machines dedicated
to publicizing their policies and promoting their "united front"
tactics.</P>
      <P>As China has deliberately blocked Taiwan media outlets' Internet
Web sites, Yao said, people there have had limited access to
Taiwan-related information.</P>
      <P>In the future, he went on, the GIO will continue to promote
cross-strait journalistic exchanges in terms of the government's
fundamental cross-strait policy of "active opening and effective
management."</P>
      <P>Taiwan first allowed Chinese media to post reporters in Taiwan in
late 2000. Besides Xinhua and People's Daily, three other Chinese
media outlets -- China Central Television, China News Agency and
China National Radio -- have also posted journalists in Taiwan.
Each of them is allowed to send two reporters to Taiwan, rotating
them out each month.</P>

      <P>The name of Taiwan's major cigarette brand
will not be called "Longlife" any more once a much-tougher amendment
to the Tobacco Hazards Act is passed and implemented, government
sources said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The amendment -- passed by the Executive Yuan Wednesday and to be
soon submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval -- stipulates
that all words and phrases hinting that cigarettes are "mild, " "low
tar, " or "may lead people to mistakenly believe that smoking does
not impair health" will be banned from packs or containers of
cigarettes.</P>
      <P>Smokers and dealers' days in the future are seen to be more
difficult, as the amendment to the Tobacco Hazards Act carrying much
tougher articles than before, including that tobacco tax, imposed to
finance the cash-strapped national health insurance program, will be
raised from NT$5 to NT$10 per pack.</P>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh has also instructed that in the future,
tobacco tax will be imposed based on the unit price of the cigarette
packs, meaning that smokers will have to pay more than NT$10
(US$0.317) for tax upon each purchase of higher-priced cigarettes.</P>
      <P>The amendment also imposes much stricter regulations on tobacco
advertising or sponsorship of events.</P>
      <P>No-smoking areas will also be increased noticeably -- extending
to college and university campuses, buses and MRT systems, taxi-cabs,
karaoke clubs, Internet parlors and other indoor public places.</P>
      <P>Violators, whether they are cigarette manufacturers or importers,
will face fines ranging from NT$500,000 (US$15,800) to NT$2.5 million
per violation. If they are advertising agents or media outlets, they
will face fines ranging from NT$200,000 to NT$1 million per
violation.</P>
      <P>Selling cigarettes in places where smoking is prohibited will
also be banned, with violators facing fines from NT$2,000 to
NT$10,000 per violation, according to the amendment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA CANNOT IGNORE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR DPP: HK DAILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Lo Kin-fai and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>By giving the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and People First Party (PFP) leaders high-profile treatment,
China is trying to marginalize Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) , but can "never ignore" the public support in Taiwan
behind the DPP, a Hong Kong newspaper said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong Economic Journal said China is using "exactly the
same" strategy for Taiwan that it did for Hong Kong under British
rule. China's present tactic toward Taiwan would be "deja vu" to Hong
Kong people, it claimed in an editorial.</P>
      <P>The journal said that while Beijing can claim Hong Kong's
legislature did not have enough representation, as it was not
popularly elected during British colonial rule, China can never
ignore the fact that Taiwan's government has been popularly elected.</P>
      <P>If China's "united front" efforts cannot boost KMT and PFP
popularity, and China's evident support cannot help the two
opposition parties win the next election, then visits to China by
their chairmen will not work wonders, it added.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan is on a high-profile visit to China, and
PFP Chairman James Soong is due to visit early next month.</P>
      <P>The Journal said that if China really wants to boost popular
support in Taiwan for the two opposition parties, China's leaders
would do best by promising Lien they will take a series of actions
that strongly demonstrate goodwill toward Taiwan, including
dismantling missiles targeting Taiwan and allowing Taiwan to
participate conditionally in international organizations.</P>
      <P>The latter could deflate DPP accusations that China is bent on
stifling Taiwan in its attempts to lead a normal international life,
according to the editorial.</P>
      <P>It further pointed out that Hong Kong's status as a major conduit
for cross-Taiwan Strait contact will diminish and become irrelevant

    <HEADLINE>NPA SEEKS REMEDIAL MEASURES AFTER BLOODY CLASHES AT AIRPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The National Police Administration (NPA)
is seeking damage control measures following bloody clashes that
erupted between supporters of the "pan-green camp" and the "pan-blue
alliance" a day earlier at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
as opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan left for a visit to
China.</P>
      <P>Faced with a barrage of criticism over the violent scuffles at
the nation's main gateway that left 15 people injured while a massive
police presence stood idly by watching, the NPA demoted Aviation
Police Office chief Chen Juei-tien, while NPA Director General Shieh
Yin-tang also asked the Ministry of the Interior for discipline to
shoulder responsibility for the chaos that made international
headlines.</P>
      <P>During an overnight meeting to review crisis management
operations, Shieh claimed that self-examination will be more
important than meting out discipline for dereliction of duty.</P>
      <P>Shieh noted that Lien will wind up his China visit May 3 and that
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong will leave for
China May 5, and said the NPA will make preparations to brace for
further protests.</P>
      <P>On May 3, Shieh said, additional riot police will be deployed at
the airport, while a police force formed by alternative military
servicemen who were criticized for lacking experience in dealing with
riots during the violent clashes the previous day, will be in the
second line.</P>
      <P>In view of a convoy of vehicles led by pro-independence activists
that carried out a dangerous stunt in an attempt to intercept Lien's
limousine on his way to the airport on the freeway, the NPA has also
planned a rigorous security operation.</P>
      <P>Shieh also gave strict orders that no more loopholes or
negligence in security checks can be permitted at the airport and
that any troublemakers must be arrested.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a police task force, after reviewing video tapes of
surveillance cameras and photos taken during the melee, said it had
identified nearly 30 gangsters from the Bamboo Union criminal gang.</P>
      <P>Task force officials said that the gangsters, most dressed in
national flags or black, seemed quite young.</P>
      <P>They carried weapons such as rocks and slingshots and broke
through the inept police into off-limits areas of the terminal
building whenever the chance arose, police said.</P>
      <P>They seemed to be quite organized, they added. Police are now
asking for arrest warrants from prosecutors to launch a series of
arrests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAICHUNG LAWYER SUES DPP LAWMAKER, NEW PARTY CHAIRMAN OVER CLASHES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawyer from central Taiwan filed a
lawsuit Wednesday against Legislator Wang Shih-chien of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party and opposition New Party Chairman Yok
Mu-ming for alleged violation of the law of assembly and
demonstration.</P>
      <P>Taichung lawyer Huang Ying-chieh said the two set the worst
possible examples during the bloody clashes a day earlier between
supporters of the "pan-green camp" and the "pan-blue alliance" at the
Chiang Kai-shek International Airport that left 15 people injured.</P>
      <P>Filing the lawsuit at the Taichung District Court, Huang claimed
Legislator Wang directed supporters to the airport terminal building
without prior legal application and did not try to restrain his
supporters from violence, which inflicted immeasurable damage to the
nation's image.</P>
      <P>Huang said that although he belongs to the same party as Wang, he
will nevertheless sue him.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Huang said, Lien communicated with President Chen
Shui-bian on the eve of his departure for China and obtained the
president's blessing for his visit, but Wang led his supporters to
protest against Lien, which he described as wrong.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, supporters led by Yok might have traded punches after
provocation, but Yok also lacked manners and spoke such mob language
as "returning blood with blood, " which Huang said was a serious
provocation to ethnic harmony. </P>
      <P>To avoid any repetition of similar violent confrontations when
Lien returns May 3 after winding up his eight-day visit to China,
Huang said that he decided to file suits against the two in the hope
that the law will forestall potential troublemakers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COA LIFTS BAN ON U.S. APPLE IMPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture (COA) lifted a
four-month ban on apple imports from the United States Wednesday,
saying that U.S. quarantine authorities have adopted measures to
minimize the risk of moth larvae infesting their fruit.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level council banned imports of U.S. apples Dec. 21,
2004 after discovering codling moth larvae in separate shipments from
the United States in September, October and December last year.
According to an agreement signed in 2003, the United States is
required to suspend apple exports to Taiwan if codling moths are
found three times in apple shipments within a year.</P>
      <P>Over the past four months, a COA official said, the U.S.
quarantine bureau has produced investigative reports and adopted
improvement measures to prevent moth larvae infestation.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ying, deputy director of the COA's Animal and Plant
Quarantine and Inspection Bureau, said that COA quarantine officials
have conducted many rounds of on-the-spot inspections in the United
States in the past few months.</P>
      <P>"The results of on-the-spot inspections show that the U.S.
revised work procedure met with our quarantine demands and
that related measures can effectively reduce the risk of
apple infestation, " Yeh said, adding that the council
has thus decided to lift the ban from April 27.</P>
      <P>"Apples cleared by U.S. quarantine officials on or after April 27
are now eligible to enter Taiwan," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>As to when U.S. apples can hit market shelves, Yeh said it will
depend on how fast U.S. suppliers handle their export procedures.</P>
      <P>The codling moth is considered a major pest affecting crops of
apples, pears, quince and walnut in Europe, Asia and North America.</P>
      <P>Taiwan consumes around 115,000 tonnes of apples annually, relying
on imports to meet more than 90 percent of demand. Until the ban, the
United States was the largest supplier. Taiwan had imported 10,800
tons of apples last year as of Dec. 20, 52 percent of which were from
the United States.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A yellow-blue light was recorded for
Taiwan's economy in March, meaning that it has gone from "stable" to
"sluggish, " the Cabinet-level Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the five-color rating system devised by the CEPD to
gauge Taiwan's economy, red means an overheated economy, yellow-red
represents a heating-up economy, green reflects stability,
yellow-blue stands for sluggishness and blue points to recession.</P>
      <P>But Hung Juei-ping, director of the CEPD's Economic Research
Department, said that export orders in March setting a new monthly
high coupled with a sliding unemployment rate should contribute to a
building up of momentum for the economy, and predicted a clear
economic rebound in the latter half of the year.</P>
      <P>CEPD officials noted that the composite index for March was cut
by 2 points from 23 to 21, making it the first time Taiwan's economy
has flashed a yellow-blue light since June 2003.</P>
      <P>The leading index in March slid to 106.3 from 106.7, down by 0.4
percent from February, marking the sixth consecutive monthly decline.</P>

to be optimistic about the economy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ALMOST 70% OF TAIWAN'S TEENAGERS UNHAPPY: SURVEY</HEADLINE>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 70 percent of Taiwan's teenagers do
not feel they are leading a happy life, and what troubles them most
is academic performance, lack of communication with parents, and the
inability to overcome depression and cope with pressures in life, a
survey released Thursday found.</P>
      <P>The Carnegie Training Center surveyed 2,167 young people aged
between 13 and 18 last year and found that the traditional value of
emphasizing academic achievement has become the top worry of Taiwan's
young people.</P>
      <P>Hei Yu-lung, an analyst with the training center, said most
parents in Taiwan are willing to spend a great deal of money to get
their kids into the best school, without realizing that it is
self-confidence, communication ability and human relationships that
affect a person's life at home, work and in society.</P>
      <P>Looking into why Taiwan's teenagers do not usually have good
communication skills, Hei found that they spend most of their time
studying, and for fun, just surf the Internet, watch TV, play
computer games or use their cell phones.</P>
      <P>"They do not have a lot of chances to practice their
communication skills, so they remain quite aloof from their peers and
parents, " he said, suggesting they not just try to be "academic
achievers" but rather be more creative in developing their potential
and enjoy life.</P>
      <P>He said if self-confidence comes only from a good academic
record, wouldn't those not attending prestigious schools or not
having good grades lose confidence?</P>
      <P>Therefore, he said, it is the duty of parents and teachers to
help their children build self-confidence in other ways, such as
finding each person's strengths and developing his or her special
talents.</P>
      <P>As to improving communication skills, he suggested "practice
more, praise more and interact more." Doing this in daily life will
help a youngster regain confidence in life and further bring
happiness and harmony to society as a whole, he said.</P>

      <P>Minister of the Interior Su Jia-chyuan
ordered stepped-up security at the Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport Wednesday to brace for the May 3 return of opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan from a trip to China.</P>
      <P>Su, who had just returned from a trip to Vatican City for the
inauguration of Pope Benedict XVI, issued the instruction after being
briefed by Vice Interior Minister Lin Yung-chien about the rioting
that took place the previous day at the airport between Lien's
supporters and demonstrators protesting against Lien's trip as he
departed.</P>
      <P>Lin quoted the minister as pointing out that the airport is
off-limits to public gatherings and said the police will implement
this rule May 3. He added that as the protesters fully expressed
their opinion in Tuesday's clashes, there is "no need" to gather at
the airport again over Lien's trip.</P>
      <P>Lin said Su asked police to take every possible step to ensure
security at the airport when Lien returns.</P>
      <P>Dozens of people were injured in Tuesday's riots that erupted
despite the deployment of more than 3,700 policemen. The police chief
in charge of security at the airport was fired Tuesday for his

who led their supporters to the airport for failing to "keep their

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MUST ACCEPT ROC AS EXISTENT POLITICAL ENTITY: PRESIDENT CHEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday
expressed the hope that Beijing will seriously address the fact that
the Republic of China (Taiwan) exists.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks when he received permanent
representatives to the United Nations from Gambia, Chad, Guatemala,
and Haiti at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>China's persistent obstruction of the people of Taiwan's desire
to join the international community will not help cross-strait
relations, President Chen said, adding that the sense understood in
the international community is that cross-strait disputes should be
solved through dialogues and peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's efforts to join the United Nations are not aimed at
challenging the People's Republic of China's seat, but at securing
the rights of the 23 million Taiwan people to take part in
international affairs, the president said.</P>
      <P>He also said that China's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law
targeting Taiwan has ignored the political fact that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait have separate rule and are independent of each
other.</P>
      <P>The Anti-Secession Law is only an attempt to make the
cross-strait issue look like an internal affair and validate the use
of force against Taiwan, the president added.</P>
      <P>The law has unilaterally changed the status quo across the Taiwan
Strait, threatened regional peace and stability in East Asia and
drawn condemnation from the United States, Japan and the European
Union, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that the "opening of a stable new
situation of dialogue and consultations" between the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait is his most sincere promise to the 23 million people on
the island and the international community.</P>
      <P>The government will continue to extend olive branches to the
other side of the Taiwan Strait, but at the same time it will
solemnly express to Beijing that over 93 percent of the Taiwan people
are oppose to the Anti-Secession Law, the president said.</P>
      <P>He cited a U.S. Defense Department report that China has deployed
725 missiles along its coastal areas against Taiwan, and that Beijing
has never renounced the use of force to take Taiwan, even trying to
change the status quo by its recently passed law to allow it to use
"non-peaceful means" against Taiwan should it formally declares
independence.</P>
      <P>China is playing a dual role of "arbitrator" and "punishment
dispenser, " which the president claimed makes it a time bomb
threatening regional peace and stability, and which will only drive
Taiwan further away from it and does not contribute to a better
cross-strait relationship, the president said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN TO DEPART FOR SOUTH PACIFIC VISIT MAY 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 27 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will depart for a
three-nation South Pacific state visit Sunday, the Presidential
Office announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The five-day diplomatic tour will take Chen to three of the
Republic of China's allies in the region -- the Marshall Islands,
Kiribati and Tuvalu via the U.S. territory of Guam, Presidential
Office Deputy Secretary-General James Huang said.</P>
      <P>The three-nation tour is mainly aimed at cementing friendships
and cooperation with the ROC's diplomatic allies in the South
Pacific, Huang said.</P>
      <P>This will be Chen's third overseas trip so far this year. In
January, he visited the ROC's two other Pacific allies -- the Solomon
Islands and Palau. Earlier this month, he made an unprecedented trip
to the Vatican to attend Pope John Paul II's funeral, making him the
first serving ROC president ever to set foot in Europe. The Holy See
is the ROC's only diplomatic ally in Europe.</P>
      <P>During his visits, Huang said, President Chen will sign joint
communiques with his counterparts of the three nations and deliver
speeches at the parliaments of the Marshall Islands and Kiribati.</P>
      <P>According to the itinerary unveiled by the Presidential Office,
Chen will depart Taipei at 5 a.m. Sunday for the Marshall Islands by
a chartered China Airlines plane. The plane will make a refueling
stop at Guam before arriving at the Marshall Island at 6 p.m. local
time.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of Marshall Island President Kessai Note, Huang
said, the ROC Navy has dispatched two Lafayette-class frigates to
take part in the Pacific island nation's May 1-2 National Day
celebrations.</P>
      <P>The two ships left the Tsoying naval base in southern Taiwan
April 19 and are scheduled to arrive at the Marshall Island's capital
of Majuro April 30.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Chen will breakfast with Note aboard one of the
Lafayette frigates next Monday. Later in the day, Chen and Note will
jointly preside over the opening of a canoeing contest and then
embark on a canoe voyage. Chen will present a model of a traditional
Tao tribal canoe to Note as a gift. The Tao is one of Taiwan's
aboriginal tribes.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to fly to Kiribati May 3 where he will join
with Kiribati President Anote Tong in presiding over the opening of a
coastal "Taiwan Park" and addresses the country's parliament.</P>
      <P>Kiribati is sometimes known as the country to see the first
sunrise each day as it straddles the International Dateline. In 2000,
many people traveled to Kiribati to appreciate the dawn of the new
millennium. On May 4, Huang said, Chen and his entourage will get up
early to appreciate the spectacular sunrise.</P>
      <P>Later that day, Chen will fly to Tuvalu by a small plane for a
half day visit. He will then return to Kiribati. Shortly afterwards,
he will depart for Guam for an overnight transit stop via the
chartered CAL plane.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage are scheduled to return to Taipei May 5.
Members of his entourage will include Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan
Sun Chen, Government Information Office Minister Pasuya Yao and
aboriginal Legislator Chen Ying.</P>
      <P>According to a news release issued by the Navy General
Headquarters, the two ships will be manned by more than 300 officers
and enlisted soldiers.</P>
      <P>In addition to celebrating the Marshall Islands' National Day,
the news release said the purposes of the mission also includes
promoting relations with the nation's diplomatic ally and honing
naval personnel's long-haul navigation skills.</P>

      <P>Expressing his sadness over violent
clashes at the airport, Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh said
Wednesday that cross-Taiwan Strait issues must ultimately be solved
by those in power, and they should work to have everyone going in the
same direction.</P>
      <P>He was commenting on opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan's

tarnished national image. It's unfortunate that Taiwan's

to ruling party leaders before visiting China, and fortunately Lien
had done so and President Chen Shui-bian has also changed his
attitude and gave his blessing to Lien's journey, he said.</P>
      <P>Practically speaking, he said, a consensus needs to be reached
with the ruling party after Lien returns from China so that the
ruling party will be able to negotiate a deal for peace with China.
"Otherwise, the issue can never be solved," he added.</P>
      <P>He used an analogy to make his point: Some people are going east
while others are going west. If the goal is for everyone to go east,
you cannot just control those going east and ignore those going west.
This will only make things difficult.</P>
      <P>"If I were in charge, I would devote more time and energy trying
to convince those going in the opposite direction, so that everybody
will be going the same way," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China invited opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan to visit in an attempt to isolate President Chen
Shui-bian politically, the French daily Le Figaro said here
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The paper said Lien's China trip will also offset some of the
negative effects caused by Beijing's enactment of the Anti-Secession
Law, which provides it with a legal basis to use force against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Le Figaro noted that the KMT fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing
a civil war to the Communist Party of China and lost power in Taiwan
in 2000 after five decades of rule.</P>
      <P>The paper said Lien's trip, which Lien describes as "a journey of
peace," is intended by the KMT to improve the peace across the Taiwan
Strait.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The draft organic law of a national
communications commission passed the review of the Organic Law and
Statue Committee under the Legislative Yuan Wednesday.</P>
      <P>However, some controversial articles were reserved for further
consultations among different parties.</P>
      <P>Notably among them is the composition of the proposed commission.
The two opposition parties of the Kuomintang (KMT) and People First
Party (PFP) requested that the members of the commission should be
recommended by political parties in proportion to their
representation in the legislature.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lu Hsue-chang and KMT Legislator Wu Chin-lin
claimed that the unhealthy political environment in Taiwan obliges
this method to ensure the commission's freedom from government
control.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kuan Pi-lin of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
disagreed, claiming that the commission to be created to
independently regulate the country's mass media is part of the
administration which should be supervised by the Legislative Yuan,
and therefore there is no need to pattern it on the composition of
the legislature.</P>
      <P>Also held over for further discussion is a so-called revolving
door clause which prohibits members of the proposed commission to
work for any media regulated by the commission until five years after
they leave their posts on the commission.</P>
      <P>A similar clause which prohibits officials of any political party
from serving on the commission until three years after they have left

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh said Wednesday he
deeply regrets the outbursts of violence at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS)
International Airport the previous day over opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's visit to China.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a weekly Cabinet meeting, Hsieh said he deplored the
police handling of the melee at the nation's main gateway.</P>
      <P>Noting that the "commanding officer" at the scene failed to
exercise his public authority to maintain order, Hsieh said he was in
serious dereliction of duty.</P>
      <P>"It was outrageous and unthinkable that no rioters were caught
red-handed and that no police officers held up warning placards to
ask people to stop the violence. The commanding officer is no
longer qualified for the post and has been transferred to another
job," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He was referring to Chen Juei-tien, head of the Aviation Police
Bureau who was assigned to a research job Tuesday evening after 15
people were injured in the airport fracas.</P>
      <P>The violence broke out as supporters from the pro-independence
"pan-green" camp clashed with another group of supporters of the
pro-unification "pan-blue alliance" while staging a demonstration at
the airport against Lien's China trip.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said grassroots police officers' must perform their duty to
maintain public order in accordance with the law. They cannot afford
to give up their public authority, otherwise, public order will
deteriorate. </P>
      <P>"Under our current law, the airport complex is off-limits to any
public rally, parade or demonstration. I felt deeply regret over
Tuesday's messy, incompetent handling of the incident, " Hsieh said,
adding that the incident has tarnished the nation's image and
undermined the government's authority.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is sincere in
calling for a cross-party summit to forge a consensus on relations
across the Taiwan Strait, the president's chief of staff said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Secretary-General Yu Shyi-kun made the
remarks during an informal meeting with a group of local journalists.</P>
      <P>Yu said President Chen looks forward to meeting with the two
opposition "pan-blue alliance" leaders -- Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman
Lien Chan and People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong -- after
their China trips.</P>
      <P>In a democratic society like Taiwan, Yu said, the president must
play the role of "balancer" of "pluralistic voices or forces."</P>
      <P>"Therefore, Chen will adopt an open-minded attitude toward the
holding of a cross-party summit, " Yu said, adding that Chen will
respect opposition leaders' opinions about the timing and format of
the meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Yu, Lien took the initiative during his brief phone
conversation with Chen Monday on the eve of his departure for his
self-styled "journey of peace" to China that he hopes to meet Chen
after his return.</P>
      <P>Yu said he is convinced that a much-anticipated cross-party
summit should become a reality in the not-too-distant future.</P>
      <P>Lien is scheduled to end his China trip May 3.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the president will meet with PFP Chairman Soong
prior to Soong's May 5-12 China trip, Yu said the Presidential Office
has kept close contacts with the PFP headquarters since the Feb. 24
Chen-Soong meeting. If not necessary, Yu said, the Presidential
Office will not arrange a special Chen-Soong meeting prior to Soong's
departure.</P>

      <P>Addressing an annual congress of the Chinese National Federation

the organization slated to be held next month.</P>
      <P>Taiwan considers that it should be allowed to take part in the
global health system in accordance with the WHO's "principle of
universality" and that it's WHA bid should not be politicized.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that high-ranking officials in Taipei attach great
importance to the issue, Lee said that his office is actively
drumming up support in the U.S. administration and Congress.</P>
      <P>Saying that the United States' stance in support of Taiwan's WHA
bid is "very firm, " the envoy noted that some U.S. lawmakers have
even sent letters to WHO Director-General Lee Jong-wook expressing the
hope that he can take practical steps in support of Taiwan's efforts
to join the WHA.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that currently, Washington, the WHO's Secretariat,
Beijing and Taipei are holding separate talks on the matter, without
any direct contact or talks between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>At last year's annual WHA meeting, both Washington and Tokyo
voted for Taiwan's bid to join the WHA as an observer, saying that
health and disease-prevention should know no boundaries and that
Taiwan's human rights should be respected.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh on Thursday rejected
Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan's offer to resign over clashes
between "pan-green" and "pan-blue" supporters at Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport two days ago.</P>
      <P>Asked about the issue while inspecting a landslide disaster
prevention exercise in Miaoli County, Hsieh said Su should not be
asked to take the responsibility for the incident because it is the
supervisors on the frontline who are responsible for failure to
maintain order at the airport.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Su was not even in Taiwan when the incident occurred,
Hsieh pointed out.</P>
      <P>The violence broke out Tuesday as a group of protesters from the
ruling "pan-green camp" clashed with another group of supporters of
the opposition "pan-blue alliance" while demonstrating at the airport
against opposition Kuomintang Chairman's China trip.</P>
      <P>Aviation Police Office head Chen Juei-tien was removed from the
post immediately after the incident.</P>
      <P>According to Cabinet spokesman Cho Jung-tai, Su rang up Hsieh and
verbally offered to resign over the incident as soon as Su returned
Wednesday from a trip to the Vatican for the inauguration of Pope
Benedict XVI.</P>
      <P>Hsieh turned down Su's offer immediately on the grounds that he
was not to blame, Cho said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, while attending a meeting of the legislature's Home
and Nations Committee on Wednesday, Su confirmed that he had offered
to resign but was asked to stay.</P>
      <P>Su apologized to the public over the police's failure to fulfill
their duty and pledged to bring to justice anyone who used violence,
regardless of their political affiliation.</P>
      <P>Su said he will continue to work to improve public order in the

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
looks forward to a positive development of cross Taiwan-Strait
relations despite Beijing's enactment of its Anti-Secession Law in
mid-March, MOFA spokesman Michel Lu said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The MOFA hopes that opposition leaders "will abide by Taiwan's
laws" and do their best to "protect the national interests" when
holding talks with officials of the Communist Party of China (CPC) ,
Lu said, referring to main opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan
who is currently on a visit to mainland China and People First Party
Chairman James Soong who will depart for China May 5.</P>
      <P>Lu made the remarks when answering reporters' questions after
White House spokesman Scott McClellan said a day earlier that the
United States "welcomes dialogue between Beijing and Taiwan, major
figures in Taiwan, because we believe that diplomacy is the only way
to resolve the cross-strait issue."</P>
      <P>"But we hope that this is the start of Beijing finding new ways

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's top official
in the United States rebutted Wednesday media reports that pressure
from Washington had caused President Chan Shui-bian to change his
attitude toward opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan's China
visit, describing the reports as "groundless."</P>
      <P>David Tawei Lee, Taiwan's representative to the United States,
made the rebuttal while meeting with reporters at a press conference
held in the U.S. capital.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the United Sates attaches great importance to the
visits to China by Lien and opposition People First Party Chairman
James Soong and is closely watching the situation. He stressed that
his office is also maintaining close contact with the relevant U.S.
officials.</P>
      <P>The U.S. stance in dealing with the China visits are to support
and encourage cross-Taiwan Strait contact and dialogue, the envoy
said, adding that besides the opposition leaders, Washington also
hopes that Beijing will make contact with the duly elected government

      <P>The stance actually corresponds to the basic and longstanding
U.S. cross-strait policy -- encouraging dialogue between the two
sides of the strait in order to resolve problems peacefully and
supporting Taiwan's democracy, he said.</P>
      <P>Washington considers that although it is good for Beijing to make

      <P>Asked whether the United States put pressure on Chen or

Lee said: "This is groundless" and "those media reports are not

      <P>Saying that he does not know the decision-making process in
Taipei regarding Lien's visit, Lee stressed that during his contact
with U.S. officials, he was never told how Taiwan should act on the

    <HEADLINE>INTERNATIONAL VOLUNTEER BODY OPENS RESOURCES CENTER IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An International Resources Center (IRC)
under the International Association for Volunteer Effort (IAVE) was
formally established in Taipei Thursday, marking the first
international non-governmental organization (NGO) to open an
international resources center in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The IAVE-IRC -- the third office of its kind that the IAVE has
established worldwide -- will mainly be a research and development
center aimed at expanding Internet networks for international
volunteer efforts, building an IAVE library, establishing a
publication center, and sponsoring seminars and training camps on
volunteering and youth services, said Liz Burns, IAVE president and
chief administrator.</P>
      <P>Burns, who has traveled to Taiwan for the opening of the center,
and Li-chiun Cheng, chairwoman of Taiwan's Cabinet-level National
Youth Commission (NYC), jointly presided over a ceremony held at the
NYC headquarters to kick off the IAVE-IRC's operations.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Burns expressed her keen
expectations that the establishment of the IAVE-IRC will help beef up
partnerships between international volunteers and their Taiwan
counterparts and will obtain enthusiastic support from Taiwan
society.</P>
      <P>Also addressing the ceremony, Cheng said that the opening of the
center in Taiwan represents a physical link-up between Taiwan's
volunteers and their global counterparts, and a vision that more
people in Taiwan will join the "volunteer family" so that they can
carry out their responsibilities as members of the civilized world.</P>
      <P>Chiang Kuo-chiang, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official
in charge of international NGO affairs, who also spoke at the
ceremony, said that the MOFA plans to publish a book to give an
account of the ministry's efforts in NGO work over the last five
years since the MOFA NGO Committee was established.</P>
      <P>Wendy Stratton, the first executive director of the IAVE-IRC,
expressed hope that Taiwan will be a base and a fresh starting point
for her to further promote international volunteerism and youth
services worldwide. Stratton, a retired geography teacher from
Canada, has been involved in international volunteer services for
more than 20 years.</P>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian, who has made known on many occasions
his zeal in promoting volunteerism and youth services, met Burns in
Taipei during a visit she made in 2004 at the invitation of the Asia
Pacific Public Affairs Forum.</P>
      <P>During that visit, Burns also presided over a ceremony marking
the establishment of the IAVE Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Burns, a teacher-turned-volunteer from Scotland, was elected
director of the Volunteer Development Scotland in 1983. She was then
chosen as chief administrator for the IAVE in 2001.</P>
      <P>The IAVE office in Taiwan, according to Cheng, is a center of
resources devoted to providing and assisting in Web site coordination
and integration of the IAVE's organizational system.</P>
      <P>Founded in 1970, the IAVE is the only international organization
with the mission of promoting, celebrating and strengthening
volunteerism worldwide. Working closely with the United Nations
Volunteers, the group was instrumental in getting the U.N. General
Assembly to declare 2001 the International Year of Volunteers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's "one country, two systems"
unification formula has been proven pointless since Hong Kong and
Macau returned to Beijing's rule in 1997 and 1999, respectively,
President Chen Shui-bian said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks during a meeting with a group of more than
30 Taiwan expatriates from Hong Kong and Macau at the Presidential
Office. Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman You Ying-lung and
Presidential Vice Secretary-General James Hung were also present at
the meeting.</P>
      <P>Describing it as "impossible" for Taiwan and China to undergo
political consolidation before China implements democracy and allows
direct elections, as well as freedom of religion and speech for its
people, Chen said that the experience gained by Hong Kong and Macau
during the past several years of being ruled by China is clear proof
that the "one country, two systems" scheme is a lie.</P>
      <P>The president said that the situation facing Hong Kong and Macau
at present is not how many promises Beijing makes to them but is
rather the problem of whether Beijing can brace for democracy and
implement rule of law, he noted.</P>
      <P>He called on the Beijing leadership to be wise and catch up with
world trends and the globally recognized values of freedom and
democracy, and to step up political reform and make China a democracy
in order to write a new page of progress and prosperity in history
for the Chinese people in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau.</P>

      <P>China should recommend immediately the
granting of observer status to Taiwan in the World Health

of manipulating the issue for political purposes, local medical

      <P>They were responding to a media report that China's President Hu
Jintao will offer to help Taiwan participate in the World Health
Assembly (WHA) "in an appropriate capacity" either during a meeting
with opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien Chan Friday or with
opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong next month.</P>
      <P>Previous reports on a similar issue have said that Beijing
insists that Taiwan must use the name "Taiwan, China" to participate
in the WHA -- the WHO's decision-making arm. Taiwan has rejected the
proposal on the ground that it would downgrade the status of the
country to a part of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>According to Deng Jou-fang, president of the Taiwan International

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S PRESIDENT BIGGEST WINNER IN KMT HEAD'S CHINA TRIP: HK PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong Kong,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Lin Yu-kuo and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Whether opposition Kuomintang Chairman
Lien Chan's historic visit to China will be an asset or a liability
for him and his party is not yet apparent, but Chinese President Hu
Jintao will emerge as the biggest winner from his trip, a Hong Kong
daily said Thursday.</P>
      <P>An article in the Apple Daily speculates that Hu will not only
increase his say on Taiwan policy but will also consolidate his power
base within the Communist Party of China (CPC) as he emerges further
from the shadow of his predecessor, Jiang Zeming. Hu concurrently
serves as CPC general secretary.</P>
      <P>According to the article, the views of Nanjing citizens and
messages left by Chinese citizens on the Internet "show clearly" that
optimism of people in China for peaceful reunification between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait has risen dramatically since Lien's
arrival in Nanjing Tuesday, his first stop on a four-city April
26-May 3 visit.</P>
      <P>The people's will for peaceful resolution of cross-Taiwan Strait
issues is just what Hu needs most at present, the article says.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years or so, Beijing has never relaxed its
campaign of castigating Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
and seeking to check the pro-independence forces in Taiwan, the
article continues, and cross-strait tension has been persistent.
China's enactment of the Anti-Secession Law, which codifies the use
of force against Taiwan should the island formally declare
independence, has pushed the tension to a new high, the article says.</P>
      <P>According to the article, no matter how great the military
pressure, Beijing still cannot change the political situation in
Taiwan, and Hu's works on Taiwan have been stalemated.</P>
      <P>Lien's visit has given Hu a chance to break through the stalemate
and get him off the hook with regard to his Taiwan policy, the
article claims.</P>
      <P>It points out that if Hu wants to have a free hand in personnel
arrangement and promotion of his policies, he has to establish his
authority within the party.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan is an issue that most touches the nerves of the
Chinese, anyone who can contribute to solving the Taiwan issue will
see a rapid ascendance within the CPC, the article says.</P>
      <P>With Lien's visit, the Beijing authorities have made a
breakthrough in resolving the Taiwan issue by giving people in China
the impression that there is light at the end of the tunnel in a
peaceful resolution of the issue, according to the article.</P>
      <P>Where previous Chinese leaders Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin
failed, Hu has succeeded, the article continues -- referring to
securing the KMT chairman's visit to China.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Lien's visit is deemed to be a political
achievement for Hu, greatly raising his stature and authority within
the CPC, according to the article.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, the Beijing authorities will certainly
treat him well. Moreover, Lien's trip will also help cushion
animosity of the international community over the Anti-Secession Law.
It is only natural for Beijing to provide Lien with the treatment
accorded to a national leader under Beijing's logic, the article
says.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WANTS CROSS-STRAIT TRADE RELATIONS UNDER WTO FRAMEWORK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Trade and economic relations with China
must be based on the framework established by the World Trade
Organization (WTO) , the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs said Thursday.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials made the remarks amid reports that China might
offer to establish a closer economic partnership arrangement (CEPA)
with Taiwan during opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's
historic visit to China. Lien is scheduled to call on Chinese
President Hu Jintao Friday, marking the first meeting between the
leaders of the KMT and the Communist Party of China (CPC) since the
KMT fled the mainland in 1949.</P>
      <P>The officials said that entering into a CEPA would denigrate
Taiwan, and would be politically motivated.</P>
      <P>They said that according to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, the predecessor of the WTO, and the GATS, or the General
Agreement on Trade in Services, which is an international trade
agreement that came into effect in 1995 and operates under the
umbrella of the WTO, WTO members have the right to sign free trade
agreement or similar accords to promote bilateral trade and
economic cooperation.</P>
      <P>Given this, Taiwan would like to use the framework of the WTO to
complete talks on a timetable for the opening of the service industry
and a free trade zone, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted that the CEPA signed between China and Hong Kong
stipulates the adherence to "one country, two systems, " which
obviously denigrates Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>If China offers to sign a CEPA with Taiwan, it will be a sign
that China is trying to bring Taiwan under its "one China" umbrella,
which is its political "united front" approach, and Taiwan will never
accept that, they said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA'S DEMOCRATIZATION KEY TO CROSS-STRAIT INTEGRATION: PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  28 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Political integration is not possible
between Taiwan and China until Beijing implements democratic
elections, nationalizes its armed forces and grants full freedom of
speech and religion to its people, President Chen Shui-bian said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The government of China hopes for the success of the so-called
'one country, two systems' model for dealing with cross-Taiwan Strait
relations, " Chen told a group of visiting Taiwanese expatriates
living in Hong Kong and Macau.</P>
      <P>"But it has been proven that the biggest conflict across the
Taiwan Strait is not the political separation but the different
choices in terms of system of governance and lifestyle, " Chen added.</P>
      <P>In what Chen called a lesson that Beijing's leaders should learn
from and an alert for the 23 million people of Taiwan, Chen claimed
that the integration of Hong Kong and Macau into China regardless of
the huge gap that exists between them has led to a regression in the
socio-economic development of the two special administrative regions.</P>
      <P>With eight years since the handover of Hong Kong to China and six
years of Macau's handover, the so-called "one country, two systems"
model has been "proven to be nothing but a lie," Chen said.</P>
      <P>While the National People's Congress (NPC) of China interpreted
the Hong Kong Basic Law proactively in April 2004 to deny Hong Kong
residents the right to directly elect their chief executive in 2007
and their legislative council in 2008, the NPC made a similar move
earlier this month and issued its interpretation on the term of the
next chief executive, he noted.</P>
      <P>Chen said that by interpreting the law proactively, Beijing has
deprived the Hong Kong courts of their right to interpret the law.</P>
      <P>He argued that the problem faced by Hong Kong and Macau today is
not how many promises China can make but whether China can practice
democracy and rule of law, which he said are the most secure
protections for human rights and the most effective deterrents to
corruption.</P>
      <P>Known for its integrity and efficiency in the past, Hong Kong has
seen its luster as "the pearl of the Orient" fade since its handover
to China in 1997, he said.</P>
      <P>"The dictatorship of China is like a giant cage in which the
freedom- and democracy-aspiring Hong Kong and Macau residents are
confined. It is even more like a pair of heavy shackles that have
seriously hampered Hong Kong's and Macau's pursuit of progress and
development," Chen said.</P>
      <P>The president urged Beijing's leaders to comply with global
trends, embrace the universal values of freedom, democracy, human
rights and peace, and speed up political reforms to allow democracy
and rule of law to take root in China.</P>

    <TEXT>New York Times: House Overturns New
Ethics Rule as Republican Leadership Yields.

The Republican-led House on Wednesday overturned contentious rule
changes made to the House ethics process, with Republicans saying
they surrendered to the Democrats to try to restore a way to enforce
proper conduct in the House. After a closed-door meeting with House
Republicans, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert indicated that the reversal
was primarily motivated by a need to resolve the torrent of questions
surrounding the conduct of Representative Tom DeLay, the majority
leader. One of the most immediate effects of the House's reverting to
the old rules will be the opening of an investigation into persistent
questions about DeLay's overseas travel and his relationships with
prominent lobbyists. His fund-raising operations are under
investigation by a grand jury in Texas, and some of the lobbyists'
roles have come under increasing scrutiny by federal investigators in
recent months. DeLay has not been named as a target of tho se
investigations, the attention paid to his troubles has proven
disruptive in the House.

Wall Street Journal: Facing Lawsuits, Parmalat Auditor Stresses
Its Disunity.

Deloitte &amp; Touche, the U.S. unit of Parmalat SpA, one of Italy's
largest companies, was once described a"crown jewel for the
organization worldwide. Today, with plaintiffs in two U.S. lawsuits
trying to tie the U.S. unit to the massive scandal at Parmalat,
Deloitte is describing itself in very different terms. The accounting
firm says it is a network of affiliated but legally separate national
partnerships and that Deloitte &amp; Touche SpA, its Italian arm, bears
sole responsibility for the audit. The Big Four accounting firms --
Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG and Ernst &amp; Young -- have long
claimed in court cases that their units are independent and can't be
held liable for each other's sins. U.S. courts to date have backed
that argument. The firms say the distinction is important -- allowing
them to boost the efficiency of the global economy by spreading
uniform standards of accounting around the world, without worrying
that one unit's missteps will sink the entire enterprise.</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>POLITICALLY MOTIVATED CEPA UNACCEPTABLE TO TAIWAN: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 28 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China's reported offer to sign a closer
economic partnership arrangement (CEPA) is unacceptable to Taiwan but
the two sides should engage in mutually beneficial exchanges under
the framework of the World Trade Organization (WTO), a veteran China
analyst suggested Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-ueh, a professor at the Institute of China Studies under
Tamkang University, made the comments during an exclusive interview
with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>Although Chang admitted that a CEPA is a good way to enhance
two-way trade and economic exchanges, like the similar mechanism
between Australia and New Zealand, he said, however, that inking a
CEPA with China is risky for Taiwan due to its political connotation
associated with the "one China" concept or "unification."</P>
      <P>A CEPA allows China to grant privileged treatment to Hong Kong
and Macau -- two former colonies that became special administrative
regions after reverting to Beijing's rule in 1997 and 1999
respectively, and thus it would be unacceptable for Taiwan to sign
such an agreement as it would downgrade Taiwan's status to that of
Hong Kong and Macau, he explained.</P>
      <P>Under the terms provided by the CEPA between China and Hong Kong
and Macau, which took effect Jan. 1, 2004, more than 100 categories
of products from the two territories are allowed to enter China
duty-free.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan-China relations represent a far cry from the Hong
Kong and Macau models, and against such a backdrop, he went on, the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait should use the WTO as a platform to
conduct bilateral trade and economic exchanges because it is
important for both to maintain links under a sound structure to
engage in a division of labor from a global prospective.</P>
      <P>In the face of China's CEPA with Hong Kong and Macau and the
would-be "10 plus three" pact between China, Japan, South Korea and
the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, "a
lack of a sound mechanism to boost and enhance the heavily
interdependent trade and economic relations between Taiwan and China
is impractical," he said.</P>
      <P>Now that both Taiwan and China are WTO member states, it is
important and appropriate to further promote Taiwan-China trade and
economic cooperation through its channels, he suggested.</P>
      <P>Chang's comments came after the local media reported earlier the
same day that Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan, who is currently
visiting China, might talk about a CEPA between Taiwan and China with
Communist Party of China General Secretary Hu Jintao when the two
meet Friday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lien's historic visit to China is the first by a KMT top leader
in 56 years after Taiwan and China split in 1949 in the wake of the
Chinese civil war.</P>
      <P>The high-profile trip has won great support from KMT backers who
are fervently hoping for a breakthrough in deadlocked Taiwan-China
ties, but it has also backfield among the pro-independence camp out
of strong fear that Taiwan might be sold out.</P>

      <P>Although the volume of Taiwan's air cargo
transport posted a mere 0.4 percent increase in the first quarter of
this year, the volume of transshipped cargoes in the same period
soared 16.5 percent, government sources reported Thursday.</P>

lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events that have
occurred on this date in the past:

(By Oliver Lin and P.C.Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's invitations extended to
leaders of Taiwan's opposition parties to visit China are aimed at
causing dissension within Taiwan, a U.S. scholar said Thursday.</P>
      <P>June Teufel Dreyer, a professor in the University of Miami's
Department of Political Science, also said that main opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's current China visit has
deflected criticism of Beijing over its anti-secession law targeting
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien, at the head of a 30-member KMT delegation, arrived in China
Tuesday for an eight-day visit. James Soong, chairman of the People
First Party, is scheduled to leave for China May 5.</P>
      <P>The professor said that Lien's visit "has already heightened
cross-strait tensions by polarizing feelings within Taiwan, "
referring to Beijing's move to try to cause dissension within Taiwan
as "clever."</P>
      <P>"What is shameful is that Lien would allow himself to be part of
this. It is all the more amazing that Lien would make this trip so
soon after Beijing passed its anti-secession law -- which most
outsiders believ disturbs the status quo," Dreyer further said.</P>
      <P>According to the professor, Lien's China visit has helped China
deflect criticism of its anti-secession law and made it look as if
the Taiwan people have no problem with the law and are longing for
unification.</P>
      <P>She also said that some of her students, who are largely ignorant
of the situation in Taiwan and China, were "aghast" at seeing on TV
that an opposition party leader had gone to his country's only enemy
to hold talks and that they could not imagine Al Gore or John Kerry,
the two Democrat candidates in the last two U.S. presidential
elections, repectively, doing the same.</P>

      <P>Ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairman Su Tseng-chang continued to lambaste opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan Friday for the latter's visit to China shortly
after Beijing's enactment of its anti-secession law authorizing the
use of non-peaceful means against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien arrived in China Tuesday for a historic eight-day visit,
marking the first time a KMT chairman has set foot on mainland
Chinese soil in nearly 60 years.</P>
      <P>"All we've seen has been dining, drinking and gift exchanging,
but we haven't seen Lien express a single word in China to reflect
the Taiwan people's feelings about the anti-secession law, " Su said
at a press conference marking the launch of a publicity campaign to
drum up support for the ruling DPP in the May 14 election of
mission-oriented National Assembly members.</P>
      <P>Ridiculing an earlier news report that China may give Taiwan two
pandas as a goodwill gesture in response to Lien's China visit, Su
said that "what Taiwan needs is for China to destroy its missiles

      <P>On remarks made by Sun Yafu, deputy director of the Taiwan

saying the DPP would not accept invitations of any kind from Beijing
at this moment, only 45 days after the anti-secession law's
enactment, which brought hundreds of thousands of Taiwan citizens out
into the streets in a protest rally shortly afterward.</P>

      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that
the reported coming to Taiwan of two pandas from mainland China has
nothing to do with the current visit in China by opposition
Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and urged the country not to
politicize the panda matter.</P>
      <P>Ma, himself a KMT vice chairman, stressed that Taipei City Zoo
has been working for years to prepare for welcoming the Chinese
pandas, and the matter is by no means related to KMT Chairman Lien's
ongoing China visit.</P>
      <P>Noting that the purpose of a city zoo is to conserve as well as
display wild animals, Ma said that the Taipei City Zoo should strive
to make itself like any other zoo in the world which is capable of
accommodating all kinds of wild animals, including pandas.</P>
      <P>It would be a nice thing for both Taipei and Taiwan if the Taipei
City Zoo were able to have pandas, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>If other zoos around the world are able to accommodate Chinese
pandas -- actually 23 pandas are already kept in zoos in more than 10

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh has approved the
resignation of Vice Minister of the Interior Lin Yung-chien, Cabinet
spokesman Cho Jung-tai said Friday.</P>
      <P>According to Cho, Lin offered to resign verbally to Hsieh last
night to assume political responsibility for the clumsy police
handling of the fracas at Chiang Kai-shek (CKS) International Airport
earlier this week over opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan's visit to China.</P>
      <P>Lin, a former deputy mayor of the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, assumed the second-highest post at the Ministry of the
Interior (MOI), which supervises police operations, in February this
year.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Lin said he must take full
responsibility for the flawed police handling of the violent clashes
between opponents and supporters of Lien's China visit Tuesday at the
nation's main gateway.</P>
      <P>"The airport melee has tarnished our national image, " Lin said
regretfully, adding that the MOI has apologized for the incident.</P>
      <P>When the incident happened, Interior Minister Su Jia-chyuan was
on a trip to the Vatican to attend Pope Benedict XVI's inaugural
mass.</P>
      <P>"At the time, I was in charge of ministry affairs. Therefore, I
must step down to take the blame for the airport chaos," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin recalled that he clearly issued two directives while
attending a working meeting at the Aviation Police Bureau on the eve
of Lien's departure.</P>
      <P>"The directives were that nobody should be allowed to give a
public speech at the passenger terminal because the airport complex
is off-limits to any public rally, parade or demonstration and that
police must promptly hold up warning placards when any law-breaking
move was spotted," Lin said.</P>
      <P>"I feel deep regret that the 'commanding officer' at the scene
failed to exercise his public authority to respond properly when the
violence broke out, " Lin said, referring to former Aviation Police
Bureau Director Chen Juei-tien.</P>
      <P>Chen was transferred to a research job shortly after the
incident. Liu Shih-lin, deputy director-general of the National
Police Administration, who was at the Aviation Police Bureau to
supervise airport police operations that day, has also been slapped
with a demerit.</P>
      <P>Now that he has resigned, Lin said, he hopes "probes into police
accountability can be stopped at this point" because police still
have many tough jobs ahead, referring to Lien's return scheduled for
May 3 and opposition People First Party Chairman James Soong's
departure for China May 5 for a visit.</P>
      <P>"I'm very hopeful that the public will offer our police officers
a chance to remedy Tuesday's flawed operations," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan has come a long way in its democratic
development, Lin said individual citizens and opinion leaders from
the rival camps should learn to express their political opinions in a
peaceful, rational manner.</P>
      <P>"We may have different views about our nation's development
course, but we all live on this island. We should never resort to
violence against each other. Otherwise, out democratic way of life
will be at stake," Lin added.</P>
      <P>The violence broke out Tuesday as supporters from the
pro-independence "pan-green camp" clashed with a group of supporters
of the pro-unification "pan-blue alliance" while staging a
demonstration at CKS Airport against Lien's China trip. A dozen
people were injured in the chaos.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN URGES BOTH SIDES TO WORK FOR CROSS-STRAIT PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing, April 29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Chairman Lien Chan on Friday stressed that both sides of the Taiwan
Strait "have a responsibility toward each other" and that they must
work toward cross-strait peace and development for their mutual
benefit.</P>
      <P>Lien, the first KMT leader to set foot in mainland China since
the KMT fled to Taiwan after being defeated by Communist Party of
China (CPC) in 1949, made the appeal during a speech he delivered to
more than 500 faculty members and students at Peking University in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>He said that both sides must "insist on peace and maintain a
stable status quo, " adding that maintaining a status quo is not a
passive approach but aims to put aside differences and seek common
ground so as to accumulate cross-strait goodwill "bit by bit" for the
positive development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Lien lauded two major figures that played key roles in the
development of Taiwan and China, respectively, namely the late
Republic of China President Chiang Ching-kuo and the late CPC General
Secretary Deng Xioaping, saying that they had helped turn history in
critical time.</P>
      <P>Noting that Chiang promoted the "10 major-construction projects"
which helped create Taiwan's economic miracle, while Deng championed
reforms that led to an overall improvement in mainland Chinese living
standards, Lien said that he hopes that the young students will learn
from these sagacious foreleaders and become "navigators of their
time."</P>
      <P>As intellectuals, he asked the students to be determined and
courageous to "find a way" for the vast majority of the people so
that the Chinese people will never again have to go to war and shed
blood.</P>
      <P>On how to achieve cross-strait peace, Lien cited a memorial
tablet in a museum in Tel Aviv, Israel commemorating the Holocaust
that says Jews have a responsibility to each other, to stress that
every Chinese person with wisdom and ability must dedicate themselves
to a lasting cross-strait peace.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that he has traveled to the mainland with the hope
of seeing overall development proceed more quickly, noting that there
has been rapid political development, such as the holding of local
elections and the inclusion of protecting property rights into the
constitution, which is moving China in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he added that ample room remains for further
political reform.</P>
      <P>Faced with globalization, the two sides of the strait can only
succeed through cooperation to upgrade their competitiveness, he
said.</P>
      <P>Lien noted that the two sides are "complementary to each other, "
adding that Taiwan is striving toward a second economic miracle,
while China is witnessing an unprecedented opportunity, claiming that
if both sides can cooperate, then achieving a modern and prosperous
China "will no longer be an impossible dream."</P>
      <P>"What's wrong with both sides cooperating to earn money from the
world, " Lien asked, stressing that cross-strait cooperation will see
its effect multiply and create a multiple-win situation.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the two sides not cling to the past
lest they miss the opportunities that the future holds, saying that
reconciliation is supported by the people and that no one wants to
see cross-strait rivalry and confrontation.</P>
      <P>Noting that some have voiced suspicions that his visit is a
"third KMT-CPC negotiation" aimed at uniting the CPC to check the
pro-independence forces in Taiwan, Lien said that this view is a
serious distortion of the facts and represents a rigid mindset left
from the civil war era.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that the KMT has always supported the notion that
following the right path will lead to opportunities and solutions,
Lien said that Taiwan should not let populism take the place of
democracy nor allow the timetable of Taiwan independence forces
sabotage the people's well-being. He claimed that a majority of
Legislative Yuan members support this position and that a significant
majority of the Taiwan people support cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Lien began his speech by saying that he was "warmed" with a
homecoming feeling to step onto the campus of his 96-year-old mother
Chao Lan-kun's alma mater, and recalling her youthful days at the
prestigious school.</P>
      <P>He also spoke about the spirit of freedom and tolerance
championed by former Peking University President Tsai Yuanpei, adding
that the school is the roots of modern China.</P>
      <P>The 40-minute speech, interrupted several times by warm and
enthusiastic applause, was followed by a 20-minute
question-and-answer session.</P>
      <P>After his speech, Lien received as a gift a copy of his mother's
academic records during her time at the school.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan urged China Friday to open its market to Taiwan's agricultural
products.</P>
      <P>Lien, who is on a historic eight-day visit to China, made the
appeal during a question-and-answer session after making a 40-minute
speech to around 600 faculty members of Peking University in Beijing.</P>
      <P>A Peking University professor noted that history has shown that
the KMT used to face a big challenge in maintaining the livelihoods
of farmers, and asked Lien about his views on how to promote
cross-Taiwan Strait agricultural exchanges and enhance cross-strait
cooperation and exchanges.</P>
      <P>Lien said that agriculture has become weak in Taiwan in view of
the nation's rapid industrialization and technological development,
although the population of farmers still numbers several million,
mostly in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But he noted that Taiwan has made substantial progress in
agricultural technology over the years. In China, where there are
excellent agricultural environments, many things that are not
workable in Taiwan may still hold a promising future in China, he
said.</P>
      <P>Lien expressed the hope that China can open up its market to
Taiwan agricultural products.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Joseph Wu accused opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
Friday of disappointing the people of Taiwan by failing to express
their voice in a speech he made at Peking University earlier that
day.</P>
      <P>Instead, Wu said, Lien spoke ill of Taiwan's democratic
development, when the island's democratic experience is supposed to
be the most valuable model for China to follow.</P>
      <P>In addition to calling for cross-Taiwan Strait cooperation for
peace and stability in his speech, Lien also claimed that Taiwan's
democracy is threatened by a rising trend of populism in the nation,
while its people's happiness is at stake because of a
pro-independence campaign trying to draft a new constitution and
change the official name of the country.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, it was disappointing that Lien did not seize the
rare opportunity to elaborate on topics such as the cross-strait
status quo in which Taiwan and China are independent of each other
and the fact that the Republic of China is an independent, sovereign
state whose fate is to be determined by its 23 million people.</P>
      <P>Wu accused Lien of denigrating the democratic development of
Taiwan on the soil of the undemocratic People's Republic of China,
which he said is something a well-trained politician should not have
done.</P>
      <P>While it was highly significant for Lien to discuss freedom and
democracy at Peking University -- the origin of liberalism in China,
it was a pity that he restricted his discussion to the freedom and
democracy advocated during the May Fourth Movement back in 1919,
without mentioning anything about enhancing the democratic
development of China, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Saying that Lien did not link the concepts of peace, freedom and
democracy together, Wu further expressed his disapproval of Lien's
failure to point out Beijing's information blockade in China and
China's military threat against Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HEAD PUTS FORWARD `NEW THINKING' AT PEKING UNIVERSITY: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A speech made by opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) Chairman Lien Chan at Peking University has won favorable
responses from Chinese students because he put forward "new thinking"
about developing cross-Taiwan Strait relations based on the values of
peace and the people's well-being, a Taiwan scholar claimed Friday.</P>
      <P>Andy Chang, a China studies professor at Tamkang University, also
pointed out that Lien's speech to university faculty and students was
broadcast live, an indication that China was trying to lead Taiwan
people to believe that new thinking and a new strategy were being
formulated in its policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China apparently would like to use this occasion to change Taiwan
people's "stereotyped" impression of China, Chang said.</P>
      <P>While Lien was proposing peace and dialogue for the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, the spirit of "seeking peace through dialogue"
actually is needed for both cross-strait relations and intra-party
relations in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>If there is a need for the KMT and the Communist Party of China
to seek reconciliation and dialogue, so much more the need for such
"new thinking" for the ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan, Chang
went on.</P>
      <P>He said relations between Taiwan and China are now entering a
"subtle and critical" point, from which both sides should look hard
at the reality, focus on what the general public really wants and
choose peace and cooperation as their prime values to jointly create
a win-win situation for all.</P>
      <P>The future development of cross-strait relations depends on more
exchanges and interaction, he said, adding that if Lien's speech
helps promote mutual understanding between the people of China and
the people of Taiwan, it would show "constructive" significance.</P>
      <P>As Lien has indicated he will step down as KMT chairman, some
pundits have said that Lien is making his April 26-May 3 China visit
his swansong, but Chang claimed that Lien's trip has created history
not only for himself, but for the two sides of the strait.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   April  29  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's agricultural products are
targeted at the whole world for exports and China is not the only
market, the head of the Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA)
pointed out Friday.</P>
      <P>COA Chairman Lee Chin-lung made the remarks in the wake of a
speech at Peking University made by opposition Kuomintang Lien Chan
earlier in the day in which he said that while agriculture has become
weak in Taiwan in view of the country's rapid industrialization and
technology development, the island still holds an edge in
agricultural technology and could have prospects in the vast China
market. He also expressed the hope that China can open up its market
to Taiwan agricultural products.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that statistics show that Japan is the largest market
for Taiwan's agricultural products, accounting for 40 percent,
followed by Hong Kong and the United States, with China ranking
fourth at around 9.2 percent.</P>
      <P>"China is neither the biggest nor the only market for Taiwan
agriculture," Lee added.</P>
      <P>Lee said that although China reportedly expressed that it would
help Taiwan agricultural products to be sold in China, the COA has
yet to receive substantial proposals, whether orally or in written
form.</P>
      <P>At present, Taiwan fruit exported to China is subject to high
tariffs and taxes, Lee said, adding that if China truly wants to open
up its market to Taiwan agricultural products, it should propose
substantial measures, simplify customs clearance and quarantine
procedures.</P>
      <P>Anything that concerns the exercise of authority of the
government will still be dealt with by the government and related
agencies that have been commissioned by the government, he said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Beijing,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan said Friday here that his insistence on peace and a win-win
future in terms of Taiwan-China ties is on the right track of
history.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks at Peking University during a
question-and-answer session after giving a speech that was warmly
received by about 600 students and faculty members, including 23
students from Taiwan.
</P>
      <P>Claiming that history will eventually prove that this is the
right direction, Lien said "he has seen the irresistible historical
trends" and added that "we are pleased we have got on the bandwagon
at the right time at this juncture of history."</P>
      <P>"As long as one can catch up with the historical trends in a
timely manner, success will come, " the KMT chief said, adding that
the KMT will continue to work on the right path by building national
identity, boosting cross-Taiwan Strait peace, cementing democracy,
promoting ethnic equality and enhancing economic prosperity -- the
KMT's five themes in last year's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Responding to a student's question about what he described as
Taiwan's de-sinicization education policy, Lien said it is a radical
and lamentable policy and claimed that it is not accepted by the
majority of the people in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also praised both Peking University and National Taiwan
University (NTU) as cradles of liberalism of China and Taiwan,
respectively, pointing out that many famous professors at Peking
University transferred to NTU after retreating to Taiwan with the KMT
in 1949. The two pioneers and bastions of liberalism echo each other
on the two sides of the strait, he said.</P>
      <P>Looking back to China's painful past, he encouraged the students
to have broad vision and think about China's future, stressing that
intellectuals should have the resolve and be brave enough to assume
historical responsibility to search for the best avenue for the
people.</P>
      <P>"To avoid war and build peace for all the Chinese people and
younger generations is the great task to which intellectuals should
commit themselves," he said.</P>
      <P>Lien is the first KMT chairman to visit China in nearly 60 years
since 1949, when the KMT retreated to Taiwan after losing a civil war
to the Chinese communists.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACTIVIST GROUP ANNOUNCES SEPT. 8 AS 'TAIWAN NATIONAL DAY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of pro-Taiwan independence
activists announced Friday that they would like to have Sept. 8
designated as Taiwan's national day.</P>
      <P>Wang Hsien-chi, convener of the Taiwan Nation Movement
Preparatory Committee and founder of the Alliance to Campaign for
Rectifying the Name of Taiwan, claimed at a press conference that
Taiwan has been independent since 1945, when Japan surrendered at the
end of the World War II.</P>
      <P>More precisely, Wang admitted, Japan merely gave up its
territorial claims to Taiwan in the peace treaty it signed with the
Allied nations in San Francisco Sept. 8, 1951 and did not give the
island to any country. According to Wang, this means the island
became independent.</P>
      <P>This is the reason why the preparatory committee chose Sept. 8 as
the national day of Taiwan, an independent sovereignty, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Every Sept. 8, Wang said, the people of Taiwan should celebrate
Taiwan national day on Ketagalan Boulevard in front of the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>He said the committee will also strive to establish a national
policy advisory group, enact a Taiwan Constitution and draft a
national policy white paper -- all measures aimed at materializing
and substantiating the national system of Taiwan, as well as
detaching Taiwan from what Wang claimed is its current meaningless
name of "the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>However, Wu Li-pei, a senior adviser to President Chen Shui-bian,
claimed that genuine materialization of Taiwan's independent
sovereignty did not begin until 1996, when the people of Taiwan
directly elected their president. "Lamentably, " he went on, the
country has continued to use the unrealistic name of the ROC under an
"untrustworthy" constitution authored by people in China more than 80
years ago.</P>
      <P>Wu said that since historical facts "prove" that Taiwan is not a
part of China, there should be a clear distinction between
"independence" and "unification, " meaning that there should be no
question that Taiwan is not an independent nation and that no issue
of "unification with China" should be contemplated by the Taiwan
people.</P>
      <P>Rev. Lo Rong-kuang, a senior minister in the Taiwan Presbyterian
Church, said that Taiwan continues to face diplomatic crisis in the
international community because of the ambiguity of its identity.</P>
      <P>Describing President Chen Shui-bian as the ROC president but not
the president of Taiwan, Lo said the Taiwan people should re-elect
another president who is the "Taiwan president."</P>
      <P>Taiwan would have a good chance of joining the United Nations if
it were called Taiwan, Lo claimed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT PROPOSES COMMUNICATION FRAMEWORK BASED ON '92 CONSENSUS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing, April 29 (CNA)
(By Lin Yi-fong and S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan proposed to his Chinese hosts Friday that for the sake of
long-term peace and prosperity, both sides should build a "framework
of communications" based on the so-called "1992 consensus."</P>
      <P>The consensus has been categorically denied by Taiwan's ruling
Democratic Progressive Party, but Lien claimed that such a consensus
does exist and it means both sides agreed there is only one China,
but the interpretation of what "one China" actually means is up to
each side.</P>
      <P>Lien, speaking during a historic meeting with General Secretary
Hu Jintao of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said that the "1992
consensus" was reached only after hard efforts by both sides and that
it is "unfortunate" its meaning has been twisted over the past few
years.</P>
      <P>But he expressed confidence that as long as both sides can cast
aside their bitter historical differences and turn the past "vicious
cycle" into a "benevolent cycle, " the people on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait will be able to jointly create a bright future for
themselves.</P>
      <P>Echoing Hu's remarks, Lien said it is pointless to continue
KMT-CPC confrontations of more than half a century. Instead, he said,
both sides should demonstrate genuine goodwill toward each other in
seeking rapprochement and dialogue based on mutual trust, for the
sake of the long-term interests of the people.</P>
      <P>Lien quoted Sun Yat-sen's will, saying: "Peace, struggle and save
China" has not become invalid with the passage of time, "and I still
am a believer in Dr. Sun's instruction."</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks welcoming Lien and his KMT delegation, Hu
repeatedly mentioned Sun, the founder of the Republic of China who
died in 1925 in Beijing, praising him as a "great patriot and
national hero" who led the Chinese in a democratic revolution and
dedicated his life to promoting nationalism, freedom and democracy,
the people's wellbeing, and national unity and prosperity.</P>
      <P>According to Hu, members of the CPC have always been "staunch
supporters, cooperators and inheritors" of Sun's grand revolution
enterprise, while Sun himself looked upon the CPC as "a good friend."</P>
      <P>In spite of the complexity and volatility of the situation in the
Taiwan Strait, Hu said, both the CPC and the KMT fully realize the
true wishes of the people and are determined to "take aggressive
action" to demonstrate to the world that Chinese on both sides of the
strait "have the ability and the wisdom to solve their own
contradictions and problems."</P>
      <P>The KMT's current visit and ensuing exchanges and dialogue have
"injected a fresh air of spring" into cross-strait relations, which
are bound to improve with the joint efforts of both sides, Hu said.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian ruled out the
possibility Friday of Taiwan signing a Closer Economic Partnership
Arrangement (CEPA) pact with China, saying that such a move would
denigrate's Taiwan sovereign status and make it a "second Hong Kong."</P>
      <P>Quoting media reports, Chen said "some people" are planning to
push China to sign a CEPA with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The proposal is unacceptable because signing such an agreement
would downgrade Taiwan to a special administrative region under China
like Hong Kong," Chen said, adding that Taiwan would be "thankful so
long as China could stop opposing other countries signing free trade
agreements (FTAs) with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen made the remarks while receiving a group of pro-Taiwan
parliamentarians of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ).</P>
      <P>Under the World Trade Organization (WTO) framework, Chen said,
China should sign a free trade agreement with Taiwan, not a CEPA pact
like the one it has signed with Hong Kong and Macau. Both Taiwan and
China are WTO members.</P>
      <P>While China is not expected to sign an FTA with Taiwan in the
foreseeable future, Chen said he is hopeful that Beijing can at least
refrain from opposing the United States and Japan signing FTAs with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan-Japan relations, Chen said he was grateful for
the DPJ's concern about China's recent enactment of its
anti-secession law that codifies the use of non-peaceful means
against Taiwan. The DPJ has passed a resolution pushing the Japanese
government to voice its concern the legislation.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed his gratitude for the inclusion of the Taiwan
Strait peace as a common strategic goal during a U.S.-Japan security
cooperation meeting earlier this year and for Japan's public
opposition to a European Union plan to lift its arms embargo against
China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said he hopes Japan will continue to support
Taiwan's bid to join the World Health Assembly (WHA) -- the
decision-making body of the World Health Organization -- as an
observer when the world health promotion body holds its annual
congress in Geneva next month. Japan voted for Taiwan's WHA bid last
year, but the bid was blocked by China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'PAN-GREENS' ACCUSE KMT CHAIRMAN OF CURRYING CHINA'S FAVOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "pan-green camp" of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and opposition Taiwan Solidarity
Union (TSU) accused opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan
Friday of currying favor with China by giving a speech full of what
they called "greater China nationalism" at Peking University earlier
that day.</P>
      <P>According to DPP Secretary-General Lee Yi-yang, Lien will "pay
the price" for trampling on Taiwan's democratic development and
betraying mainstream public opinion in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien claimed in his speech that Taiwan's democracy is threatened
by a rising trend of populism in the nation, while its people's
well-being is at stake because of a pro-independence movement trying
to draft a new constitution and change the official name of the
country.</P>
      <P>Lee said the DPP despises Lien's flattery of China for its
economic development and political reform, disregarding the despotic
nature of the Chinese communist regime.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Lee said, Lien was denigrating and sneering at
the democratic development of Taiwan, which Lee said has disgraced
both Lien himself and the KMT.</P>
      <P>DPP legislators dismissed Lien's speech as disappointing and
regrettable, alleging that Lien, instead of asserting Taiwan's
identity, treated China as his motherland and considered the DPP
government his enemy.</P>
      <P>Chao Yung-ching, convener of the DPP legislative caucus, said he
wonders if Lien identifies with the Republic of China or the People's
Republic of China when he kept emphasizing his connection with and
aspiration for China, without mentioning a word about China's
long-time military threat and international isolation of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TSU lawmakers accused Lien of allying with the Chinese
communists to sell out Taiwan.</P>
      <P>While advocating the "greater China nationalism, " Lien was
suppressing the Taiwanese identity and defaming the democratic
development of Taiwan, they said.</P>
      <P>Disagreeing with the DPP and TSU, the legislative caucus convener
of the opposition People First Party, Lee Yung-ping, said the people
of both Taiwan and China are "Chinese" in a broad sense and that it
was very appropriate for Lien to appeal to the national sentiment in
his speech.</P>
      <P>Like the KMT, the PFP opposes a confrontation of Taiwan's
nationalism with China's nationalism, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Cho Po-yuan, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus, claimed that
Lien's speech has sown the seeds of democracy and freedom in China
and will facilitate the development of a win-win situation across the
strait.</P>
      <P>Cho said Lien emphasized in his speech the democratic development
of Taiwan that began with the lifting of martial law in 1987 and
urged the "pan-green camp" to stop making "unfounded accusations"
against Lien.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan has
done himself justice during his present visit to China, Taipei Mayor
Ma Ying-jeou, who is also a vice chairman of the main opposition
party, said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks during a lunch gathering with a dozen
township and village chiefs from across Taiwan in Fengyuan City, in
central Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lien's visit has been warmly accepted by the Chinese
people, Ma said that he strongly believes that Lien's trip will help
reduce hostility and create amicability between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>As Lien particularly underscored the Republic of China --
Taiwan's official title -- in Nanjing while signing a memorial after
paying tribute to ROC founding father Sun Yat-sen at his mausoleum,
Ma noted that Lien properly took the opportunity to display the
Taiwan identity and voiced the hope for peace between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Peace should take precedence over all other matters and it is
extremely important to help push for long-term stability across the
strait, Ma said, adding that Lien's efforts to initiate the
peace-making drive will be recorded in history.</P>
      <P>"Everything will be in vain if peace is not maintained, " he
stressed.</P>
      <P>Voicing his belief that Beijing will not be willing to launch war
to settle cross-strait disputes, Ma said the ROC will be the largest
common ground shared by the two sides when seeking to mend their
differences.</P>
      <P>Lien departed for China April 26 on what he dubbed a historic
"journey of peace" that will run through May 3 -- marking the first
contact between the KMT and the Communist Party of China (CPC) in
nearly 60 years since 1949, when the KMT retreated to Taiwan after
losing a civil war to the Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>Lien gave a speech Friday morning at the prestigious Peking
University and met CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao later the same
day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRIVATE SECTOR CAN PIONEER TAIWAN-CHINA COMMON MARKET: KMT HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Lin I-fung and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The concept of a common market is a
flexible way to further promote mutually beneficial economic ties
between Taiwan and China, and the private sector can help clear the
way if the governments of the two sides remain skeptical of the idea,
visiting Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan said Friday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks at a news conference after speaking with
Communist Party of China (CPC) General Secretary Hu Jintao and
releasing a five-point communique.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that finding ways to help economic cooperation
across the Taiwan Strait was the main topic during his discussion
with Hu, Lien said that both sides hope to better cooperation. But if
government authorities are uncertain about the issue, the private
sector can take the lead to help open the way, he proposed.</P>
      <P>Since a common market is a flexible concept to bolster bilateral
economic links, Lien said that Hu agreed with him on promoting
Taiwan-China exchanges based on this model.</P>
      <P>Judging from the current cross-strait situation, it is more
important for the two sides to "create peace, enhance development and
enjoy prosperity," he said.</P>
      <P>But the KMT chief made it clear that it is fully up to the
government to decide while commenting on his agreement with Hu
whether or not to set up a cross-strait peace-promoting structure,
including establishing a military trust mechanism to avoid conflict.</P>
      <P>Now is a good time to end confrontation and angst between Taiwan
and China, and the government has all the power to decide whether or
not it wants security and peace, he said, adding that "let bygones be
bygones" and "we should seize the present and look to the future."</P>
      <P>The Lien-Hu meeting was historic in that it was the first time
since 1949 that top leaders of the two rival political parties had
faced each other. Taiwan and China came under separate rule after the
KMT was defeated by the CPC in a civil war on the Chinese mainland
and fled to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien departed for China April 26 for what the KMT called a
"journey of peace" through May 3 to help ease tensions between Taiwan
and China amid fierce opposition among supporters of the
pro-independence ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan
Solidarity Union.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR CALM OVER LIEN'S CHINA VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh urged the public
Friday to look at Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's visit to
China as "nothing unusual, " but many in the "green camp" apparently
do not want to miss a chance to blast the opposition leader.</P>
      <P>Many people in Taiwan are visiting China these days, and many
things will just disappear after five minutes of enthusiasm, as the
fad of buying egg tarts was a few years ago, said the premier in
Kaohsiung. He suggested that people not discuss it deliberately, and
"just let it be."</P>
      <P>But Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Su Tseng-chang,
DPP and Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) caucuses in the Legislative
Yuan, and other politicians in the "pan-green camp" would not "let
him be."</P>
      <P>Su criticized Lien as being "absurd" for talking about "uniting
with the Chinese Communists" in a speech at Beijing University and
for recognizing "one China" in a meeting with Communist Party of
China General Secretary Hu Jintao, also president of China.</P>
      <P>For the last three generations, Su said, the Lien family has been
prominent in Taiwan's ruling class and Lien himself has had an easy
life as a high official and is a rich man, and as a retired vice
president is still enjoying a fat government pension that produces 18
percent in annual interest.</P>
      <P>Now Lien is denying Taiwan's democracy and cultural diversity
simply because he has lost two presidential elections, Su said. "How
can he return the favor of the Taiwan people?"</P>
      <P>Li Yi-yang, DPP secretary-general, said Lien will be "spit at and
dumped" by the people of Taiwan for trampling Taiwan's democracy and
sacrificing Taiwan's national sovereignty.</P>
      <P>William C.T. Lai, secretary-general of the DPP legislative
caucus, accused Lien of trying to evade his legal responsibility by
issuing a "joint press communique" with Hu that called for resuming
cross-strait talks and reaching a peace pact, matters that affect
governmental power.</P>
      <P>Lien's insistence on the so-called "1992 consensus, " which Lai
claims does not exist, will spark much controversy in Taiwan, Lai
said. He said he fears that controversies over independence or
unification, over the existence or non-existence of the "1992
consensus, " over protecting government authority or stripping it,
will push Taiwan's political circles to the edge of an abyss of war
of words.</P>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the TSU, a minority party in alliance
with the DPP on the political spectrum, went further by accusing Lien
of "betraying Taiwan" by recognizing the "1992 consensus" and "one
China."</P>
      <P>Ho Min-hao, deputy convener of the TSU legislative caucus, vowed
that people will stage a "firm but peaceful" protest against Lien
upon his return on May 3.</P>
      <P>TSU Legislator Lo Chih-ming was concerned that Lien and Hu talked
for an hour-and-a-half behind closed doors this afternoon, an act of
"betrayal of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Lee An-ni, daughter of former president Lee Teng-hui, ridiculed
Lien for " having felt like a president in China, " a dream he has
failed to realize over the past five years.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  29 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Minister of the Department of
Health (DOH) Twu Shiing-jer won a damage suit Friday that he filed
more than two years ago after being wrongly accused of sexual
harassment.</P>
      <P>According to the Taipei District Court's ruling, the defendants,
Legislator Diana Lee and Taipei citizen Cheng Ke-jung, should pay Twu
NT$600,000 (US$19,000) with interest as compensation for damaging his
reputation.</P>
      <P>Twu had demanded NT$48.75 million (US$1.56 million) , claiming
that the accusation against him in October, 2002, caused enormous
harm and untold losses for him, while a huge amount of social
resources were wasted after the media used a great deal of manpower
and money to follow the case.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, the district court judge found that Lee and Cheng had
besmirched the Twu's reputation when Lee held a news conference to
accuse Twu of forcibly kissing Cheng and licking his ear in a Taipei
KTV Aug. 6, 2002, without first finding out if there was any truth to
the allegation.</P>
      <P>As it turned out, the head of the DOH personnel department was
the culprit in the incident. His surname is Tu, which is pronounced
the same as Twu.</P>
      <P>In response to the verdict, Lee said in a news release that she
regrets the result and will appeal.</P>
      <P>Lee said that being a lawmaker, it's her duty to fight for the
public's benefit and do whatever it takes to help ordinary people air
their grievances and obtain justice.</P>
      <P>She said that she had in fact looked into the allegation before
calling the news conference to condemn Twu. Although later she was
proved to be wrong due to what she referred to as a series of
"coincidences, " Lee said she was right about the fact that someone
did harass Cheng sexually, and the real offender was sentenced to
seven months' imprisonment.</P>
      <P>She publicly apologized for the mistake and for making Twu and
his family suffer soon after finding out that she had fingered the
wrong person, Lee said, adding given the fact that she had helped
bring the real offender to justice, she was cleared of criminal
charges.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan was
duped by his Chinese hosts into debasing Taiwan without gaining
anything in return in his discussion with Chinese President Hu
Jintao, the head of a local think tank declared Friday.</P>
      <P>Chen Po-chih, chairman of Taiwan Thinktank, said after watching
Lien's televised new conference in Beijing that none of the points
reached by Lien and Hu, including Beijing's promise to help Taiwan
join the World Health Assembly, agricultural cooperation between
Taiwan and the mainland, and the creation of a common market across
the Taiwan Strait, could be realized in the next two or three
decades.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Chen said, for these unrealistic pies in the sky,
Lien has debased his country by groveling to China for help in
Taiwan's World Health Assembly (WHA) bid.</P>
      <P>As a sovereign state, Chen said, Taiwan does not need to seek
China's assistance for its WHA bid, the country can do this by
itself. Instead of asking for Beijing's help, Chen said Lien should
tell China to stop blocking Taiwan's efforts to join international
organizations.</P>
      <P>Chen dismissed Lien as being ignorant in coming to an
understanding with Hu on a common market between Taiwan and China,
saying that a common market means a market within which goods and
workers can move freely. This is unimaginable even in China now, let
alone across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Citing as an example, Chen said in China, people can only go and
work in the special economic zone of Shenzhen after gaining
government approval.</P>
      <P>Chen asked how it would be possible for China to work with Taiwan
in creating a market that cannot even exist on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lien should keep his feet firmly on the ground and talk with his
Chinese hosts on issues that can be solved in the near future rather
than have his head in the clouds and promise the moon, Chen said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien
Chan's making mockery of Taiwan's young democracy in his speech at
Peking University Friday morning was distasteful and completely
lacking in tact, a ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmaker
said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Julian J. Kuo was referring to Lien's remarks in his
40-minute speech that the KMT opposes populism taking the place of
democracy in Taiwan, the writing of a new constitution, rectification
of the nation's title and the formulation of a timetable for Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>In the civilized world, Kuo said, few sensible politicians would
deride their domestic political foes or scorn their own countries
abroad.</P>
      <P>"We all know that former U.S. President Bill Clinton dislikes
serving U.S. President George W. Bush. But Clinton would never be
likely to make a mockery of Bush in a public speech in China, " Kuo
said, adding that he hopes opposition People First Party Chairman
James Soong does not repeat such a distasteful mistake during his May
5-12 China trip.</P>
      <P>In his speech and a news statement issued after his discussion
with Chinese President Hu Jintao Friday afternoon, Lien twice
mentioned that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reached a "one
China, different interpretations" consensus in 1992, which he said
served as a basis for the ice-breaking Koo-Wang meeting in 1993.
However, Lien said he deplored that the so-called "1992 consensus"
has been distorted in recent years and that the KMT will join with
the Communist Party of China (CPC) to check pro-independence forces.</P>
      <P>"Lien's remarks were inappropriate. Independence is Taiwan' s
bargaining chip. Otherwise, Beijing authorities would not have
offered Lien such high-level treatment during his current trip. Lien
can say he is opposed to Taiwan independence or he supports the '1992
consensus.' But he should not have said that the KMT would join the
CPC to check pro-independence forces in Taiwan. Such an overture
could be interpreted as attempting to join the CPC to check the
pro-independence DPP. It's tantamount to 'colluding' with foreign
enemy forces to check domestic competitors. It's an outrageous
overture," Kuo said.</P>

U.S. President George W. Bush called Thursday night for cutting

Social Security benefits for future retirees to put the system

on sound financial footing, and he proposed doing so in a way

that would demand the most sacrifice from higher-income people

while insulating low- income workers. Saying the retirement

program is he aded for " bankruptcy, " Bush edged tentatively -

but for the first time explicitly - into the most politically

explosive aspect of the debate over how to assure Social

Security's long-term health: the benefit cuts or tax increases

needed to balance the system's books as the baby boom

generation ages and life expectancy increases.

Wall Street Journal: Drilling for Natural Gas Faces A Sizable
Hurdle: Fort Worth

The U.S.'s largest natural gas field lies under 1.6 Million
People underneath Fort Worth, Texas. The Barnett Shale formation is a
wedge of blackboar d-colored rock measuring 400 feet thick in places.
It's packed with 27 trillion cubic feet of natural gas made from
organic material that decomposed several million years ago, according
to government scientists. That's enough to supply all gas- heated
homes in the U.S. for more than five years. While it's directly
underneath a metropolitan area home to 1.6 million people, extracting
this gas is creating a peculiar set of challenges for energy
companies and for the consumers whose properties lie above it.</TEXT>

      <P>Admitting that the MAC has no idea what was raised during Lien's
close-door meeting with Hu, Wu said his office may have to call on
Lien's party or ask Lien's aides to explain the KMT chairman's
discussion with Hu after Lien returns.</P>
      <P>Wu said the government was especially disappointed by the fact
that Lien, in his talks with Hu, confirmed the existence of a
consensus between Taiwan and China on the so-called "one China
principle" in 1992 despite the fact that President Chen Shui-bian
specifically told him before his trip that the government does not
believe such a meeting of the minds was ever reached.</P>
      <P>Also, Wu said, the government was disappointed with Lien's
failure to convey to his Chinese host the government's views,
including the existence of the Republic of China, Taiwan's desire to
join international organization with dignity, local people's
resentment toward the Chinese Anti-Secession Law, and the valuable
democracy and freedoms that exist in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Exchanges with China should not run counter to the law, and no
party can be exempted from this, Wu said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHINA URGED TO TALK WITH ROC PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, April 29 (CNA)
(By Oliver Lin and P.C. Tang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China should engage in a dialogue with
President Chen Shui-bian and his Cabinet, since only that can help
find a long-term resolution of cross-Taiwan Strait differences, the
U.S. State Department deputy spokesman said Friday.</P>
      <P>Adam Ereli made the comments while responding to questions raised
at a press briefing regarding a "five-point statement" made by
Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan and Chinese
President Hu Jintao during their meeting held that same day in
Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lien, at the head of a 30-member KMT delegation, arrived in China
Tuesday for an eight-day four-city visit.</P>
      <P>Declining to respond to the specific points raised at the Lien-Hu
meeting, Ereli noted that the United States has made clear its views
and policy on cross-strait contacts and that dialogue is in the
interests of both sides to achieve a peaceful resolution of their
differences in a manner that is acceptable to both.</P>
      <P>"That is how we view -- that is the context in which we view this
ongoing visit," he said.</P>
      <P>Talking about the importance of a dialogue between Beijing and
Taipei, Ereli said: "We urge Beijing to reach out to President Chen
Shui-bian and his Cabinet, and we note that any long-term solution to
cross-strait differences can only be found if Beijing negotiates with
the duly elected leadership of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Asked whether Washington endorses agreements reached by Lien and
Hu on a resumption of talks based on the so-called "92
consensus, " the deputy spokesman said that Lien's visit is "notable
and important."</P>
      <P>In response to a question regarding whether the intent of Lien's
visit was to undercut Chen, Ereli pointed out that he cannot speak
for the KMT head and that the United States look at the visit as "an
opportunity to pursue dialogue, which is in the interest of both
sides."</P>
      <P>Touching on whether China's reaching out to Taiwan's opposition
parties might become a matter for Washington's concern that the new
development across the strait will be out of
U.S. control, Ereli noted that the development is already not
under U.S. control.</P>
      <P>"It's a process that we can support, it's a process that we can
encourage, and it's a process that we can try to help the sides work
toward. But it clearly requires a will and initiative and steps that
they take themselves. It's not something that we can control or
force, although we can certainly lend our influence and our voice to
help move things in that direction," he said.</P>
      <P>As to whether the United States wants to see Taiwan absorbed by
China, Ereli said: "We want an outcome that reflects a resolution
that is acceptable to people on both sides."</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN `INFALLIBLE' IN CROSS-STRAIT GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The legislative caucus of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) claimed Saturday that Taiwan will
"never fail" if the two sides of the Taiwan Strait engage in
government-to-government dialogue.</P>
      <P>William Lai, DPP caucus whip in the Legislative Yuan, was
responding to urging by the United States that China start a dialogue
with President Chen Shui-bian and Taiwan's ruling party.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that such cross-strait dialogue would conform with the
interests of the United States and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He said that the United States sees China as the biggest factor
in peace and safety in the Asia-Pacific region, with Taiwan as the
key force in maintaining regional peace and safety.
</P>
      <P>If China, taking advantage of the weakness of opposition parties
for political gains, succeeds in its "united front" tactics, then
either there will be an unstable Taiwan or China will achieve its end
of unifying Taiwan -- both of which are developments that would not
be welcomed by the United States, he claimed.</P>
      <P>Lai said that Chen was elected by the people, with the people
behind him, that cross-strait government-to-government talks would
foil Beijing's attempts to splinter Taiwan, and that "Taiwan will not
fail."</P>
      <P>He also lambasted a meeting between Lien Chan, chairman of
Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) , and Hu Jintao, Chinese
president and general secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) , in Beijing Friday in which they agreed to set up a platform
for communication between the KMT and the CPC in a five-point news
bulletin released after the talks.</P>
      <P>Lai noted that the DPP has long suspected a KMT-CPC cooperation
trilogy -- the first being a Lien-Hu meeting, the second being an
exchange of offices, and the third being the signing of a peace and
trade agreement.</P>
      <P>Lien only adjusted the "exchange of offices" part to a
"communication platform, " and changed the "agreement" to a "news
bulletin" for fear of violating Taiwan law, Lai claimed.</P>
      <P>If the KMT, joining forces with other opposition parties to form
a majority in the legislature, sets up a party-to-party communication
platform, then China could bypass the government altogether,
according to Lai.</P>
      <P>If the KMT then pressures the DPP administration to accept its
so-called "1992 consensus" -- meaning different interpretations
across the Taiwan Strait on the meaning of "one China" -- as a
premise for reopening bipartisan dialogue, clearing the budget and
other prioritized proposals, then there will be no end to fighting in
Taiwan politics and the nation will be "bound to go under, " Lai
warned.</P>

      <P>The White House reiterated Friday its

    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. expert on cross-Taiwan Strait

Chan's remarks made during his current China visit have opened
another option to the future of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Alan Romberg, senior associate of the Washington, D.C.-based

Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>In a five-point statement issued by Lien and Chinese President Hu

their stances of sticking to the "92 consensus."</P>
      <P>Pointing out that Hu and Lien were careful to acknowledge that
the statement was an inter-party rather than a
government-to-government issue, Romberg said it seems that the KMT
head wants to defy President Chen Shui-bian to see whether the DPP,
"in the interests of the Taiwan people, " will put the Lien-Hu
consensus into practice.</P>
      <P>Romberg predicted, however, that the DPP will say with certainty
that the KMT leader has betrayed the interests of Taiwan and will

    <HEADLINE>KMT CHAIRMAN'S TALKS WITH CHINESE LEADER `INSUBSTANTIAL': VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April  30  (CNA)
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu Saturday
criticized opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan's talks
with Communist Party of China (CPC) General Secretary and Chinese
President Hu Jintao a day earlier, describing them as
"insubstantial."</P>
      <P>In a speech at a Lions Club meeting in Taipei, Lu said the
discussion of cross-Taiwan Strait peace between Lien and Hu might
sound pleasant to the ears, but she claimed it contained nothing
substantial, with Lien not even demanding that China remove its
missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It would be more meaningful if President Chen Shui-bian were to
hold talks with Hu, witnessed by the United Nations, Lu pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that Chen has insisted that cross-strait talks must be
conducted under the principles of peace, equality and dignity, none
of which she said was followed by Lien during his visit to China.</P>
      <P>In an introduction before Lien's speech at Peking University
Friday, the host did not mention Lien's former positions as Republic
of China premier and vice president, while Lien also avoided the term
"Republic of China" except for one occasion when he visited the
mausoleum of ROC founding father Sun Yat-sen in Nanjing, Lu pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Lu said she had expected Lien, as the leader of a party that
claims it is safeguarding the ROC against Beijing's attempts to
exterminate the country, to speak more of the term and even to bring
some ROC flags to China.</P>
      <P>Further expressing her disapproval of Lien's claim that Taiwan's
democratic development is taking an unwelcome twist toward populism
and his call for people to identify with "this country" at Peking
University, Lu said she wonders which country Lien was referring to
and if Lien agrees with Beijing that "Taiwan is part of China."</P>
      <P>She also dismissed the so-called "1992 consensus" on the "one
China" principle mentioned in a news statement released after the
Lien-Hu talks as non-existent.</P>
      <P>Lu recalled that Beijing asked Taipei to accept its "one China"
principle during talks held in Hong Kong in 1992 during the rule of
the former KMT government, but Taipei instead proposed that both
sides be allowed to interpret the meaning of "one China" differently.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lien has refused to address Chen as "president" since
his first inauguration in 2000, Lu accused him of deliberately
undermining the Democratic Progressive Party government, dividing the
people of Taiwan, downgrading the status of the country and confusing
international perception of the cross-strait situation during his
China trip.</P>
      <P>She reminded the KMT that its past cooperation with the CPC led
to its loss of power in China, which forced the party to flee to
Taiwan in 1949, and urged people to learn from history.</P>
      <P>She stressed that the ROC is an independent, sovereign state
whose fate must be determined by its 23 million people and that China
must remove its missiles and military facilities targeting Taiwan
before the two sides can start negotiations.</P>
      <P>If Beijing is sincere about improving cross-strait relations, it
should show its goodwill by allowing Taiwan to join international
organizations such as the World Health Organization on an equal
footing with China, she added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Cross-Taiwan Strait consultations must be
conducted through the respective governments or channels commissioned
by the governments of each side if the issues involve government
authority, the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairman Su Tseng-chang made the remarks after main
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chan met with Hu Jintao,
China's president and general secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), Friday in Beijing and issued a five-point consensus
after the talks.</P>
      <P>Su claimed that while China made no concessions during the
meeting, Lien made too many concessions.</P>
      <P>The "five-point" consensus has the so-called "1992 consensus" --
meaning different interpretations on the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait on the definition of "one China" -- as its premise, which is
an affront to the will of the Taiwan people, according to Su, whose
party does not even accept that the "92 consensus" exists.</P>
      <P>The KMT-CPC consensus gives Taiwan up to a framework set by
China, Su claimed.</P>
      <P>Noting that Lien failed to propagate democratic values in
totalitarian China but instead mocked Taiwan's burgeoning democracy,
Su described as "outrageous" Lien's remarks in a speech at Peking
University Friday that the KMT opposes populism taking the place of
democracy in Taiwan, the writing of a new constitution, changing the
nation's official title and the formulation of a timetable for Taiwan
independence.</P>
      <P>"What's more deplorable is that the KMT failed to express to
China the antagonism of Taiwan people toward China's recent enactment
of the anti-secession law," Su said, which he claimed is "doing a big
favor to China, cushioning the negative impact of the law and helping
to realize China's aim of splintering Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Su said that Lien should report to the government about the
content of his talks with Hu after his return to Taiwan May 3, lest
Taiwan remains in the dark even as it is being sold out to the
communists by Lien and the KMT.</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Cheng Wen-tsang said the KMT is dancing to the tune
of the CPC and has not solicited any good for Taiwan.
Instead, he claimed, it has fallen into the CPC's trap by endorsing
the anti-secession law, which he said has undermined the "solidarity"
of Taiwan.
</P>
      <P>He said that only the popularly elected government has
representation and authority and that anything involving sovereignty
and government authority can only be negotiated by the governments on
either side of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The DPP opposes the opposition's approach to "bypassing the
government and sovereignty issues, " as such an approach is
"self-denial" and undermines Taiwan's sovereignty and the fact of the
existence of the Republic of China, Cheng said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT HAPPY TO SEE U.S. PRODDING CHINA TO TALK WITH PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is happy
to see that the United States is urging China to start a dialogue
with President Chen Shui-bian, a KMT legislative caucus whip said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Cho Po-yuan said it is quite a positive proposal that will help
improve cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Cho made the remarks amid reports that the White House and the
U.S. State Department would welcome dialogue between China and Taiwan
leaders, and that Beijing should move toward expanding dialogue to
ruling party leaders rather than merely opposition figures.</P>
      <P>According to Cho, this shows that the easing of cross-Taiwan
Strait tension, the establishment of a communication platform and
avoidance of war are not only the aspirations of people on either
side of the strait but also the aspirations of the international
community.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) should realize that
cross-strait peace is "a world trend" and cast aside its rigid
ideology, Cho said, adding that "we need to understand our friends,
but need more to understand our enemies."</P>
      <P>Referring to a five-point consensus reached between KMT Chairman
Lien Chan and Hu Jintao, China's president and general secretary of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) after their talks in Beijing
Friday, Cho said it will require bipartisan consultations if the
consensus is to be carried out.</P>
      <P>The five tasks that the KMT and the CPC agreed to promote include
a resumption of cross-strait talks, termination of cross-strait
hostility, all-out cross-strait economic exchanges, Taiwan's
participation in international affairs, and the establishment of a
regular party-to-party communication platform.</P>

      <P>A group aimed at promoting sport among
Taiwan's female citizens, boosting the level of development of women
and sport, and enhancing women's rights in the field of sport and
physical activities, which is dominated by men in Taiwan, was
formally set up Saturday.</P>
      <P>The first chairwoman of the Taiwan Association of Women and Sport
(TAWS), Legislator Hsiao Bi-khim of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, said that she hopes the organization will help with the
development of women in sport.</P>
      <P>Many authorities and sporting celebrities took part in the
inauguration ceremony, including Chen Chuan-shou, minister of the
National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, Huang Ta-chou,
chairman of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee, Etsuko Ogasawara,
co-chairwoman of the International Working Group on Women and Sports,
Chi Cheng, Asia's top female track and field athlete of the 20th
century, and Sun Shu-fang, general manager of ESPN Star Sports in
Greater China.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, Hsiao said there is insufficient public
space in Taiwan for women to play sports or engage in physical
exercise and she expressed hope that the new organization will help
boost the number of female athletes in Taiwan, promote and facilitate
the development of opportunities for women in sport.</P>
      <P>Citing the Olympic Games as an example, Huang said the number of
local female athletes in international competitions accounts for 53
percent of the Taiwan competitors on average. Despite this majority,
female athletes do not enjoy equivalent attention and support, he
noted, suggesting that more efforts be made to improve the
environment for women and sport.</P>
      <P>One of the TAWS's goals is to seek the right to host the Asia
Conference on Women and Sport in 2007 as part of its efforts to lead
the region's development in women and sport.</P>

      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive

Assembly election biked along the Love River in the southern city of
Kaohsiung Saturday to elicit voter support.</P>
      <P>Chao Wen-chuo, head of the DPP's Kaohsiung chapter explained that
campaigning by bicycle is aimed at demonstrating the party's vitality
and declaring his party's determination to lead Taiwan along its own
road, referring to the recent talks between the opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) and the Communist Party of China in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Interpreting the April 29 talks between KMT Chairman Lien Chan

party chooses to stay with the Taiwanese people and he urged voters
around the nation to support the DPP and vote for its candidates in
the upcoming election of the mission-oriented National Assembly.</P>
      <P>Despite widespread voter apathy toward the elections, Chao said
the results will affect the country's constitutional reforms, which
will play a key role in the nation's development. He called on DPP
candidates to win the election in order to give a green light to four
major constitutional amendment proposals adopted by the Legislative
Yuan last August.</P>
      <P>Items in the package include reducing the number of legislative
seats from the present 225 to 113 and adopting a "single seat, two

National Assembly to allow for popular referendums on future
constitutional amendments.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Frank Hsieh expressed hope
Saturday that the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) will display the
same efficiency in promoting legislative bills as has in its talks
with the Chinese leadership.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the sideline of a beach-cleaning activity on
Chinshan, Taipei County, Hsieh was commenting on KMT Chairman Lien
Chan's meeting with Hu Jintao, China's president and general
secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), in Beijing Friday.</P>
      <P>During the Lien-Hu talks, both sides agreed to promote five tasks
-- a resumption of cross-Taiwan Strait talks, an end to cross-strait 
hostility, all-out economic exchanges, Taiwan's participation in
international affairs, and the establishment of a regular
party-to-party communication platform.</P>
      <P>The premier said that the government is already carrying out or
promoting some of the points and added that "the government will
continue to promote things that should be done." But the government
will never act under pressure from the Lien-Hu meeting to implement
anything that is improper or unfavorable for the Taiwan people, he
said.</P>
      <P>"Everything will have the interests of the public as the top
priority concern," he added.</P>
      <P>On the resumption of cross-strait talks, the premier stressed
that this should be the government's business.</P>
      <P>However, from the political viewpoint, he said, the opposition
party should work toward regaining power because only after it
becomes the ruling party will it be able represent the people and the
government in talks with the other side of the strait.</P>
      <P>It is not right for a vanquished political party to conduct
consultations with Beijing, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>But he also said tongue in cheek that he envies the CPC, saying
that it seems that Lien and Hu were able to reach consensus in just
40 or 50 minutes.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the administration's proposal of new 10 major
construction projects and a five-year, NT$500 billion (US$15.87
billion) stimulus plan aimed at propping up the country's sustainable
development have been stalled in the Legislative Yuan for four or
five months, the premier noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must maintain proper defense
capabilities to ensure its security until the termination of
cross-Taiwan Strait military confrontation, opposition Kuomintang
(KMT) lawmakers said Saturday.</P>
      <P>According to Cho Po-yuan, a whip of the KMT legislative caucus,
the establishment of a cross-strait military confidence-building
mechanism proposed by KMT Chairman Lien Chan during talks Friday with
Communist Party of China General Secretary Hu Jintao in Beijing is a
goal that the KMT hopes to achieve to reduce cross-strait hostility
and halt the cross-strait arms race.</P>
      <P>However, this does not mean Taiwan can stop all its arms
procurement plans, Cho said.</P>
      <P>Cho said the KMT will consult with the other parties to trim the
NT$480 billion (US$15.19 billion) arms procurement package proposed
by the Ministry of National Defense to make sure it fits the needs of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The package includes a squadron of 12 P-3C anti-submarine
aircraft, six Patriot PAC-III anti-missile batteries and eight
diesel-electric submarines from the United States.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Shuai Hua-min, who is the former head of the
National Defense Management College, said that while pursuing
cross-strait peace, Taiwan needs to maintain sufficient defense
capabilities to preserve its leverage to negotiate with China.</P>
      <P>Shuai said it is necessary for the country to invest properly in
arms procurement and to avoid any wasteful procurement items.</P>
      <P>According to Shuai, Taiwan and China will have to exchange
dialogue on the military issue sooner or later, depending on the
cross-strait political atmosphere.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's military deployment should be guided by the
concept of "survival is victory" and that the governments on both

    <HEADLINE>PFP HOPES TO PROMOTE CROSS-STRAIT GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP)
unveiled a "four-legged table" theory Saturday prior to the upcoming
visit of party chairman James Soong to China, hoping that the visit
will help promote direct contacts between the governments on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait and eventually lead to the signing of
bilateral agreements.</P>
      <P>PFP officials said the first leg of the theory is based on a
meeting between President Chen Shui-bian and Soong earlier this year
in which they reached a 10-point consensus that included President
Chen's reaffirmation of no declaration of Taiwan independence, no
change of the official title of the nation and no change of the
status quo in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The PFP-initiated cross-strait peace promotion bill, which is yet
to be reviewed by the Legislative Yuan, is the second leg and is
designed to provide a framework for the direction and target of the
cross-strait peace process through cross-party consensus.</P>
      <P>The third leg is the exchange of visits of party leaders on both
sides of the Taiwan Strait, the PFP officials said.</P>
      <P>They said that such visits would allow people and leaders on
either side to comunicante with each other on ideas and concepts that
will mitigate friction and misunderstanding and enhance understanding
so that both sides can find the maximum common ground.</P>
      <P>The fourth leg is direct contacts between the respective
governments on either side of the Taiwan Strait and will eventually
lead to the signing of bilateral agreements, a move that will be
welcomed by the U.S. government.</P>
      <P>PFP officials said that this will allow an overall development of
cross-strait relations, which they say will be "in the best interests
of the people."</P>
      <P>The PFP has already said that since the Feb. 24 Chen-Soong
meeting, Chen has adjusted his independence-tilted policies to spell
out the long-standing ideals of the opposition parties, which makes
"anti-Taiwan independence" the mainstream view of the Taiwan people,
and cross-strait peace as the most favored issue for all parties.</P>
      <P>PFP officials said that Soong's trip, dubbed a "bridge-building
journey, " aims at contributing to cross-strait positive development
through communication with the Communist Party of China.</P>
      <P>But in contrast with the Kuomintang (KMT) , which has taken the
initiative on cross-strait issues in the hope of swaying the
development of Taiwan's cross-strait policy, the PFP will define
itself as the promoter and balancer of cross-strait relations and
will keep Soong's trip moderate and low-profile.</P>
      <P>Soong is scheduled to visit China May 5-12. KMT Chairman Lien
Chan, currently on a four-city tour of China, will return home after
winding up his historic eight-day visit May 3.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMATURE INFANTS FACE HIGH RISK OF GROWTH SLOWNESS: RESEARCH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Domestic research shows that premature
babies with birth weight of under 1,500 grams face a high risk of
slowness in general growth, with some of them even likely to grow up
with the problem of mental retardation.</P>
      <P>In a long-term study conducted by the Premature Baby Foundation
of Taiwan among 138 domestic preemies born with a birth weight of
under 1,500 grams, researchers found that when they reach the age of
eight, one third of the children show lower growth levels in terms of
skull circumference, height, weight, intelligence, movement and
attention than those of their normal counterparts.</P>
      <P>The researchers also found that 8.8 percent of the preemies are
assessed to be mentally retarded at the age of eight, while another
8.8 percent are at the critical point between retarded and normal.</P>
      <P>The two figures are higher than the 2.2 percent and 6.7 percent
seen among normal eight-year-old children, according to the study.</P>
      <P>Pediatrician Tzou Kuo-su of the Taipei Municipal Hospital for
Women and Children said that although the cause of growth slowness
among premature infants is as yet unknown, many foreign and domestic
research results show that the right brain of a preemie functions
more slowly than that of a normal person.</P>
      <P>Therefore, she said, the research explains why a preemie can have
balance problems and difficulty understanding the concepts of space
and graphic representation.</P>
      <P>The podiatrist said that many parents of preemies are only
concerned about their children's physical development and are
reluctant to give their babies follow-up checks after being
discharged from hospital, which she said is mostly the reason why
premature babies miss the golden time for the best treatment for
mental slowness.</P>
      <P>She suggested that parents bring their children back to hospital
for follow-up checks at the age of six months, 12 months, three
years, five years and eight years. Meanwhile, they should also study
how to raise a preemie, the expert added.</P>

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang Chairman Lien
Chan arrived in Xian in northern Shaanxi Province Saturday on the
third leg of his self-styled "journey of peace" to China.</P>
      <P>Lien said upon his arrival at Xian International Airport that he
was excited to return to his birthplace after being away for nearly
60 years.</P>
      <P>"I was born in Xian to Taiwanese parents. I didn't leave this
ancient cultural city until I was eight years old. I have fond
memories of my childhood here," an emotional Lien said.</P>
      <P>Noting that Xian has a rich cultural heritage, Lien said the city
is a symbol of cultural inclusiveness.</P>
      <P>"I hope this spirit can bring inspiration to both sides of the
Taiwan Strait. Cross-strait relations are at a critical juncture and
I believe none of us would like to see this impasse continue
endlessly," Lien said.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, he visited his alma mater, Houcaimen Elementary
School, where he received a red carpet welcome. Six school children
recited a poem to welcome "grandpa Lien's return."</P>
      <P>Lien presented a red envelope stuffed with cash, glassware and
other gifts to his alma mater. Later, he visited the famed Terracotta
Warriors Museum.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, Lien will visit his grandmother's grave before
departing for Shanghai on the last leg of his historic China visit.</P>
      <P>Lien, a former Republic of China premier and vice president, is
the first KMT leader ever to set foot in China since the party fled
to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a bloody civil war to the Chinese
communists.</P>
      <P>He delivered a 40-minute speech at the elite Peking University in
Beijing Friday and held a historic meeting with Chinese President Hu
Jintao. According to a news bulletin issued at the end of the
closed-door Lien-Hu meeting, the KMT and the Communist Party of China
(CPC) will jointly promote an end to cross-strait hostilities,
full-fledged cross-strait trade ties and the establishment of a
military trust mechanism.</P>
      <P>The meeting was the first in nearly 60 years between the leaders
of the KMT and the CPC.</P>
      <P>But the ROC government criticized the meeting, calling Beijing
insincere and saying the talks would not improve frosty relations.</P>
      <P>Lien, heading a large delegation of KMT officials and
journalists, arrived in Nanjing Tuesday to start his high-profile
China journey.</P>
      <P>His visit marks one of the biggest political ironies in the past
decade of dizzying change in Taiwan -- one of Asia's most dynamic
democracies. Violent clashes erupted between supporters and opponents
of Lien's China trip at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport prior

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  April 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan feels no goodwill on the reported
willingness of China to help Taiwan join the World Health Assembly
(WHA) , the decision-making arm of the World Health Organization
(WHO), local medical experts claimed Saturday.</P>
      <P>They were responding to reports that main opposition Kuomintang
Chairman Lien Chan and Hu Jintao, China's president and general
secretary of the Communist Party of China, reached a five-point
consensus after talks in Beijing Friday that says China will make
Taiwan's participation in WHO activities a priority, but the premise
will be to "promote the resumption of cross-strait talks" first.</P>
      <P>The medical experts claimed that China has nothing but slogans
and said they feel no goodwill in the words. They urged the people of
Taiwan not to harbor any false hopes on China's offer.</P>
      <P>Wu Shu-ming, chairman of the Foundation of Medical
Professionals Alliance in Taiwan, said it is the basic right of
Taiwan to join the WHO and it should not be traded in any form of
conditions.</P>
      <P>Faced with this "lip service" from Beijing, Taiwan should know
that it cannot hinge its expectations on joining the WTO upon
assistance from Beijing, he claimed.</P>
      <P>The 58th WHA conference is scheduled to be held in Geneva May
16-25. Taiwan has since 1997 solicited to become a WHA
observer, but has suffered setbacks every year because of
Beijing's opposition.</P>
      <P>Wu said it is high time the government changed its mindset for
future strategy and suggested that as the biggest hurdle is China,
then Taiwan might as well work toward joining the WHO rather than the
WHA.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-hsiu, director of the Department of International 
Cooperation under the Department of Health, said that if China really
wants to extend an olive branch, it should promote Taiwan's
WHA participation.</P>
      <P>Any suggestions that Taiwan should join the WHA in the name of
private group or non-governmental organization is not under
consideration, he said.</P>
      <P>"The government's stance is clear -- we'll join the WHA without
undermining the nation's dignity," he added.</P>
      <P>After the United States and Japan expressed their support for
Taiwan's bid to join the WHA, the attitude of the 25-member European
Union will play a key role, Chang said, adding that the DOH is
actively lobbying for the support of E.U. members.</P>
      <P>The DOH will continue to request that its allies support Taiwan's
bid, and is optimistic about joining the WHO this year, he claimed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
expressed regrets Saturday over the U.S. inclusion of Taiwan in its
"Special 301" blacklist of copyright violators.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) office released its 2005
"Special 301" report on the adequacy and effectiveness of protection
for intellectual property Friday, in which Taiwan continues to rank
in the "watch list." The report was based on an annual review un der
the section of U.S. law for which it is named.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said Taiwan has made strenuous efforts over the
past year to crack down on commercial piracy and improve intellectual
property rights (IPR) protection.</P>
      <P>The USTR "Special 301" report recognizes Taiwan's progress in IPR
protection, including tightened law enforcement, completing revisions
to the Copyrights Law and the Medical Service Law, installing an IPR
police corps to enhance operational efficinecy, and strengthened
personnel training.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, the USTR report says, Taiwan's streamlined
law enforcement helped reduce American firms' financial losses from
piracy to an estimated US$315.5 million in 2004 from ahigh of
US$847.9 million in 2002.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the report says, there is still room for Taiwan to
improve law enforcement in Internet copyrights infringement,
circulation of pirated commercial software and exports of pirated or
counterfeit goods.</P>
      <P>MOEA officials said they will continue to coordinate with other
relevant government agencies in crackdown on commercial piracy and
IPR protection and keep the USTR informed of Taiwan's efforts in the
field in the hope of having the nation removed from the "Special 301"
watch list as early as possible.</P>
      <P>The USTR uses a three-step warning list to designate countries
according to the degree of abuses.</P>
      <P>China ranks in the "priority watch" list this year. The "priority
watch" list is the second most serious of the three, below the
"Priority Foreign Countries, " which China was listed on in 1994 but
then removed after striking a bilateral agreement with the US
government.</P>
      <P>Among the 36 trading partners on the "watch list" -- which
entails "bilateral attention to address underlying IPR problems" --
were South Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEF URGES 'TAISHANG' TO PAY MORE HEED TO PERSONAL SAFETY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan business people operating in China,
known locally as "taishang, " should pay more heed to their own
personal safety as well as investment risks, the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The quasi-official intermediary body made the call after three
"taishang" in Wujiang in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu were
injured by gangsters earlier this week.</P>
      <P>SEF Secretary-General Liu Teh-hsun said two of them were
seriously injured and the third one sustained only minor injuries.
All of the three are now in stable conditions after surgical
operations and treatment, Liu added.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the injured didn't have any business disputes
in China nor were they acquainted with the attackers.</P>
      <P>Noting that public order in China has been deteriorating, Liu
said "taishang" should keep alert on their own safety. Before
venturing into China, he said, local business people should also
carefully evaluate business risks there to avoid financial losses.</P>
      <P>According to SEF tallies, the number of reported cases involving
"taishang's" personal safety has been increasing steadily in recent
years. In 2004, a record number of 124 cases were reported, marking a
15.88 percent rise from the 2003 level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN MAY COMMENT ON LIEN-HU MEETING IN KIRIBATI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, April 30 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian is very likely to
issue his first comment on the April 29 meeting between the leaders
of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China
(CPC) during his upcoming visit to the Pacific island nation of
Kiribati, political sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chen will depart for a three-nation South Pacific state visit
Sunday. The five-day diplomatic tour will take Chen to three of the
Republic of China's allies in the region -- the Marshall Islands,
Kiribati and Tuvalu via the U.S. territory of Guam.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who is currently on a historic visit in
China, held an unprecedented closed-door meeting with CPC General
Secretary Hu Jintao in Beijing Friday. According to a "news bulletin"
issued after the Lien-Hu meeting, the two parties vowed to promote
five tasks under the so-called "1992 consensus" on the "one China
principle."</P>
      <P>While the Mainland Affairs Council already expressed the ROC
government's stance immediately after the release of the "news
bulletin" that the so-called "1992 consensus" is non-existence, both
the Presidential Office and the Cabinet have not yet made any public
comments on the Lien-Hu talks.</P>
      <P>In addition to defining the Lien-Hu meeting as a party-to-party
rendezvous, political sources said the Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) administration has worked out response measures. Nevertheless,
the sources said, the Presidential Office will not publicly comment
on the event until after Lien's return May 3.</P>
      <P>Party sources said Chen will hold an informal meeting with
journalists during his state visit in Kiribati May 3. Chen is very
likely to take advantage of the occasion to air his views on the
five-point work plan issued after the Lien-Hu talks, the sources
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the sources said Chen's three-nation South Pacific
visit is aimed at cementing the ROC's relations with its allies in
the region and containing China's military expansion in the region
for the sake of safeguarding Asia-Pacific peace and stability.</P>
      <P>This will be Chen's third overseas trip so far this year. In
January, he visited the ROC's two other Pacific allies -- the Solomon
Islands and Palau. Earlier this month, he made an unprecedented trip
to the Vatican to attend Pope John Paul II's funeral, making him the
first serving ROC president ever to set foot in Europe. The Holy See
is the ROC's only diplomatic ally in Europe.</P>
      <P>During his visits, President Chen will sign joint comuniques
with his counterparts of the three nations and deliver speeches at
the parliaments of the Marshall Islands and Kiribati.</P>
      <P>According to the itinerary unveiled by the Presidential Office,
Chen will depart Taipei at 5 a.m. Sunday for the Marshall Islands by
a chartered China Airlines (CAL) plane. The plane will make a
refueling stop at Guam before arriving at the Marshall Island at 6
p.m. local time.</P>
      <P>Similar to an arrangement made for the last Pacific visit by the
president in January, CAL has assigned a Boeing B737-800 aircraft for
the flights because the tour will require only short to medium-range
flights, with the flying times ranging between one and four hours.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of Marshall Island President Kessai Note, the
ROC Navy has dispatched two Lafayette-class frigates to take part in
the Pacific island nation's May 1-2 National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>The two ships left the Tsoying naval base in southern Taiwan
April 19 and are scheduled to arrive at the Marshall Island's capital
of Majuro April 30.</P>
      <P>During his visit, Chen will breakfast with Note aboard one of the
Lafayette frigates next Monday. Later in the day, Chen and Note will
jointly preside over the opening of a canoeing contest and then
embark on a canoe voyage. Chen will present a model of a traditional
Tao tribal canoe to Note as a gift. The Tao is one of Taiwan's
aboriginal tribes.</P>
      <P>Chen is scheduled to fly to Kiribati May 3 where he will join
with Kiribati President Anote Tong in presiding over the opening of a
coastal "Taiwan Park" and addresses the country's parliament.</P>
      <P>Kiribati is sometimes known as the country to see the first
sunrise each day as it straddles the International Dateline. In 2000,
many people traveled to Kiribati to appreciate the dawn of the new
millennium. On May 4, Huang said, Chen and his entourage will get up
early to appreciate the spectacular sunrise.</P>
      <P>Later that day, Chen will fly to Tuvalu by a small plane for a
half day visit. He will then return to Kiribati. Shortly afterwards,
he will depart for Guam for an overnight transit stop via the
chartered CAL plane.</P>
      <P>Chen and his entourage are scheduled to return to Taipei May 5.
Members of his entourage will include Minister of Foreign Affairs Tan
Sun Chen, Government Information Office Minister Pasuya Yao and
aboriginal Legislator Chen Ying.</P>
      <P>According to a news release issued by the Navy General
Headquarters, the two ships will be manned by more than 300 officers
and enlisted soldiers.</P>
      <P>In addition to celebrating the Marshall Islands' National Day,
the news release said the purposes of the mission also includes
promoting relations with the nation's diplomatic ally and honing
naval personnel's long-haul navigation skills.</P>

President's Big Social Security Gamble

President Bush made two big bets in
proposing on Thursday night to cut Social
Security benefits for future generations of
retirees, one political, one on the substance
of his policy, and if he is to succeed in
remaking the retirement system, both of them
will probably have to break his way.
Representative Jim Kolbe, Republican of
Arizona, said Mr. Bush's strategy "has the 
potential" to create enough bipartisanship to 
move legislation through Congress, "but there are
no guarantees." Kolbe has long called for
benefit cuts to be part of a repair for Social 
Security.</TEXT>

    <TEXT>The Times: Post vote hotline signals action
on fraud.
An emergency hotline will be set up this weekend so that returning
officers can report postal ballot malpractice and fraud as fears grow
that dozens of election results in marginal constituencies could be
challenged, The Times has learnt. 

Election officers have been told to call the police if anyone brings
more than five postal ballot papers into a polling station. 

Senior officials have also given warning that election staff are under
enormous pressure because of the number of postal votes being cast.
They believe that this will make it far harder to spot fraud. 



Financial Times: Labour fears for its majority.
Tony Blair, UK prime minister, enters the final weekend of the general
election campaign on Saturday assured of victory but beset by fears his
massive majority in parliament will be severely eroded, destroying his
hopes of serving a full third term.

As the three main parties launch a final push for votes before the May
5 vote, the prime minister can be confident he will be back in Downing
Street on Friday.</TEXT>
