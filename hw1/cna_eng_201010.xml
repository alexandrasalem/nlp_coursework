    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan missed an opportunity to make history by losing to South Korea 79-68
Thursday in the semifinal of the FIBA Asia U18 Championship for Men in Sanaa,
Yemen.</P>
      <P>If the team had advanced to the championship game, it would have at least
matched its best record -- silver medal finishes in 1972 and 1989 -- in the
biennial tournament and could have made a challenge for its first gold in
history.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was dealt a knockout blow in the decisive third quarter, when the Koreans
opened the second half with a 17-2 run, turning a close game into a rout. Taiwan
was out-scored 23-10 in the period and trailed by as many as 18 points.</P>
      <P>Unable to match Korea's inside play, Taiwan was out-rebounded 39-22. Korea,
which was led by Lee Seounghyun's 17 points and 14 rebounds and Lee Jonghyun's
15 points and 10 rebounds, also made 10 more free throws than the Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>Center Hu Lung-mao scored a team-high 25 points to go with eight rebounds and
six steals for Taiwan, which was leading 35-34 at halftime. Chen Ying-chun and
Huang Po-wei had 13 points each.</P>
      <P>The team will meet Iran, which lost to China in the other semifinal match, in
Friday's bronze medal game. It is still something worth playing for because the
top three teams in the tournament will represent Asia in the 2011 FIBA U19 World
Championship, which will be played in Latvia June 30-July 10, 2011.</P>

(By Hsieh Chun-wei and Frances Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said Thursday that it had relaxed
securities transaction regulations for foreign investors and overseas Chinese
investors by allowing them to buy stocks in the underwriting phase.</P>
      <P>Previously, foreign investors and overseas Chinese investors were allowed only
to buy stocks that had been already listed on the main board or the over-the-
counter (OTC) market, no matter whether the stocks were sold in primary listings
or in the form of Taiwan depository receipts.</P>
      <P>"We are in a fast-changing market. The FSC, after taking market reality and
public opinion into consideration, has decided to broaden the scope of
investments for foreign investors, " said Wu Kuei-mao, chief secretary of the
FSC's Securities and Futures Bureau.</P>
      <P>Underwriting is the process by which investment bankers known as underwriters
raise investment capital from investors on behalf of a company that is issuing
securities before a listing on the main board or the OTC market.</P>
      <P>Foreign investors  and overseas Chinese investors  are now permitted to
participate in share subscriptions in the underwriting stage, the FSC said.</P>
      <P>Lin Tung-liang, chief secretary of the FSC, said the FSC had been planning the
rule relaxation for some time and was waiting for an appropriate time to boost
the presence of foreign investors in the local capital market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Liberty Times: Under-the-table dealings across the strait</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/01/10  11:31:55
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Zhimin, China's vice minister of public security, visited Taiwan Sept.
13-18 for an official visit. The visit, however, was not made public until Sept.
27, and the government has so far not released any details.</P>
      <P>Such secret dealings have become a model for interaction between the Kuomintang
(KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC) . This sends a dangerous message to
the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>Under the leadership of President Ma Ying-jeou, cross-Taiwan Strait affairs have
often bypassed  the democratic  monitoring mechanism. Most of the time,
consensus or agreements are reached between the KMT and CPC without the people's
knowledge. Examples include Taiwan's observer status at the World Health
Assembly under the name Chinese Taipei and the signing of the economic
cooperation framework agreement.</P>
      <P>This clandestine model for cross-strait negotiations is exactly what has been
sought after by China, because it enables the KMT and the CPC to determine
Taiwan's future by themselves, skipping the Taiwanese people.</P>
      <P>The people must see this situation clearly. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 1, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council expressed welcome Thursday to an announcement
that Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Demetrios Marantis will lead a U.S.
delegation to Taiwan for bilateral trade talks.</P>
      <P>"After a three-year freeze over access to Taiwan's beef market, this signifies a
welcome resumption in dialogue between America and its 10th-largest trading
partner, " the non-profit business group said in a statement.</P>
      <P>The statement was released after the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
announced earlier in the day that talks under the Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement (TIFA) between the United States and Taiwan will soon be resumed.</P>
      <P>It said Marantis will be the most senior official to have visited Taiwan
representing the Barack Obama government. His visit "heralds an important first
step in re-establishing a robust dialogue on areas of mutual interest," the
statement said.</P>
      <P>Council President Rupert Hammond-Chambers said the upcoming dialogue will focus
on issues regarding pork and rice, and he expressed hope that it will not fall
into another dispute like the one that saw a Taiwanese ban on U.S. beef imports.</P>
      <P>The statement made clear that the council will support the negotiation and
conclusion of agreements between the two sides to address  issues  on  taxation,
investment,  e-commerce,  the liberalization of Taiwan's energy market, and
pharmaceuticals.</P>
      <P>Since its signing in September 1994, the TIFA has provided an official channel
for Taiwan-U.S. dialogue on trade and economic issues. Talks under the agreement
were suspended by the U.S. in 2007, however, in retaliation for Taiwan's beef
ban.</P>

      <P>Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Ltd., the world's largest contract electronics
product maker, said Friday that it will issue US$1 billion-worth of overseas
convertible bonds Oct. 12 to meet funding demand for overseas production
material purchases.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai said the capital to be raised from the bond sales will also be used to
repay debt in an attempt to cut interest payments.</P>
      <P>The convertible bonds will have a maturity of three years with a zero coupon
rate, the company said, adding that it has set a conversion price of NT$152.75
(US$4.90) for each Hon Hai share for bond-holders who would like to exchange
their bonds for company shares.</P>
      <P>On July 19, Hon Hai scrapped an earlier bond sales plan as its stock price
"failed to reflect the company's value" after the stock got hammered following a
string of suicides by workers at its Shenzhen complex in China earlier this
year.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai said the cancellation of the bond issuance plan was also because the
date of issuance approved by the Financial Supervisory Commission had expired.</P>
      <P>However, the company resurrected the plan July 24 by revising the terms of the
bond sale to the three-year maturity rather than the previous five-year
offering.</P>
      <P>"I suspect Hon Hai might expand its business through acquisitions or mergers in
the near future, for which funds will be necessary, " Grand Cathay Securities
analyst Mars Hsu said.</P>
      <P>According to Grand Cathay Securities, Hon Hai's short term debt totaled NT$171.4

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Impact of latest interest rate hikes</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/01/10  13:21:56
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major Taiwanese banks are expected to raise their interest rates in the coming
few days after the Central Bank of the Republic of China (CBC) bumped up its key
lending rates by another 0.125 percentage points from Friday.</P>
      <P>The hike -- the second so far this year -- brought the CBC's discount rate on
loans to commercial banks to 1.5 percent, the interest rate on collateralized
loans to 1.875 percent and the rate on unsecured loans to 3.75 percent.</P>
      <P>Responding to the CBC's move, local commercial banks are likely to inch up their
deposit rates by 0.06 percentage points and lending rates by about 0.125
percentage points to reflect their higher capital costs, banking sources said.</P>
      <P>Economists said the latest interest rate hikes indicate that the domestic
monetary policy will become more neutral after the CBC had previously kept
interest rates low since September 2008 amid the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>The latest interest rate hikes come amid steady domestic economic recovery and
rising consumer prices and also reflect the CBC's hopes of gradually bringing
relatively low interest rates back to normal levels, CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan
said after a quarterly CBC board meeting.</P>
      <P>Perng further said the bank will continue to execute selected prudential
measures to rein in skyrocketing housing prices and that it will continue
jawboning with local mortgage lenders on risk management.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said the central bank mainly was targeting real estate
speculators  when it adopted selected credit tightening measures in June for the
first time.</P>
      <P>This time around,  the analysts said, land developers and construction companies
will be the principal targets of selected credit control measures.</P>
      <P>Banking sources said the CBC will conduct spot checks once every two weeks on
commercial banks' total lending to land developers, particularly those who own
many plots of unused or unoccupied land.</P>
      <P>Perng said buying large parcels of land but failing to launch any construction
projects on them should be defined as "piling up land for profiteering."</P>
      <P>If bank loans to land developers continue to spike, banking sources said, the
CBC is likely to unveil stricter regulations before the end of the year to
better regulate such lending. (Oct. 1, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Senior bankers present at Thursday's CBC board meeting said the central bank has
directed commercial banks to require land developers or construction companies
to produce construction licenses within six months of securing loans and to
stipulate that they must launch construction projects within one year or face
the requirement of repaying the mortgage loans.</P>
      <P>Citing data released by H&amp;B Realty, Perng said at the CBC board meeting that
housing prices have declined 2.88 percent since June, when the CBC adopted
credit tightening measures to cushion real estate speculation, including capping
each home mortgage in the greater Taipei area at 70 percent of collateral. (Oct.
1, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Perng said the latest interest rate hikes are part of the central bank's efforts
to keep deposit interest rates above the domestic inflation rate so that local
people need not worry about that interest income on their bank deposits are
offset by rises in consumer prices.</P>
      <P>According to Perng, the local real interest rate will closely approach zero this
year in terms of the 1.23 percent growth rate of the annual consumer price index
forecast by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>Perng said the central bank will keep a close watch on the domestic economic
situation and maintain a positive real interest rate. (Oct. 1, 2010).</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih instructed the relevant authorities Friday to investigate the
illegal hiring of foreign workers for a freeway construction project in the
central county of Nantou, after six foreigners were killed in an accident a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>Wu said he was concerned about the presence of foreign workers at the site
because the construction contract expressly prohibits such hiring. He told the
Council of Labor Affairs and the Department of Social Affairs of Nantou County
to investigate the matter.</P>
      <P>Wu said the problem of illegal foreign workers is a lingering issue, as the
whereabouts of thousands of foreign workers remain unknown.</P>
      <P>The accident occurred when a 50-meter high, 80-meter wide section of scaffolding
collapsed Thursday at the construction site of the Beishan Interchange of the
No. 6 Freeway, triggering a landslide in which seven people were killed,
including the six foreign nationals.</P>
      <P>While the authorities said the workers were probably working illegally,  the
contractor,  Kuo Ten Construction,  said their identities had not yet been

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed little changed Friday in quiet trading, with
investors remaining on the sidelines watching closely how companies will report
their September sales next week, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 6.40 points, or 0.07 percent, to 8,244.18 after moving
between 8,220.73 and 8,260.28 on turnover of NT$111.96 billion (US$3.59
billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.26 percent as rotational buying resumed in select old
economy stocks, but the gains were compromised by cautious sentiment ahead of
the September sales announcements by electronics heavyweights, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>The construction sector outperformed the broader market as the central bank did
not come up with any widely expected dramatic measures to impact the industry
Thursday, such as the imposition of housing loan limitations to cap local
property prices, they said.</P>
      <P>In its quarterly policy making meeting,  the central bank announced a hike of
the key discount rate by 0.125 percentage points to 1.50 percent.</P>
      <P>"The central bank move was better than expected, despite the rate hike," Concord
Securities analyst Allen Lin said.</P>
      <P>"The market was kind of relieved that the central bank imposed no further
tightening regulations directly on the property market, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said he was expecting the market to continue to move in a trading range
between 8,200 points and 8,400 points next week.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,895 stocks closed up and 1,806 down with 357 remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>The construction sector posted the highest gains, up 0.89 percent. Paper and
pulp stocks rose 0.8 percent, textiles gained 0.65 percent, plastics and
chemical shares added 0.62 percent, and financials rose 0.29 percent.</P>
      <P>The cement sector closed up 0.24 percent and the foodstuff sector was 0.08
percent higher, while the machinery and electronics sector fell 0.17 percent.</P>
      <P>In the construction sector, Sakura Development rose 2.47 percent to NT$22.80 and
Hung Poo Real Estate gained 1.72 percent to close at NT$44.25.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The University of New Haven will dedicate a newly completed US$14 million
building at its campus in Connecticut to forensic scientist Henry Lee, with
university President Steven H. Kaplan officiating the inauguration ceremony on
Oct. 15, a university press release said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Dr. Lee has been a pioneer in the field of forensic science for more than 40
years, " Kaplan said in the press release. "With the dedication of the new Henry
C. Lee Institute of Forensic Science building, we will establish a benchmark by
which technologically advanced forensics training facilities will be measured
for decades to come."</P>
      <P>Lee joined the university's Department of Forensic Science as an assistant
professor and program director in 1975.  Under his leadership, the forensic
science program has expanded from just half a dozen students and limited
laboratory space to a premier forensic sciences teaching center in the United
States.</P>
      <P>He arrived in the U.S. from Taiwan in 1972 to pursue his education in forensic
science and biochemistry in New York after working for several years in the
Taipei Police Department.</P>
      <P>As a forensic scientist, he has worked on famous cases such as the O.J. Simpson
and Laci Peterson cases, as well as the post-Sept. 11 forensic investigation. In
2008, he was invited to conduct investigations of the March 19 shooting incident
of then-President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu in Tainan,
southern Taiwan, on the eve of Taiwan's presidential election.</P>
      <P>On March 1, 2007, the university dedicated the College of Forensic Sciences to
the highly reputed Lee, and renamed it the Henry C. Lee College of Criminal
Justice and Forensic Sciences. Meanwhile, the university started raising funds
for the establishment of a state-of-the-art building to house a learning center.</P>
      <P>The Forensic Learning Center will include high-tech laboratories, virtual crime
scene training modules and classrooms to train police, lawyers, investigators
and students in new concepts and practices in forensic scene investigation and
examination of physical evidence, according to the press release.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: The courage of the central bank</HEADLINE>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Bank of the Republic of China announced a 0.125 percentage point
hike in its discount rate Thursday. The measure appears to run counter to the
bank's efforts to block the inflow of hot money to try to slow down the
appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>The hike, which followed a similar one three months ago, has fueled expectations
that Taiwan's key interest rate will be raised every quarter. Instead of
repelling the hot money, this measure will actually attract more hot money into
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, South Korea -- Taiwan's main competitor in the
international market -- has seen a 70 percent drop in its currency, due mainly
to the global financial crisis and the military standoff with North Korea.
Failing to keep its currency at relatively low levels, Taiwan has lost its
competitive advantage with South Korea as a result.</P>
      <P>While the central bank's decision to further raise interest rates at such a
sensitive time allows us to see its courage, we pray that the central bank also
has a viable way to fight off an influx of hot money. (Editorial abstract --

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Minister of the Interior urged the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) Friday to support a government plan to implement an absentee voting
system, which he said has won overwhelming public support.</P>
      <P>The system, which allows voters away from the location of their household
registration to cast their ballots, will benefit students, workers and military
personnel who have the right to vote but do not live in their hometowns,  said
Jiang Yi-huah, citing ministry statistics showing that more than 80 percent of
the people in the country have expressed support for the system.</P>
      <P>Jiang made the call in a response to media inquires on the DPP's opposition to
the government's plan to adopt the system in time for the 2012 presidential
election.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior decided the previous day that it will push for an
amendment to the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and Recall Act to
make absentee voting in the presidential election possible.</P>
      <P>However, DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang said society has not yet reached a consensus
on whether or not absentee voting should be implemented and that there is a lack
of coordinating measures or a mechanism to prevent flaws or irregularities.</P>
      <P>The party also believes that such a system should start with a small election,
instead of a major poll such as a presidential election, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin accused the government of making the decision "in a manner that is not
sufficiently prudent and careful" and said the plan has been drawn up for
political reasons.</P>

      <P>An interest rate hike in June effectively curbed local property market prices,
Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) Governor Perng Fai-nan said
Friday, the day after the bank raised the benchmark interest rate for the second
time this year.</P>
      <P>Perng was responding to ruling Kuomintang legislator Lin Te-fu, who questioned
the government's recent policies in handling rising housing prices at a
parliamentary session.</P>
      <P>The governor said that according  to reports from several construction companies
and property realtors, buyers of pre-sales housing and new homes had more room
to negotiate in August, allowing home prices to fall by 2.8 percent from June.</P>
      <P>The central bank's policy moves had proved effective, Perng said, adding that
home mortgages in Taipei City accounted for about 52 percent of total new
mortgage lending, down from 59 percent in June, Perng said.</P>
      <P>Perng also said that the central bank had taken actions to "manage risks," not
"dampen the housing market."</P>
      <P>He said that as more than 38 percent of total bank lending was in home mortgages
recently, the financial health of the banking industry could be affected.</P>
      <P>"So the central bank decided to "take cautious,  targeted measures," he said.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, the central bank raised its benchmark discount rate by 0.125
percentage points to 1.5 percent, after a similar move on June 24 from a record-
low 1.25 percent.</P>
      <P>The central bank introduced mortgage restrictions in June, including a 70
percent cap on loans for second homes in the Taipei metropolitan area to cool
real estate prices.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Wu Den-yih also said that the government was not dampening
property markets.</P>
      <P>High housing prices are an issue in Taipei metropolitan area, but in areas south
of Taoyuan, the issue is purchasing power, he said.</P>

      <P>The Control Yuan, the branch of government that monitors the behavior of
officials and civil servants, launched an investigation  Friday into a fatal
accident  on a freeway construction site to find out whether any officials are
involved in illegal or irregular practices with regard to the project.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan Minister without Portfolio Lee Ping-nan, who is in charge of the
probe, said earlier in the day that he and his colleague Cheng Jen-hung will
make an Oct. 4 visit to the site of the accident that took seven lives a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>The probe will focus on safety measures at the construction site on the No. 6
Freeway in Nantou County, central Taiwan, and the alleged illegal employment of
foreign workers there.</P>
      <P>They will also check whether the relevant authorities, including the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications,  have
been negligent in ensuring that the construction was being carried out properly
and safely, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The accident occurred when a 50-meter high, 80-meter wide section of scaffolding
collapsed at the construction site of the Beishan Interchange on the freeway,
triggering a landslide in which seven workers were killed, six of whom were
foreigners.</P>
      <P>The foreign laborers, all of whom were Indonesian, did not have work permits
issued by the Taiwan  Area National  Expressway Engineering Bureau.</P>
      <P>CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan told the media she has demanded heavy punishment for
any contractors who have illegally hired foreign workers.</P>
      <P>She also sought heavy punishment for anyone found to have failed to protect
their employees, as an initial investigation suggested that the collapse might
have been caused by weak supports resulting from bad grouting carried out by
inexperienced workers.</P>
      <P>The collapse also injured one local and one Vietnamese worker.</P>
      <P>Construction of the interchange project, which began in January last year and is
scheduled for completion Jan. 12, 2011, was suspended immediately following the
collapse. It will not be resumed until safety checks have been completed, with
the contractors obliged to cover any losses caused by the accident, according to
the expressway engineering bureau.</P>
      <P>The bureau also said the consultancy company responsible for overseeing the
project, Sinotech Engineering Consultants, should be held accountable for
allowing foreign workers to be illegally employed at the site. Sinotech
officials declined to comment.</P>

      <P>Indonesia's representative office in Taiwan has not begun to handle the deaths
of six Indonesian migrant workers killed in a construction site accident
Thursday as it has yet to be informed of their identity, an official with the
office said Friday.</P>
      <P>Seven workers, including six who were reportedly Indonesian, were killed and two
others were injured after a sprawling network of scaffolding at a construction
site for a No. 6 Freeway exit ramp collapsed early Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>The No. 6 Freeway, which connects Caotun to Puli in central Taiwan, saves travel
time to the popular tourist areas of Sun Moon Lake and Cingjing Farm.</P>
      <P>"We've been in contact with labor affairs authorities since the accident
happened,  but we're  still  waiting  for the final identification report from
the police department to proceed with subsequent procedures, " said Amina
Tjandra, a member of the Indonesian Economic and Trade Office to Taipei's Labor
Department.</P>
      <P>The six migrant workers were reportedly illegally hired by contractors.</P>
      <P>Tjandra said she has no information about the six workers.</P>
      <P>"If the media report is correct, they could be undocumented workers who legally
entered Taiwan but left their previous job, " she said.</P>
      <P>There were 151,723 Indonesian workers in Taiwan as of the end of August,
according to figures from the Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training under
the council. The number accounts for more than 40 percent of the 372,146 migrant
workers in Taiwan at the time.</P>
      <P>Just over 85 percent of Indonesian workers -- 129,046 out of 151,723 -- were

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hundreds of people, particularly the elderly, lined up outside hospitals in
Taipei Friday to receive free seasonal flu vaccinations,  the first day of the
government's flu-prevention campaign for this year.</P>
      <P>Even before midday, nearly 1,000 people had received a number from the Taipei
Veterans  General Hospital to get their free vaccination in anticipation of the
approaching peak flu season.</P>
      <P>A long line also formed at Taipei City Hospital's Renai Branch.</P>
      <P>An  85-year-old  man  surnamed  Hsueh,  accompanying  his wheelchair-bound wife
to the hospital for vaccination, said he and his wife had received flu
inoculations every year for the last five years.</P>
      <P>"We are healthier and have spent less on medicine and doctor visits since
receiving the vaccinations," he said.</P>
      <P>"The vaccine protects my child, " said a mother surnamed Chao who had brought
her two-year-old to the hospital to receive a free shot.</P>
      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control, said
the center has purchased nearly 3 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine this
year, some from Taiwan's Adimmune Corp. and the rest from overseas firms
Novartis and Sanofi-Aventis.</P>
      <P>"The vaccines have been distributed to 3,662 public health institutions
nationwide," he said.</P>
      <P>"Supplies will be smooth and adequate, unlike last year, when the inoculation
process was brought to a halt due to shortages, " he added.</P>
      <P>The vaccination program will run from Oct. 1-Nov. 30, for citizens aged over 65,
children aged between six months and 10 years, medical personnel in charge of
disease control and prevention, poultry breeders, and patients with rare or
serious diseases, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>If the number of doses exceeds requirements, he said, any surplus will be made
available to the general public from Dec. 1.</P>
      <P>People who are not on the priority list for free inoculation can still get
vaccinated at a cost of between NT$500 (US$15.63) and NT$600, Shih pointed out.</P>
      <P>The public health authorities began offering free vaccinations against seasonal
flu as well as swine flu -- officially known as influenza A(H1N1) -- in 2009,
amid global fears over A(H1N1), which can be fatal.</P>

      <P>Heavy rainfall brought by several storms in September has helped ease worries
that Taiwan will suffer water shortages during the fast approaching dry season,
the Water Resources Agency (WRA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Water levels at Taiwan's major reservoirs are now generally above 80 percent of
capacity, ensuring a stable water supply for most of the country through next
spring, the WRA said.</P>
      <P>More than half of Taiwan's reservoirs are filled to more than 90 percent of
capacity, topped by Tsengwen Reservoir in southern Taiwan, which is nearly full,
according to WRA figures.</P>
      <P>Only four have water levels below 80 percent of their capacity: Taipei's Feitsui
Reservoir, Keelung City's Hsinshan Reservoir, Tainan County's Wushantou
Reservoir and Nantou County's Wushe Reservoir.</P>
      <P>Even those reservoirs, however, were replenished by Typhoon Fanapi on Sept. 17
and other weather fronts in recent weeks, helping relieve water shortages and
curtailing the need for water rationing around Taiwan, the WRA said.</P>
      <P>Despite the improved water supply situation, the WRA urged people to conserve
water whenever they could to help the country get through the dry season, which

      <P>Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung said Friday that the government should
implement proper policy measures to help community hospitals survive, as the
number of such hospitals decreased more than 30 percent over the past 15 years.</P>
      <P>He said that under the current system and standard of payments, community
hospitals -- which are considered to better meet social service needs -- find it
difficult to survive.</P>
      <P>"The government should consider how to provide sufficient support to community
hospitals in terms of policy, budget and payment system," Huang said at a press
conference.</P>
      <P>Many community hospital managers said that a lot of people prefer waiting in
medical center corridors to seeking help from community hospitals, he added.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan introduced the national health insurance system 15 years ago, the
number of community hospitals dropped from 568 to 385, while the number of
medical centers and regional hospitals rose sharply, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He noted that in 1995, there were 13 medical centers and 48 regional hospitals
in Taiwan. As of the end of 2009, the number of medial centers had increased 77
percent to 23, while the number of regional hospitals rose by 62 percent to 78.</P>
      <P>Huang also said that in 2009, the volume of medical services provided by

medical services, while medical centers and regional hospitals accounted for
41.2 percent and 37.7 percent respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Court holds hearing on extending ex-president's detention</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan High Court held a hearing Friday on whether to further extend the
detention of former President Chen Shui-bian, who has been held since Dec. 30,
2008 in connection with corruption and money laundering charges.</P>
      <P>Presiding judge Teng Chen-chiu said that the court would hand down a ruling on
whether Chen will remain detained for two more months before the current
extension expires on Oct. 18. The former president's detainment was previously
extended for three months in July.</P>
      <P>Chen said at the court hearing that he has been detained for 674 days and that
he has said "all he has to say." One should not assume that he has access to
channels of fleeing the country because he has been president, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Teng had said that if he remitted all the money his family
held overseas back to Taiwan, he would have a good chance of being released.</P>
      <P>The former president said that he had remitted all US$18.43 million back. The
amount fell short of the US$21 million the prosecution alleged his family had
laundered to Swiss banks because of losses including processing fees and charges
for the early termination of investment contracts.</P>
      <P>"If the judge still won't release me on bail now that I've returned the money,
is he cheating me?" the former president asked.</P>
      <P>After the hearing, Chen returned to the Taipei Detention Center.</P>
      <P>He and his wife Wu Shu-jen were found guilty of corruption, forgery and money-
laundering in September 2009 and given life sentences, but the Taiwan High Court
reduced the sentences to 20 years on June 11.</P>
      <P>Chen, his wife and the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme
Prosecutors  Office,  which  led the probe  into the ex-president's cases, all
appealed the verdict to the Supreme Court.</P>

    <DATELINE>10/01/10  20:12:26
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When President Ma Ying-jeou put forward a proposal in July to set up an anti-
corruption agency under the Ministry of Justice, the low level of the proposed
agency immediately raised doubts about its effectiveness.</P>
      <P>Ma also said agency staff would be selected from existing members of the Bureau
of Investigation and ethics departments of government offices. This is an even
worse idea because it is tantamount to pouring old wine in a new bottle, which
would not help change the existing culture in which bureaucrats stick up for one
another.</P>
      <P>An example is the recent corruption scandal that erupted over Taipei City's
Xinsheng Overpass improvement project. Huang Hsi-hsun, a former chief of the
city's New Construction Office who is under investigation in the case, has
obtained an investigative report from the city government's ethics department.</P>
      <P>This shows that ethics departments of government offices are either worthless or
are an accomplice to irregularities. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 1, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The approval  obtained  by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the
world's largest contract chip maker, to upgrade the production technology at its
foundry in China is a "positive" for the company, a research note issued by
Macquarie Securities said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs issued the green light to TSMC Wednesday,
allowing the company to upgrade the technology at its 8-inch wafer plant in
Shanghai to the 0.13 micron process from the current 0.18 micron process.</P>
      <P>"We view this as a positive, as the upgrade will boost TSMC's competitiveness, "
against companies such as China's Semiconductor International Corp., in product
categories that include driver ICs and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
(CMOS) sensors,  the research note said.</P>
      <P>Macquarie said it expects the technology upgrade will boost TSMC's capacity in
China by 33.3 percent by the end of the first quarter of 2011, 55.6 percent by
the end of second quarter and 100 percent by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The securities firm said the development will help TSMC gain a higher market
share in China.</P>
      <P>In late February, the government relaxed its restrictions on local foundry
investment in China by allowing chip makers to upgrade to the 0.13 micron
process from the 0.18 micro process.</P>
      <P>The relaxation came after the local high-tech industry strongly urged the
government to change its policy on fears Taiwanese companies in China would fall
behind foreign rivals that had applied to adopt the 0.13 micron process or even
more advanced technology in China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Macquarie said TSMC's shipments in the fourth quarter are expected to
remain at about the same level as in the third quarter, a more optimistic
assessment than the market consensus projecting a 5-10 percent decline.</P>
      <P>The securities firm said orders placed by mobile customers, such as Qualcomm and
Broadcom, are expected to serve as the main engine of TSMC's sales in the fourth
quarter.</P>
      <P>Macquarie said it maintained a "neutral" recommendation on TSMC shares with a
12-month target price of NT$60.00.</P>
      <P>TSMC closed unchanged at NT$62.00 on Taiwan's stock exchange Friday.</P>

      <P>A commodity fair promoting Taiwan-made products opened in Seoul Friday, with
Taiwanese manufacturers hoping to capitalize on trade opportunities created by
Asia's growing economy.</P>
      <P>A delegation led by the Importers and Exporters Association of Taipei (IEAT)
hosted the event at a hotel in the Korean capital.</P>
      <P>The group consisted of 35 Taiwanese brands, including household cleaner
manufacturer Farcent Enterprise Co. and kitchenware producer Sinon Corporation.</P>
      <P>The exhibition  showcases patented household goods made by Taiwanese companies
that cater to Korean consumers, from LED lights and furniture to stationery and
toys.</P>
      <P>South Korea was Taiwan's fifth biggest trade partner last year while Taiwan was
its seventh biggest source of imports, said association Chairman Liu Kuo-chao.</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade contracted in 2009 due to the global economic</P>
      <P>downturn, but has grown 58.7 percent to US$14.55 billion in the first seven
months of this year, Liu said.</P>
      <P>Chang Yang Horng, director of the Taiwan Trade Center in Seoul, said Taipei's
recent signing of a trade deal with Beijing that will allow some of Taiwan's
products to be given tariff reductions or exemptions in China, could spur
increased business with Korea.</P>
      <P>He contended that Korean businesses can take advantage of the trade deal by
cooperating with Taiwanese enterprises to expand their share of the emerging

      <P>A tailor-made elastic bandage has helped reduce swelling in the arm of a two-
year-old Cambodian girl who checked into Taichung Veterans General Hospital in
central Taiwan for treatment on Aug. 28, her doctor said Friday.</P>
      <P>The young patient from Cambodia, Reachny Mich, whose condition has been
described as an "elephant arm, " was prescribed the elastic garment by pediatric
hematologist Chang Teh-kao.</P>
      <P>The sleeve reduced her right arm's circumference  from 31 centimeters two weeks
ago to 26 centimeters, Chang said at a news conference at the hospital.</P>
      <P>"It proves that our conservative therapy to reduce the massive swelling in her
arm has worked, " he said.</P>
      <P>The two-year-old was brought to Taiwan by her mother about one month ago for
examination and possible treatment of her arm, which weighed so much the girl
was unable to walk.</P>
      <P>Chang said Mich's right arm was four to five times larger than her left arm.  He
diagnosed  the girl with a rare case  of Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome, a
deformation of blood vessels and bones.</P>
      <P>The girl was fortunate as she has not suffered from arteriovenous malformation,
an abnormal connection between veins and arteries that would otherwise cause
heart failure, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that the circumference of the child's arm will decrease to about 20
centimeters in a month," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He said that doctors decided not to perform surgery on the child because they
felt she was too young and the surgery could cause complications.</P>
      <P>"It will take six months to one year for us to complete the current treatment.
We will make a new assessment if there is a problem with the sleeve," he said.</P>
      <P>Reachny Mich is expected to be released from the hospital in one month so she
and her mother can rent a home near the hospital and visit the doctor twice a
week, according to Hsu Yu-pi, a volunteer at the hospital.</P>
      <P>Hsu has been assisting the two with their finances as they seek medical
attention in Taiwan. They have also received a donation of NT$100,000 (US$3,125)
from Royal Philips Electronics.</P>
      <P>Mich was discovered by a Taiwanese medical team when it visited Cambodia in
April to provide free medical services.</P>

      <P>The new director of the Southwest Coast National Scenic Area Administration
believes the area's ecological and cultural features will prove appealing to
overseas visitors, and he said he plans to tap into that market to boost tourism
in the region.</P>
      <P>Unveiling his plans to promote tourism in the scenic area that covers the
southern Taiwan counties of Yunlin, Chiayi, and Tainan, Chang Cheng-yuan said he
will invite international media to explore the region's natural beauty.</P>
      <P>He said he is convinced that with its shoals, lagoons and estuary wetlands and
unique religious customs, the scenic area has the potential to draw tourists
from abroad for cultural and ecological excursions.</P>
      <P>Chang took over the post earlier in the day from Acting Director Cheng Jung-feng
at the administration's office in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Part of Chang's confidence in attracting visitors from abroad stems from his

years until he was appointed to govern the scenic area.</P>
      <P>He said at the swearing-in ceremony that in his eight years in New York, he

      <P>Driven by Taiwan's growing economy, sales of Mercedes-Benz cars are expected to
rise 40 percent year-on-year in 2010 to 7,000 units, the German luxury car's
largest dealer in Taiwan said Friday.</P>
      <P>The CMI Group, which is also a major shareholder of Mercedes-Benz Taiwan Ltd.,
said at an event to mark its 40th anniversary that it was upbeat about Taiwan's
luxury car market because of the improving economic environment.</P>
      <P>A.A. Khoo, president of CMI, estimated that 7,000 Mercedes-Benz cars, priced at
an average of NT$2 million apiece, will be sold in Taiwan this year, compared to
more than 5,000 sold in 2009.</P>
      <P>"Although it takes about two to three months to deliver a car, most local buyers
are willing to wait, an indication of rising consumer confidence, " Khoo said at
the CMI anniversary event.</P>
      <P>The CMI president said that he expected Mercedes-Benz car sales in Taiwan to
maintain double-digit growth annually because the luxury car's sales here have
been relatively stable compared to other parts of Asia.</P>
      <P>The CMI Group also revealed Friday that it had plans to diversify its business
into the local property market.</P>
      <P>Khoo expressed  optimism  over the prospects  for Taiwan's residential and
commercial real estate markets, even though the country's central bank raised
benchmark interest rates for the second time this year on Thursday.</P>
      <P>CMI Property Ltd., a subsidiary of the CMI Group, plans to develop a 132,000
square-meter plot of land into a high-tech industrial park in northern Taiwan's
Guandu in two to three years, Khoo said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the company is also planning to take part in a joint development

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced Friday that Taiwan will impose anti-

      <P>The anti-dumping duties, which will range from 4.73 percent against three
specific companies to 59.70 percent against other Chinese exporters of the
chemical, will be levied over a five-year period beginning retroactively from

      <P>The workers' union for indebted American International Group's (AIG) Taiwan unit
called for dialogue with the company's new chief executive soon after he was
appointed on Friday, in the wake of a failed attempt by AIG to sell the unit.</P>
      <P>"We urge the new CEO to talk with us and to lead Nan Shan Life Insurance Co. to
operate in accordance with laws, " Wedding Lan, a spokesman for the union, told
the Central News Agency by telephone.</P>
      <P>Hours earlier, Nan Shan announced the appointment of Richard Bender, executive
vice president and chief agency officer at AIA (American International
Assurance) Hong Kong, as acting president and CEO to replace Frank Chan, who
retired.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government rejected the sale of the unit to a Hong Kong consortium on
Aug. 31, voicing concern about the buyer's long-term capability and rights of
Nan Shan's workers.</P>
      <P>Lan blasted Nan Shan management for a lack of communication about the sale and
asked the new chief executive not to repeat the mistake.</P>
      <P>A dialogue will help the employees understand the management's difficulties in
running the Taiwanese insurer and help the management know how it can better
protect workers' rights, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that the workers' union would not necessarily oppose a deal to sell Nan
Shan, but doesn't want to see any possible negative impact on the company's
37,000 employees.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, AIG was mulling its options on whether it will sell its Taiwan unit
again, a Taiwanese spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>"AIG is now conducting a cautious assessment on the possible results of managing
Nan Shan on its own, putting it up for sale again or launching an initial public
offering (IPO), " Nan Shan spokeswoman Amanda Chou told CNA by telephone.</P>
      <P>She said the board meeting that chose Bender did not discuss the next step for
the Taiwanese insurer.</P>
      <P>Bender will keep his positions at AIG's Hong Kong subsidiary, but will be based
in Taiwan after taking the new post, Chou added.</P>
      <P>Bender's appointment will become effective after approval from Taiwan's
regulator, a press statement from AIG said.</P>
      <P>Such an approval should not be a problem as Bender serves as "acting" CEO of Nan
Shan, an official with the Taiwan-based Financial Supervisory Commission's
Insurance Bureau said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Nan Shan executive told CNA that the
appointment of an acting CEO rather than a formal CEO would likely pave the way
for another attempt to sell the unit.</P>
      <P>AIG has been working to repay the U.S. government for a bailout that saved the
company two years ago.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong consortium comprising Primus Financial Holdings and China Strategic
Holdings in September terminated a deal to acquire Nan Shan after the Taiwan
government rejected its application.</P>
      <P>Lan, an active spokesman for the union, was relieved of his senior executive
position after the sale was rejected.</P>
      <P>The union staged a sit-in Sept. 28 to protest the Nan Shan management's
treatment of Lan.</P>

      <P>"Thanks to the program, I feel very relieved knowing that Chien-chien will come

      <P>A geographic information system (GIS) used to monitor the country's road system
proved effective at keeping motorists away from potentially dangerous roads when
Taiwan was struck by Typhoon Fanapi in mid-September, the Directorate General of
Highways (DGH) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The first-hand information provided by the system allowed the DGH to monitor
many vulnerable road sections and bridges prior to and during the storm and
reduce the risk of casualties, said Chen Shou-chiang, an engineer with the DGH's
Central Emergency Command Center.</P>
      <P>According to the DGH, the 18 road sections were completely blocked by landslides
and other natural obstacles triggered by the typhoon, and the other 48 that
suffered minor damage, were all tracked by the system.</P>
      <P>Because of the GIS, the agency was able to close off some roads and bridges
before the storm hit to prevent motorists from being caught in sudden road or

    <HEADLINE>Gov't to help puppet show company secure soft loans after fire</HEADLINE>

      <P>The government will help a venerable Taiwanese puppet show company secure
preferential loans to help it overcome the loss of invaluable puppets and other
props and equipment to a fire, Premier Wu Den-yih said Friday.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 puppets that formed a crucial part of Taiwan's folk cultural
heritage were destroyed Thursday when an early morning fire engulfed the studios
of the famous company, Pili International Multimedia Inc., in Tuku Township in
Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>The blaze raged for more than two hours before it could be extinguished.</P>
      <P>All of the company's puppets, manuscripts, stage props, film production
equipment and a number of newly completed films were burned to ashes, an
incalculable cultural loss, said Chris Huang, chairman of the puppet company
that produces films and video games featuring the puppets.</P>
      <P>The company estimated the monetary value of the losses sustained in the fire at
around NT$100 million (US$3.17 million).</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has contacted Mega Bank and other public banks to offer
preferential loans to the company, Wu said during a question-and-answer session
at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He added that both he and President Ma Ying-jeou had called Huang after the fire
to express their sympathy and made known their willingness to help.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to a question from a legislator, Wu said the
administration plans to establish a Taiwanese puppet show museum in Yunlin
County dedicated to helping preserve the legacy of the folk art.</P>
      <P>Huang comes from Taiwan's most prominent puppet family, whose members, including
his late grandfather Huang Hai-tai and his father Huang Chun-hsiung, have
maintained a tradition of finding new ways to advance the artistry of performing
with wooden puppets.</P>
      <P>Their creative performances and skillful management established the company  as
the living history  of Taiwan's  puppet show development.</P>
      <P>Huang, along with his brother Vincent, later took over the company's operations
with a younger generation's vision and passion, establishing Pili Multimedia and
bringing the company into the modern era.</P>
      <P>They adopted Hollywood production techniques, as well as computer animated
special effects and digital sound effects, that took the traditional artform to
a whole new level.</P>

      <P>A preliminary review of a construction site where a section of a No. 6 Freeway
interchange collapsed and killed seven workers found that there was no flaw in
the roadway's design, the body supervising the construction said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Dar-jen, head of the National Expressway Engineering Bureau, dismissed
speculation that an inappropriate design led to an overloading of an elevated
girder during the grouting process, triggering the collapse of the scaffolding.</P>
      <P>The elevated support girder can hold up to two times its designated weight,
Tseng said, but the actual weight of the cement poured into the section had
reached only one-third of the girder's capacity when the collapse occurred.</P>
      <P>The official also rejected speculation that the accident happened because the
contractor was rushing to meet the project's January 2011 due date. Tseng said
88 percent of the Beishan Interchange project had been completed when the
accident happened.</P>
      <P>"The construction project was definitely not rushed, " he said.</P>
      <P>The collapse of the scaffolding surprised the 10 workers at the site at the
time, one of whom was not a regular on the project. Seven were killed and the
three others were injured in the accident.</P>

      <P>Heavy rainfall brought by several storms in September has helped ease worries
that Taiwan will suffer water shortages during the fast approaching dry season,
the Water Resources Agency (WRA) said Friday.</P>
      <P>Water levels at Taiwan's major reservoirs are now generally above 80 percent of
capacity, ensuring a stable water supply for most of the country through next
spring, the WRA said.</P>
      <P>More than half of Taiwan's reservoirs are filled to more than 90 percent of
capacity, topped by Tsengwen Reservoir in southern Taiwan, which is nearly full,
according to WRA figures.</P>
      <P>Only four have water levels below 80 percent of their capacity: Taipei's Feitsui
Reservoir, Keelung City's Hsinshan Reservoir, Tainan County's Wushantou
Reservoir and Nantou County's Wushe Reservoir.</P>
      <P>Even those reservoirs, however, were replenished by Typhoon Fanapi on Sept. 17
and other weather fronts in recent weeks, helping relieve water shortages and
curtailing the need for water rationing around Taiwan, the WRA said.</P>
      <P>Despite the improved water supply situation, the WRA urged people to conserve
water whenever they could to help the country get through the dry season, which
runs from November to April.</P>

      <P>Control Yuan member Huang Huang-hsiung said Friday that the government should
implement proper policy measures to help community hospitals survive, as the
number of such hospitals decreased more than 30 percent over the past 15 years.</P>
      <P>He said that under the current system and standard of payments, community
hospitals -- which are considered to better meet social service needs -- find it
difficult to survive.</P>
      <P>"The government should consider how to provide sufficient support to community
hospitals in terms of policy, budget and payment system," Huang said at a press
conference.</P>
      <P>Many community hospital managers said that a lot of people prefer waiting in
medical center corridors to seeking help from community hospitals, he added.</P>
      <P>Since Taiwan introduced the national health insurance system 15 years ago, the
number of community hospitals dropped from 568 to 385, while the number of
medical centers and regional hospitals rose sharply, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He noted that in 1995, there were 13 medical centers and 48 regional hospitals
in Taiwan. As of the end of 2009, the number of medial centers had increased 77
percent to 23, while the number of regional hospitals rose by 62 percent to 78.</P>
      <P>Huang also said that in 2009, the volume of medical services provided by
community hospitals accounted for only 18.7 percent of the country's total
medical services, while medical centers and regional hospitals accounted for
41.2 percent and 37.7 percent respectively.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Court held a hearing Friday on whether to further extend the
detention of former President Chen Shui-bian, who has been held since Dec. 30,
2008 in connection with corruption and money laundering charges.</P>
      <P>Presiding judge Teng Chen-chiu said that the court would hand down a ruling on
whether Chen will remain detained for two more months before the current
extension expires on Oct. 18. The former president's detainment was previously
extended for three months in July.</P>
      <P>Chen said at the court hearing that he has been detained for 674 days and that
he has said "all he has to say." One should not assume that he has access to
channels of fleeing the country because he has been president, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that Teng had said that if he remitted all the money his family
held overseas back to Taiwan, he would have a good chance of being released.</P>
      <P>The former president said that he had remitted all US$18.43 million back. The
amount fell short of the US$21 million the prosecution alleged his family had
laundered to Swiss banks because of losses including processing fees and charges
for the early termination of investment contracts.</P>
      <P>"If the judge still won't release me on bail now that I've returned the money,
is he cheating me?" the former president asked.</P>
      <P>After the hearing, Chen returned to the Taipei Detention Center.</P>
      <P>He and his wife Wu Shu-jen were found guilty of corruption, forgery and money-
laundering in September 2009 and given life sentences, but the Taiwan High Court
reduced the sentences to 20 years on June 11.</P>
      <P>Chen, his wife and the Special Investigation Division under the Supreme

corruption agency under the Ministry of Justice, the low level of the proposed
agency immediately raised doubts about its effectiveness.</P>
      <P>Ma also said agency staff would be selected from existing members of the Bureau

another.</P>
      <P>An example is the recent corruption scandal that erupted over Taipei City's
Xinsheng Overpass improvement project. Huang Hsi-hsun, a former chief of the

      <P>The approval  obtained  by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the
world's largest contract chip maker, to upgrade the production technology at its
foundry in China is a "positive" for the company, a research note issued by
Macquarie Securities said Friday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs issued the green light to TSMC Wednesday,
allowing the company to upgrade the technology at its 8-inch wafer plant in
Shanghai to the 0.13 micron process from the current 0.18 micron process.</P>
      <P>"We view this as a positive, as the upgrade will boost TSMC's competitiveness, "
against companies such as China's Semiconductor International Corp., in product
categories that include driver ICs and complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
(CMOS) sensors,  the research note said.</P>
      <P>Macquarie said it expects the technology upgrade will boost TSMC's capacity in
China by 33.3 percent by the end of the first quarter of 2011, 55.6 percent by
the end of second quarter and 100 percent by the end of next year.</P>
      <P>The securities firm said the development will help TSMC gain a higher market
share in China.</P>
      <P>In late February, the government relaxed its restrictions on local foundry
investment in China by allowing chip makers to upgrade to the 0.13 micron
process from the 0.18 micro process.</P>
      <P>The relaxation came after the local high-tech industry strongly urged the
government to change its policy on fears Taiwanese companies in China would fall
behind foreign rivals that had applied to adopt the 0.13 micron process or even
more advanced technology in China.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Macquarie said TSMC's shipments in the fourth quarter are expected to
remain at about the same level as in the third quarter, a more optimistic
assessment than the market consensus projecting a 5-10 percent decline.</P>
      <P>The securities firm said orders placed by mobile customers, such as Qualcomm and
Broadcom, are expected to serve as the main engine of TSMC's sales in the fourth
quarter.</P>
      <P>Macquarie said it maintained a "neutral" recommendation on TSMC shares with a
12-month target price of NT$60.00.</P>
      <P>TSMC closed unchanged at NT$62.00 on Taiwan's stock exchange Friday.</P>

      <P>A tailor-made elastic bandage has helped reduce swelling in the arm of a two-
year-old Cambodian girl who checked into Taichung Veterans General Hospital in
central Taiwan for treatment on Aug. 28, her doctor said Friday.</P>
      <P>The young patient from Cambodia, Reachny Mich, whose condition has been
described as an "elephant arm, " was prescribed the elastic garment by pediatric
hematologist Chang Teh-kao.</P>
      <P>The sleeve reduced her right arm's circumference  from 31 centimeters two weeks
ago to 26 centimeters, Chang said at a news conference at the hospital.</P>
      <P>"It proves that our conservative therapy to reduce the massive swelling in her
arm has worked, " he said.</P>
      <P>The two-year-old was brought to Taiwan by her mother about one month ago for
examination and possible treatment of her arm, which weighed so much the girl
was unable to walk.</P>
      <P>Chang said Mich's right arm was four to five times larger than her left arm.  He
diagnosed  the girl with a rare case  of Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome, a
deformation of blood vessels and bones.</P>
      <P>The girl was fortunate as she has not suffered from arteriovenous malformation,
an abnormal connection between veins and arteries that would otherwise cause
heart failure, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"It is hoped that the circumference of the child's arm will decrease to about 20
centimeters in a month," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He said that doctors decided not to perform surgery on the child because they
felt she was too young and the surgery could cause complications.</P>
      <P>"It will take six months to one year for us to complete the current treatment.
We will make a new assessment if there is a problem with the sleeve," he said.</P>
      <P>Reachny Mich is expected to be released from the hospital in one month so she
and her mother can rent a home near the hospital and visit the doctor twice a
week, according to Hsu Yu-pi, a volunteer at the hospital.</P>
      <P>Hsu has been assisting the two with their finances as they seek medical
attention in Taiwan. They have also received a donation of NT$100,000 (US$3,125)
from Royal Philips Electronics.</P>

largest dealer in Taiwan said Friday.</P>
      <P>The CMI Group, which is also a major shareholder of Mercedes-Benz Taiwan Ltd.,
said at an event to mark its 40th anniversary that it was upbeat about Taiwan's
luxury car market because of the improving economic environment.</P>
      <P>A.A. Khoo, president of CMI, estimated that 7,000 Mercedes-Benz cars, priced at
an average of NT$2 million apiece, will be sold in Taiwan this year, compared to
more than 5,000 sold in 2009.</P>
      <P>"Although it takes about two to three months to deliver a car, most local buyers
are willing to wait, an indication of rising consumer confidence, " Khoo said at

      <P>The CMI president said that he expected Mercedes-Benz car sales in Taiwan to

      <P>Khoo expressed  optimism  over the prospects  for Taiwan's residential and
commercial real estate markets, even though the country's central bank raised
benchmark interest rates for the second time this year on Thursday.</P>
      <P>CMI Property Ltd., a subsidiary of the CMI Group, plans to develop a 132,000
square-meter plot of land into a high-tech industrial park in northern Taiwan's

      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) announced Friday that Taiwan will impose anti-
dumping duties retroactively on benzoyl peroxide made in China because it has
been sold in Taiwan at lower than market prices.</P>
      <P>The anti-dumping duties, which will range from 4.73 percent against three
specific companies to 59.70 percent against other Chinese exporters of the
chemical, will be levied over a five-year period beginning retroactively from
May 20 this year, according to the MOF's Department of Customs Administration.</P>
      <P>Benzoyl peroxide is a chemical compound often used as the active ingredient in
products to treat acne, dye hair or whiten teeth because of its antiseptic and
bleaching properties.</P>
      <P>The move was not the first time Taiwan had imposed anti-dumping duties on
products made in China.</P>
      <P>Chinese-made footwear has been subject to an anti-dumping duty of 43.46 percent
since March 16, 2007 while Chinese-made towels have been subject to an anti-
dumping duty of 204.1 percent since June 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>The two duties are scheduled to expire on March 15, 2012 and May 31, 2011

    <TEXT>
      <P>The workers' union for indebted American International Group's (AIG) Taiwan unit
called for dialogue with the company's new chief executive soon after he was
appointed on Friday, in the wake of a failed attempt by AIG to sell the unit.</P>
      <P>"We urge the new CEO to talk with us and to lead Nan Shan Life Insurance Co. to
operate in accordance with laws, " Wedding Lan, a spokesman for the union, told
the Central News Agency by telephone.</P>
      <P>Hours earlier, Nan Shan announced the appointment of Richard Bender, executive
vice president and chief agency officer at AIA (American International
Assurance) Hong Kong, as acting president and CEO to replace Frank Chan, who
retired.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan government rejected the sale of the unit to a Hong Kong consortium on
Aug. 31, voicing concern about the buyer's long-term capability and rights of
Nan Shan's workers.</P>
      <P>Lan blasted Nan Shan management for a lack of communication about the sale and
asked the new chief executive not to repeat the mistake.</P>
      <P>A dialogue will help the employees understand the management's difficulties in
running the Taiwanese insurer and help the management know how it can better
protect workers' rights, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that the workers' union would not necessarily oppose a deal to sell Nan
Shan, but doesn't want to see any possible negative impact on the company's
37,000 employees.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, AIG was mulling its options on whether it will sell its Taiwan unit
again, a Taiwanese spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>"AIG is now conducting a cautious assessment on the possible results of managing
Nan Shan on its own, putting it up for sale again or launching an initial public
offering (IPO), " Nan Shan spokeswoman Amanda Chou told CNA by telephone.</P>
      <P>She said the board meeting that chose Bender did not discuss the next step for
the Taiwanese insurer.</P>
      <P>Bender will keep his positions at AIG's Hong Kong subsidiary, but will be based
in Taiwan after taking the new post, Chou added.</P>
      <P>Bender's appointment will become effective after approval from Taiwan's
regulator, a press statement from AIG said.</P>
      <P>Such an approval should not be a problem as Bender serves as "acting" CEO of Nan
Shan, an official with the Taiwan-based Financial Supervisory Commission's
Insurance Bureau said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on condition of anonymity, a Nan Shan executive told CNA that the
appointment of an acting CEO rather than a formal CEO would likely pave the way
for another attempt to sell the unit.</P>
      <P>AIG has been working to repay the U.S. government for a bailout that saved the
company two years ago.</P>
      <P>A Hong Kong consortium comprising Primus Financial Holdings and China Strategic
Holdings in September terminated a deal to acquire Nan Shan after the Taiwan
government rejected its application.</P>
      <P>Lan, an active spokesman for the union, was relieved of his senior executive
position after the sale was rejected.</P>
      <P>The union staged a sit-in Sept. 28 to protest the Nan Shan management's
treatment of Lan.</P>

      <P>A German pharmaceutical company and the Ministry of Education (MOE) are funding
an after-school program for underprivileged elementary school students in Nantou
County, a school principal said Friday.</P>
      <P>Through the ministry's "Star Angel Project, " Bayer has since mid-September been
providing 14 disadvantaged students from Dehua Elementary School -- including
seven from the Tao aboriginal tribe -- with meals, tutoring programs and
aboriginal language classes, principal Liang Yu-chang said.</P>
      <P>The Tao tribe is the smallest recognized Taiwanese aboriginal tribe, with only
about 700 members throughout the country.</P>
      <P>One of the beneficiaries, a fourth grader who identified herself as "Chien-
chien, " lives with her 70-year-old grandmother and a physically disabled father
who struggles to provide for the family.</P>
      <P>"There is no one at home to teach me how to do school exercises," the girl said
at the press conference.</P>
      <P>The grandmother said she felt a lot of pressure when Chien-chien approached her
with questions from school because she was illiterate.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to the program, I feel very relieved knowing that Chien-chien will come
home with the answers, " the grandmother said, adding that the girl's grades
have improved over the past two weeks.</P>
      <P>Liu Chung-cheng, head of the Department of Education in Nantou County, said
there was still a lot of work to do.</P>
      <P>"There are approximately 5,200 students in Nantou who need help, but only 600
are taken care of. We welcome more assistance from the corporate world, " Liu
said.</P>
      <P>The MOE,  in cooperation with private companies and local organizations, began
the Star Angel Project in 2008 to provide children from disadvantaged families

    <TEXT>
      <P>A geographic information system (GIS) used to monitor the country's road system
proved effective at keeping motorists away from potentially dangerous roads when
Taiwan was struck by Typhoon Fanapi in mid-September, the Directorate General of
Highways (DGH) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The first-hand information provided by the system allowed the DGH to monitor
many vulnerable road sections and bridges prior to and during the storm and
reduce the risk of casualties, said Chen Shou-chiang, an engineer with the DGH's
Central Emergency Command Center.</P>
      <P>According to the DGH, the 18 road sections were completely blocked by landslides
and other natural obstacles triggered by the typhoon, and the other 48 that
suffered minor damage, were all tracked by the system.</P>
      <P>Because of the GIS, the agency was able to close off some roads and bridges
before the storm hit to prevent motorists from being caught in sudden road or
bridge collapses and it could also monitor the roads in real-time to keep
vehicles away soon after problems occurred.</P>
      <P>The DGH added that all 66 of the affected road sections were opened to traffic
by the end of September.</P>
      <P>The installation in April of the NT$1.3 million (US$41.000) cloud computing
system aimed at integrating information from relevant government branches to
enhance the response to natural disasters, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said the system has encouraged cross-department collaboration, with agencies
having access to the platform's database all able to share instant typhoon
information and local contacts to improve response efficiency.</P>
      <P>Participating agencies include the Central Weather Bureau, the National Science
and Technology Center for Disaster Reduction, the Water Resources Agency, and
the Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, according to the DGH.</P>
      <P>Until now, however, the system has been only partially open to the public due to
the Computer-Processed Personal Data Protection Law.</P>
      <P>"Technically speaking, the system is ready to go online anytime," Chen said. "We
hope a public edition without specific information will hit the road soon."</P>

      <P>The government will help a venerable Taiwanese puppet show company secure
preferential loans to help it overcome the loss of invaluable puppets and other
props and equipment to a fire, Premier Wu Den-yih said Friday.</P>
      <P>More than 2,000 puppets that formed a crucial part of Taiwan's folk cultural
heritage were destroyed Thursday when an early morning fire engulfed the studios
of the famous company, Pili International Multimedia Inc., in Tuku Township in
Yunlin County.</P>
      <P>The blaze raged for more than two hours before it could be extinguished.</P>
      <P>All of the company's puppets, manuscripts, stage props, film production
equipment and a number of newly completed films were burned to ashes, an
incalculable cultural loss, said Chris Huang, chairman of the puppet company
that produces films and video games featuring the puppets.</P>
      <P>The company estimated the monetary value of the losses sustained in the fire at
around NT$100 million (US$3.17 million).</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has contacted Mega Bank and other public banks to offer
preferential loans to the company, Wu said during a question-and-answer session
at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>He added that both he and President Ma Ying-jeou had called Huang after the fire
to express their sympathy and made known their willingness to help.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to a question from a legislator, Wu said the
administration plans to establish a Taiwanese puppet show museum in Yunlin
County dedicated to helping preserve the legacy of the folk art.</P>
      <P>Huang comes from Taiwan's most prominent puppet family, whose members, including
his late grandfather Huang Hai-tai and his father Huang Chun-hsiung, have
maintained a tradition of finding new ways to advance the artistry of performing
with wooden puppets.</P>
      <P>Their creative performances and skillful management established the company  as
the living history  of Taiwan's  puppet show development.</P>
      <P>Huang, along with his brother Vincent, later took over the company's operations
with a younger generation's vision and passion, establishing Pili Multimedia and
bringing the company into the modern era.</P>
      <P>They adopted Hollywood production techniques, as well as computer animated
special effects and digital sound effects, that took the traditional artform to

      <P>A preliminary review of a construction site where a section of a No. 6 Freeway
interchange collapsed and killed seven workers found that there was no flaw in
the roadway's design, the body supervising the construction said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tseng Dar-jen, head of the National Expressway Engineering Bureau, dismissed
speculation that an inappropriate design led to an overloading of an elevated
girder during the grouting process, triggering the collapse of the scaffolding.</P>
      <P>The elevated support girder can hold up to two times its designated weight,
Tseng said, but the actual weight of the cement poured into the section had
reached only one-third of the girder's capacity when the collapse occurred.</P>
      <P>The official also rejected speculation that the accident happened because the
contractor was rushing to meet the project's January 2011 due date. Tseng said
88 percent of the Beishan Interchange project had been completed when the
accident happened.</P>
      <P>"The construction project was definitely not rushed, " he said.</P>
      <P>The collapse of the scaffolding surprised the 10 workers at the site at the
time, one of whom was not a regular on the project. Seven were killed and the

      <P>Taiwan won its first medal in the FIBA Asia U18 Championship for Men since 2000
and a berth to represent Asia in the 2011 FIBA U19 World Championship after
edging Iran 65-60 in the bronze medal game in Sanaa, Yemen late Friday Taiwan
time.</P>
      <P>Hung Kang-chiao scored a team-high 18 points and Hu Lung-mao added 17 points as
Taiwan used a 14-5 run in the third quarter to control the momentum before
holding off Iran's furious rally in the final period.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which opened the biennial tournament with an overtime loss to the
defending champion Iran, limited the Iranians to a miserable 30 percent field
goal shooting percentage in the game for a sweet revenge.</P>
      <P>"We have improved a lot, haven't we? " Taiwan head coach Huang Wan-lung quipped
after the game, according to the post-game report on the FIBA Asia Web site.</P>
      <P>Taiwan last won a medal -- also a bronze -- in the biennial tourney in Kuala
Lumpur in 2000, when Huang served on the Taiwanese junior national team as an
assistant coach under South Korean head coach Chung Kwang Suk.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has never won the junior tournament. It won silver medals in 1972 and
1989 and took home bronze in 1974, 1987, 2000 and 2010. Two years ago, Taiwan
finished an all-time worst ninth place.</P>
      <P>With the win, Taiwan secured one of three Asian berths in the 2011 FIBA U19
World Championship, which will be held in Latvia from June 30 to July 10, 2011.
Taiwan's previous appearance in the world's top-level junior competition came 23
years ago, when they played at Bormio, Italy in 1987.</P>
      <P>China routed South Korea 103-80 in the title game to win its ninth gold in the
history of the tournament. The gold and silver medalists will also play in

    <TEXT>
      <P>At the United Nations General Assembly last week, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao
said China will "push forward political restructuring" while deepening its
economic restructuring.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that a Beijing leader has spoken of the necessity for
political reform by China at the United Nations, and was the fifth such remark
by Wen since Aug. 20.</P>
      <P>The lack of freedom and democracy within the Chinese Communist Party is the most
serious problem with China's totalitarian regime. So far, there have not been
signs that Wen is at risk of being purged, which can be seen as progress. There
are therefore calls in China for the protection of Wen.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, pushing for China's democratization is a more imperative issue than
having Beijing remove the missiles targeting Taiwan, because this is the
greatest debt the Chinese communists owe to China's modernization and its 1.3

      <P>Two abnormal phenomena are prevalent in the medical sector. Fewer medical
students are specializing in internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics
and gynecology, and more are concentrating on plastic surgery. The number of
practicing doctors switching to plastic surgery is also increasing, resulting in
a decrease in the number of life-saving doctors.</P>
      <P>The phenomena can be attributed to the heavy stress, difficult work and high
risk of being sued that life-saving doctors face. In addition, the income of
plastic surgeons is higher than hospital doctors because plastic surgery is not
covered by the National Health Insurance (NHI) and patients are required to foot
the bill by themselves.</P>
      <P>For example, a surgeon receives only around NT$50,000 in NHI reimbursement for a
unilateral mastectomy, while a plastic surgeon earns NT$100,000 for a thermacool
facelift procedure.</P>
      <P>Another problem is the low pay for new doctors. A National Taiwan University
medical school graduate who has just obtained a medical license must work 15
hours a day and sleep in the hospital at night, but they make only NT$40,000 to
NT$60,000 a month.</P>
      <P>The low-pay policy for young doctors is driving them away, which will leave the
nation critically short of specialist doctors.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Institute for Information Industry has unveiled a number of inventions
for better social networking, medical care and navigation at an invention fair
that runs through Sunday.</P>
      <P>The government-sponsored body designed a large white plastic capsule that
automatically provides pills at different times of the day, with music and
lights to prevent patients from forgetting to take their medication or taking
the wrong pills.</P>
      <P>"Users can set times on a small tablet device connected to the iCapsule by
wireless, helping elderly people take medicine correctly at proper times, " the
institute's media contact Chang Shu-yuan told the Central News Agency recently
at the Taipei International Invention Show and Technomart.</P>
      <P>The 18-by-7 centimeter device stands upright and drops pills into a dish from
seven differently colored compartments.</P>
      <P>"A patient can also take an individual compartment of pills with them if they
need to go out for the entire day, which is quite convenient, "she said.</P>
      <P>The invention will be one of the entries competing for the German International
Forum Design Award later this year, according to the institute.</P>
      <P>Another invention of the institute's is a small device called "pippo" that
allows users to quickly swap personal information through radio-frequency
identification with just one click of the device.</P>
      <P>The device is 3 centimeters in width and length and can be integrated with
social websites such as Facebook and Twitter.</P>
      <P>In addition to creating new inventions, the institute has demonstrated at the
fair how it can improve on existing technologies.</P>
      <P>For example, the institute made public "i-WANT" technology for navigation
devices or mobile phones.  I-WANT can increase the navigational accuracy of
these devices from the 5-20 meter range to a distance of 1-3 meters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Accident exposes foreign worker issues</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/02/10  15:03:50
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"Why there were illegal foreign laborers at a national expressway construction
project? " Premier Wu Den-yih asked Friday after an accident at a construction
site on the No. 6 Freeway in central Taiwan took seven lives a day earlier. Six
of the victims were later found to be runaway Indonesian workers.</P>
      <P>Wu instructed the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) and the Ministry of
Transportation  and  Communications  (MOTC)  to immediately investigate how the
contractors for the project were allowed to employ runaway foreign workers
without being brought to justice.</P>
      <P>He also asked relevant authorities to look into what caused the fatal collapse
of a 50-meter tall,  80-meter wide section of scaffolding used in the
construction of a freeway interchange.</P>
      <P>"Anyone found accountable should be brought to justice. Nobody should be let
off, " Wu said in a determining tone.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>CLA statistics showed that the number of foreign workers who are unaccounted for
has reached 33,000. "Where are they now? " Wu asked, suspecting the laborers,
who entered Taiwan legally but failed to show up at their declared place of
work, have been working in the country illegally.</P>
      <P>National Immigration Agency Director-General Hsieh Li-kung said the agency has
identified four of the six Indonesian victims -- three entered Taiwan as
"fishing workers, " and the other as a factory worker.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said he believed the increasing number of illegal foreign workers resulted
from a constant shortage of workers at construction sites and local employers'
practice of hiring illegal foreign workers to cut down the costs.</P>
      <P>"These are the culprits" that lured foreign workers away from the obligations of
their contracts, Hsieh said. (Oct. 2, 2011).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Bad policies were the leading reasons that pushed foreign laborers to leave the
workplace where they were legally employed. They included the fact foreign
workers from countries like Indonesia and Vietnam are all required to apply for
a loan -- no matter how unnecessary the money is to them -- from a bank in
Taiwan before they are permitted to come to the island for work.</P>
      <P>After they begin work, the laborers are also obliged to pay their broker
NT$1,700 (US$55) every month in fees. Some unethical brokers impose even more
charges.</P>
      <P>The wage system is also a problem. While the standard wage for a factory worker
who works eight hours a day is NT$17,280 a month, those hired as "family
workers" can have monthly salaries of only NT$15,840. Some of them have to work
around the clock if they attend sick, elderly people.</P>
      <P>In addition, light punishments for employing runaway foreign workers have also
been blamed for the growing number of illegal workers. (Oct. 2, 2011).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsuan stressed that all the contractors and subcontractors
for the freeway interchange  project  would be investigated following the fatal
collapse.</P>
      <P>Those found hiring runaway foreign workers will be fined up to NT$750,000, with
a prison sentence of up to three years for repeat offenders, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Although Premier Wu demanded a crackdown on the employment of runaway foreign
workers, officials had trouble finding efficient measures to carry out the
order.</P>
      <P>Chou Chun-teng, head of the CLA Central Region Inspection Office, said that in
their unannounced checks at construction sites, they seldom find illegal
workers. Their inspectors have to pass control personnel before being allowed to
enter the construction site, and the procedure exposes their mission, he said.

      <P>The Republic of the Fiji Islands has granted visa-free privileges to Taiwanese
passport holders, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The ministry said in a statement that Taiwanese citizens with hotel reservations
in Fiji and onward air tickets will be eligible for visa-free entry, entitling
them to stay for up to four months.</P>
      <P>The ministry said the decision by the Fijian government is expected to encourage
more Taiwanese tourists to go to the South Pacific country.</P>
      <P>The visa-free privileges are also expected to enhance business exchanges between
Taiwan and Fiji, according to the ministry.</P>
      <P>MOFA statistics show that around 2,000 Taiwanese tourists visit Fiji each year.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that since President Ma Ying-jeou took office in May 2008, one
of the government's diplomatic priorities has been to push for visa-free
privileges from countries that have no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>So far, a total of 33 countries, including New Zealand, Ireland, Britain, Japan,
South Korea and Singapore, have granted visa-free privileges to Taiwanese
tourists, the ministry said.</P>

      <P>A group of 80 foreign high school exchange students showed their affection for
Taiwan by sewing a banner Saturday composed of their countries' flags as a warm-
up event for next year's Republic of China centennial celebration.</P>
      <P>The three-meter by 13-meter patchwork banner, which includes the national flags
of 23 countries, will make its debut at this year's Double Ten national day
parade, in which more than 100 students from six continents will dress in
traditional costumes and carry the banner to symbolize the friendship between
Taiwan and the respective countries.</P>
      <P>The idea of making a multinational banner was pitched by the ROC Centenary
Foundation and the Rotary International District 3520 in the hope that more of
Taiwan's international friends can participate in honoring the country's
centennial.</P>
      <P>"One of the most important parts of the celebration is to increase Taiwan's
international exposure by letting the world see Taiwan, and we hope more of
Taiwan's foreign friends can join in the festivities," said the foundation's
Chou Cheng-feng.</P>
      <P>Proudly draping the Mexican flag on his back, Luis Rojom said he had always
wanted to visit Taiwan after learning about the country in his history classes.</P>

      <P>The process of securing visa-free privileges for Taiwanese tourists to the
European Union is "going smoothly" and the measure might be implemented soon,
Minister of Foreign Affairs Timothy C.T. Yang said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The visa-exemption treatment could be provided by the end of this year if
approved by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union," Yang
told reporters during a sightseeing tour of eastern Taiwan's Taitung County with
foreign ambassadors to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"I am cautiously optimistic about the matter, which has been proceeding
smoothly," he said.</P>
      <P>According to ministry spokesman James Chang,  the European Commission, the EU's
executive arm, submitted a proposal in July suggesting that the EU include
Taiwan on its Schengen visa-free privilege list.</P>
      <P>A working panel of the Council of the European Union and the Committee on
Foreign Affairs of the European Parliament discussed the proposal in September
and were both positive about granting Taiwanese visitors visa-free privileges,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>He added that the Council of European Commission and the European Parliament are
slated to hold meetings in October or November to screen and vote on the matter.</P>
      <P>The Schengen Area comprises the territories of 25 European countries, which
include 22 EU member states and three-non EU states -- Norway, Iceland and
Switzerland.</P>
      <P>The visa-waiver program is also applicable to three non-Schengen EU member
states -- Romania, Bulgaria and Cyprus.</P>
      <P>The Schengen Area operates very much like a single state for international
travel purposes, with border controls for travelers traveling in and out of the
area, but with no internal border controls.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has so far been given visa-exemption privileges by 33 countries,
including New Zealand, Ireland, Britain, Japan and South Korea.</P>

      <P>The value of public works designated by the government for participation by the
private sector is expected to exceed NT$200 billion (US$6.39 billion)  in 2011,
the Public Construction Commission said Friday.</P>
      <P>The commission said the government has selected 57 public works projects worth
about NT$171.3 billion to be offered to private contractors next year, and is
studying other potential infrastructure development programs for participation
by the private sector.</P>
      <P>Among the 57 projects are a Taichung metro system development plan, an economic
and trade zone development plan for Kinmen, and four land development  plans in
Taipei's Xinyi district,  the commission said.</P>
      <P>The government is hoping to lower its financial burden and stimulate economic
activity by encouraging the private sector to invest in infrastructure projects
through a variety of business models.</P>
      <P>Under the Act for Promotion  of Private Participation  in Infrastructure
Projects, the government offers the private sector incentives such as relaxed
rules on land acquisition and preferential tax status to encourage investment.</P>

      <P>A fatal accident at a construction site on a freeway in central Taiwan that

However, the award budget has never been used up, the council said.</P>
      <P>The CLA is considering increasing the amount, it said.</P>
      <P>CLA statistics show that since Taiwan began to import workers from countries

a press conference Saturday.</P>
      <P>IMFeD, or identification and management of feeding difficulties, a tool based on
six classifications of feeding difficulty, is already widely applied in some

      <P>IMFeD consists of a tear-off questionnaire that parents can easily complete

feeding difficulty.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons contributing to feeding difficulties, said Chao Hsun-
chin, a doctor from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital who specializes in pediatric
gastroenterology and hepatology.</P>
      <P>Chao said that because the questionnaire narrows down the possible causes into

      <P>Four out of six Indonesian workers killed in a freeway construction collapse
have been identified and officials have been working round the clock to identify
the other two, an immigration official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Seven workers, including the six Indonesians, were killed and two others were
injured after a sprawling network of scaffolding at a construction site for a
No. 6 Freeway exit ramp collapsed Sept. 30.</P>
      <P>As of Saturday, the four identified workers were 29-year-old Sutarji, 24-year-
old Sunaryo, 31-year-old Suprapto and 20-year-old Sirmanto, according to Chang
Chi, deputy director-general of the National Immigration Agency (NIA).</P>
      <P>According to the NIA, the six workers were all undocumented migrant workers who
had fled their previous employers and had overstayed their visas for up to three
years.</P>
      <P>The agency was working closely with the Indonesian Economic and Trade Office in
Taipei -- Indonesia's representative office in Taiwan -- and the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs to help the families of the dead workers to get to Taiwan as
soon as possible, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The accident has brought up widespread social ramifications, with Premier Wu
Den-yih pledging to enforce a crackdown on undocumented foreign workers and
domestic employers and contractors who illegally hire migrant workers.</P>
      <P>Wu has also instructed the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to uphold the human
rights of the dead workers and to provide their families with as much assistance
as possible.</P>
      <P>There were 151,723 Indonesian workers in Taiwan as of the end of August,
according to figures from the Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training under
the CLA. The number accounted for more than 40 percent of the 372,146 migrant

      <P>A U.S. scholar has expressed support for Taiwan's policy of opening its
universities to Chinese students, saying the step is essential if Taiwanese
universities are to stay competitive.</P>
      <P>According to William C. Kirby, a distinguished service professor at  Harvard
University  and  a historian  of  modern  China, internalization is a big
challenge for universities both in Taiwan and the United States when their
counterparts in China are growing fast  in size  and  quality  and  are
becoming  increasingly internationalized.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and the United States have to move fast to recruit the very best from
anywhere, " Kirby said in a dialogue with President Ma Ying-jeou that was
featured in the latest edition of Ma's online video journal released Saturday.</P>
      <P>Kirby pointed out that universities in China are getting stronger by recruiting
students and faculty not only from all over China but also from Hong Kong,
Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>The School of Economics and Management of Tsinghua University, for example, has
a high percentage of foreign students and half of its courses are taught in
English, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, however, enjoys great advantages that are not found in China, such as
democracy, rule of law and a long-standing spirit of open inquiry, he said.</P>
      <P>"If its (Taiwan's) education system can truly be as open as its economy has
become and seek the best faculty and the best students from all sources, it will
be the best in Asia, and it will be a natural magnet for talent in the coming
decade," Kirby said.</P>
      <P>Ma for his part said the recognition of Chinese diplomas and the admission of
Chinese students to universities in Taiwan are the first steps in
internationalizing Taiwan's universities.</P>
      <P>"A democratic and free society cannot close its doors, nor can it be an ostrich"
with its head in the sand, Ma said.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan reiterated Saturday that
"putting Taiwan first for the benefit of the people" is the highest principle of
Taiwan's China policy and that the people of Taiwan have the right to choose the
future direction of cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar in Taipei on continuity and changes in cross-strait
relations from 2008 to 2010, Lai said the core rights of Taiwan's people are a
key foundation for developing cross-strait relations and she noted that
democracy, sovereignty and security are rights that should be protected.</P>
      <P>"It also needs to be ensured that the people have the right to decide the future
development of cross-strait relations, " Taiwan's top China policy planner said.</P>
      <P>Lai said the people of Taiwan  should have the right to meaningfully take part
in international affairs, compete in a fair trade environment  and not be
discriminated  against by other countries.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has the right to negotiate and sign economic agreements with its trade
partners," she added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's underprivileged traditional industries, agriculture and labor should be
protected by the government during the process of regional integration, she
said.</P>
      <P>Once those core rights and interests  are understood  and respected, cross-
strait relations can be developed in a healthy way, Lai said.</P>

      <P>A research institute unveiled Saturday a Taiwan-developed technology for
producing biofuel from microalgae, as part of efforts to target the growing
environmentally friendly renewable energy industry.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) , which developed  the
technology,  showed off the process of turning microalgae into biodiesel at the
four-day Taipei International Invention Show and Technomart exhibition organized
by the Taiwan External Trade Development Council and scheduled to end the
following day.</P>
      <P>Microalgae, which has extraordinary potential for cultivation as an energy crop,
consumes large quantities of carbon dioxide and produces oxygen through
photosynthesis.</P>
      <P>During the process of consuming carbon dioxide, microalgae turns carbon dioxide
into materials containing oil. The ITRI uses these materials to produce crude
lipids that can then be converted into biodiesel. According to the ITRI, one
gram of algae will produce 0.5 grams of lipids.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is encircled by the ocean, which makes it very convenient for obtaining
microalgae to produce biodiesel, " said Lin Yun-hui, a manager of the ITRI's
biofuel laboratory.</P>
      <P>Lin said a liter of ocean water contains 1 gram of microalgae, which can be
multiplied to about 5 grams after a week of cultivation.</P>
      <P>"However, we have invented multi-layer filters that are able to boost the
density of the microalgae in ocean water and extract about 120-150 grams from a
single liter of ocean water," Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, Lin noted that production costs of microalgae biodiesel are high and
said it remains to be seen when such fuel will be commercially viable.</P>
      <P>The ITRI's microalgal biofuel production technology development has been
financially sponsored by the Bureau of Energy under the Ministry of Economic
Affairs in a four-year project that started in 2009 and will cost a total of

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan weighs subsidized IVF to boost birth rate</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government is weighing the feasibility of subsidizing in-vitro fertilization
(IVF) treatment in an effort to slow the continuing decline in the birth rate, a
Department of Health (DOH) official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>If the subsidy program is adopted and offered to infertile couples, the official
said, the number of newborns could increase by an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 a
year.</P>
      <P>Chao Kun-yu, deputy director-general of the DOH's Bureau of Health Promotion
(BHP), said the bureau has drafted two potential IVF subsidy programs for the
reference of the Ministry of the Interior's (MOI's) Population Policy Committee.</P>
      <P>One of the proposals requires the government to offer each infertile couple
NT$50,000 (US$1,609) in IVF subsidies per year, while the other calls for an
annual subsidy of NT$150,000, Chao said.</P>
      <P>"The first option would cost the national coffers about NT$600 million per year,
and the needed outlay would spike to NT$2.2 billion if the second option were to
be adopted," Chao said.</P>
      <P>According to DOH statistics, more than 6,000 local married couples receive IVF
treatment each year, with some couples receiving multiple treatments in a single
year, Chao said.</P>
      <P>The BHP has assessed that the number of IVF treatments would increase by 50
percent if the government were to subsidize each couple by NT$50,000 a year and
could double if the subsidy was raised to NT$150,000.</P>
      <P>IVF, which costs between NT$150,000 and NT$250,000 per treatment, is not covered
by the national health insurance program.</P>
      <P>According to Chao, the MOI asked the BHP to assess the efficacy of subsidizing
IVF treatment after Tseng Chi-jui, dean of Taipei Medical University's College
of Medicine came up with the proposal recently.</P>
      <P>Tseng, an expert in reproductive medicine, said the government's plan to offer
child-rearing subsidies for third and subsequent children under two years of age
would be less effective  in encouraging people to have more children than
offering IVF subsidies.</P>
      <P>"The government should follow the lead of Japan, South Korea and Singapore and
subsidize IVF, which would be far more effective in raising our country's birth
rate, " Tseng wrote in an article carried in a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>BHP Director-General Chiu Shu-ti echoed Tseng's view Saturday, saying that the
MOI-proposed incentives to encourage married couples to have second or third
children are ineffective because most couples only want one child.</P>
      <P>Chiu said she looks forward to an early launch of the subsidy program to help
promote child birth.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's fertility rate -- the average number of children born to a woman over
her lifetime -- has been on a steady decline since reaching 1.6 in 2001. It hit
a low of 1.03 in 2009, the world's second lowest, higher only than that of
Germany.</P>
      <P>A biennial demographic assessment released by the Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) in August said the country's fertility rate could drop
further to an estimated 0.94 this year because of the traditional superstition
that the Year of the Tiger is not a good time for babies to be born.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also lagged behind other major Asian countries in terms of birth rate
-- the average annual number of births during a year per 1,000 persons in the
population.</P>
      <P>According to the latest CEPD estimate, Taiwan's population will reach zero
population growth in 2022, four years earlier than previously forecast.</P>

that the Year of the Tiger is not a good time for babies to be born.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also lagged behind other major Asian countries in terms of birth rate
-- the average annual number of births during a year per 1,000 persons in the
population.</P>
      <P>According to the latest CEPD estimate, Taiwan's population will reach zero
population growth in 2022, four years earlier than previously forecast.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: The Jody Chiang phenomenon</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/03/10  14:12:48</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>After over 30 years in the trade, Jody Chiang, one of the most successful
singers of her generation in Taiwan, has been all the more remarkable in recent
concerts -- to the thrill of audiences of all ages.</P>
      <P>Tickets to Chiang's latest concerts have been sold at amazing speed, and she has
been forced to add additional dates to satisfy her fans.</P>
      <P>Chiang, who started her singing career at the age of 12 in Japanese-style pubs
in Taipei and went on to become a pop queen, singing in Taiwanese, won the
hearts of the audiences not only because her evergreen popularity backed up by
her numerous classics, but also because of her amazing singing voice, which
enthralls practically anyone who hears it.</P>
      <P>She has not been absent from Taiwan's pop music arena for a single year and has
remained popular on all stages -- from club performances in the years when
Taiwan's economy was taking off, to TV shows some 20 years ago, to live concerts
in the high-technology era in the most recent decade.</P>
      <P>Her songs have, in a certain sense, become a window of Taiwanese people's
collective sentiments and morale over the decades -- ranging from life's anxiety
and uncertainties, to the loneliness of people who have left their homes to work
in the cities.</P>
      <P>Let's embrace the valuable phenomenon of Jody Chiang, who has been nicknamed by
many as "the second sister." She is actually the sister of everybody in Taiwan.

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Give foreign laborers viable options</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Council  of Labor Affairs  (CLA)
10/03/10  16:19:29
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chairwoman Wang Ju-hsuan said Saturday that her council will convene a meeting
at the end of this month to study whether to allow foreign laborers to switch
employers freely to reduce the number of foreign laborers who abscond from their
jobs.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks after a fatal accident at a construction site on the No. 6
Freeway in central Taiwan earlier in the week. Six of the victims were later
found to be runaway Indonesian workers.</P>
      <P>Foreign workers on Taiwan's public construction projects reportedly have to
spend at least half of their permitted time in Taiwan -- 18 months -- simply to
pay back their labor brokerage fees. Some are even forced to return to their
countries before they have repaid these fees, which encourages them to leave
their jobs and seek illegal work.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Foreign labor rights groups believe that the main reason foreign workers abscond
is because they cannot switch employers freely. For this reason, what the
government should do is not step up a crackdown on foreign workers, but allow
them to switch employers freely, the groups said.</P>
      <P>In response, Wang said that the matter will be discussed in a meeting on foreign
labor policy later this month.</P>
      <P>To protect the rights of employers, if the policy is put into practice, there
will also need to be complementary measures, such as giving the original
employers notice of three months or longer to allow them time to find
replacements.</P>
      <P>At present, foreign laborers can switch jobs and are not subject to restrictions
of region or sector. For example, a foreign caregiver in Pingtung can switch
jobs to work in a factory in Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>However, as a change of job requires the consent of both the original and
prospective employers, if the employers do not agree to the switch, foreign
laborers still find that the easiest option is to abscond and work illegally.</P>
      <P>The human rights advocates have therefore asked for further easing of
restrictions, allowing foreign laborers to more easily switch jobs. (Oct. 3,
2010)</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Ku Yu-ling, president of the Taiwan International Workers' Association, said
that those foreign laborers who are able repay their brokerage fees are the
lucky ones.</P>
      <P>She noted that many factories in Taiwan closed during the financial crisis that
began two years ago, and that many foreign workers lost their jobs after just a
few months in Taiwan, leaving them heavily in debt.</P>
      <P>Ku said foreign workers have to pay on average between NT$80,000 and NT$250,000
in brokerage fees, and added that according to the results of a survey, foreign
workers have to spend at least 18 months "working for nothing."</P>
      <P>In addition, a large number of foreign workers employed as caregivers reportedly
have to work very long hours.</P>
      <P>These caregivers are nominally employed only to take care of patients, but are
often also expected to clean and cook, with no time off.</P>
      <P>Foreign workers working in Taiwanese homes are divided into two groups --
housemaids and caregivers. However, the conditions for employing a housemaid are
strict and only around 2,000 families in Taiwan can meet the requirements.</P>
      <P>Employing a caregivers, however, is much easier, and about 180,000 families
apply to employ them. Although the conditions for employing them are more lax,
they should only be tasked with caring for designated patients and should not be
asked to do other household work.</P>
      <P>But Ku said that because caregivers work within families, the authorities are
usually unable to monitor them, and employers often simply treat them as
servants. (Oct. 3, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau (CWB) has said that its weather forecasting
service on the world's largest social networking site, Facebook, has been
blocked "for unknown reasons" for about a week.</P>
      <P>The bureau said in a Sept. 29 statement that it had been barred from posting
Facebook messages since Sept. 27.</P>
      <P>In a recent notice to the bureau, Facebook cited a "violation of user rules" as
a reason for the ban, according to the bureau's statement.</P>
      <P>The bureau  has received  no response  from  the Facebook administrators,
despite repeated requests for an explanation for the ban, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Liu Guo-long,  deputy head of the bureau's  Meteorological Information Center,
told Taiwan's Chinese-language daily Liberty Times Sept. 30 that the bureau had
read all the Facebook rules and still was at a loss as to what rules it had
violated.</P>
      <P>The bureau therefore simply started a similar service on a new Facebook account,
the statement reads.</P>
      <P>The banned page had attracted 25,371 followers since it was set up June 10,
while the new page had already attracted 1,006 followers.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 4, Facebook imposed a ban on a CWB official who used the website in a
private capacity to issue weather forecasts, because he posted copyright-
protected photographs.</P>

      <P>A string of four earthquakes, including a magnitude 5 temblor, jolted Taiwan's
northeastern Yilan area early Sunday morning, with no casualties reported,
according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>The magnitude 5 quake occurred at 3: 23 a.m., with its epicenter located 6.9 km
southwest of the county's Nanao, according to the CWB's Seismology Center.</P>
      <P>The temblor also had an intensity of 5.0 in Taroko Gorge and Hoping Rural
Township in the neighboring county of Hualien, according to the center.</P>
      <P>The quake had an intensity of 4.0 in the townships of Suao and Luodong in Yilan
County and at Hehuanshan in central Nantou County, the center said.</P>
      <P>Earthquake monitoring stations in other areas north of the southern county of
Chiayi also recorded the jolt, center officials said.</P>
      <P>The magnitude 5 temblor was followed by three aftershocks before 6: 35 a.m. that
day -- of magnitudes of 3.5, 3.1 and 3.1, respectively.</P>
      <P>Center officials said the four jolts were normal seismological activity that
helped release accumulations of tectonic pressure that regularly builds up in
the area.</P>
      <P>Eastern Taiwan is located on a juncture between the Philippine Sea and the
Eurasian tectonic plates, where underground activity is common and tectonic
pressure regularly builds up, according to Kuo Kai-wen, director of the CWB's
Seismology Center.</P>
      <P>The center welcomed 10 mild earthquakes, including a magnitude 5.1 temblor, that
shook Hualien County over 15 hours from Sept. 28 as constructive  tectonic

      <P>A fire that broke out early Sunday at a plant belonging to Nanya Plastics Corp.,
one of the pivotal companies of the Formosa Plastic Group (FPG) , has created
another great challenge faced by the group since two fires at its petrochemical
complex in Yunlin County in July.</P>
      <P>"The damage caused by the fire is hard to estimate. It's gone, " said Chen Wen-
yang, a deputy manager of the plant, after the fire, which broke out at around
8:30 a.m.</P>
      <P>The Nanya Second Plant, located in Taibao City in the southern county of Chiayi,
is Taiwan's only manufacturer of high-class, waterproof synthetic paper known as
White Pearl, or PEPA, used mainly for labeling bottles.</P>
      <P>According  to the results of an initial investigation  by firefighters, the fire
was found to have probably been caused by a leakage of fuel oil in the plant's
electrical control room.</P>
      <P>The fire engulfed the plant,  which had stocks of resin, methylbenzene and
lubricant, sending billows of black smoke into the air for several hours. As of
noon, the fire still had not been extinguished.</P>
      <P>No injuries were reported, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Plant authorities said that the chemicals are not classed as controlled
substances, but warned that contact with the smoke from the fire could cause
skin irritation.</P>
      <P>Chiayi Magistrate Chang Hwa-kuan immediately went to the scene of the blaze,
where she announced the fire to be a major industrial hazard.</P>
      <P>She ordered the establishment of an emergency response center, blocked off
access to areas surrounding the plant and set up a medical attention station.</P>
      <P>Nearly 100 residents from nearby boroughs staged protests at the plant to vent
their anger after the fire.</P>
      <P>The protesters demanded compensation on a par with that offered by FPG to
residents in Yunlin after the two fires that occurred there in July, according
to Yeh Chuan-cheng, a borough chief.</P>
      <P>The FPG agreed in August to pay up to NT$500 million (US$15.63 million) in
compensation for the agricultural and fishery losses caused by the two fires.</P>

      <P>A spate of recent incidents over the past few months has triggered  heated
debate on the issue of balancing  economic development with environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>Even if there have been short-term compromises in the wake of the incidents --
two fires at a petrochemical complex belonging to Formosa Plastics Group in
Yunlin, controversy over a proposed petrochemical plant in Changhua and
confrontation over a proposed biotech park in a military complex in suburban
Taipei -- we have yet to see anyone put forward a convincing long-term opinion.</P>
      <P>This has resulted in confrontations  or standoffs  between developers and
environmentalists, but we are afraid that if the standoffs persist, then
polarized views might appear in the end, with some even advocating using extreme
measures to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>We are worried about such a development and hope to find a basis for dialogue
between the two sides to ease the confrontation. Neither side should be pushed
to extremes to the point that it refuses to compromise.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of future generations, environmental protection vs.
economic development should not be an extreme zero-sum game mindset.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in Tokyo has launched a probe into a report
published Sunday by the Sankei Simbun newspaper that the United States and Japan
are slated to hold a joint military exercise in November as a mock operation to
retake the Tiaoyutai Islands if China occupies them, Foreign Ministry spokesman
James Chang said that day.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Republic of China's sovereignty claim over the islands is
unquestionable and that the government of Taiwan will closely monitor the
situation.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the U.S. navy and Japanese maritime forces are likely
to hold the joint drill immediately after President Barack Obama's visit to
Japan next month for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.</P>
      <P>Chang reiterated Taiwan's sovereignty over the island chain located in the East
China Sea, saying that the Tiaoyutais, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan,
are an indivisible part of ROC territory.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan spokeswoman Sheila Paskman later reiterated
Washington's long-standing stance on the issue that the U.S. does not have a
position on the question of the ultimate sovereignty of the islands.</P>
      <P>"We expect the claimants to resolve this issue through peaceful means among
themselves, " she said without making any direct comment on the report of the
naval exercise.</P>
      <P>However, she said the islands fall within the scope of Article 5 of the 1960
U.S.-Japan Treaty on Mutual Cooperation and Security because they have "been
under the administrative control of the government of Japan since 1972."</P>
      <P>The islands are claimed by Taiwan,  China and Japan. The contention between
Japan and China was further inflamed when the Japanese Coast Guard detained a
Chinese trawler captain Sept. 7 following a collision between his vessel and a
Japanese patrol boat in waters near the islands.</P>
      <P>The captain was released only after China's Foreign Ministry issued a stern
statement warning Japan that if he was not released, China would take "strong
counter-measures for which Japan would have to take all the consequences."</P>
      <P>The islands, which lie north of Taiwan and south of Japan's Okinawa prefecture,
are surrounded by teeming fishing grounds and are believed to sit atop rich oil
and gas deposits.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-hsuan promised Sunday to hold a
meeting in two weeks to discuss the issue of runaway migrant workers after a
construction accident Sept. 30 killed seven workers, six of whom were
undocumented migrant workers from Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Wang said in Taichung City, central Taiwan that the CLA will pursue all legal
means to get to the bottom of the incident, and that the government will remain
vigilant and impartial on the matter.</P>
      <P>Preliminary investigation results show that the contractors and subcontractors
involved in the construction accident on the No. 6 Freeway hired the six runaway
Indonesian workers via an individual contractor surnamed Huang, said the
minister.</P>
      <P>The seven workers died when a section of scaffolding collapsed at a construction
site at Nantou County's Beishan Interchange.</P>
      <P>It was further reported that the other victim, a Taiwanese national, was
uninsured, disqualifying his family from receiving any compensation.</P>
      <P>Wang said employers are legally obliged to provide insurance for their workers
and that the CLA, along with the National Immigration Agency and the National
Expressway Engineering Bureau, will conduct a thorough investigation into the
matter to ensure justice for all the parties involved.</P>
      <P>The incident not only highlighted the issue of work site safety, but also the
perennial problem of runaway migrant workers, prompting the CLA to mull the
possibility of loosening the current policy on minimum contract periods for
foreign hires.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, CLA statistics show that each year, over 10,000 migrant
workers run away from their employers. The main motivation for absconding is
their inability to switch employers during the duration of their contracts, said
Wang.</P>
      <P>In order for employees to change job sites or employers, the law requires them
to finish out the terms prescribed in the contract and to leave the country
before they can re-enter Taiwan via a paid broker.</P>
      <P>Wang acknowledged that many human rights groups have long denounced that policy,
which binds migrant workers to a certain employer and said it is these stringent
regulations that have driven many unhappy workers to run away.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei Flora Expo to begin three-week trial run Oct. 9</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Taipei city government is planning a three-week trial run of the 2010 Taipei
International Flora Expo in a bid to iron out any kinks ahead of the official
Nov. 6 opening, an organizer said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Expo official Ting Hsi-yung said the four-stage trial run will start with the
Yuanshan Park exhibition area and then expand to other venues -- Fine Arts Park,
Xinsheng Park, Dajia Riverside Park areas. The number of visitors will also
gradually be increased from 5,000 to 10,000 daily, he said.</P>
      <P>During the last stage, scheduled for Oct. 25-28, almost all the exhibition areas
will be opened and the number of visitors increased to between 60,000 and 70,000
daily.</P>
      <P>"We expect to have around 500,000 visitors during the 20-day trial run period,
which will simulate the real number of visitors after the hard opening," Ting
said.</P>
      <P>However, some city councilors said the trial run might fail to reflect the real
situation.</P>
      <P>Councilor Huang Hsiang-chun  said the city government  has estimated that after
the formal opening, daily weekday visitors could reach 20,000, with a possible
106,000 during weekends and 152,000 during national holidays.</P>
      <P>The gap between the "real" number of up to 152,000 and the "simulated" figure of
a maximum of 70,000 is too big and cannot be counted as a real test, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang's colleague Chen Yu-mei said the trial run is "too conservative " and
suggested that the organizers should "prepare for the worst" regarding traffic
controls and an influx of visitors during the trial run.</P>
      <P>Volunteer firefighters, ward heads, tour guides, teachers in charge of field
trips, underprivileged groups, workers unions, and expo sponsors will be invited
to attend the trial run.</P>
      <P>Taipei residents can register with their ward chiefs to apply for free passes to
the exhibition, but this will not be extended to residents of other cities and
counties for the time being.</P>
      <P>The expo, which will run through April 25, 2011, will open just three weeks
before the Taipei mayoral election, in which incumbent Mayor Hau Lung-bin is
seeking re-election.</P>
      <P>Hau, who has been plagued by a scandal surrounding overpriced materials for the
Xinsheng Overpass project, is hoping that a smooth opening will boost his
approval rating.</P>

      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) dispatched a
toxic disaster response team to a plant belonging to Nanya Plastics Corp. in the
southern county of Chiayi Sunday after a fire engulfed the plant, causing
massive air pollution.</P>
      <P>Nanya Plastics Corp, one of the pivotal companies of the Formosa Plastics Group
(FPG), was ordered by the Chiayi County government to immediately suspend
operations in the wake of the fire that took eight hours to extinguish.</P>
      <P>The county government also handed out a fine of NT$1 million (US$31,250) to
Nanya for the severe air pollution caused by the fire. Although the levels of
sulfides and nitrogen oxide in the black smoke that billowed from the plant were
within allowable levels, the odor concentration of the smoke far exceeded
allowable levels, said the Chiayi County Environmental Protection Department.</P>
      <P>The fire, which broke out at around 8: 30 a.m. that day, engulfed the plant,
which had stocks of resin, methylbenzene and lubricant, sending thick black
smoke into the air for several hours. The fire was not extinguished until 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>No injuries were reported.</P>
      <P>The Nanya Second Plant, located in Taibao City in the southern county of Chiayi,
is Taiwan's only manufacturer of high-class, waterproof synthetic paper known as
White Pearl, or PEPA, used mainly for labeling bottles.</P>
      <P>The fire dealt another heavy blow to FPG after two fires at the group's
petrochemical complex in Yunlin County in July.</P>
      <P>FPG Chairman Wang Wen-yuan was reported  to be monitoring developments closely
since the fire broke out and was said to have instructed Nanya Plastics Corp.'s
President, Wu Chia-chao, to "handle the aftermath properly."</P>
      <P>Wu estimated that the damage caused to the plant was as high as roughly NT$150
million and that about 30 percent of its production lines were destroyed.</P>
      <P>"Part of the production will be now be taken over by Nanya's two other plants in
Chiayi County and China," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The Nanya Second Plant used to produce some 2,000 tons of PEPA a month, worth
between NT$100 million and NT$150 million, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>The results of an initial investigation by firefighters suggested that the fire
was probably caused by a leakage of fuel oil in the plant's electrical control
room.</P>
      <P>Chiayi Magistrate Chang Hwa-kuan immediately went to the scene of the blaze,
where she announced that the fire had been designated as a major industrial
hazard.</P>
      <P>She ordered the establishment of an emergency response center, blocked off
access to areas surrounding the plant and set up a medical attention station.</P>
      <P>Nearly 100 residents from nearby boroughs staged protests at the plant to vent
their anger after the fire.</P>
      <P>The protesters demanded compensation on a par with that offered by FPG to
residents in Yunlin after the two fires that occurred there in July, according
to Yeh Chuan-cheng, a borough chief.</P>
      <P>The FPG agreed in August to pay up to NT$500 million in compensation for the
agricultural and fishery losses caused by the two fires.</P>

      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Sunday that Taiwan's public education program
should put more stress on technical and vocational training to help the country
cultivate skilled personnel and improve its competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an award ceremony for the 40th National Skills Competition held in
Taichung City, central Taiwan, Siew said manpower cultivation is a major way of
continuing Taiwan's economic miracle, since the country lacks natural resources.</P>
      <P>"Once you have developed your own skills, you will be able to live a more self-
sufficient life," he said.</P>
      <P>Taking Germany as an example, Siew said the vocational schools within that
country's education system have helped Germany emerge as an industrial power.</P>
      <P>He added that an improved talent pool could also increase Taiwan's international
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>The education authorities  should work together to promote vocational education
at a deeper level, especially in the area of training teachers and improving

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau (CWB) has said that its weather forecasting
service on the world's largest social networking site, Facebook, has been
blocked "for unknown reasons" for about a week.</P>
      <P>The bureau said in a Sept. 29 statement that it had been barred from posting
Facebook messages since Sept. 27.</P>
      <P>In a recent notice to the bureau, Facebook cited a "violation of user rules" as
a reason for the ban, according to the bureau's statement.</P>
      <P>The bureau  has received  no response  from  the Facebook administrators,
despite repeated requests for an explanation for the ban, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Liu Guo-long,  deputy head of the bureau's  Meteorological Information Center,
told Taiwan's Chinese-language daily Liberty Times Sept. 30 that the bureau had
read all the Facebook rules and still was at a loss as to what rules it had
violated.</P>
      <P>The bureau therefore simply started a similar service on a new Facebook account,
the statement reads.</P>
      <P>The banned page had attracted 25,371 followers since it was set up June 10,
while the new page had already attracted 1,006 followers.</P>
      <P>On Sept. 4, Facebook imposed a ban on a CWB official who used the website in a
private capacity to issue weather forecasts, because he posted copyright-
protected photographs.</P>

      <P>A string of four earthquakes, including a magnitude 5 temblor, jolted Taiwan's
northeastern Yilan area early Sunday morning, with no casualties reported,
according to the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>The magnitude 5 quake occurred at 3: 23 a.m., with its epicenter located 6.9 km
southwest of the county's Nanao, according to the CWB's Seismology Center.</P>
      <P>The temblor also had an intensity of 5.0 in Taroko Gorge and Hoping Rural
Township in the neighboring county of Hualien, according to the center.</P>
      <P>The quake had an intensity of 4.0 in the townships of Suao and Luodong in Yilan
County and at Hehuanshan in central Nantou County, the center said.</P>
      <P>Earthquake monitoring stations in other areas north of the southern county of
Chiayi also recorded the jolt, center officials said.</P>
      <P>The magnitude 5 temblor was followed by three aftershocks before 6: 35 a.m. that
day -- of magnitudes of 3.5, 3.1 and 3.1, respectively.</P>
      <P>Center officials said the four jolts were normal seismological activity that
helped release accumulations of tectonic pressure that regularly builds up in
the area.</P>
      <P>Eastern Taiwan is located on a juncture between the Philippine Sea and the
Eurasian tectonic plates, where underground activity is common and tectonic
pressure regularly builds up, according to Kuo Kai-wen, director of the CWB's
Seismology Center.</P>
      <P>The center welcomed 10 mild earthquakes, including a magnitude 5.1 temblor, that
shook Hualien County over 15 hours from Sept. 28 as constructive  tectonic
activity that helped release underground pressure.</P>

      <P>A spate of recent incidents over the past few months has triggered  heated
debate on the issue of balancing  economic development with environmental
protection.</P>
      <P>Even if there have been short-term compromises in the wake of the incidents --
two fires at a petrochemical complex belonging to Formosa Plastics Group in
Yunlin, controversy over a proposed petrochemical plant in Changhua and
confrontation over a proposed biotech park in a military complex in suburban
Taipei -- we have yet to see anyone put forward a convincing long-term opinion.</P>
      <P>This has resulted in confrontations  or standoffs  between developers and
environmentalists, but we are afraid that if the standoffs persist, then
polarized views might appear in the end, with some even advocating using extreme
measures to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>We are worried about such a development and hope to find a basis for dialogue
between the two sides to ease the confrontation. Neither side should be pushed
to extremes to the point that it refuses to compromise.</P>
      <P>From the point of view of future generations, environmental protection vs.
economic development should not be an extreme zero-sum game mindset.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in Tokyo has launched a probe into a report
published Sunday by the Sankei Simbun newspaper that the United States and Japan
are slated to hold a joint military exercise in November as a mock operation to
retake the Tiaoyutai Islands if China occupies them, Foreign Ministry spokesman
James Chang said that day.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Republic of China's sovereignty claim over the islands is
unquestionable and that the government of Taiwan will closely monitor the
situation.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the U.S. navy and Japanese maritime forces are likely
to hold the joint drill immediately after President Barack Obama's visit to
Japan next month for Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.</P>
      <P>Chang reiterated Taiwan's sovereignty over the island chain located in the East
China Sea, saying that the Tiaoyutais, known as the Senkaku Islands in Japan,
are an indivisible part of ROC territory.</P>
      <P>American Institute in Taiwan spokeswoman Sheila Paskman later reiterated
Washington's long-standing stance on the issue that the U.S. does not have a
position on the question of the ultimate sovereignty of the islands.</P>
      <P>"We expect the claimants to resolve this issue through peaceful means among
themselves, " she said without making any direct comment on the report of the
naval exercise.</P>
      <P>However, she said the islands fall within the scope of Article 5 of the 1960
U.S.-Japan Treaty on Mutual Cooperation and Security because they have "been
under the administrative control of the government of Japan since 1972."</P>
      <P>The islands are claimed by Taiwan,  China and Japan. The contention between
Japan and China was further inflamed when the Japanese Coast Guard detained a
Chinese trawler captain Sept. 7 following a collision between his vessel and a
Japanese patrol boat in waters near the islands.</P>
      <P>The captain was released only after China's Foreign Ministry issued a stern
statement warning Japan that if he was not released, China would take "strong
counter-measures for which Japan would have to take all the consequences."</P>
      <P>The islands, which lie north of Taiwan and south of Japan's Okinawa prefecture,
are surrounded by teeming fishing grounds and are believed to sit atop rich oil
and gas deposits.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) Minister Wang Ju-hsuan promised Sunday to hold a
meeting in two weeks to discuss the issue of runaway migrant workers after a
construction accident Sept. 30 killed seven workers, six of whom were
undocumented migrant workers from Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Wang said in Taichung City, central Taiwan that the CLA will pursue all legal
means to get to the bottom of the incident, and that the government will remain
vigilant and impartial on the matter.</P>
      <P>Preliminary investigation results show that the contractors and subcontractors
involved in the construction accident on the No. 6 Freeway hired the six runaway
Indonesian workers via an individual contractor surnamed Huang, said the
minister.</P>
      <P>The seven workers died when a section of scaffolding collapsed at a construction
site at Nantou County's Beishan Interchange.</P>
      <P>It was further reported that the other victim, a Taiwanese national, was
uninsured, disqualifying his family from receiving any compensation.</P>
      <P>Wang said employers are legally obliged to provide insurance for their workers
and that the CLA, along with the National Immigration Agency and the National
Expressway Engineering Bureau, will conduct a thorough investigation into the
matter to ensure justice for all the parties involved.</P>
      <P>The incident not only highlighted the issue of work site safety, but also the
perennial problem of runaway migrant workers, prompting the CLA to mull the
possibility of loosening the current policy on minimum contract periods for
foreign hires.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, CLA statistics show that each year, over 10,000 migrant
workers run away from their employers. The main motivation for absconding is
their inability to switch employers during the duration of their contracts, said
Wang.</P>
      <P>In order for employees to change job sites or employers, the law requires them
to finish out the terms prescribed in the contract and to leave the country
before they can re-enter Taiwan via a paid broker.</P>
      <P>Wang acknowledged that many human rights groups have long denounced that policy,
which binds migrant workers to a certain employer and said it is these stringent
regulations that have driven many unhappy workers to run away.</P>

      <P>The Taipei city government is planning a three-week trial run of the 2010 Taipei

      <P>Expo official Ting Hsi-yung said the four-stage trial run will start with the

Xinsheng Park, Dajia Riverside Park areas. The number of visitors will also
gradually be increased from 5,000 to 10,000 daily, he said.</P>
      <P>During the last stage, scheduled for Oct. 25-28, almost all the exhibition areas
will be opened and the number of visitors increased to between 60,000 and 70,000
daily.</P>
      <P>"We expect to have around 500,000 visitors during the 20-day trial run period,
which will simulate the real number of visitors after the hard opening," Ting

      <P>However, some city councilors said the trial run might fail to reflect the real
situation.</P>
      <P>Councilor Huang Hsiang-chun  said the city government  has estimated that after
the formal opening, daily weekday visitors could reach 20,000, with a possible
106,000 during weekends and 152,000 during national holidays.</P>
      <P>The gap between the "real" number of up to 152,000 and the "simulated" figure of
a maximum of 70,000 is too big and cannot be counted as a real test, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang's colleague Chen Yu-mei said the trial run is "too conservative " and
suggested that the organizers should "prepare for the worst" regarding traffic
controls and an influx of visitors during the trial run.</P>
      <P>Volunteer firefighters, ward heads, tour guides, teachers in charge of field
trips, underprivileged groups, workers unions, and expo sponsors will be invited
to attend the trial run.</P>
      <P>Taipei residents can register with their ward chiefs to apply for free passes to
the exhibition, but this will not be extended to residents of other cities and
counties for the time being.</P>
      <P>The expo, which will run through April 25, 2011, will open just three weeks
before the Taipei mayoral election, in which incumbent Mayor Hau Lung-bin is
seeking re-election.</P>
      <P>Hau, who has been plagued by a scandal surrounding overpriced materials for the
Xinsheng Overpass project, is hoping that a smooth opening will boost his
approval rating.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) dispatched a
toxic disaster response team to a plant belonging to Nanya Plastics Corp. in the
southern county of Chiayi Sunday after a fire engulfed the plant, causing
massive air pollution.</P>
      <P>Nanya Plastics Corp, one of the pivotal companies of the Formosa Plastics Group
(FPG), was ordered by the Chiayi County government to immediately suspend
operations in the wake of the fire that took eight hours to extinguish.</P>
      <P>The county government also handed out a fine of NT$1 million (US$31,250) to
Nanya for the severe air pollution caused by the fire. Although the levels of
sulfides and nitrogen oxide in the black smoke that billowed from the plant were
within allowable levels, the odor concentration of the smoke far exceeded
allowable levels, said the Chiayi County Environmental Protection Department.</P>
      <P>The fire, which broke out at around 8: 30 a.m. that day, engulfed the plant,
which had stocks of resin, methylbenzene and lubricant, sending thick black
smoke into the air for several hours. The fire was not extinguished until 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>No injuries were reported.</P>
      <P>The Nanya Second Plant, located in Taibao City in the southern county of Chiayi,
is Taiwan's only manufacturer of high-class, waterproof synthetic paper known as
White Pearl, or PEPA, used mainly for labeling bottles.</P>
      <P>The fire dealt another heavy blow to FPG after two fires at the group's
petrochemical complex in Yunlin County in July.</P>
      <P>FPG Chairman Wang Wen-yuan was reported  to be monitoring developments closely
since the fire broke out and was said to have instructed Nanya Plastics Corp.'s
President, Wu Chia-chao, to "handle the aftermath properly."</P>
      <P>Wu estimated that the damage caused to the plant was as high as roughly NT$150
million and that about 30 percent of its production lines were destroyed.</P>
      <P>"Part of the production will be now be taken over by Nanya's two other plants in
Chiayi County and China," Wu said.</P>
      <P>The Nanya Second Plant used to produce some 2,000 tons of PEPA a month, worth
between NT$100 million and NT$150 million, according to Wu.</P>
      <P>The results of an initial investigation by firefighters suggested that the fire
was probably caused by a leakage of fuel oil in the plant's electrical control
room.</P>
      <P>Chiayi Magistrate Chang Hwa-kuan immediately went to the scene of the blaze,
where she announced that the fire had been designated as a major industrial
hazard.</P>
      <P>She ordered the establishment of an emergency response center, blocked off
access to areas surrounding the plant and set up a medical attention station.</P>
      <P>Nearly 100 residents from nearby boroughs staged protests at the plant to vent
their anger after the fire.</P>
      <P>The protesters demanded compensation on a par with that offered by FPG to
residents in Yunlin after the two fires that occurred there in July, according
to Yeh Chuan-cheng, a borough chief.</P>
      <P>The FPG agreed in August to pay up to NT$500 million in compensation for the
agricultural and fishery losses caused by the two fires.</P>

      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew said Sunday that Taiwan's public education program
should put more stress on technical and vocational training to help the country
cultivate skilled personnel and improve its competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Speaking at an award ceremony for the 40th National Skills Competition held in
Taichung City, central Taiwan, Siew said manpower cultivation is a major way of
continuing Taiwan's economic miracle, since the country lacks natural resources.</P>
      <P>"Once you have developed your own skills, you will be able to live a more self-
sufficient life," he said.</P>
      <P>Taking Germany as an example, Siew said the vocational schools within that

      <P>He added that an improved talent pool could also increase Taiwan's international

      <P>The education authorities  should work together to promote vocational education

of Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) , saw one of its factories in Chiayi County go
up in flames Sunday.</P>
      <P>The fire tarnished the image of one of the country's largest private business

protests from local residents.</P>
      <P>The string of plant fires are signs of lax management at FPG factory complexes.
It is sad and regrettable to see the group retrogress in its corporate
administration and safety record less than two years after the death of its
founder Wang Yung-ching.</P>
      <P>Wang was known for his down-to-earth working style and strictness in corporate
management. Following his death, there have often been reports of his family
members sparring over allocation of his huge assets. It is deplorable that the
scions of the family have failed to uphold their father's responsible work

      <P>Investors were mostly upbeat ahead of the release of HTC Corporation's September
sales report on Oct. 6 and its Taipei debut of the HTC Desire HD and HTC Desire
Z Android-based smartphones on Oct. 7, local media reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Cell phone parts manufacturers said HTC's Q4 shipments were expected to reach a
record 10 million units, reports said.</P>
      <P>They said HTC had received orders for more than 11 million units for Q4, but
shipments will be affected by a shortage of certain cell phone parts and the
company's nearly 100 percent capacity utilization rate.</P>
      <P>Shipments in Q3 are estimated to be above 7 million units, higher than the
company's forecast of 6.5 million units, institutional investors said.</P>
      <P>The company is scheduled to release its September sales and profits for the
third quarter on Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>Its third quarter sales are expected to reach NT$75 billion, exceeding the
company's target of NT$70 billion, and net profit is expected to rise above
NT$12 per share in the quarter -- the highest among all listed companies in
Taiwan, investors said.</P>
      <P>With the injection of sales from the company's new smartphones and the Windows
Phone 7 mobile operating system expected to be launched in mid-October, HTC's
performance in Q4 will be even better than Q3, they said.</P>
      <P>One local newspaper reported that HTC's combined earnings per share (EPS) in the
first three quarters of this year is likely to stand above NT$30, surpassing
integrated circuit designer Mediatek Inc. to become the most profitable stock.</P>
      <P>HTC's EPS in Q1 and Q2 was NT$6.38 and NT$10.3 respectively.</P>
      <P>HTC said that this week's phone release will be the largest event it has ever
held in Taiwan, with more than 350 celebrities and representatives from Asian
media organizations expected to attend the event.</P>
      <P>HTC Chief Executive Officer Peter Chou has said that at least 30
telecommunication carriers around the world -- the highest number in the
company's history -- decided to buy the new HTC Desire HD since it was first
launched in Europe in September. Almost all mobile phone operators in Europe
will introduce the new Android-based smartphone, he said.</P>

      <P>Nanya Plastics Corp. saw one of its plants in Chiayi County's Taibao City go up
in flames Sunday morning, burning until firefighters were able to put it out at
around 1 a.m. Monday.</P>
      <P>It was the third major safety glitch involving factory sites of FPG -- one of
Taiwan's largest private conglomerates -- over the past three months. In July,
the group's Mailiao petrochemical complex in Yunlin County was twice hit by
fires and explosions.</P>
      <P>Nanya, Taiwan's largest plastics maker, has been ordered to shut down its Chiayi
plant, which produced about NT$150 million (US$4.76 million) worth of PEPA, a
high-class synthetic paper used for packaging and printing purposes, a month.
The county government also fined the company NT$1 million.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the incident:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Heavy "black rains" fell in Chiayi City and Shueishang and Jhongpu townships
Sunday afternoon, hours after a fire broke out at Nanya's Chiayi Second Plant in
neighboring Taibao City earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Local environmental  officials said that the "black rains" contained particulate
pollution caused by the Nanya plant fire. Some local residents  said the company
should compensate  them for car-washing fees. Farmers in the plant's vicinity
were also concerned about possible damage to their crops.</P>
      <P>Although Nanya executives said the materials used at the Taibao plant were
common chemicals and non-toxic, environmental experts said the materials
released  a pungent odor and could cause skin irritation.</P>
      <P>FPG Chairman Wang Wen-yuan is scheduled to visit the Chiayi County government
Monday, a move said to be part of an effort to pre-empt protests from local
residents.</P>
      <P>Strong protests from Yunlin residents after the Mailiao plant fires in June
forced the FPG to offer huge compensation for local residents. (Oct. 4, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Chen Wen-yang, deputy manager of Nanya's Chiayi plant, apologized to local
residents for the fire Sunday and promised to discuss remedy measures within one
week.</P>
      <P>The Nanya plant was Taiwan's  only factory  that produced high-quality synthetic
paper, also known as pearl paper. Chen said the fire would not disrupt the pearl
paper supply because the company has another production line. He also said it
would take an estimated NT$100 million to build a new PEPA plant which takes at
least one year to complete. (Oct. 4, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>As fires at the Chiayi plant and the Mailiao petrochemical complex all took
place on Sundays, people are concerned about FPG's holiday safety measures and
management.</P>
      <P>Petrochemical industry observers said a string of fires at FPG plant sites
signal structural problems in the group following the death of founder Wang
Yung-ching in October 2008.</P>
      <P>They said the group should review its internal monitoring mechanism, training
programs and production facilities to prevent similar accidents.</P>
      <P>Nanya President Wu Chia-chao, who took a high-speed rail train to Chiayi Sunday
to help with the rescue effort, said the company does not relax its safety
supervision on holidays.</P>
      <P>"We follow the same stringent standard operation procedures on holidays as we
follow on workdays, " he stressed after Sunday's incident. (Oct. 4, 2010).</P>

in more than two years during morning trade Monday.</P>
      <P>The U.S. currency opened flat at NT$31.310 and fell to NT$30.976 -- the lowest
level since August 2008, when it briefly hit NT$30.915. It later recovered
slightly to close morning trade at NT$31.007.</P>
      <P>Dealers said that foreign funds continued to flow into local markets after
Taiwan's central bank raised the benchmark interest rate for the second time
this year on Thursday last week.</P>
      <P>Institutional investors are mostly upbeat that the NT dollar will keep moving up
against the greenback.</P>
      <P>Affected by the strong rise of NT dollar, stock market investors were reluctant
to trade export-oriented electronics shares during Monday's session.</P>
      <P>Traders said that the appreciation of local currency would increase electronic
firms' foreign exchange losses and was also likely to squeeze their revenues and
gross profit margins.</P>
      <P>They said that if the NT dollar rose by 1 percent against the U.S. dollar, the
gross profit margins of chip foundry United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) would
decrease by 0.5 percentage points, and the margins of Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering Inc. ( ASE Inc.) , a semiconductor packaging and test services
provider, would drop by 0.2 percentage points.</P>
      <P>The stronger NT dollar is considered positive to asset-backed shares, however,

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed mixed Monday, with the rise of the local currency
against the U.S. dollar dampening interest in electronics stocks but boosting
asset-backed shares, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index edged up 1.92 points, or 0.02 percent, to 8,246.1 after
moving between 8,240.67 and 8,300.04 on turnover of NT$138.29 billion (US$4.46
billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.2 percent as the stronger Taiwan dollar -- which rose to
its highest level against the greenback in more than two years in the morning --
boosted asset-backed shares and briefly pushed the index above the key 8,300
level.</P>
      <P>Worried, however, that the appreciation of the local currency would affect sales
of Taiwan's export-oriented electronics vendors, investors started unloading
their holdings of electronics companies that are expected to release September
sales figures this week.</P>
      <P>Kevin Lin, senior vice president at Fuh Hong Financial Planning Co., said
institutional investors simply wanted to take profits on electronics shares
prior to Taiwan's special municipality elections on Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>"They do not want to wait until the electronics firms release their next sales
figures in early November, because that would be too close to the elections,"
Lin said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,755 stocks closed up and 2,301 finished down, with 225 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector posted the highest gains, up 3.96 percent. Textile
shares rose 2.92 percent, the cement sector gained 1.44 percent, and financial
shares advanced 1.27 percent.</P>
      <P>Construction issues rose 1.25 percent, plastics and chemicals shares were 0.74
percent higher, and foodstuff shares added 0.21 percent.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector fell 0.93 percent, the only one of the
eight major stock categories losing ground on the day.</P>
      <P>Integrated circuit designer Mediatek Inc., fell NT$21, or 4.85 percent, to
NT$428.</P>
      <P>Smartphone maker HTC dropped NT$9, or 1.27 percent, to NT$698, still maintaining
its position as the most expensive stock in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It rose as high as NT$723 at one point during the session on expectations that
the company will release better monthly revenue figures this week, and that
sales remain strong with the debut of two new Android-based smartphones.</P>
      <P>Dealers noted that Yulon Motor Co.,  a leading automobile manufacturer in Taiwan
with a stockpile of assets, performed well Monday because the group is expected
to benefit from growing demand in Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Yulon shares closed limit-up at NT$60.9.</P>

      <P>Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) Chairman Wang Wen-yuan apologized Monday for a fire
the day before at a plant run by group affiliate Nan Ya Plastics Corp. in the
southern Taiwan county of Chiayi.</P>
      <P>The head of Taiwan's largest private-sector enterprise addressed the apology to
all Chiayi residents during a meeting with Chiayi County Magistrate Chang Hwa-
kuan at the latter's office.</P>
      <P>Nan Ya Plastics has launched overall safety checks and will take full
responsibility, Wang said.</P>
      <P>He told reporters that pending investigation, he had no idea what caused the
fire.</P>
      <P>The blaze broke out at around 8: 30 a.m. Sunday at Nan Ya's Chiayi Second Plant
in Taibao City.  The factory produced  a high-quality waterproof synthetic paper
known as white pearl, or PEPA.</P>
      <P>It took firefighters nearly 17 hours to extinguish the blaze. No casualties were
reported.</P>
      <P>The fire dealt another heavy blow to the group after two fires at the group's
petrochemical complex in Mailiao Township in the southern county of Yunlin in
July.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the Chiayi County government put together an expert panel to evaluate
damage caused by the latest fire and handle resident complaints.</P>
      <P>At a news conference before receiving Wang, Chang said the fire was a "serious
industrial safety incident" that caused severe air pollution in the county,
which is one of Taiwan's major agricultural areas.</P>
      <P>Anyone who suffered from losses due to the pollution will have an opportunity to
present evidence, and if there are losses proven, the panel will help people
claim compensation from Nan Ya, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Experts were also asked to determine whether the fire affected the quality of
water, air or soil in the county, she added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Monday it had drawn up a
cooperation plan with other agencies, including the Environmental Protection
Administration, to monitor the operations of Taiwan's petrochemical industry.</P>
      <P>The plan will be implemented immediately if approved by the Executive Yuan, the
officials said, noting that FPG petrochemical factories would likely be the
first target because of public concern.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Missing the point on the wealth gap problem</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/04/10  16:43:55
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Both an Executive Yuan special panel headed by Vice Premier Sean Chen and a
Presidential Office economic advisory task force have come up with proposals to
address the problem of the widening wealth gap facing the country.</P>
      <P>Neither of the teams, however, dared to touch the crux of the problem. Both
dodged the responsibility of reviewing the government's tax policies and
refrained from proposing adjustments to direct taxes, such as income tax,
inheritance tax and corporate income tax.</P>
      <P>It is not surprising that neither team wanted to make such a policy review
because most of their members were vocal advocates of the sizeable reductions to
the inheritance and gift taxes early last year.</P>
      <P>They also would not like to weigh whether the decision to cut the corporate
income tax to 17 percent from this year would exacerbate the rich-poor divide in
the local society, because both the president and the premier have been touting
the tax cut as a key momentum to drive the Taiwan economy to a new "golden
decade."</P>
      <P>The administration of President Ma Ying-jeou, however, cannot buck the principle
of "levying higher taxes on rich persons" if it truly wants to tackle the thorny
issue of the wealth gap.</P>
      <P>This goal can only be reached by raising the income tax, capital gains tax or
inheritance tax. Proposals put up by the two task forces, such as imposing a
luxury tax, yacht tax or other indirect taxes, could by no means be effective in
contributing to the goal. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 4, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan held a screening hearing Monday on President Ma Ying-jeou's
nominations for the top two leadership positions in the Judicial Yuan.</P>
      <P>The hearing, organized by caucuses of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), paved the way for the legislature to vote on
the nominees Oct. 8.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 24, Ma nominated Central Election Commission (CEC) Chairman Rai Hau-min
to be president of the Judicial Yuan, with law professor Su Yeong-chin as his
vice president.</P>
      <P>The top two Judicial Yuan posts opened up after Lai In-jaw and Hsieh Tsay-chuan
resigned as president and vice president in July to take responsibility for a
scandal in which three senior judges were detained for alleged corruption.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, the president and vice president of the Judicial
Yuan are appointed by the country's president from among 15 justices of the
Constitutional Court and confirmed by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Seven legislators across partisan lines and seven scholars and legal pundits
took part in the hearing and gave their opinions on the nominees.</P>
      <P>Former New Party Legislator Hsieh Chi-ta, who was not on the 14-member panel,
issued an open letter to Rai outside the Legislative Yuan, accusing him of
intervening in judicial proceedings on a corruption scandal involving former
Taiwan Provincial Assemblyman Chen Chin-teh.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislator Chiu Yi, one of the screening lawmakers, said the scandal remains
unclear although the case was closed and Chen was acquitted in 2007 after 13
years of judicial proceedings.</P>
      <P>"It would be a real scandal if the new Judicial Yuan leadership does not look
into the case again," Chiu said.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislator Kuan Bi-ling accused Rai of neglecting duties in his capacity as
CEC chairman by being absent from a commission vote on whether KMT Legislator
Diane Lee should be stripped of her legislative seat after a dual citizenship
row in January 2009. The CEC revoked Lee's elected status the following month.</P>
      <P>"(Rai) is the worst nomination that President Ma has made, " Kuan said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Feng-cheng, executive director of the non-profit Judicial Reform
Foundation, welcomed Rai's nomination.</P>
      <P>Lin said that although Rai has not worked on the country's judicial frontline, a
speech he delivered recently rekindled hope in Taiwan's legal sector,
particularly a phrase saying that "a country's judiciary should only exist for
the people's interests."</P>
      <P>Three other university academics spoke highly of the nominees. A fourth
professor said that by working together, Rai and Su would produce a synergy and
boost the country's judicial development.</P>

      <P>Former President Chen Shui-bian will oversee the opening of boxes of official
documents that he removed from the Presidential Office at the end of his term,
the Special Investigation Division (SID) under the Supreme Prosecutors Office
said Monday.</P>
      <P>SID Director Chen Hung-tah said that the former president, who has been held
since Dec. 30, 2008 in connection with corruption and money laundering charges,
will take part in the opening of 58 cartons of documents that prosecutors
retrieved from his office and other places in September.</P>
      <P>The opening is scheduled to take place at the Taipei Detention Center, where the
former president is held, beginning on Oct. 6, Chen Hung-tah said. Staff from
Chen's office and officials from the Presidential Office will also be present.</P>
      <P>The opening process is expected to take 10 working days, Chen Hung-tah added.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors seized 58 cartons of documents from Chen's office on Sept. 15 as
part of an investigation into allegations that he took more than 20 boxes of
classified files with him when he left the Presidential Office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said Sept. 10 that it had instructed Chen's office to
return the documents and files after being notified of their existence by Chen's
office.</P>
      <P>The former president's aides, however, said that they were not in a position to
do so and that they would hold onto the documents until Chen was released from
detention.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office then filed a lawsuit with the SID alleging Chen' s
office had violated the Embezzlement of Public Property Act.</P>
      <P>After questioning  Chen Song-shan,  director of the former president's office,
the SID issued search warrants and conducted a search of the old and new
locations of Chen's office, leading to the seizure of the 58 cartons.</P>
      <P>The former president has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for embezzling
state funds, laundering money, accepting bribes and committing forgery.</P>

      <P>Foreign laborers who are injured or killed while working should not receive any

      <P>Compensation in cases of occupational accidents involving foreign workers should

authorities should also take measures to protect foreign workers' rights and
benefits, according to Su.</P>
      <P>Ma also instructed  relevant authorities  to put in place mechanisms to prevent
accidents in non-public places, such as residential buildings, factories and
industrial parks, Su added.</P>
      <P>He said the president voiced concern about two separate fires over the weekend:
one that engulfed a Yunlin County film studio known for producing Taiwanese

      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on Monday urged the public not to panic
over the country's first reported case of the NDM-1 "superbug, " saying the
patient has been asymptomatic so far and is out of the hospital.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at a press  conference  in Taipei,  CDC  Deputy Director-General Shih
Wen-yi urged people to maintain a high level of personal hygiene by constantly
washing their hands and adhere to the proper protocol when using antibiotics to
guard against the bug.</P>
      <P>Shih said Taiwan's patient zero was a male cameraman who was operated on in New
Delhi last month after being shot by masked gunman.</P>
      <P>The man may have contracted a bacteria made resistant to most antibiotics by the
NDM-1 gene during the operation, he said.</P>
      <P>"The man underwent surgery and was hospitalized in a high-risk country. This is
the first time that the strain has been detected in Taiwan and we therefore have
reason to believe that this was an imported case," he said.</P>
      <P>According to Shih, during tests conducted on the man's anus, wound and urine,
traces of the antibiotic-resistant superbug were found around his anus.</P>
      <P>The man, who was shot in the abdomen, was accompanied by a team of medical
workers on his return flight to Taiwan on September 27. Shih said all the waste
material on the aircraft was properly disposed of.</P>
      <P>The cameraman, who works for local cable TV news station TVBS, is reportedly in
good health but must report back to the CDC on a weekly basis for follow-up
visits.</P>
      <P>Bacteria with the NDM-1 gene has infected people around the world, but its main
infection epicenter is in India and Pakistan. They are resistant  to most
available  antibiotics,  including carbapenems that are used as a last resort
when common antibiotics have failed.</P>
      <P>In August, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a statement  warning
governments  to  take  measures  to combat anti-microbial resistance.</P>
      <P>"WHO suggests that countries should be prepared to implement hospital infection
control measures to limit the spread of multi-drug resistant strains and to
reinforce national policy on prudent use of antibiotics,  reducing the
generation  of antibiotic  resistant bacteria," the WHO statement said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two decades after the reunification of East Germany and West Germany, many
Germans of the formerly separated country continue to wrestle with problems that
arose, even as many others recognize the benefits of reunification, said a
visiting professor on the 20th anniversary of the historic event.</P>
      <P>"While most of the people in Germany have a positive assessment of the
reunification, frustration from a depressed job market and other unfulfilled
demands also led to relative negative assessment by many, " Professor Dr. Stefan
Wolle of the Free University (FU) of Berlin told an audience in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As this year marks two decades since the two sides reunified, the German
Institute Taipei invited the historian and head of research at the DDR Museum in
Berlin to give a series of lectures in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>At academic institutes and universities where Wolle spoke, audiences were
enthusiastic to learn from the historian the German experience of reunification.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the uniqueness of German reunification, the scholar pointed out that
"the drive for reunification came as a surprise to many observers."</P>
      <P>"The desire for unity by no means came from above. It was articulated by the
masses on the street," he said.</P>
      <P>Immediately after the monetary union on July 1, 1990, people in the east found
that while they finally gained long-desired freedom and the entitlement of
consumers, they had to meet the challenges of severe competition in a market
economy.</P>
      <P>Wolle pointed out that the monetary union failed to prepare East Germans for the
devastating consequences of a collapsing economy in the former East Germany,
also known as the German Democratic Republic (GDR).</P>
      <P>As West German retail outlets offered an abundance of goods which overwhelmed
the market, demand for East German products almost completely collapsed and
industrial production in former East Germany abruptly dropped by half within a
year.</P>
      <P>Between 1989 and 1992, the number of employed people in the east dropped from
9.7 million to 6.7 million; the sluggishness of the job market was comparable to
the Great Depression years between 1929 and 1932, Wolle noted.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the job market in the new federal states have hardly recovered
from the post-reunification sluggishness, and the bitterness among those who
were used to a system of guaranteed employment and social security was
understandable, according to the professor.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that most German people had a positive assessment of the
transformation of Germany, but quite a few had complaints and worries about the
free market economy.</P>
      <P>The frustration of those forced into a disadvantaged position after the
reunification had given rise to nostalgic sentiment of the " harmony" under the
socialist system, Wolle said.</P>
      <P>The so-called "Ost-talgia" for " the idyll behind the barbed wire", as Prof.
Wolle suggested, reflected people's disappointment over unfulfilled promises.</P>
      <P>From 1990 and 1991, Wolle worked as an expert on files of the Stasi (the
Ministry of State Security of the GDR) and was a member of the committee for the
dissolution of the secret police organization.</P>
      <P>He said, in the long process of integration, the German people should think
beyond the limitations of the current situation. Meanwhile, the authorities
should note the spiritual aspects and psychological complications people still
faced, while the progress of infrastructure reconstruction in the former GDR
should be recognized, Wolle said.</P>
      <P>The former member of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR in the 1970s and 1980s
spoke as an academician while using survey reports to reflect assessments by
German people, and also as a witness who had led a life under the socialist
system of East Germany and as an active participant in the process of
reconciliation.</P>
      <P>He said that he was impressed to find the audience in Taiwan had great interest
in the German experience, adding that from the questions  raised,  he found
people in Taiwan were relatively well-informed about contemporary German
history.</P>

      <P>A 25-member Taiwan trade promotion mission, organized by the Taiwan External
Trade Development Council (TAITRA) , arrived in Manila Monday for trade talks
that are expected to draw the participation of executives from nearly 200
companies in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The TAITRA mission is comprised of executives of 17 Taiwanese companies involved
in machinery, spare parts, telecommunications facilities and products, health
care equipment and health foods, as well as auto parts.</P>
      <P>In addition to one-on-one trade talks, mission members are expected to visit
several major shopping malls and factories around the Philippines to gain
further understanding of the business climate in the Southeast Asian country,
said Huang Jung-chun, mission leader and a TAITRA official.</P>
      <P>He estimated that the visit will generate business opportunities worth US$1
million.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between the two countries reached US$4.1 billion in the first six
months of this year, with Taiwan's exports to the Philippines totaling some US$3
billion and its imports from that country amounting to US$1.1 billion, according
to Donald C.T. Lee, Taiwan's representative in the Philippines, who was also
present at a welcoming party that was held at Hotel Dusit Thani in Manila.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is currently the seventh largest trade partner of the Philippines, Lee
said. The Philippines is one of Taiwan's top 10 export markets.</P>
      <P>Amadeo Perez Jr., chairman of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO),
extended a welcome to the mission at the party.</P>
      <P>MECO is a quasi-official body authorized by the Philippine government to handle

    <HEADLINE>Spot baldness likely to trigger other autoimmune diseases: study</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A recent study of more than 4,000 Taiwanese "spot baldness" patients has found a
correlation  between the affliction and other autoimmune diseases, Taipei
Veterans General Hospital said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the study done by the hospital, patients suffering from spot
baldness have a higher risk of contracting other autoimmune diseases such as
atopic dermatitis, lupus, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, said an attending
physician.</P>
      <P>With the help of the Bureau of National Health Insurance's database, the study's
researchers analyzed the records of 4,334 spot baldness patients from 1996 to
2008 and cross-checked the incidence of autoimmune diseases with their ages,
said Chen Chih-chiang, the doctor who led the study.</P>
      <P>The results showed that children with spot baldness under 10 have 9.7 times more
of a chance to get lupus, while patients in the 11-20 age group were prone to
psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Patients older than 60 have a higher risk of thyroid disease, he added.</P>
      <P>Spot baldness, known formally as alopecia areata, describes the patchy loss of
hair on the scalp or the body.</P>
      <P>Though it has many causes that are hard to pinpoint, Chen said the study, to be
published in Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, could help doctors
detect in a timely manner other autoimmune diseases in alopecia patients and
reduce the waste of medical resources.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shares of Taiwanese solar power producers fell sharply Monday on news that
Germany, the world's largest solar market, is likely to cut its subsidies for
solar energy products and power early next year, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Institutional investors said that although most solar firms are still expected
to post strong sales and profits in September and for the third quarter as a
whole, the negative news still hurt local solar energy vendors.</P>
      <P>The news had been expected by most investors, but it still cast a cloud over the
industry's  outlook and triggered profit-taking pressure, they said.</P>
      <P>Green Energy Technology shares closed limit-down at NT$88.7, and Sino-American
Silicon Products shares also fell by the maximum 7 percent limit to NT$89.8.</P>
      <P>Media reports quoted a German federal network agency as saying that new
photovoltaic solar energy installations in the first eight months of the year
had exceeded the number installed in all of 2009 as well as the target for 2010.</P>
      <P>As a result, Germany might slash solar subsidies by 13 percent next January.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a local photovoltaic solar association ran a half-page newspaper ad
Monday to urge the government to fully implement the Renewable Energy
Development Act.</P>
      <P>The association  asked the government  to further simplify administrative
procedures to assist the public in installing solar equipment.</P>

      <P>Construction companies in Taiwan will suffer a less-than-expected impact from
the new tightening measures that government-controlled banks are expected to
impose on financing, as the booming market equips them with solutions, analysts
said Monday.</P>
      <P>"When needing more funds, some of the local constructors can choose -- and some
already have chosen -- to sell their less popular commercial properties as it is
easy to do so when the property market is booming right now, " H&amp;B Business
Group spokeswoman Jessica Hsu told the Central News Agency in a telephone
interview.</P>
      <P>She did not expect the government will hit the property market hard as local
banks rely heavily on land and construction financing.</P>
      <P>Her remarks came days after local news media reported that Land Bank of Taiwan
and Taiwan Cooperative Bank -- Taiwan's largest sources of land and construction
financing -- were scheduled to be "more cautious" in reviewing loan applications
from Monday.</P>
      <P>These banks will also ask construction companies to start their construction
projects within one year after receiving the loans, or they will raise interest
rates on the loans or cancel the loans, the reports said.</P>
      <P>Bright Lee, a spokesman for Evertrust Rehouse Co., told CNA by telephone that
the impact of the new measures will affect small construction companies more
than big ones as big companies have more ways to raise funds, such as by issuing
new shares.</P>
      <P>He added that many of local big contractors have set up companies in other
fields -- many of which are quite successful -- and these big companies can get
funds from their other companies if necessary.</P>
      <P>At its quarterly board meeting on Sept. 30, Taiwan's central bank did not launch
additional measures to cool the housing market in the capital city of Taipei and
surrounding Taipei County as widely expected.</P>
      <P>The central bank, however, said in a statement that it is necessary to continue
to ask local banks to tighten control on land financing risks.</P>
      <P>Since June, the central bank has launched a series of tightening moves on bank
lending to curb the upward spiral of housing prices as the soaring prices have
raised complaints and fears that many local residents would not be able to buy a
home.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An annual U.S.-Taiwan defense industry conference opened Sunday at Cambridge,
Maryland with more than 140 government officials, scholars, experts and
representatives from defense companies taking part.</P>
      <P>Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, said the
meeting has provided a platform for both sides and defense companies to discuss
the issues of safety and national defense.</P>
      <P>The themes of this year's meeting include an assessment of threat faced by
Taiwan from China, and Taiwan's capacity to engage in asymmetric warfare.</P>
      <P>Yang Nien-dzu, deputy defense minister of Taiwan, said the purpose of the
meeting is to increase bilateral cooperation and friendship and to discuss with
the United States how to strengthen cooperation in Taiwan's military
transformation process.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the United States would sell Taiwan F-16C/D jet
fighters which it has long sought to guard its air space and enhance its self-
defense capability.</P>
      <P>Prior to the conference, Hammond-Chambers was asked when he thought the U.S.
would sell F-16C/D fighters to Taiwan so it can replace its aging fleet. He
answered that he believes Washington will do so in the first term of U.S.
President Barrack Obama.</P>
      <P>The conference has been held annually since 2002.</P>
      <P>U.S. officials participating in this year's Oct. 3-5 conference</P>
      <P>included Beth M. McCormick, deputy assistant secretary for</P>
      <P>defense, trade &amp; regional security of the U.S. Department of</P>

      <P>A 52-minute fireworks display will light up the skies over Taipei Sunday night
in celebration of the 99th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China,
the organizing committee announced on Monday.</P>
      <P>The day's activities will kick off early Sunday outside the Presidential Office
with three well-known vocalists leading the singing of the ROC's national
anthem, followed by a string of performances by five schools and the military.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou will then give his annual Double Ten Day address,
accompanied by the first lady. A parade of 23 floats from 10 counties and
various government agencies will also add color to the celebration.</P>
      <P>According to the committee, backpacks or handbags that exceed 30 centimeters in
length and umbrellas or heavy colorful raincoats will not be allowed. In case of
inclement weather, only light colored transparent raincoats will be permitted.</P>
      <P>Other items barred include batons, sticks, knives, balloons, and blow horns.</P>
      <P>Small folding chairs can be used, but cameras with long lenses must not be
brought into the restricted zones, the committee said.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon, another float parade that looks ahead to the country's
centennial anniversary next year will run from the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall
to the square outside Taipei City Hall.</P>
      <P>This year, the main evening celebration will be held on the offshore island of
Penghu.</P>
      <P>The entire show, featuring a full line of pop artists, aboriginal singers, and
bands and a 30-minute fireworks display, will be broadcast live in Taiwan as
well as in different parts of the world via the Overseas Compatriots
Commission's  Macroview Television Service.</P>
      <P>Another fireworks show will be held around the same time in Taipei, the
committee said.</P>
      <P>A series of cultural activities and exhibitions, including a nationwide design
competition, movie festival, and a traditional puppet display at the Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport, will also be held until the end of the year in
honor of the country's birthday.</P>
      <P>A total of 263 foreign dignitaries, including the president of Sao Tome and
Principe, the prime minister of the Solomon Islands, and parliamentary members
of South Korea, Kuwait, and Mongolia will attend this year's National Day
celebration, said Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng. who serves as the committee
chairman.</P>
      <P>The chairmen of Taiwan's six major political parties have been invited to attend
the celebration, but the heads of the two major opposition parties -- the
Democratic Progressive Party and the Taiwan Solidarity Union -- have yet to
reply to the invitation, Wang said.</P>
      <P>This year's National Day celebration will cost NT$46 million, NT$3 million more
than in 2008 because of the extra cost of transporting equipment to Penghu, Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan suspended the celebration in 2009 after a deadly typhoon wrecked havoc in
southern Taiwan, leaving more than 700 people dead.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that the wave of shopping seen at department

crisis, it had also expanded Taiwan's rich-poor divide, leaving many
disadvantaged people throughout society.</P>
      <P>As part of the effort to deal with the problem, the Executive Yuan recently
revised social relief regulations that authorize the government to offer
subsidies to more low-income households, Ma said.</P>

      <P>The first person in Taiwan to be infected by bacteria carrying the NDM-1 gene
was asymptomatic and the bacteria nontoxic, but specialists worry the bug's
mutating gene could jump to local bacteria, making them equally resistant to
antibiotics.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) confirmed Monday that a Taiwanese
cameraman shot in India in September had contracted the superbug, which first
emerged in South Asia.</P>
      <P>The CDC believes it is not likely to become a communicable disease, and it has
designated it as "non-contagious."</P>
      <P>Wang Fu-de, the director of Taipei Veterans General Hospital's Infection Control
Office said the superbug is mainly spread through invasive surgeries when a
patient's immune system is weak, and he contended that the chance of the average
person being infected is low.</P>
      <P>Su Ih-jen, the deputy superintendent of National Cheng Kung University Hospital
and a former head of the CDC, disagreed.</P>
      <P>"This is a big deal and should not be handled this way," he said, mainly because
of fears that the NDM-1 gene mutation in the carrier's bactera will transfer its
drug resistant property to other local bacteria.</P>
      <P>If the patient's stool contains NDM-1, Su said, then the drug resistant gene
could transfer to regional bacteria like E. coli, which residents of Taiwan
could later be infected with.</P>
      <P>This was the greatest concern, he said, because it would be very difficult to
treat. At present, bacteria with the NDM-1 gene resist even carbapenem
antibiotics, which are generally used as a last resort to treat conditions
resistant to regular antibiotics.</P>
      <P>Huang Li-min,  a physician  in National  Taiwan University Hospital's
Department of Pediatrics and an infectious disease specialist, said discharging
the NDM-1 carrier from the hospital was a practical response to a difficult
problem.</P>
      <P>"It's not that Taiwan is not willing to deal with the situation. It's simply
that nothing can be done," he said.</P>
      <P>If the patient were to be kept in the hospital, where there are so many people
being operated on or with weak immune systems, it would only increase the
chances of spreading disease, he said.</P>
      <P>Huang acknowledged, however, that once a "healthy carrier" returned home,  the
household could be contaminated  with the NDM-1-affected bacteria, and family
members would have to emphasize their own personal hygiene.</P>
      <P>Even then, Huang admitted, family members were still at risk of becoming
"healthy carriers" of bacteria with the NDM-1 gene.</P>

Sunday by securing the Los Angeles Dodgers record for lowest ERA based on a

      <P>The 29-year-old pitched a scoreless inning in relief against the Arizona
Diamondbacks, lowering his ERA to 1.200. That was slightly better  than the
previous  record  of 1.202 set by Cy Young award-winning reliever Eric Gagne in
2003.</P>
      <P>"Gagne is still my idol, " Kuo said after the game. Gagne recorded 152 saves

he attempted numerous comebacks before retiring in April 2010.</P>
      <P>In the final game of the season, Kuo took over in the bottom of the ninth with
the Dodgers leading 3-1, and yielded only a walk in securing his 12th save of

      <P>The left-hander started the season injured but later emerged as the Dodgers'
best reliever and the only one in Major League Baseball to record at least 10
saves and 20 holds during the 2010 season.</P>
      <P>Kuo's 56 appearances earned him an additional US$25,000 in incentives.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will field 12 of its Asian Games baseball players at the 2010 IBAF
Intercontinental Cup tournament slated to be held in central Taiwan later this
month, the team's manager said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei Amateur Baseball Association announced on Monday its 24-man
roster for the Intercontinental Cup, which will be held in Taichung and Douliou
Oct. 23-31.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 24 players will consist of 11 pitchers, three catchers, six infielders
and four outfielders, manager Yeh Chih-hsien announced at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Of the 24 players on the roster, only Hsiao Poh-ting, an infielder, was not on
the country's preliminary 45-member national team roster for the Asian Games
scheduled to be held in Guangzhou City in November, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Twelve members of the International Cup squad are on the current 24-man roster
for the Asian Games.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will be the defending champions at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games after
winning the title in Doha in 2006.</P>
      <P>A total  of 10 teams  will  participate  in this  year's Intercontinental Cup.
Aside from host Taiwan, the field will consist of teams representing Cuba, the
Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, South Korea
and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Because  the CPBL (Chinese  Professional  Baseball  League) championship series
overlaps with the Intercontinental Cup for a day, players with the Sinon Bulls
and the Brother Elephants were not included on the roster, according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>Uni-President Lions pitcher Wang Ching-ming was also excluded because of his arm
injury, which might need an operation, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The team is scheduled to play two training games with the Sinon Bulls at the
Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium Oct. 11-12 and three other warm-ups
against Cuba, the Netherlands and Japan at the Tienmu Baseball Stadium in Taipei
City on Oct. 18, 19 and 20, respectively.</P>
      <P>The complete 24-man roster for Taiwan's national team is as follows:</P>
      <P>Pitchers (11): Pan Wei-lun, Hsu Ming-chieh, Huang Chih-lung, Chen Hung-wen, Lo

      <P>The Ministry of the Interior staged a drill Monday to simulate a massive
earthquake hitting the Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan's "Silicon Valley," in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said the drill was set up to respond to a
simulated magnitude 6.8 earthquake caused by movement of the Hsincheng Fault,
which affects the Taoyuan, Hsinchu, and Miaoli areas.</P>
      <P>Jiang said the Hsinchu Science Park is the powerhouse of Taiwan's high-tech
industry with a great number of laboratories and chemical plants.</P>
      <P>Damage control and management  have become more important, especially after the
fire at a Nan Ya Plastics Corp. factory in Chiayi County a day earlier, he said.</P>
      <P>"If one Nan Ya plant can have such an impact, we can imagine the tremendous
impact if the entire science park is affected," he added.</P>
      <P>He said that although 70-80 percent of earthquakes in the area hit eastern
Taiwan, the heaviest casualties often occur in western Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We should not take the impact of earthquakes on densely populated areas
lightly, " he said. "Compared with Hualien or other areas in southern Taiwan,
Hsinchu may not have as many faults, but any fault could move,"</P>
      <P>The drill was divided into two stages. The first stage covered the first six
hours, with the park being engulfed in flames after explosions, railway trains
being stopped at Jhunan, toxic gases being released into the air and buildings
collapsing.</P>
      <P>During the second stage, between the seventh and 30th hour, outbound traffic and
communications of remote townships were cut off, serious damage to reservoirs
occurred, and urban areas were engulfed in fire.</P>
      <P>The drill was performed to mark National Disaster Prevention Day, which is
normally held on Sept. 21 to mark the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that killed more
than 2,400 people and devastated central Taiwan on that day in 1999.</P>
      <P>This year's drill was postponed because of Typhoon Fanapi, which landed on
Taiwan Sept. 19.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will field 12 of its Asian Games baseball players at the 2010 IBAF
Intercontinental Cup tournament slated to be held in central Taiwan later this
month, the team's manager said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Chinese Taipei Amateur Baseball Association announced on Monday its 24-man
roster for the Intercontinental Cup, which will be held in Taichung and Douliou
Oct. 23-31.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 24 players will consist of 11 pitchers, three catchers, six infielders
and four outfielders, manager Yeh Chih-hsien announced at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Of the 24 players on the roster, only Hsiao Poh-ting, an infielder, was not on
the country's preliminary 45-member national team roster for the Asian Games
scheduled to be held in Guangzhou City in November, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Twelve members of the International Cup squad are on the current 24-man roster
for the Asian Games.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will be the defending champions at the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games after
winning the title in Doha in 2006.</P>
      <P>A total  of 10 teams  will  participate  in this  year's Intercontinental Cup.
Aside from host Taiwan, the field will consist of teams representing Cuba, the
Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, South Korea
and Thailand.</P>
      <P>Because  the CPBL (Chinese  Professional  Baseball  League) championship series
overlaps with the Intercontinental Cup for a day, players with the Sinon Bulls
and the Brother Elephants were not included on the roster, according to Yeh.</P>
      <P>Uni-President Lions pitcher Wang Ching-ming was also excluded because of his arm
injury, which might need an operation, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>The team is scheduled to play two training games with the Sinon Bulls at the
Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium Oct. 11-12 and three other warm-ups
against Cuba, the Netherlands and Japan at the Tienmu Baseball Stadium in Taipei
City on Oct. 18, 19 and 20, respectively.</P>
      <P>The complete 24-man roster for Taiwan's national team is as follows:</P>
      <P>Pitchers (11): Pan Wei-lun, Hsu Ming-chieh, Huang Chih-lung, Chen Hung-wen, Lo
Chin-lung, Lin Yi-hao, Liao Wen-yang, Lin Yu-ching, Chen Kuan-yu, Lin Chen-hua
and Lai Hung-cheng.</P>
      <P>Catchers (3): Kao Chih-kang, Chen Chun-hsiu and Lin Kun-sheng.</P>
      <P>Infielders (6): Kao Kuo-ching, Lin Chih-sheng, Chen Yung-chi, Kuo Yen-wen, Lin
Han and Hsiao Poh-ting.</P>
      <P>Outfielders (4): Lo Kuo-hui, Lin Che-hsuan, Chung Chen-yu and Liu Fu-hao.</P>
      <P>Taiwan finished third in the last Intercontinental Cup held in Taichung in early
November 2006, and soon after won the title at the Asian Games held in Doha
later that month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Drill held to simulate science park being hit by earthquake</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior staged a drill Monday to simulate a massive
earthquake hitting the Hsinchu Science Park, Taiwan's "Silicon Valley," in
northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said the drill was set up to respond to a
simulated magnitude 6.8 earthquake caused by movement of the Hsincheng Fault,
which affects the Taoyuan, Hsinchu, and Miaoli areas.</P>
      <P>Jiang said the Hsinchu Science Park is the powerhouse of Taiwan's high-tech
industry with a great number of laboratories and chemical plants.</P>
      <P>Damage control and management  have become more important, especially after the
fire at a Nan Ya Plastics Corp. factory in Chiayi County a day earlier, he said.</P>
      <P>"If one Nan Ya plant can have such an impact, we can imagine the tremendous
impact if the entire science park is affected," he added.</P>
      <P>He said that although 70-80 percent of earthquakes in the area hit eastern
Taiwan, the heaviest casualties often occur in western Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We should not take the impact of earthquakes on densely populated areas
lightly, " he said. "Compared with Hualien or other areas in southern Taiwan,
Hsinchu may not have as many faults, but any fault could move,"</P>
      <P>The drill was divided into two stages. The first stage covered the first six
hours, with the park being engulfed in flames after explosions, railway trains
being stopped at Jhunan, toxic gases being released into the air and buildings
collapsing.</P>
      <P>During the second stage, between the seventh and 30th hour, outbound traffic and
communications of remote townships were cut off, serious damage to reservoirs
occurred, and urban areas were engulfed in fire.</P>
      <P>The drill was performed to mark National Disaster Prevention Day, which is
normally held on Sept. 21 to mark the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that killed more
than 2,400 people and devastated central Taiwan on that day in 1999.</P>
      <P>This year's drill was postponed because of Typhoon Fanapi, which landed on
Taiwan Sept. 19.</P>

      <P>Taiwan renewed a call Monday for the United States to approve its request for
F-16C/D fighters to help enhance its air defense capability against China's
military threat.</P>
      <P>Yang Nien-dzu, deputy defense minister of Taiwan, said during the annual
U.S.-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference held in Cambridge, Maryland that the
security threat faced by Taiwan has not eased despite closer cooperation with
China on economic issues.</P>
      <P>The situation was highlighted in July when Chinese defense minister Liang
Guanglie commented that Taiwan affairs were the main focus of China's military
buildup, Yang said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's need to beef up its weak air defense was also publicized in a report on
China's military development released earlier this year by the U.S. Department
of Defense, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to Yang, F-16C/D fighters, along with diesel-electric submarines, are
the weapons most urgently needed by Taiwan to maintain a minimum, basic self-
defense capability.</P>
      <P>Failure to obtain these weapons is like being without an important piece of a
jigsaw puzzle and leaves Taiwan's defense deployment incomplete, he said.</P>
      <P>The United States has not ruled out selling Taiwan the 66 F16C/D fighters it has
requested, but it has dragged its feet on making a commitment of any kind out of
fear of angering Beijing.</P>
      <P>Some have speculated that Washington might opt to instead provide upgrades of
Taiwan's fleet of F16 A/B aircraft.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-Taiwan Defense Industry has been held annually since 2002.</P>
      <P>U.S. officials participating in this year's Oct. 3-5 conference included Beth M.
McCormick, deputy assistant secretary of state for defense, trade and regional
security, and Wallace Gregson, assistant secretary of defense for Asian &amp;
Pacific security affairs.</P>

      <P>This demonstrates  that Taiwan's economic strength has won widespread attention

      <P>The development is also obviously related to the state of detente across the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Since the inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou in May 2008, Taiwan and China
have stopped their zero-sum confrontation. A "diplomatic  truce" mindset has
been adopted  in dealing with international affairs.</P>
      <P>That has resulted in Taiwan attaining observer status at the World Health
Assembly, an end to the fierce cross-strait competition for diplomatic allies,
and progress in Taiwan's efforts to sign free trade agreements with its trade

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Central bank takes up fight against hot money</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/05/10  12:02:38
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar surged past the so-called "Perng Fai-nan" barrier of NT$31
against the U.S. greenback at one point Monday amid an influx of hot money, but
it weakened later in the session to close at NT$31.250, thanks to the
intervention of the Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan).</P>
      <P>Central bank Governor  Perng Fai-nan reportedly  chaired a brainstorming session
with the heads of the bank's currency affairs and market research departments
Monday evening to assess the direction of hot money flows.</P>
      <P>They also plotted new strategies on working with other Asian central banks to
protect the local currency from hot money attacks.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Banking sources said the central bank pumped at least NT$20 billion into the
foreign exchange market Monday to stabilize the Taiwan dollar's exchange rate
against the greenback.</P>
      <P>The local currency appreciated NT$0.3 to hit NT$30.976 -- the highest level
since August 2008 -- at one point, but then weakened amid central bank
intervention. At the end of the day, the local currency had only gained NT$0.06
over the previous trading session to close at anearly 25-month high of NT$31.25.</P>
      <P>Local currency dealers said the Taiwan dollar has ranged between NT$31 and NT$34
to the greenback over the past two years, indicating that the central bank will
not stand aside and allow the currency to spike past NT$31, a level known as the
"Perng Fai-nan" barrier.</P>
      <P>When asked about her view of the Taiwan dollar's recent upward trend, Christina
Liu, chairwoman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, said that
given Taiwan's steady economic recovery, it was only natural for the Taiwan
dollar to appreciate because currency values tend to reflect countries' economic
situation.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said a combination of factors have contributed to the Taiwan
dollar's appreciation in recent days. A major cause was the central bank's
decision to raise its key interest rates by 0.125 percentage points from Oct. 1.</P>
      <P>That fueled an influx of hot money because other Asian countries such as South
Korea and Malaysia have suspended interest rate adjustments.</P>
      <P>Another factor is that the local currency has appreciated by only 2.44 percent
against the dollar since the beginning of this year, a range far smaller than
the Japanese yen's rise of 10.46 percent, the Thai baht's appreciation of 8.9
percent and the Korean won's rise of 3.57 percent.</P>
      <P>According to economic officials, the Taiwan dollar's 1.5 percent rise in value
over the past two weeks has helped cushion domestic inflationary pressures
fueled by recent hikes in raw materials prices in global markets. (Oct. 5,
2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>With a listless greenback, Asian central banks have had a hard time protecting
their currencies from appreciating too drastically amid an influx of hot money.</P>
      <P>Market sources said signs have become more palpable that Asian central banks
might be losing the battle to prevent hot money attacks on their currencies.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the Korean won rose to a five-month high of 1,122.3 against the
greenback, breaking the Korean central bank's target of keeping the won below
the 1,130 level.</P>
      <P>Despite the Thai central bank's intervention, the baht still surged past the
30.15 barrier to hit a 13-year high of 30.05 Monday.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, central bank officials are working on new strategies to cooperate
with other Asian central banks to stabilize the Taiwan dollar's exchange rate,
senior bankers said.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) ,
inbound foreign exchange remittances amounted to US$2.35 billion in September, a
five-month high.</P>
      <P>Accumulated capital inflows for the first nine months of this year hit US$157.78
billion, according to FSC statistics. (Oct. 5, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Tuesday urged Taiwanese nationals
visiting India to remain alert to the danger of being infected by drug-resistant
bacteria carrying the NDM-1 gene.</P>
      <P>The MOFA said Taiwanese citizens who are in India for business or pleasure
should pay special attention to disease prevention if they need to be treated at
a hospital in the South Asian country.</P>
      <P>The MOFA warning came after Taiwan reported its first superbug case Monday -- a
cameraman for cable TV news station TVBS who contracted the disease while being
treated in an Indian hospital after being shot during a visit to New Delhi in
September.</P>
      <P>He was confirmed as having a bacterium carrying the NDM-1 gene on Monday, but
has not shown any symptoms from the antibiotic-resistant bug.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Centers Disease Control (CDC) listed NDM-1, short for New Delhi
metallo-beta-lactamase-1, as a notifiable disease in September.</P>
      <P>The ministry said Taiwanese citizens traveling to India who need any assistance
should use the emergency number 9810-502-610 to contact Taiwan's representative
office there.</P>
      <P>It also advised Taiwanese nationals to closely follow information of the
superbug by frequently logging onto the CDC's website or to call the CDC for
advice in case they have to get medical care in India.</P>
      <P>The CDC has required local hospitals to immediately report any suspected cases
of the superbug, especially those in which the patient has received medical
treatment in India or Pakistan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- 'B'in Music' writes Taiwan's concert history</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/05/10  12:29:32
(Business Today 717)(translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Music enthusiast Ason Chen had such a strong belief that concerts were the
future of the music industry that he ended his 20-year career with a noted
record company in 2007 to open his own concert promotion business.</P>
      <P>Today, Chen's company, known as B'in Music, has emerged as the leading promoter
in the field. In July and August alone, B'in Music organized 13 concerts at home
and abroad that attracted more than 130,000 music fans, and in the first eight
months of 2010, it held over 30 concerts drawing 300,000 people.</P>
      <P>Among concert promoters in Taiwan, B'in Music is unrivaled as a concert
promoter, organizing at least 50 percent more concerts than any music company in
Taiwan. From January to August this year, it totaled NT$80 million (US$2.56
million) in concert and merchandising sales.</P>
      <P>Chen joined Rock Records Co. after graduating from college and has planned album
promotional campaigns ever since. One of his most successful collaborations has
been with the band Mayday, which released its first album in 1999.</P>
      <P>His plan to have Mayday to perform on the streets of Taipei City's Ximending for
a month when the band first hit the market proved successful in building a fan
base.</P>
      <P>In a subsequent concert open to anyone who showed up with Mayday's album, 20,000
people attended. It was then that Chen first appreciated the potential of
concerts.</P>
      <P>Record companies began to feel the impact of online music downloads in 2004 and
saw record sales drop sharply in Taiwan from their peak of NT$11 billion. The
downward trend eventually created an opening for Chen to pursue his vision.</P>
      <P>Because Rock Records was affected by the industry downturn and unable to support
all of its singers, Chen and Rock Records colleague Hsieh Chih-fen took several
artists with them and set up B'in Music in 2007 after discussions with Rock
Records' management.</P>
      <P>Believing that "each concert is unique itself as it cannot be recreated once you
miss it, " Chen's strategy for B'in Music requires that all of its artists are
able to perform in live concerts.</P>
      <P>The market for concerts in Chinese-speaking regions, including Singapore and
Malaysia,  has been growing rapidly since 2003, remaining unaffected by the
Internet boom.</P>
      <P>Income from concerts currently accounts for nearly 50 percent of B'in Music's
revenue, and the company is the only one in the industry that has its own
department dedicated to organizing and promoting concerts.</P>
      <P>Chou Yu-yang, who heads B'in Music's concert production unit, said the
department has grown from three people to the current staff of 11, with "at
least two concert projects running at any time and up to five projects at the
most." The company also produces concerts of artists from different labels.</P>
      <P>Willing to invest money to create the perfect concert experience and keeping
ticket prices low are also elements of Chen's strategy that makes his company's
concerts stand out from others.</P>
      <P>"The goal is to make the audience develop expectations of the next concert right
after the conclusion of the one they've just attended," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Compared with the NT$2,000 average ticket price of concerts in Taiwan, tickets
to B'in Music concerts average NT$1,200 to make them more affordable for
students, who account for nearly half of the company's ticket sales.</P>
      <P>The gamble that Chen took in 2007 seems to be paying off and has allowed him to
further give expression to his passion for music.</P>
      <P>"I've always wondered what I would do if the world were to end tomorrow," Chen
said. "I think I would want everybody to gather for a concert."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Superbug is unstoppable but not easily contracted: health minister</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Bacteria carrying the NDM-1 gene cannot be blocked but can only be transmitted
through open wounds, meaning infection will not occur easily, Taiwan's health
minister said Tuesday in trying to ease public anxiety over the superbug.</P>
      <P>Taiwan reported on Monday that a TV cameraman who was infected during a hospital
stay in New Delhi in September had become the country's first carrier of multi-
drug resistant bacteria with the gene mutation known as NDM-1.</P>
      <P>But because he was asymptomatic, he was discharged from Taipei Veterans General
Hospital Monday, raising fears he could spread the NDM-1 gene carried in the bug
to other bacteria, which could eventually infect others.</P>
      <P>Health Minister Yaung Chih-liang told reporters prior to a legislative hearing
that because the superbug was a category-four notifiable disease, the cameraman,
described as healthy and well, was not subject to quarantine by law.</P>
      <P>After a discussion with specialists, the carrier was sent home because remaining
in the hospital could lead to possible infections of other hospital patients,
Yaung said.</P>
      <P>"We cannot stop the bug" because there could be an incubation period for healthy
carriers, said Yaung, who contended it was safer to return the infected
individual to his community.</P>
      <P>But Yaung also noted that economic activity could not suddenly be brought to a
halt, making it "impossible" to restrict the carrier's daily activities.</P>
      <P>The priority now, he said, was to improve hospital infection control practices.</P>
      <P>"I have to be frank, it is unstoppable, " Yaung said of the NDM-1 gene, which
makes bacteria resistant even to the carbapenem group of antibiotics known as
"last resort" drugs.</P>
      <P>Yaung said the bug was "definitely unlike" the swine flu, known medically as
influenza A (H1N1) . Swine flu, he said, was spread through phlegm and coughing,
while the superbug is transmitted through wounds and, like hepatitis B, is not
easily transferred to others.</P>
      <P>"It is a problem, but it will definitely not become a nationwide public health
crisis immediately, " Yaung added, pledging that health officials will keep
track of the bacteria.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Yaung  said the DOH has decided  to fine the Chinese-language Apple
Daily for running a picture of the superbug carrier in Tuesday's paper.</P>
      <P>Though the carrier's identity is known, the paper was not allowed to print his
picture in the newspaper, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>"Maybe Apple Daily has more money than others, so we will fine them," he said.</P>

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative  Yuan held a public hearing  Monday as a pre-screening of the
president's judicial nominations. Legislators, however, had collected very
limited information about Rai Hau-min, the candidate to lead the Judicial Yuan,
obtaining only a biography of Rai with no mention of his ideas for judicial
reform.</P>
      <P>There is a big difference between Taiwan and the United States in dealing with
judicial nomination hearings. On the nomination of Elena Kagan for Supreme Court
justice, for example, the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee compiled 70 files on
Kagan and her opinions and spent four days hearing the testimony of 26
witnesses.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan must change its bad habit of goofing around and learn from
the serious attitude of the U.S. Senate to be qualified to demand judicial
reform. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 5, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Over 500 residents of Tainan County's Longci Township smashed chairs, flipped
tables, and clashed with police Tuesday to protest the construction of a
proposed landfill that they feared will cause irreversible damage to the area's
ecosystem.</P>
      <P>The project, involving a landfill and an industrial waste management facility in
the Longci Industrial Park, has received the green light from the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) and the Tainan County Government, but the
protesters were not convinced it will be environmentally sound.</P>
      <P>"We are adamantly against the project because we believe the toxic by-products
will seep into the ground and taint our water, soil and air, " said Cheng Wen-
chien, an environmental specialist at the Longci Township office.</P>
      <P>"Although the company has assured us they will keep pollution to the minimum,
area residents are still extremely worried."</P>
      <P>The protests broke out at a meeting in the township held by the project's
contractor, Ocin Environmental Co.,  to notify local residents of the landfill
plan, on which work is scheduled to begin at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Several people were reportedly hurt during the altercations, but the project's
contractor insisted that the plan will move forward despite the staunch
opposition of local residents.</P>
      <P>"The company will continue doing its best to communicate with local residents
but there is no plan to suspend the project, " said Hsu Chih-hau, manager of the
partially state-owned Ocin Environmental Company, which was awarded the project
by the Industrial Development Bureau.</P>
      <P>Addressing the protesters' concerns, Hsu told the Central News Agency that his
company has planned ample measures to prevent any leakage  of  toxic  products,
including  using  cement-based solidification  to treat waste materials  and
recycling  water discharged from the facility.</P>
      <P>He also said much of the 41-hectare site designated for the project will retain
its original landscape because the landfill and waste management plant will only
occupy 14.5 hectares of land.</P>
      <P>The project has economic benefits as well, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The company is obligated by law to contribute NT$60 million to the Tainan County
government, with 70 percent of the funds going directly to Longci Township to
fund local development, the executive said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the project will create an estimated 30 to 50 jobs once it becomes
operational roughly 10 months after construction begins, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>But with local residents becoming more environmentally conscious, Hsu and his
company may still face resistance in the future.</P>
      <P>One protester, Hsiao Hsiu-hua, said she will fight against the landfill to the
end.</P>
      <P>"Who in their right mind would accept a garbage dump right in their backyard?"
she wondered.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.55 percent Tuesday as investors took cues from
a Wall Street fall overnight amid lingering concerns over the global economy,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 45.67 points to 8,200.43, after moving between 8,155.30
and 8,217.86, on turnover of NT$116.34 billion (US$3.72 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 0.34 percent on the Wall Street losses, and the pressure
increased as investors continued to abandon the high-tech sector on fears that a
rising Taiwan dollar would undermine the export-oriented sector's global
competitiveness, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,739 stocks closed down and 1,102 finished up, with 255 stocks
remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>The foodstuff sector suffered the steepest decline, down 1.92 percent. Textiles
shares fell 1.91 percent, plastics and chemical stocks lost 0.66 percent,
machinery and electronics shares shed 0.64 percent and financials closed down
0.58 percent.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector lost 0.48 percent and the cement sector fell 0.43
percent, while the construction sector rose 0.91 percent.</P>
      <P>"After a recent strong showing, the local bourse was susceptible to negative
factors at home and abroad as investors tended to take profits," Mega Securities
analyst Alex Huang said.</P>
      <P>Huang said the worse than expected August factory orders data in the U.S.
dampened market sentiment as investors were afraid that further disappointing
economic figures would indicate a weak global economy.</P>
      <P>"Investors here seized the decline on Wall Street as an excuse to sell," Huang
said.  "The current high valuation of the local market may encourage more
selling to test the 8,100-point level soon."</P>
      <P>Huang advised investors  to keep their distance  from the bellwether electronics
sector,  in particular the semiconductor segment, as it needs more time to
overcome competitiveness concerns.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. fell 1.29 percent to NT$61.10 and rival
United Microelectronics Corp. lost 0.72 percent to NT$13.70.</P>
      <P>However, the transport sector outperformed the broader market on increasing
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges, with China Airlines up 2.14 percent at NT$23.90
and EVA Airways up 1.27 percent at NT$27.90.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A new urban renewal plan unveiled by the government will likely keep home prices
high by encouraging more funds to flow into the local property market, an
analyst said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) approved on Monday a
proposal by the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) to earmark more than NT$18
billion (US$576 million) in financial assistance to help homeowners remodel or
rebuild their properties.</P>
      <P>"While the central bank has raised interest rates to cap local property prices,
the government continues to pump capital into the market," Hua Nan Securities
analyst Lin Cheng-chien said.</P>
      <P>"The market has gotten the message. The government does not seem to want to see
local property prices fall," Lin said.</P>
      <P>The central bank hiked the discount rate by another 0.125 percentage points at a
policy-making meeting on Sept. 30, marking the second consecutive quarterly rate
hike since June.</P>
      <P>The central bank's move was interpreted by market observers as the latest in a
series of measures to prevent a property bubble.</P>
      <P>Lin said the NT$18 billion urban renewal plan, which still requires approval of
the Cabinet, is expected to boost home prices, especially in the Greater Taipei
area, where those who participate in the plan will reap relatively higher
financial gains.</P>
      <P>Home prices in the Greater Taipei area have risen more than 30 percent after the
local property market was hard-hit by a global financial meltdown in 2008.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying, deputy minister of the CEPD, said the urban renewal plan aims to
improve the living standards of the country's urban areas and provide a better
living environment for the public.</P>
      <P>The government is expected to receive applications from about 20,000 home owners
for loans to rebuild or remodel their properties under the plan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou and Premier Wu Den-yih said recently that the government
could study the possibility of imposing a luxury tax or a capital gains tax
targeting wealthy individuals in an effort to narrow Taiwan's growing gap
between rich and poor.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) , however, has been unusually passive about the
idea, saying that the government needs to take "timing" into consideration in
conducting tax reform.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years,  the MOF's performance has been disappointing because
it has always complied with whatever was dictated  by its "higher-ups."  We hope
this time  the MOF's "higher-ups" are serious about promoting reform, because
this will greatly increase its chance of success.</P>
      <P>In fact, similar reform proposals have undergone numerous studies and
discussions, and the government is well aware of whether they are feasible or
not. What the government needs now is the determination to put the ideas for
reform into practice, rather than conducting more studies. (Editorial abstract

    <TEXT>
      <P>The recent appreciation of Taiwan's currency was "not surprising at all" because
it has simply mirrored the rise of other Asian currencies against the weakening
U.S. dollar, Taiwan's top economic planner said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the sideline of an economic seminar, Council for Economic Planning
and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman Christina Liu said most Asian currencies --
and especially the Japanese yen -- have been relatively strong against the
greenback recently.</P>
      <P>"Although Japan's economy has not yet staged a strong recovery, the U.S. and
European economies have not performed so well either, and that resulted in a
stronger yen against the greenback and euro and the rise of other Asian
currencies," Liu said.</P>
      <P>"Therefore,  the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar is not surprising at all."</P>
      <P>The local currency closed at NT$31.250 against the U.S. dollar Monday, its
highest level against the greenback in two years, and even broke the NT$31
barrier during the session before the central bank intervened.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar's appreciation of 2.4 percent over the past month has fueled
growth  concerns  because  of the country's export-oriented economy.</P>
      <P>The electronics sub-index on Taiwan's stock exchange has fallen by 1.8 percent
over the last three trading sessions on investor fears that companies in the
country's dominant industry could see their margins squeezed if the currency
appreciates much further.</P>
      <P>Liu said, however,  that Asian countries have become less resistant to allowing
their currencies to rise over the past six months, because of a growing focus on
boosting domestic demand instead of relying heavily on exports.</P>
      <P>The appreciation of the local currency would not only benefit domestic-demand
sectors, but also benefit manufacturers that need to import raw materials as
well as Taiwanese residents traveling abroad, she said.</P>
      <P>Liu argued that a country's currency should reflect its genuine value, without
favoring specific industries or people, and that its central bank needs to let
the market reflect the value of the currency.</P>
      <P>That appeared to be at odds with the position of Taiwan's central bank, which
has intervened in the market to keep the country's exchange rate against the
greenback at relatively stable levels in the face of an influx of hot money.</P>
      <P>The central bank's approach has led observers to call the NT$31 exchange rate
the "Perng Fai-nan" barrier, referring to the central bank governor.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's  currency closed relatively  unchanged  Tuesday at NT$31.252 to the
greenback, after moving as high as NT$31.035 earlier in the day.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday that the government will deal with the issues
surrounding a collapse at a construction site on the No. 6 Freeway in central
Taiwan in which seven people died, including six runaway Indonesian workers.</P>
      <P>The premier said in an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan that the
government will investigate to see if there were any flaws in the design and
construction at the construction site, as well as probing possible negligence on
the part of the contractors.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the fatal collapse of a 50-meter tall, 80-meter wide section
of scaffolding used in the construction of a freeway interchange last Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The government will definitely deal with any contractors who have hired illegal
foreign workers," he said.</P>
      <P>He noted that there were at one point 90,000 foreign workers unaccounted for and
that after efforts by the Council of Labor Affairs and related government
agencies, 60,000 have been found and repatriated, leaving 30,000 still
unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>"The government has to deal with the issue quickly; otherwise, they will still
be a potential source of disturbance," he added.</P>
      <P>In related news that same day, the sixth and final Indonesian victim of the
freeway accident was identified as Mansur Ali, the National Immigration Agency

      <P>The premier also mentioned three accidents involving the Formosa Plastics Group,
one of Taiwan's largest private conglomerates -- two fires and explosions at its
petrochemical complex in Mailiao in July and a fire that wreaked havoc at its
Nanya plant in Chiayi Sunday.</P>

      <P>Philippine immigration authorities on Monday arrested two Taiwanese men
suspected of drug trafficking between Taiwan and the Philippines.</P>

      <P>Lin, who has run a seafood company in Davao since 1999, allegedly gave a boat
captain 16 pieces of high-purity heroin of 375 grams apiece, the CIB said.</P>
      <P>The other key suspect, surnamed Chang, was also involved in a violation of the
Narcotics Endangerment Prevention Act in 2000.</P>
      <P>In addition to the two key suspects, authorities also arrested four Taiwanese at
Lin's company who were suspected of working in the Philippines without work
permits.</P>
      <P>Lin and Chang are expected to be extradited to Taiwan within two months if they
are not found to be involved in any other criminal cases in the Philippines, the
police said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Symposium reviews relations with US, Japan, China</HEADLINE>

      <P>A strong security partnership between the United States and Japan is vital for
Taiwan's  security  and confidence, and China's growing military prowess is
aimed at more than just unifying Taiwan, former Japanese and U.S. officials said
Tuesday at a symposium.</P>
      <P>"A strong U.S.-Japan alliance allows Taiwan to feel secure" and Taiwan's
security would be badly damaged if the U.S. could not respond in the region
quickly enough due to a lack of presence in Japan, said Dan Blumenthal, a
research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who served as senior
country director for China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mongolia under the U.S. State
Department.</P>
      <P>Blumenthal was speaking at an international symposium on "50 years of U.S.-Japan
Security Alliance and the Security of Taiwan" in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The U.S. and Japan signed a treaty of mutual cooperation and security in 1960 to
strengthen Japan's relations with the West during the Cold War. At the "two-
plus-two" Security Consultative Conference in 2005, the Taiwan Strait was
explicitly included for the first time as a common interest.</P>
      <P>Blumenthal said, however, that insecurity has often been ignored in Washington
and that the current U.S. administration tends to embrace slogans without
strategic thinking.</P>
      <P>With China's rapidly growing economic and military power, the balance of power
in East Asia has changed as China "has unmasked itself," showing that its
military expansion means more than just the eventual unification of Taiwan,
Blumenthal said. China has clear goals in its military buildup because it is
"quite unhappy with many political arrangements in the Asian Pacific region," he
said.</P>
      <P>China has been trying to throw its weight around in Asia, he said, evidenced by
a series of international events this year, including the crisis on the Korean
Peninsula and disputes in the East China Sea and the South China Sea.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-Japan security treaty was more than just a bilateral partnership but
also "public goods" that played a stabilizing role in East Asia and will benefit
Taiwan and other countries, Japanese Congressman Shigeru Ishiba, who served as
Minister of Defense in the former Liberal Democratic Party administration, wrote
in a thesis delivered at the symposium. He did not attend the symposium due to a
political commitment in Japan.</P>
      <P>Japan and Taiwan have been "sandwiched" between a pair of superpowers -- a
rising China and a "declining U.S." -- and both need to find a position that
serves their national interests, said Gen Nakatani, a congressman who served as
head of the Japan Defense Agency under former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of the Taiwan Strait in the 2005 two-plus-two declaration is
Japan's "commitment as a country" and is expected to be kept in place regardless
of which party is in power, Nakatani said.</P>
      <P>The one-day symposium was organized by the Taiwan National Security Institute
and gathered scholars and former officials from Taiwan, Japan and the U.S.</P>

      <P>Solar power generation system outfitters urged the government Tuesday to speed
up the purchasing of solar power generated by private firms to help the sector
survive.</P>
      <P>Under the Renewable Energy Development Act, the government is allowed to
purchase solar power or other renewable electricity generated by the private
sector to encourage private enterprises to engage in the green energy business.</P>
      <P>Life Lai, head of the Solar Power Generation System Association of the Republic
of China, said that the application procedure to seek government purchases of
solar power is very complicated, making it difficult for applicants to enjoy the
benefits of the incentives. The association comprises companies that design
solar energy systems for businesses and government offices.</P>
      <P>"It is stunning that since the law was enacted in July 2009, none of the six
applications that were filed to seek government purchases have been approved,"
Lai said.</P>
      <P>"Before the government purchases the power, the firms that bought the generation
equipment from us will not pay," he said.</P>
      <P>Lai said the sticking point is that state-owned Taiwan Power Co., which acts as
the only renewable power buyer on behalf of the government, has erected
procedural barriers that make the approval impossible.</P>
      <P>Lai said an applicant needs to complete an application of about 250 pages before
a long reviewing process by five groups inside Taipower.</P>
      <P>The government should remove the barriers to allow easier purchases, or the
firms that manufacture and sell solar power generation equipment will not be
able to survive, he said.</P>
      <P>The number of local solar power generation equipment makers has fallen to about
36 from a peak of more than 200 before a global financial meltdown hurt the
local economy in 2008.</P>
      <P>"The difficulties in landing government purchases of power have made the
situation worse, " Lai said. "Without any improvement in the application
process, the number will continue to fall."</P>

      <P>A collection of 12 Taiwanese films are ready to take the 15th Pusan
International Film Festival by storm this week to show Taiwan's cinematic
prowess, the Government Information Office (GIO) said Tuesday, two days before
the festival is set to kick off.</P>
      <P>Ranging from romantic  comedies to suspense  thrillers  to tearjerkers,  the 12
films best represent  Taiwan's  cinematic creativity and "soft power, " said
Chen Chih-kuan, director of the Department of Motion Pictures under the GIO.</P>
      <P>"After Cape No. 7 in 2008, Taiwan's film industry has enjoyed a boom period,
churning one great movie after another. There is no time like right now to
invest in Taiwanese movies, " he said, recalling a dark period for the industry
a few years back when a local film was considered a smash if it grossed over
NT$3 million (US$96,674).</P>
      <P>Paying tribute to the Taiwanese directors and producers who refused to give up
their silver screen dreams even during the tough times, Chen said that at
present, "a Taiwan-made movie can easily reel in over NT$10 million."</P>
      <P>This year, avant-garde director Tsai Ming-liang, who has reached the top tier in
filmmaking for his pushing-the-envelope style, will be honored with the title of
Asian Filmmaker of the Year.</P>
      <P>In addition, six Taiwanese films have been invited to compete in the "A Window
on Asian Cinema" category, including Ho Wi-ding's "Pinoy Sunday" which takes a
stab at the issue of labor by tickling the audience's funny bone, Arvin Chen's
crime-caper-romantic-comedy "Au Revoir, Taipei, " and toe-curling thriller "Zoom
Hunting" by Cho Li.</P>
      <P>Chung Mong-hong's "The Fourth Portrait" featuring a cast of acclaimed actors,
"Taipei Exchanges" by Hsiao Ya-chuan, who is a frequent guest at international
film festivals,  and Hollywood big-name director John Woo's action-packed "Reign
of Assassins" will also be shown.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest honors received by Taiwanese filmmakers at this year's event
is the chance to present "When Love Comes, " a film that explores the issue of
unwanted pregnancy and wedlock by award-winning  director Chang Tso-chi,  at the
festival's Gala Presentation.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese actress Yang Kuei-mei has also been invited to be one of the five
jurors for the "New Currents" category, which honors up-and-coming Asian
filmmakers.</P>
      <P>An additional 18 Taiwanese films will be featured in the "Asian Film Market, "
an event on the sidelines of the festival aimed at educating the region's next
generation of filmmakers.</P>
      <P>The festival is slated to take place Oct. 7-15 and Taiwan's representative
office in South Korea will host a reception to showcase Taiwan's cinematic
achievements, according to the GIO.</P>
      <P>The Pusan event is the most prestigious film event in Asia and is expected to
attract 150,000 film lovers from around the world this year.</P>
      <P>The organizers said the festival will boast a record 103 world premiers among
its line-up of 308 films.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is finding it easier to host international meetings in the wake of the
signing of the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) earlier this
year,  the Ministry of Economic Affairs said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Alice Chou,  a project leader of the Meeting,  Incentive, Conference and
Exhibition Project Office, said one of the most important of these, the annual
standards meeting of the Third Generation Partnership Project, will take place
in Taiwan for the first time next February.</P>
      <P>The annual meeting brings together a number of influential telecommunications
standards bodies to produce globally applicable technical specifications, which
will help improve Taiwan's telecom industry.</P>
      <P>As the convention and exhibition industry is included on Taiwan's ECFA "early
harvest" list, several Chinese event organizers have signed memorandums of
understanding with Taiwan, Chou said, adding that the two sides will soon co-
sponsor various meetings.</P>
      <P>There will be a total of 400 international exhibitions held in Taiwan before the
end of this year, the number and scale of which has increased since the 200-300
of last year, she said.</P>
      <P>As an example, Chou said, an annual gathering of the Lions Club in the Asia-
Pacific region, which is expected to draw tens of thousands of participants,
will take place in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung City in November.</P>

      <P>The founder of Acer Inc., the world's second largest computer maker, said
Tuesday that both tablet and netbook computers have opened new markets and are
not taking market share from laptop computers.</P>
      <P>"Tablet and netbook computers  are not replacing  notebook computers as their
functions are not exactly the same, " Stan Shih said on the sidelines of a local
forum.</P>
      <P>"(Tablet and netbook computers) represent new markets and new applications," he
told reporters.</P>
      <P>His remarks came as major electronics companies at home and abroad are jumping
on the bandwagon led by Apple's iPad to launch their own versions of tablet
computers.</P>
      <P>The rising market share of tablet computers will not necessarily result in a
fall in the market share of laptop computers in the near future, Shih said.</P>
      <P>"The market (for notebook computers) is still growing as a lot of people still
need them, " he added.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that it took many years for notebook computers to replace desktop
models.</P>
      <P>"Only when notebook computers started having big screens and when their prices
became similar to those of desktops did the market share of desktops started
shrinking," Shih said.</P>
      <P>When asked to comment on media reports that Acer will launch a tablet computer
later this year, Shih said he has not yet looked at the tablet computer and is
not aware of any plans.</P>

      <P>Digital China Holdings Ltd., a Chinese integrated IT service provider, is

    <HEADLINE>Absconded foreign laborers a loophole in management: Control Yuan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There are presently around 370,000 foreign laborers in Taiwan and nearly 33,000
have absconded and are unaccounted for, creating a loophole in the management of
foreign laborers, the Control Yuan, the nation's top watchdog body, said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan members Teresa J. C. Yin and Chien Lin Whei-jun said in an
investigation report that the National Immigration Agency (NIA) has no data
regarding the overstay period, genders or trades of the absconded laborers.</P>
      <P>"Such unaccounted foreign laborers have scattered around Taiwan, resulting in a
loophole in the management of foreign workers, " the report said.</P>
      <P>The report came after a No. 6 Freeway construction accident on Sept. 30 that
killed seven people, including six illegal Indonesian workers.</P>
      <P>The report said that according to an analysis of the latest statistics from the
Council of Labor Affairs, businesses from which foreign workers abscond said the
main reason is the urging of their colleagues (49 percent), followed by the
expiration of a hiring date (30.4 percent) and hopes for better pay (17.2
percent).</P>
      <P>In terms of trade, the absconding rates in the construction and manufacturing
sectors accounted for 21.8 percent and 11.4 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The report also found that although the council has established a foreign
brokerage agency assessment system in a bid to curb the hefty fees charged to
foreign laborers, it has not rigorously implemented an "exit" mechanism or a
policy of strongly fining offenders.</P>
      <P>The council should actively review the issue, the Control Yuan urged.</P>
      <P>The report said the number of foreign laborers was around 3,000 in 1991, but it
had ballooned to 372,146 by August 2000. The number of construction and
manufacturing laborers has gradually decreased, while the amount of caregivers
has gradually increased, the report added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan plans to apply its experience of using vehicles that can serve as
computer classrooms to help bridge the digital divide between urban and rural
areas to other countries, with the Philippines likely the first, the Taiwanese
head of a regional committee said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Stan Shih, founder of Acer, Inc. -- the world's second-largest computer maker --
and chairman of the ADOC 2.0 Project Non-government Steering Committee under the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, said that the project can
benefit the maximum number of people due to its mobility.</P>
      <P>"The project can move a classroom to anywhere that needs it, " said Shih on the
sidelines of an ADOC 2.0 workshop in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Shih said that the vehicles, equipped with 20 computers and wireless
communications, can go to designated locations or simply park on the street to
allow instructors to teach local people how to use computers.</P>
      <P>"We are working to benefit as many people as possible through this project,
which we started implementing in Hualien (in eastern Taiwan)," he said.</P>
      <P>With three such vehicles so far, the project is aimed at helping 20,000 people
in the eastern county within three years of its launch in May this year.</P>
      <P>Shih told reporters at the workshop, attended by more than 100 representatives
from APEC members, that the Philippines could be the first country outside
Taiwan to adopt the project.</P>
      <P>He said that a company in the Southeast Asian country has expressed interest in
the project and might launch it early next year, using computers, teaching
materials and methodology provided by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been helping its APEC peers to bridge their digital divides and turn
them into digital opportunities, said the two-day forum's organizer, the Bureau
of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>More than 145,000 visits have been recorded at information and communication
courses in 56 centers Taiwan has helped set up in Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and other APEC economies since

      <P>Patients with advanced breast cancer pleaded with the government Tuesday to
share the heavy financial burden of cancer treatment at a press conference held
by the Foundation of Breast Cancer Prevention and Treatment.</P>
      <P>One of the two patients, a 29-year-old surnamed Wang, said that the cost of her
treatment was not reimbursed by the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI)
and that even with a private insurance company covering two-thirds of the cost,
she still has to pay around NT$30,000 (US$996.80) per month to stay alive.</P>
      <P>Wang was diagnosed with her2-positive metastatic breast cancer, or stage four,
in 2008. "I was bereft of hope when I learned that the cancer cells had reached
my brain and that trastuzumab was not working," Wang said.</P>
      <P>She said she then started taking a different drug, lapatanib, which has
stabilized her condition but has burned a hole in her pocket.</P>
      <P>Chang King-jen, chairman of the Foundation of Breast Cancer Prevention and
Treatment, said that about 80 to 100 of Taiwanese female patients like Wang, who
have responded poorly to medicines on the government's  subsidized  list,  have
difficulty  affording lapatanib, which has proved effective in prolonging
patient's lives for at least 14 months.</P>
      <P>Lin Wei-chieh, secretary-general of the Taiwan Breast Cancer Friends
Association, expressed hope that the government will consider reimbursing the
drug, giving breast cancer victims a chance to spend more time with their
families and friends.</P>

      <P>Slag from the steel-making industry has been found in a landfill near a major
reservoir in southern Taiwan's Tainan County, the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Tainan County Environmental Protection Bureau has taken samples from the
exposed slag at the Yongyang Landfill construction area upstream of the
Wushantou Reservoir's catchment region for further examination, amid concern
that the water in the reservoir might have been contaminated.</P>
      <P>Experts found the slag northwest of the site Oct. 3, said Shen Yi-fu, deputy
director of the Department of Water Quality Protection.</P>
      <P>Shen added that there are fears heavy metals and dioxin the slag contains might
have polluted the reservoir water, Shen added.</P>
      <P>Part of the landfill, which is still under construction, lies on a faultline and
the underground water in the area flows directly into the reservoir,  raising
concerns  among  local residents  and environmentalists.</P>
      <P>The Tainan Environmental Alliance has monitored the landfill for years,
suspecting that toxic waste was being dumped there despite the lack of an
operating license.</P>
      <P>Groundwater at the site has been confirmed to be polluted, Shen said, although
the source of the pollution is unclear.</P>
      <P>Shen noted that the establishment of the landfill received approval in 1992
after the Tainan County Environmental Bureau passed an environmental impact
assessment. However, the company that runs the landfill has never been allowed
to begin operating because of the site's location on a faultline.</P>
      <P>The Wushantao Reservoir supplies water for irrigation of the Chia-Nan Plain
region, for industry, and for water used by a population of over 1 million in
the Tainan area.</P>

      <P>A civic society comprised of professors and academics issued a statement Tuesday
calling for this year's Nobel Peace Prize to be awarded to Chinese dissident Liu
Xiaobo, who is currently serving an 11-year sentence in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The Taipei Society issued the statement ahead of the announcement of the winner,
due Oct. 8.</P>
      <P>China, with its track record of abusing human rights and repressing political
dissidents, naturally regards Liu's Charter 08 Initiative and his bid for the
peace prize as threats to the legitimacy of its regime, and has warned the Nobel
Peace Committee not to award the prize to Liu, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>The group said it stands in solidarity with Liu and called on the Nobel Peace
Committee to award the prize to Liu, despite China's official warning.</P>
      <P>The society said that a Nobel Peace Prize for Liu would mean not only
recognition of his long-term dedication to human rights and democratic reforms
in China, but would also send a clear message to the Chinese communist regime
that the world stands in solidarity with Chinese people who share Liu's vision
for a strong, prosperous and democratic China that respects individual freedom
and human rights.</P>

      <P>Agents from the Investigation Bureau under the Ministry of Justice, led by
prosecutors from the Taipei District Prosecutors Office, conducted searches of
11 sites simultaneously earlier that day, including the city government's New

      <P>Asked by reporters about the search while attending a ceremony in Taipei, Hau
said that as far he understood, the searches were just aimed at collecting data.</P>
      <P>"We respect the justice system, and hope the prosecutors will demonstrate fair

      <P>Investigators had already searched the residences and offices of five senior
city government officials Sept. 7 looking for evidence of allegations  that they
allowed contractors to fleece the city government.</P>
      <P>The probe was initiated at Hau's request after several city councilors of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) claimed the city government turned
a blind eye to construction companies that inflated the price for improving the
city's Xinsheng elevated highway.</P>
      <P>Hau, who is facing a serious challenge from a DPP candidate in his bid for a

      <P>A Taiwan-born fashion designer who rose to global fame in early 2009 after U.S.
first lady Michelle Obama wore one of his designs to her husband's inauguration
ball returned to Taipei early Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"I'm very excited (to return home), " said Jason Wu, speaking to reporters upon
his arrival at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, the country's main gateway.</P>
      <P>Though Wu returned home mainly to attend his brother's wedding, the designer
said he will also meet with President Ma Ying-jeou, whom he said he holds in
high esteem, and also with the media to share his experiences as a designer.</P>
      <P>After many years of being away from Taiwan, Wu said he misses Taiwanese foods
very much,  especially quintessential Taiwanese snacks, and he will also visit
Taipei's Shilin night market during his stay.</P>
      <P>On the  wedding  gown  that  he  has  designed  for  his sister-in-law-to-be, Wu
said it is clean, elegant, fashionable and does not follow any traditional
style.</P>
      <P>The one-shoulder  gown he designed for Michelle Obama for President Barack
Obama's inauguration ball has already become a museum piece.</P>
      <P>It was donated to the National Museum of American History, where it will join
the museum's collection of 24 other gowns worn by U.S. first ladies, including
12 worn on inauguration days.</P>
      <P>The 28-year-old designer left Taiwan when he was nine and moved to Vancouver,
Canada, where he learned to sew by designing and making doll clothes. He went on
to study sculpture in Tokyo and later enrolled at Parsons the New School for
Design in New York City.</P>
      <P>At age 16, Wu began to make freelance doll clothing designs and later traveled
around the world to study fashion design. Four years ago, he launched his own
fashion store in New York with earnings from sales of his doll clothes and
accessories.</P>
      <P>He launched his first full collection in 2006 and won Fashion Group

    <TEXT>
      <P>A fall in flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp.'s sales for September reflected a
continued product price decline amid weakening global demand, an analyst said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"The average selling price in the third quarter fell more than 10 percent from
the second quarter, worse than the previous estimate of a 5-10 percent fall, "
Grand Cathay Securities analyst Jeff Chang said.</P>
      <P>AUO Tuesday said it had sales of NT$41.99 billion (US$1.36 billion) in
September, down 3.6 percent from August. The September figure, however, was 2.5
percent higher than a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Shipments of large-sized flat panels -- panels 10 inches or larger -- fell 4
percent in September from a month earlier to about 9.51 million units, while
shipments of small- and medium-sized panels rose 11 percent to 20.14 million
units.</P>
      <P>"In the global flat panel market, supply exceeded demand in September, leaving
inventories at high levels," the analyst said.</P>
      <P>Chang said falling demand from China, which accounts for 15-20 percent of AUO's
total sales, affected shipments of the company's large-sized products.</P>
      <P>Demand is expected to pick up in October, however, as the high-tech sector
enters the fourth quarter, considered to be its peak season, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"I expect AUO will see an improvement in shipments from October as demand and
supply is expected to reach a balance," Chang said.</P>
      <P>In the third quarter, AUO shipped 28.67 million large-sized flat panels, down
3.2 percent from a quarter earlier, and 55.59 million small- and medium-sized
panels, up 0.3 percent quarter-on-quarter.</P>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academia Sinica, Taiwan's top academic research institute, is planning to turn a
25.31-hectare site at an abandoned arsenal compound into a biotech development
park. Facing environmentalists' demands to save the "last lung of Taipei City, "
it has made several changes to its original plan to show its determination to
preserve a wetland in the compound while promoting industrial development.</P>
      <P>The changes include reducing the area to be covered by the park's facilities
from 9.6 hectares to four hectares and pledging to restore a plot of grassland,
which was found to have likely been a wetland 100 years ago, to what it once
was.</P>
      <P>These efforts to compromise with nature, however, have not even gained the
slightest hint of approval from the green activists, who rejected them outright.
The lesson of the case seems to be that no matter how hard Academia Sinica
tries, it has faced a complete veto. Under  such  circumstances,  why even
bother  compromising  on conservation issues?</P>
      <P>The future biotech research laboratories and production lines have all been
planned to sit on a site that already is home to cement structures from the old
arsenal, which begs another question: how could the site that was used to make
weapons not be suitable for biotech research laboratories?</P>
      <P>Rational environmentalists should articulate their thoughts and opinions on the
changes instead of rejecting any possibility that may strike a balance between
industrial development and ecological conservation. (Editorial abstract -- Oct.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves continued their upward spiral in September to
hit another record high of US$380.51 billion, marking the 23rd consecutive month
that they have set a new record.</P>
      <P>In September alone, the foreign exchange reserves increased by an amazing
US$8.44 billion. The Central Bank of the Republic of China (CBC)  attributed
the hefty rise to returns on its currency investments and gains by the euro and
other major currencies against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Market analysts, however, said the reason for the big gain in foreign exchange
reserves was the central bank's buying of the greenback during the month in a
bid to prevent the Taiwan dollar from appreciating too drastically against the
U.S. currency.</P>
      <P>Whether the central bank should continue intervening in the foreign exchange
market to keep the local unit's exchange rate at bay has become a new focus of
debate, particularly after Japan's central bank surprised investors Tuesday by
effectively cutting its main interest rate to zero percent.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan has said on many occasions that the bank cannot be a
symbol of Taiwan's economic strength if increases in its foreign exchange
reserves mainly stem from the CBC's moves to stabilize the local currency.</P>
      <P>He has also repeatedly acknowledged that such a phenomenon will not be a boon to
the country's economic health over the long term.</P>
      <P>Asked about her views on local electronics makers' remarks that they will be
unable to survive if the New Taiwan dollar surges past the level of NT$31
against the greenback, Christina Liu, chairwoman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, said Tuesday that no country can afford to peg its
currency policy to a single industry's well-being.</P>
      <P>In the long run, Liu said, Asian countries, including Taiwan, cannot rely solely
on exports as the growth engine for their economic development.</P>
      <P>While currency appreciation would hobble export competitiveness, it could also
help expand domestic demand, Liu said. Asian countries should work to stimulate
domestic demand as a new strategy to spur economic growth, she added. (Oct. 6,
2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>The Bank of Japan cut its key interest rate to a range of zero to 0.1 percent
Tuesday and said it might set up a 5 trillion yen (US$60 billion) fund to buy
government bonds and other assets in an attempt to prop up the country's
faltering economy.</P>
      <P>Financial market experts said Japan's move could be a prelude to a second round
of quantitative easing (QE2) policies around the world since the outbreak of the
global financial crisis two years ago.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports said the U.S. Fed is likely to follow Japan's lead
to announce new QE2 measures in November and that the Bank of England is already
warming up for new easing steps.</P>
      <P>Some local market analysts said central banks around the world will be in the
spotlight this week, particularly on Thursday when the European Central Bank and
the Bank of England meet.</P>
      <P>But the main focus of the week across all markets will be a run on U.S. economic
data that could have a bearing on whether the Fed takes further action to
stimulate the U.S. economy. Most important will be Friday's jobs data, as this
often sets the market tone for a week or two after release. (Oct. 6, 2010).</P>

set up an R&amp;D center here as well.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Technology Research Institute, the Institute for Information

develop cloud computing technologies.</P>
      <P>However, Intel is still considering whether to establish a separate R&amp;D
center or expand its existing center to include cloud computing, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport was criticized Wednesday for sending a
traveler who fainted after arriving from China to a regional hospital that
lacked key emergency equipment, the latest in a series of complaints about the
airport's management.</P>
      <P>Family members of Chou Chang Chin-hao, who died on Oct. 3, accused the airport
of ignoring their desire to send the 80-year-old woman to Linkou Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital after she fainted at the arrival terminal.</P>
      <P>They said that when neighbors traveling with the patient asked that she be sent
to the biggest medical center in the area, the ambulance driver refused because
the airport was bound by a contract with Landseed Hospital, a regional teaching
hospital.</P>
      <P>The family charged that Landseed Hospital's attitude was poor and complained
that it did not have an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) machine that
they believe would have given Chou Chang a chance to survive.</P>
      <P>Wu Ching-pyng, an attending physician at Landseed Hospital, said the patient did
not have any vital signs when she arrived at the facility.</P>
      <P>Though he did call other larger hospitals to try to get access to an ECMO
machine, Wu said his pleas were rejected because the other hospitals felt the
machine would not help the patient.</P>
      <P>Chou Chang died of pneumonia-induced septic shock, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Lee  Wan-lee,  vice  director  of  the  Civil  Aeronautics Administration, said
the agency will investigate the family's claims.</P>
      <P>The airport, Taiwan's main gateway, has come under fire since late June when a
jetway collapsed at the airport's Terminal 2.</P>
      <P>In early July, the airport again drew attention for the wrong reason when
staffers with the airport's central control room were caught holding a party
with alcoholic beverages while on duty.</P>
      <P>Repeated bathroom leaks that have left both of the airport's terminals flooded
and complaints of defective equipment and unclear signs in terminal lobbies have
only compounded the facility's woes.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 1.01 percent Wednesday after an overnight surge on
Wall Street, with buying focusing on domestic demand-oriented stocks, in
particular property firms, whose asset values are expected to be lifted by a
rising New Taiwan dollar, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 83.60 points to 8,284.03, after moving between 8,267.61
and 8,301.39, on turnover of NT$148.35 billion (US$4.79 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 1.17 percent on a knee jerk reaction to a five-month high
on Wall Street overnight after Japan's central bank lowered its key interest
rates to stimulate the country's economy, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>While old economy stocks got boosted by a rising local currency, the bellwether
electronics sector appeared relatively lackluster, which compromised the gains
to some extent, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,661 stocks closed up and 1,339 were down with 313 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The construction sector posted the highest gains, up 3.55 percent. Cement stocks
added 2.59 percent, foodstuffs rose 2.41 percent, paper and pulp shares gained
2.19 percent and financial stocks rose 1.1 percent.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector added 0.86 percent, the textile sector rose
0.65 percent and plastics and chemicals closed up 0.34 percent.</P>
      <P>"Investors have high hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will follow its
Japanese counterpart and loosen its monetary policy," First Capital Management
analyst Edward Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Once the Fed cuts interest rates, the world's capital markets will be awash in
high liquidity, further lifting share prices," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He said this optimism spread to the local bourse,  where traditional industrial
stocks attracted buyers due to a stronger Taiwan dollar, although the higher
local currency stirred up concerns over the global competitiveness of the high
tech sector.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the local market posted strong gains Wednesday, "unless
the electronics sector stages a significant rebound, it will not be easy for the
index to surmount the nearest technical resistance mark of 8,395 points."</P>
      <P>In the construction sector, Cathay Real Estate gained 7 percent to close at
NT$18.35, Goldsun Development rose 6.91 percent to end at NT$16.25 and Prince
Housing added 6.38 percent to NT$25.85 at close of trade.</P>
      <P>Among the high tech stocks, personal computer vendor AsusTek closed unchanged at
NT$221.00 and IC designer MediaTek fell 0.72 percent to end the day at
NT$412.50.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. conducting assessment of Taiwan's defense needs</HEADLINE>

10/06/10  17:37:37

    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington has begun a sweeping assessment of Taiwan's defense needs over the
next five to 10 years to determine the types of defensive weapon systems the
United States should provide it with, a U.S. business leader said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, which
groups U.S. companies with interests in Taiwan, made the remarks  following  the
2010 U.S.-Taiwan  Defense Industry Conference that took place in Cambridge,
Maryland Oct. 3-5, bringing together more than 140 government officials,
scholars, experts and defense company representatives.</P>
      <P>The assessment, the most complete and comprehensive of its kind in 10 years,
will include an examination of the threat faced by Taiwan from China and
Taiwan's capacity to engage in asymmetric warfare, Hammond-Chambers said.</P>
      <P>Participants from Taiwan and the U.S. at the annual conference agreed
unanimously that although Taiwan and China have concluded an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that is set to further enhance cross-
Taiwan Strait economic ties, China's military threat to Taiwan persists and the
strait remains "one of the globe's potential flashpoints," according Hammond-
Chambers.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's deputy defense minister, Andrew Yang, also said in a speech at the
conference that the security threat faced by Taiwan from China has not declined
because of the ECFA, but in fact has increased.</P>
      <P>Hammond-Chambers said that after the assessment is completed in the next one or
two years, the U.S. will not "tell" Taiwan what defense systems it is getting,
but instead will "begin dialogue with Taiwan" on the contents of the assessment,
as well as on Taiwan's ability to afford arms purchases.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan's renewed call for the U.S. to sell it F-16C/D fighters, he said that
to his knowledge, the U.S. is not thinking so much about whether it should sell
Taiwan the advanced jet fighters, but more about the best timing to make the
sale.</P>
      <P>Hammond-Chambers  said it would  not surprise  him if the administration of U.S.
President Barack Obama announces the F-16C/D sale within a year, as well as the
upgrading of the F-16A/B fighters currently used by Taiwan's air force.</P>
      <P>Yang noted a day earlier that Taiwan has long sought to acquire F-16C/D jet
fighters and upgrade its F-16A/Bs to guard the country's airspace and enhance
its self-defense capability.</P>
      <P>"The purchase of 66 F-16C/Ds and the upgrading of F-16A/Bs are two different
cases and they are not alternative cases subject to choice between the two,"
Yang said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Japanese National Diet lower house member Gen Nakatani said in Taipei Tuesday
that the absence of a NATO-like organization in Northeast Asia has made the
existing Japan-U.S. security alliance extremely important and he suggested that
Taiwan collaborate with Tokyo and Washington to contain the threat from China.</P>
      <P>Nakatani was bold and straightforward to make such a suggestion. His remarks
reflect Japan's anxiety over the rapidly growing China threat, as evidenced by
the two countries' recent spat over the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands.</P>
      <P>In the wake of the rift, both the United States and Japan have come to
understand the importance of Taiwan should they ever need to impose a naval
blockade against China.</P>
      <P>During the Cold War, Taiwan clearly understood that it should side with the U.S.
and Japan to fight the China threat. The situation, however, has changed over
the past two years.</P>
      <P>The latest improvements in cross-Taiwan Strait relations could someday give
Taiwan an embarrassing and perilous dilemma of having to choose sides in the
race between Washington and Beijing for hegemony in East Asia.</P>
      <P>Both the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou and the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party should begin soul-searching on how Taiwan should
respond in the event of a military conflict between China and the U.S.-Japan
alliance. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 6, 2010).</P>

      <P>A ceremony redolent with feelings of gratitude was held at the Taiwan Fund for
Children and Families (TFCF) in the central city of Taichung Wednesday to
celebrate the 60th founding anniversary of the non-profit organization dedicated
to helping children in need.</P>
      <P>Thank-you cards from children from 22 countries who are being sponsored by
Taiwanese donors through a TFCF sponsorship program were displayed at the party,
which was attended by Presidential Office Secretary-General Liao Liou-yi,
ChildFund Alliance Chairman David Taylor and two sons of the late Glen D.
Graber, a priest from the United States who was the TFCF's first chairman.</P>
      <P>Liao praised the TFCF for its remarkable achievements in helping underprivileged
children and their families, and described its establishment as "one of the
brightest pages in the Republic of China's history."</P>
      <P>The TFCF began as the China's Children Fund established in 1938 by a group of
American Christians in Richmond, Virginia to help thousands of homeless Chinese
orphans during the Sino-Japanese War.</P>
      <P>In 1950, the organization set up its first family-style orphanage in Taiwan to
shelter needy children whose families had been struck by accidents, opening the
second chapter of the TFCF's history.</P>
      <P>Over the years, the TFCF has opened 23 branches, 28 service offices, three
shelters for the physically and mentally challenged, as well as seven shelters
for children and teenagers around Taiwan. It has also set up a branch in
Mongolia.</P>
      <P>It joined ChildFund International -- which was later renamed ChildFund Alliance
-- in 2002 to further expand its sponsorship to foreign children in need. So
far, it has helped more than 230,000 domestic and foreign children living in
poverty with its sponsorship programs, according to the TFCF.</P>
      <P>ChildFund Alliance is an alliance of global, developmental child sponsorship
organizations that implement lasting and meaningful changes in the lives of
impoverished children and families worldwide.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan depositary receipts (TDRs) of China-based textile maker China Taisan
Technology Group Holdings Ltd. jumped on its debut on Taiwan's stock exchange
Wednesday, with demand far outstripping supply.</P>
      <P>China Taisan's TDRs rose by the maximum-allowed 7 percent to NT$13.00 (US$0.42)
with only 100,000 shares changing hands, while the benchmark weighted index
closed up 1.01 percent at 8,284.03.</P>
      <P>"Investors embraced high hopes that the fast growing China market will further
boost the company's bottom line, " TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih said.</P>
      <P>Unlike IPO share prices, which can rise or fall freely in the first five days of
trading, TDR prices can only rise or fall by a maximum 7 percent from their
first day of trading, according to the local bourse's rules.</P>
      <P>That kept the volume for China Taisan TDRs low, despite heavy demand. According
to the stock exchange, buying orders for the TDRs exceeded 150 million shares.</P>
      <P>"The interest is so strong that the TDRs will enjoy further significant gains
the rest of the week," Shih said.</P>
      <P>China Taisan, which has been listed in Singapore since 2008, is a supplier of
performance fabrics used in the production of sportswear and casual wear for
international brands such as Reebok, Nike, Adidas, FILA and Lotto, as well as
Chinese brands including Li-Ning, Qiaodan and Septwolves.</P>
      <P>The company's production facilities are located in Jinjiang in China's Fujian
Province. The city is known as China's sportswear hub.</P>
      <P>The company said it will expand its production capacity by building new
facilities in Jinjiang next year, and the new plant is expected to start
operations in the fourth quarter of the year.</P>
      <P>In the first half of this year, China Taisan posted net income of 109 million
Chinese yuan (NT$505 million), up 192 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>The company said net profit for the entire 2010 is expected to reach 225 million
Chinese yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Student teams revitalize small businesses with e-commerce ideas</HEADLINE>

      <P>A student team that originally quit the competition ended up winning a
government-sponsored  e-commerce marketing contest by helping a cosmetics
company use the Internet to spark to its business, the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Competing  in the "E-commerce  Creative Marketing  Contest" organized by the
MOEA, 31 student teams were each assigned to help a small- and medium-sized
enterprise that had applied for online marketing assistance to improve sales.</P>
      <P>The winning team, composed of students from Shih Hsin University and National
Taiwan Normal University (NTNU) , helped improve the online traffic of a
cosmetic mask company by 44 percent by using the social networking sites Plurk
and Facebook as marketing channels.</P>
      <P>But the team almost did not make it to the finish line.</P>
      <P>Team leader Huang I-shun said the original group of students from Shih Hsin
University quit soon after the contest got underway at the end of May because
they could not bear the pressure.</P>
      <P>The team was later reorganized, however, with the addition of some students from
NTNU, and it eventually won for its contribution to the cosmetic mask company
during the two months the contest was held until the end of July.</P>
      <P>"As I told the newcomers, it was never going to be easy to go for the
championship," Huang said.</P>
      <P>It was the first time the MOEA created a category for student groups in the
annual contest that was launched in 2000 to encourage online marketing
creativity to help smaller businesses expand their reach.</P>
      <P>The goal of adding the student category was to enhance the participants'
competitiveness before they entered the job market, the MOEA said.</P>
      <P>Porsh Tsai, a member of another team that won an excellence award, said his
team's project helped a small online vendor recruit 30 retailers to post their
products on its sales platform.</P>
      <P>"Our project has been extended and funded by another enterprise that is very
interested in it," she said.</P>
      <P>The MOEA conceived of the idea after finding that most companies in suburban or
rural areas rarely promoted their businesses with online tools like electronic
direct mail or social networking websites, which are widely used in the student
community.</P>
      <P>"We hope the prize-winning projects can have a long-term impact on small firms
in Taiwan, similar to long-term efforts to promote a sport,"  said Mei Hua, one
of the judges at the contest's awards ceremony.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Export Import Bank of Korea (Kexim) signed a dollar-denominated syndicated
loan worth US$262 million with Taiwan Cooperative Bank (TCB) Wednesday -- the
first time a Korean firm has ever raised capital via a syndicated loan in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>TCB, the lead bank for the syndicated loan, said that 17 banks took part in the
loan, which was over-subscribed by 30 percent against the originally planned
amount of US$200 million.</P>
      <P>"The number  of banks participating  in the loan and the over-subscriptions were
higher than our expectations, " said a senior official in TCB's syndication
department who declined to be named.</P>
      <P>The amount of most of the bank's syndicated loans over the past year was less
than US$200 million, the official noted.</P>
      <P>The official said that many local major banks participated in the syndication
because Kexim is a state-run bank with sound credit ratings, and the loan's
interest rate is relatively good.</P>
      <P>The terms -- interest rates plus up-front fees -- for the syndication were 143
basis points over the 90-day London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) -- which was
quoted at 0.2906 percent Wednesday. That resulted in the cost of borrowing at
1.7206 percent, the official said.</P>
      <P>Among the participating banks, two are from outside Taiwan: Bank SinoPac's Hong
Kong branch and the Singapore branch of Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co.</P>
      <P>The official also noted that more international companies are willing to raise
capital in Taiwan because of the lower cost of borrowing.</P>
      <P>"It would be the first time a lot of foreign companies raised money in Taiwan,"
she said.</P>
      <P>Kexim Deputy President Kim Jin-kyung said that Kexim is not only attracted by
the lower cost of funds in Taiwan, but also wants to diversify its capital-
raising sources in Asia.</P>
      <P>The Seoul-based bank does not collect deposits to fund its loans. Its major
source of funds comes from its share capital  and international capital markets.</P>
      <P>TCB Chairman Liu Teng-cheng said at the loan-signing ceremony that he hopes to
attract more foreign customers to seek syndicated loans and explore more
business for the bank.</P>
      <P>As of the end of September, TCB was ranked second as a book-runner for
syndications loans in Taiwan, following Bank of Taiwan, according to statistics
provided by the bank.</P>
      <P>TCB handled 68 syndicated loan deals worth US$3.482 billion as a book-runner in
the first three quarters of this year, translating to a market share of 9.2
percent.</P>

      <P>Morris Chang,  chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) ,  is
the most admired entrepreneur  in Taiwan,  according to a survey conducted  by
CommonWealth magazine that was released on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The magazine said Chang was a "visionary thinker" who embodied a "charismatic
leadership." Respondents agreed that Chang, who heads the world's largest
contract chip maker, demonstrated excellent management skills and innovation
capacity, allowing TSMC to enjoy an outstanding operation performance.</P>
      <P>It was the 14th year Chang topped the survey, which started in 1994, the
magazine said.</P>
      <P>The survey collected  952 valid questionnaires  from local businesspeople after
asking them to choose who the entrepreneurs they most admire based on criteria
such as management skills, corporate operation performance, business visions,
business strategy and innovation capability.</P>

entrepreneur to enter the top 10 in the survey's 16-year history, coming in the
eighth position.</P>
      <P>Wang was given a thumbs-up for her business strategy thinking and innovation
capability, as well as her ability to forge a clear management philosophy.</P>
      <P>Little affected by a recent string of suicides by Chinese workers at a factory
complex in Shenzhen, Terry Guo, chairman of Hon Hai Group, the world's largest

      <P>Several online non-English foreign-language academic platforms have been made
available, enabling not only academics but also members of the general public to
search for information in a variety of languages, the National Science Council
(NSC) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The NSC said that under a program that began in December 2008, it has provided
funds to the National Taiwan University (NTU) library to establish a pool of
Japanese-language academic information in the humanities and social sciences.</P>
      <P>So   far,    the   NTU   platform    at   http:
//jpndbs.lib.ntu.tw/DB/search.jsp has collected 11 Japanese-language databanks,
and over 400 free Japanese-language web resources, including Japan Knowledge and
an archive of the Daily Yomiuri, Japan's biggest-circulation newspaper.</P>
      <P>According to NTU library statistics, the Japanese -language online platform
recorded around 7,300 visits between July 29 last year and Sept. 30 this year,
with Japan Knowledge, an encyclopedia and dictionary, the most-frequently
visited.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the NSC said, National Chengchi University (NCCU) was given funding
to launch German-  and French-language  academic information platforms in law,
literature, linguistics and philosophy.</P>
      <P>The NCCU platforms, which now includes 353 German- and 232 French- language
databanks, are also free to access and can be found at
http;//german2.nccu.edu.tw/ and http: //french2.nccu.edu.tw/, respectively.</P>
      <P>Liu Chi-hsuan, the curator of NCCU's library, said the databanks provide a good
channel for those learning the languages and cultures of the two countries as
they covers official data, media reports and information on daily life.</P>
      <P>He said that hits to the German- and French-language platforms have totaled more

    <TEXT>
      <P>The office of former President Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday accused the Special
Investigation Division (SID) under the Supreme Prosecutors Office of abusing
judicial power by raiding Chen's office and seizing documents.</P>
      <P>SID prosecutors seized 58 cartons of documents from Chen's office on Sept. 15 as
part of an investigation into allegations that he took more than 20 boxes of
classified files with him when he left the Presidential Office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors, along with staff from the Chen Shui-bian Office and officials
from the Presidential Office, opened some of the boxes Wednesday at the Taipei
Detention Center, where the former president is held. Chen witnessed the opening
process in person.</P>
      <P>Chen Song-shan, director of the former president's office, said that the
suspected embezzling of official documents would fall under a criminal code
beyond the jurisdiction of the SID, which is only mandated to conduct
investigations into possible corruption by government officials.</P>
      <P>"The SID has abused its judicial power as it has no legal right to seize, search
or open the documents, " Chen Song-shan said prior to entering the detention
center to monitor the opening.</P>
      <P>He cited the former president as saying the SID was politically motivated and
wanted to divert public attention away from a string of scandals surrounding the
Taipei Flora Expo. The Kuomintang-ruled Taipei City government has been accused
of procuring materials for the expo at highly inflated prices, which Taipei
Mayor Hau Lung-bin admits has dampened his popularity and clouded his bid for a
second term.</P>
      <P>Chen Song-shan quoted the former president as saying he is also interested in
finding out what documents are in the boxes, as he did not take part in the
packing of the cartons.</P>
      <P>As for embezzling, he added, the former president said he had no intention or
need to commit such crime.</P>
      <P>The opening process of the seized documents,  which began Wednesday, is expected
to take 10 working days, according to SID Director Chen Hung-tah.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office said Sept. 10 that it had instructed Chen's office to
return the documents and files after being notified of their existence by Chen's
office.</P>
      <P>The former president's aides, however, said that they were not in a position to
do so and that they would hold onto the documents until Chen was released from
detention.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office then filed a lawsuit with the SID alleging Chen' s
office had violated the Embezzlement of Public Property Act.</P>
      <P>The former president, who has been held since Dec. 30, 2008, has been sentenced
to 20 years in prison for embezzling state funds, laundering money, accepting
bribes and committing forgery.</P>

      <P>A Vietnamese woman expressed her gratitude to the Taiwanese public on Oct. 4 for
donations that allowed volunteer doctors to perform an operation in August to
help correct an eye disorder called strabismus.</P>
      <P>Victims of strabismus have difficulty aligning their eyes with each other.</P>
      <P>Born with the condition, Le Bao Ngoc, or "Ruby," said she grew up being bullied,
and that her dream was to have the eyes of a normal person.</P>
      <P>A 20-year-old university student majoring in tourism, Le told a press conference
in Taipei 101 how strabismus had taken away her confidence.</P>
      <P>"In Vietnam, people with strabismus and short stature are looked down on. They
said I have a double weaknesses, so I am the worst kind," she said.</P>
      <P>After the operation in August, Le said she leads a normal life and proudly shows
her new glasses to people who teased her before. She said anonymous Taiwanese
donors had changed her life.</P>
      <P>Le's surgery was part of a fundraising project held by ORBIS Taiwan and Standard
Charted Bank in 2009. In less than 10 days, a total of NT$1.3 million
(US$31,250) was raised nationwide for 1,200 children in less developed countries
with eye problems.</P>
      <P>Traveling as far as Tibet to perform volunteer operations on eye patients, said
Tsai Jui-fang, superintendent of the Taipei Eye Center, that Taiwan has the
capability to save more people like Le who have diseases that are easily
treatable and preventable.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that there are currently five Taiwanese opthamologists certified by
ORBIS who visit developing countries and offer free services to help young
people suffering from cataracts, strabismus and blindness.</P>
      <P>The programs give the doctors a chance to demonstrate Taiwan's successful
medical expertise  and train doctors in developing countries, Tsai said, adding
that people should never forget to lend a helping hand to those in need.</P>

      <P>The report of the first case of the NDM-1 "superbug" in Taiwan has inevitably
caused a panic in local society. Some scholars have even slammed the Centers for
Disease Control for its decision to allow the patient to leave the hospital and
go home.</P>
      <P>The NDM-1 gene's resistance to antibiotics is worthy of medical community's
concern and study. Ordinary people, however, need not panic over the case
because chances are low, if not nil, for the "superbug" to trigger an epidemic.</P>
      <P>All of the NDM-1 cases reported around the world so far were contracted through
surgical operations. To date, the World Health Organization has not listed the
NDM-1 as a major communicable disease.</P>
      <P>What local public should be concerned are rampant misuse or abuse of
antibiotics,  which are the culprit  of the emergence  of drug-resistant
bacteria or superbugs, such as the NDM-1. Careless practices in drug supply and
use have hastened drug resistance in Taiwan and many other countries around the
world. It is truly an issue that should not be ignored any longer. (Editorial

Shipments of new products will start to expand from October, the statement said.</P>

      <P>The fair will take place at three universities in Aceh, Jakarta and Yogyakarta
starting Oct. 9. The ministry will also host three lectures on life and studying
in Taiwan, said Chu To-ming, a secretary at the Bureau of International Cultural
and Educational Relations.</P>
      <P>A delegation of more than 80, led by the Ministry of Education, also includes
representatives  from six international  academic exchange agencies such as the
University Entrance Committee for Overseas Chinese Student.</P>
      <P>There are 615 Indonesian students in Taiwan studying for degrees, with more than
one-third studying engineering  and technology, according to Chu. Nearly 1,000
others are studying Chinese language.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's aging society has taken its toll on domestic schools, with many
colleges facing insufficient recruitment. Universities have become anxious to
attract international students, including Chinese students, to fill the gap
caused by the country's low birth rate.</P>

      <P>The life and music of Taiwan's legendary songstress Teresa Teng will be featured
at the Taipei International Flora Expo, giving the public a chance to pay
tribute to the late mega star while enjoying three hectares of floral displays
at the Yuanshan Park Area, organizers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Known for her soothing voice and mastery of an array of genres, Teng is one of
the most beloved cultural icons in the global Chinese community. The singer's
popularity expands far and wide to Japan, China, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia
even after her sudden passing in 1995.</P>
      <P>"After a long deliberation, we unanimously agreed that Teng would be the best
candidate to be honored at the Celebrity House because she fully embodies the
traditional beauty of Chinese cultures, " organizing committee director Chen
Hsiung-wen said.</P>
      <P>Divided into three halls, the over 100-ping Celebrity House complex -- fashioned
after traditional Japanese wooden architecture -- was designed to give visitors
a visually and aurally stunning experience, with floral decorations and the
flowing melodies of some of Teng's best-known songs.</P>
      <P>A ping is a unit of area equivalent to about 3.3 square meters.</P>
      <P>Teng's die-hard fans can also cruise down memory lane with over 40 pieces of
never-before-displayed personal artifacts, including handwritten notes, stage
costumes and even a pair of hot-pink roller skates presented in the halls.</P>
      <P>A 38-minute documentary on Teng's career will also be shown at the house, said
Frank Teng, the singer's older brother and chairman of the of Teresa Teng
Foundation.</P>
      <P>The chairman said that Teng had a green thumb and was an avid flower lover who
had a particular fondness for lilies and roses.</P>
      <P>"She would have been more than happy to take part in this important event that
means so much for the country she loved, " he said.</P>
      <P>Set to have its grand opening in 31 days on Nov 6, the Taipei City government is
aiming to attract at least 8 million spectators to the six-month expo, which
will be held in Taiwan for the first time.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that several positive signs show Taiwan's
economy has been continuously recovering and the investment environment has
improved since the signing of the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's gross domestic product rose 13.1 percent in the first half from a year
earlier as economic expansion keeps its momentum, creating 285,000 jobs, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate declined to 5.17 percent in August from 6.13 percent a
year earlier, Ma noted.</P>
      <P>Foreign investment has surged since signing the ECFA on June 29, Ma said during
a speech at the World Taiwanese Chambers of Commerce.</P>
      <P>The amount of investment so far is estimated at NT$300 billion (US$9.64
billion), Ma said, urging more businesses to invest Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Although China's market is critical, we're not putting all our eggs in one
basket. It's more important for us to aim at global deployment. Taiwan will
reach out and open its doors to the world, " he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Chien-Ming Wang to pitch in instructional league</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese pitcher Chien-Ming Wang of the Washington  Nationals  is scheduled to
pitch an inning in an instructional league game in Viera, Florida Thursday
Taiwan time in what could be one of the most important outings of his U.S. Major
League Baseball (MLB) career.</P>
      <P>Wang, who has been under rehabilitation for a shoulder injury that occurred
before signing with the Nationals for a one-year, US$2 million deal this April,
is slated to pitch one inning against the Detroit Tigers minor league team in
the Florida Instructional League, a league for minor leaguers to hone their
skills.</P>
      <P>The 30-year-old veteran was quoted by the Chinese-language Liberty Times
newspaper as saying that he will try to work mainly on sinkers -- his most
effective weapon -- in the inning. His fastball is now clocked at around 85
miles per hour.</P>
      <P>After a rehabilitation of almost 15 months, the right-hander will pitch under
the watchful eyes of Mike Rizzo and Jim Riggleman, general manager and manager
of the Nationals, which hasn't enjoyed Wang's service since he signed with the
team.</P>
      <P>Wang's performance Thursday appears to be important for his future with the
Nationals, which finished with 69 wins and 93 losses and ranked last in the
five-team National League East Division this season. If the team chooses not to
offer him a new major league contract, he will become a free agent.</P>
      <P>The Nationals had originally hoped Wang, who will be eligible for arbitration
this offseason, would make his 2010 debut in mid-June. However, Wang has
suffered a shoulder injury that, according to Rizzo,  occurred more often to
American football players than pitchers, citing New Orleans Saints quarterback
Drew Brees, who underwent the same surgery as Wang, as an example.</P>
      <P>Wang signed with the New York Yankees in 2001 and was first called up to the
mound of a major league game in April 2005.</P>
      <P>He was the third player from Taiwan to make it into the MLB after Dodgers
outfielder Chen Chin-feng and Rockies pitcher Tsao Chin-hui.</P>
      <P>Wang shot to fame in 2006 with his powerful sinkers, scoring 19 wins to tie with
Johan Santana of the Minnesota Twins and put him above all other Asian pitchers
in the MLB. He secured another 19 wins the following season.</P>
      <P>While with the Yankees, Wang suffered a torn right shoulder capsule that was
repaired in July 2009, but he has been slow to recover from the injury.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Interior minister underlines new mentality of spatial planning</HEADLINE>

(By Chris Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan government needs a new mentality to tackle the vital issue of spatial
planning in a challenging time of climate change and financial crisis, Interior
Minister Jiang Yi-huah said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan, like any other country in the world, is now at the juncture of having
to deal with extreme weather caused by climate change and the task of boosting
its economy after the financial crisis, " Jiang said in a speech at Shih Hsin
University.</P>
      <P>It is a massive challenge from which Taiwan cannot shy away, he told around 200
university students, especially after a series of recent disasters caused huge
damages to Taiwanese people, including Typhoon Morakot, the deadliest typhoon in
the country's history, widespread flooding caused by torrential rains in
southern Taiwan last month.</P>
      <P>The cases of controversial farmland expropriation in the central town of Dapu,
Miaoli and disputed land takeover in the Central Taiwan Science Park this year
have both brought nationwide discontent, the minister said.</P>
      <P>"That's why we have to embrace the future with a brand new mentality. It will be
difficult, but we have to get it done, " he stressed.</P>
      <P>After the disasters and incidents, Taiwan's government has taken a step back to
review its national spatial planning policy, which in the past was doomed by
administrative failure, systematic errors and negligence, according to Jiang.</P>
      <P>To avoid the same mistakes, the ministry has laid out priorities. Jiang said the
first priority would be to protect farmers and agriculture with measures such as
requiring agricultural agencies to give approval before farmland can be
developed for commercial use.</P>
      <P>One of the new mentalities also includes more civic participation in the policy-
making process, which would ensure all policies are well thought-out before
being implemented, he said.</P>
      <P>"National  spatial planning is important because it always involves people's
lives and property, " he said, but lamented that the National Spatial Planning
Act has not been screened by the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Government officials will have to make things happen even without the
appropriate legislation, he said.</P>
      <P>"If we think it's the right thing to do, we will do it and we should do it
within our administrative power."</P>
      <P>In the future, land development and land expropriation plans will all be
reviewed on the basis of fairness, justice and public interest, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government urged to stop leaks before raising water rates</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  6 (CNA)
10/06/10  22:35:50

    <TEXT>
      <P>The non-profit Consumers Foundation urged the Water Resources Agency (WRA) under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs Wednesday to stop wasting water by fixing
leaking pipes around Taiwan before raising water rates.</P>
      <P>The service water leakage during the transport process had reached 22 percent
per year in Taiwan, higher than the global average of 18 percent and much higher
than the 7 percent in Japan, the foundation said in a statement.</P>
      <P>Its survey found that in 2009, a total of 720 million cubic meters of water
leaked from water pipes around Taiwan (except Kaohsiung City) before being
transported to consumers.</P>
      <P>Using the effective water storage of 200 million cubic meters at the Shihmen
Reservoir in Taipei County, northern Taiwan,  for comparison, the foundation
said the service water lost last year could fill 3.6 Shihmen Reservoirs.</P>
      <P>And the leaked water was not just a problem of waste, but could also affect the
environment, the foundation said, citing a United Nations warning at the Fifth
World Water Forum in March 2009 that predicted nearly half of the world's
population would live in areas suffering from a lack of fresh water by 2030.</P>
      <P>"The problem of water leakage does not just concern consumers' rights and
benefits, but is also a serious environmental protection issue," the foundation
said in the statement.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that even when the government's project to replace 4,000
kilometers of old water pipes around the country between 2009 and 2012 is
complete, it will only decrease the leakage rate to 18.93 percent -- still
higher than the global average.</P>
      <P>The foundation asked the WRA to find more effective measures to reduce the waste
caused by leaking pipes.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Water Corp. President Chen Fu-tien confirmed that the leakage of water
reached 21.95 percent in 2008. The state-run company began a four-year project
that year to replace 4,160 kilometers of old pipes and reduce the leakage.</P>
      <P>The budget the company listed for the project, however, was cut by NT$900
million (US$29.14 million) this year to NT$9.9 billion, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Because of the budget cut, the length of old pipes to be replaced will be
reduced to 4,000 kilometers, lowering the leakage to 19.12 percent by 2011, he
said.</P>
      <P>Chen said it was up to the government to decide whether or not to raise water
rates, which he said were cheap compared with many other countries.</P>
      <P>Citing a report by CommonWealth Magazine, a Chinese-language monthly business
journal, the Consumers' Foundation said water rates in Taiwan were only higher
than in South Korea and China in the region. The annual expenditure on water
bills of a family in Taiwan accounted for 0.4 percent of its total household
expenditure, far lower than the international level of 4 percent, the foundation
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) was censured Wednesday by the
Control Yuan, Taiwan's top watchdog body, for turning a blind eye to safety
problems at gas stations around the country.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan approved the censure proposed by members Cheng Jen-hung, Hung
Chao-nan and Yang Mei-ling as a warning to the council for neglecting its duties
as a government agency responsible for overseeing workers' rights and welfare.</P>
      <P>The censure said that gas station attendants are chronically exposed to cancer-
causing agents from the gasoline, especially benzene, but the council has not
devised regulations on gas station safety, nor has it come up with a stipulation
requiring gas station operators to provide attendants with sufficient health
checks.</P>
      <P>It also said that the council has not authorized testing on the operational
environment at gas stations for the past 11 years.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that since gas station attendants sustain greater cancer risks from
their workplace than workers in other fields, they are entitled to receive
checkups at intervals shorter than the five years stipulated in CLA regulations.</P>
      <P>Existing laws are inadequate to protect gas station attendants, Cheng said,
urging state-owned petroleum company CPC Corp., Taiwan to make greater efforts
to protect the health of workers at the pump.</P>
      <P>CPC, the largest fuel processor and distributor in the country, operates 649 gas
stations nationwide, with 2,023 workers on its regular payrolls and 8,658 part-
time attendants, Cheng said. The number of other privately run gas stations
totals 2,073, with about 12,000 part-time attendants, many of them students.</P>
      <P>The Control Yuan members also suggested that the Ministry of Economic Affairs
come up with a regulation requiring gas stations to do more to prevent the
corrosion of underground oil tanks.</P>
      <P>They also said the Ministry of the Interior should study the feasibility of
introducing technology to build earthquake-resistant gas stations.</P>

      <P>Nobel laureate and pioneer AIDS researcher Francoise Barre-Sinoussi of France
shared her experiences studying AIDS and offered insight into the prevention of
the deadly disease at Academia Sinica in Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Barre-Sinoussi, co-discoverer of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as the
cause of AIDS, delivered a speech titled "What can we learn from the diverse
spectrum of HIV/SIV infections? " at Taiwan's top research institute.</P>
      <P>The virologist discussed two prominent models of interest with respect to HIV
resistance -- human HIV controllers and African Green Monkeys.</P>
      <P>She also talked about the prospects of AIDS vaccines and possible research
directions in the future.</P>
      <P>Barre-Sinoussi is currently director of the Regulations of Retroviral Infections
Unit at the Pasteur Institute in Paris where her team focuses on regulation of
HIV/SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) infection.</P>
      <P>Noting that the spread of the AIDS virus knows no borders, she said that if the
world fails to help AIDS-plagued, resource-scarce countries today, the virus
could spread quickly to other parts of the planet, and mutation of the virus
could trigger uncontrollable disasters.</P>
      <P>She said education and information sharing are good ways to keep AIDS at bay.
Education allows people to know AIDS better, influencing them to change their
behavior, she said.</P>
      <P>Barre-Sinoussi called for those infected with AIDS not to be too shy to seek
medical attention in time.</P>
      <P>In 2008, she won the Nobel prize in Medicine or Physiology, together with Luc
Montagnier, for their identification of HIV as the cause of AIDS.</P>
      <P>The pair paved the way for rapid cloning of the HIV-1 genome, leading to an
understanding of how the virus interacts with its host and development of
methods to diagnose infected patients and screen blood products.</P>
      <P>In addition to her scientific study, she has been deeply involved in promoting
the integration of research and action in countries with limited resources.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of the Sayling Wen Cultural and Educational Foundation as well

1950: Communist Chinese troops enter Tibet.

1958: Communist Chinese begin to launch a mass movement in Tientsin to make iron

President to help plan the policy framework for national unification and to

2000: Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan confirms that the Ministry of Justice's
Investigation Bureau will formally phase out its controversial "political
surveillance" work soon.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "It is only the man with the most perfect divine
moral nature who is able to combine in himself quickness of magnanimity,
generosity, benignity, and gentleness: qualities necessary for the exercise of
patience."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese pitcher Chien-Ming Wang of the Washington Nationals threw a shutout
inning in an instructional league game in Viera, Florida Thursday (Taiwan time)
in his first return to the mound after missing the entire 2010 season while
rehabbing from shoulder surgery.</P>
      <P>According to a report posted on the masnsports.com website, Wang had a good
outing in the game against the Detroit Tigers minor league team in the Florida
Instructional League.</P>
      <P>Wang faced four batters, walking one and retiring the other three, in the
inning. He also hit 85-87 miles per hour with his fastball, which sports experts
said was not bad, but not great.</P>
      <P>The right-handed pitcher has been rehabbing a shoulder injury that occurred
before signing with the Nationals for a one-year, US$2 million deal in April.</P>
      <P>The Florida instructional league appearance was seen as one of the most
important outings of the 30-year-old veteran's U.S. Major League Baseball (MLB)
career.</P>
      <P>The masnsports website report quoted Wang's agent, Alan Nero, as saying that
both the Nationals and Wang are open to a contract for 2011 before the Nationals
would have to decide whether to offer Wang arbitration, but are waiting to see
how he progresses through the fall.</P>
      <P>Wang signed with the New York Yankees in 2001 and was first called up to the
mound of a major league game in April 2005.</P>
      <P>He was the third player from Taiwan to make it into the MLB after Dodgers
outfielder Chen Chin-feng and Rockies pitcher Tsao Chin-hui.</P>
      <P>Wang shot to fame in 2006 with his powerful sinkers, scoring 19 wins to tie with
Johan Santana of the Minnesota Twins and put him above all other Asian pitchers
in the MLB. He secured another 19 wins the following season.</P>
      <P>While with the Yankees, Wang suffered a torn right shoulder capsule that was
repaired in July 2009, but he has been slow to recover from the injury.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected to reach 9.3
percent in 2010 and 4.4 percent in 2011,   according   to  a  forecast
released  by  the Washington-headquartered  International  Monetary Fund (IMF)
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Among other major economies in Asia, China is projected to post 10.5 percent
growth in 2010 and 9.6 percent in 2011; Hong Kong 6 percent in 2010 and 4.7
percent in 2011; and Japan 2.8 percent in 2010 and 1.5 percent in 2011, the
IMF's World Economic Outlook showed.</P>
      <P>The growth in South Korea is predicted to reach 6.1 percent in 2010 and 4.5
percent in 2011; Singapore 15 percent in 2010 and 4.5 percent in 2011; and India
9.7 percent in 2010 and 8.4 percent in 2011.</P>
      <P>The report stated that Asia is continuing to lead the global recovery.</P>
      <P>It added, however, that activity is projected to moderate from the second half
of 2010 and in 2011 in line with the winding down of stimulus policies and
tightening measures in economies facing demand pressures, as well as downdrafts
from policy adjustments in advanced economies.</P>
      <P>Overall, Asia is projected to grow by 7.9 percent in 2010 and 6.7 percent in
2011, the report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc. said Thursday it posted NT$28.13
billion (US$913 million) in sales for the third quarter of this year, down 6.13
percent from a quarter earlier.</P>
      <P>While the third quarter figure was higher than the company's estimate of NT$25.4
billion to NT$27.5 billion, analysts said the 6.13 percent decline was worse
than the market expectation of an up to 5 percent fall.</P>
      <P>In September, MediaTek recorded NT$9.86 billion in sales, down 1.82 percent from
August, also lower than a market estimate of no less than NT$10 billion, they
said.</P>
      <P>"MediaTek was faced with fierce price competition in China, where rivals were
trying hard to grab business by cutting prices, " Hua Nan Securities analyst
Henry Miao said.</P>
      <P>Cell phone chips are MediaTek's major source of revenue and about 75 percent of
its cell phone chip sales come from China, where makers of unbranded, or
"bandit" cell phones, are the company's biggest customers.</P>
      <P>Miao said MediaTek had previously planned to upgrade its cell phone chips to 3G
from the current 2.5G-2.75G to alleviate the impact from the price war.</P>
      <P>"But it seems that the upgrade is not going smoothly. To my knowledge, MediaTek
is making some adjustments in the upgrade and the benefits are not expected to
be seen until next year," Miao said.</P>
      <P>Miao said a successful technology upgrade is likely to maintain the company's
gross margin.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter,  MediaTek's  gross margin fell 1.7 percentage points from
the first quarter to 55 percent. The company has forecast that its gross margin
will fall to between 51.5 percent and 53.5 percent in the third quarter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Liberty Times: Absurd stance toward Tiaoyutais</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office issued a statement Oct. 5 saying that Taiwan had not
collaborated with China in the latest protest against Japan over the Tiaoyutai
issue. Throughout the statement, however, the Presidential Office tried to link
Taiwan to China, which runs seriously counter to the perception of the majority
of Taiwanese.</P>
      <P>The statement said the Tiaoyutai Islands were discovered and named by the
Chinese during the Ming Dynasty and that the island group was covered by China's
coastal defense during the Ming and Ching dynasties. The fact is that according
to international law, discovering a place is not equal to holding sovereignty
over it. Moreover, what does "discovery by the Chinese" have to do with Taiwan?</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office further said that the Tiaoyutais were merged into
Japanese territory following the Ching Dynasty's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War
of 1894. It argued that the islands should have been handed over to the Republic
of China in 1945 when Taiwan was returned to the ROC following "Japan's
surrender to the ROC" at the end of World War II. The fact is Japan was
surrendering to the Allied Powers, not the ROC. Although the Treaty of San
Francisco of 1951 renounced Japan's rights to Taiwan, it did not say that Taiwan
was to be returned to the ROC.</P>
      <P>Since the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou claimed the Tiaoyutais belong
to the ROC, the ROC government should expel any non-Taiwanese fishing boats that
enter the Tiaoyutai territorial waters. Why does the Presidential Office say
there is not an issue of Taiwan and China protesting against each other over the
Tiaoyutais, even when the latest diplomatic standoff between Japan and China was
caused by the intrusion of a Chinese fishing boat into the region?</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- CBC battles 'vulture' investors</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>The Central  Bank of the Republic  of China  (CBC)
10/07/10  13:53:33
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>has tightened monitoring of capital inflow to prevent international "vulture"
investors from speculating on the Taiwan dollar's exchange rates amid a looming
global currency war.</P>
      <P>Banking sources said daily inbound capital remittances jumped past US$600
million Wednesday, prompting the central bank to launch a special inspection
into the operations of a major foreign bank's local branch.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, the central bank has adopted a series of
measures to stabilize the Taiwan dollar's value, including prohibiting banks
from selling huge amounts of U.S. dollars late in the trading session.</P>
      <P>In recent days, the sources said, the central bank has usually allowed the local
currency to appreciate sizably in the morning session, but intervened late in
the session by buying U.S. dollars to prevent speculators from scoring windfalls
in same-day trading.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the currency issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Japan's announcement of new quantitative easing measures Tuesday invoked a
global currency war, drawing an influx of hot money into Asia and driving major
Asian currencies to new highs.</P>
      <P>With U.S. authorities deliberately allowing the greenback to plunge, the ongoing
currency war also spread to Europe Wednesday, with the euro gaining 0.6 percent
to approach the barrier of US$1.39.</P>
      <P>In the face of the current financial market turbulence, Premier Wu Den-yih said
during a meeting with local industry executives Wednesday that he is confident
the CBC will be able to cope well under the leadership of Governor Perng Fai-
nan, who has been rated as one of the world's most competent bankers. (Oct. 7,
2010).</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>The central bank and the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) have been
collaborated closely to crack down on currency speculation in recent days amid
the currency warfare.</P>
      <P>In addition to monitor the flow of inbound capital remittances, the CBC has also
advised local companies not to engage in reckless forward currency trading to
avoid unnecessary losses.</P>
      <P>The FSC has been inspecting commercial  banks' trading in derivatives to prevent
any irregularities, financial sources said. (Oct. 7, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>International Monetary Fund (IMF) Chairman Dominique Strauss-Kahn warned in an
interview against countries using currencies as "policy weapons."</P>
      <P>In comments to the Financial  Times published on Tuesday, Strauss-Kahn said:
"Translated into action, such an idea would represent a very serious risk to the
global recovery... Any such approach would have a negative and very damaging
longer-run impact."</P>
      <P>He made the comments to the paper on Monday ahead of annual IMF and World Bank
meetings in Washington this weekend.</P>
      <P>The comments also came a day before the Bank of Japan's cut to its key interest
rates and its outline of a fund to buy assets to boost liquidity, the
announcement of which briefly weakened the yen Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Nobel Prize-winning U.S. economist Joseph Stiglitz also warned
Tuesday that the U.S. Fed's and the European Central Bank's constant raises of
liquidity have begun destabilizing the global financial market, including
causing chaos in foreign exchange markets and enhancing the risk of asset
bubbles. (Oct. 7, 2010).</P>

    <DATELINE>10/07/10  15:54:28
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The death of six illegal foreign workers at a construction site on the No. 6
Freeway last week highlighted the problem of runaway foreign workers, which
number more than 35,000.</P>
      <P>In fact,  the unreasonable  labor brokerage fee system is responsible for the
situation, in which many legal foreign workers opt to abscond.</P>
      <P>According to the Taiwan International Workers' Association, foreign workers
intending to work in Taiwan are required to pay as much as NT$80,000
(US$2,603)-NT$250,000 in brokerage fees. With other miscellaneous fees included,
these payments represent at least 18 months-worth of wages.</P>
      <P>It is little wonder, therefore, that so many foreign workers run away near the
expiration date of their employment contracts so that they can continue to stay
in Taiwan and work illegally to at least try to cover their costs.</P>
      <P>If the Council of Labor Affairs is to deal with the problem, it should target
these unscrupulous brokers who are exploiting the foreign workers. (Editorial

      <P>Uni-President Hankyu Department Store opened its second Taiwan branch in
Taipei's bustling Xinyi shopping district Thursday morning, attracting thousands
of shoppers who waited in line hours ahead of the opening.</P>
      <P>Scores of workers were busy guiding the thronging crowds, most of whom were
there for the grand opening of the country's first UNIQLO shop, a Japanese
casual wear retailer.</P>
      <P>Bill Chou and Philip Wu, college students who arrived at around midnight for a
place at the head of the entrance line, said it was their first time to do such
a thing.</P>
      <P>"But it's worth it. The jeans we want to buy will save us NT$1,000 (US$32.50) ,
so it's like we save NT$100 per hour, " they said, adding that their budget for
the day was about NT$8,000.</P>
      <P>Customers streamed in and out of the seven-story building after the 10:00 a.m.
opening, but not everyone was in the mood to take part in the frenzy.</P>
      <P>"There are too many people. It's as if everything was free, " a passerby named
Alice Chen complained. "There must be some great discounts, but I definitely
don't want to be in the middle of it."</P>
      <P>The new department store is a joint venture between Taiwan's Uni-President
Group, which runs the local 7-Eleven store chain, and Japan's Hankyu Department
Store.</P>
      <P>A lot of effort was put into promoting the opening, especially to pink-collar
workers and teens. The store planned to hold a fashion show Thursday evening
with some of the country's best-known models, including Janel Tsai and Yuli Lin.</P>
      <P>"I want to make it the best in the commercial district, " said Wang Po-ming,
Uni-President Hankyu Taipei's general manager, pointing out that there are eight
other department stores or malls in the area.</P>
      <P>Wang told reporters the newly opened store, co-constructed with an MRT transfer
station, was expected to attract 150,000 customers and generate NT$100 million
in sales on its opening day.</P>
      <P>Uni-President Hankyu Department Store opened its first Taiwan store in the
southern port city of Kaohsiung in 2006.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a low-level travel alert for Sweden over
concerns of possible terrorist attacks, a ministry official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The gray alert -- the lowest on the ministry's four-color system -- came after
the Swedish Security Service changed its five-scale terrorist attack threat from
the second grade of "low threat" to the third level of "elevated threat, "
Thomas Chen, director-general of the Bureau of Consular Affairs under the
ministry, said in a press briefing.</P>
      <P>A gray level alert advises tourists to "travel with caution."</P>
      <P>Threat of a terrorist attack in Sweden is still lower than that in some European
countries, and an "elevated threat" doesn't mean a terrorist attack is imminent,
Chen said, adding that "however, Sweden has never been considered the target of
a terrorist attack before."</P>
      <P>In related news, the ministry said the travel alert for Thailand remained at the
second-lowest yellow level, which advises tourists to travel with caution and
reconsider their itinerary.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, four Thai provinces -- Bangkok, Nonthaburi, Samut
Prakan and Prathum Thani -- were still in a state of emergency and the
possibility of an extremist attack in the Southeast Asian country remains high.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed little changed Thursday on profit-taking after the
market briefly hit the nearest technical resistance level of around 8,300
points, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index closed down 0.11 points at 8,283.92, after moving between
8,270.31 and 8,310.80, on turnover of NT$129.17 billion (US$4.19 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.25 percent on follow-through buying, but investors became
increasingly cautious,  in particular in late trading, to pocket profits ahead
of a U.S. jobless report due Friday, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,087 stocks closed down and 1,746 were up, with 349 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector suffered the heaviest selling, down 2.03 percent.
Construction shares fell 1.21 percent, machinery and electronics stocks lost
0.08 percent and textile shares closed down 0.02 percent.</P>
      <P>The cement sector rose 1.76 percent, foodstuffs gained 1.1 percent, the
financial sector added 0.57 percent and plastics and chemicals closed up 0.11
percent.</P>
      <P>"Without turnover expanding to NT$14 billion or even NT$15 billion, the market
is unlikely to overcome the technical hurdles ahead of 8,300 points," Concord
Securities analyst Allen Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said the pullback from the early gains in the late trading was evidence of
the cautious mood.</P>
      <P>"Range trade is expected to keep dominating market movements on a lack of fresh
incentives, " Lin said. "Even if rotational buying will boost the index, profit-
taking will emerge to compromise the gains," he added.</P>
      <P>Among the construction stocks that had been lifted by a rising New Taiwan dollar
but saw their recent gains eroded during the session, Prince Housing shed 3.48
percent to NT$24.95 and Kuo Yang Construction fell 3.13 percent to NT$23.20.</P>
      <P>The financial sector benefited from bargain-hunting, with Taiwan Business Bank
up 4.90 percent at NT$10.70 and Mega Financial up 2.62 percent at NT$19.60.</P>

      <P>Intel Corp., the world's largest chip maker, declined on Thursday to comment on
reports that its chief executive officer will visit Taiwan later this month.</P>
      <P>Intel's Taiwan branch told the Central News Agency that it has not confirmed a
date or details regarding a visit from Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is an important market and our executives visit regularly to meet
customers and government, " Rachel Liu, a spokeswoman for Intel Taiwan, said in
an e-mail message.</P>
      <P>"But we have nothing specific to say in response to this rumor, " she said.</P>
      <P>Local media have attached great importance to whether Otellini will visit Taiwan
after Intel dismissed its WiMAX Program Office (WPO) in late June.</P>
      <P>The move was interpreted as Intel withdrawing support for the development of
WiMAX broadband wireless technology in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Intel, however, has repeatedly said that the closure of the office was "simply a
small internal restructuring plan" and does not signal any change in its
commitment to WiMAX.</P>
      <P>Liu's remarks came one day after Taiwan's Chinese-language Economic Daily News
reported that Otellini would visit Taiwan at the end of this month and meet
local leaders in the information and communications technology industry.</P>
      <P>Later Wednesday, an official at Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs told CNA

    <TEXT>
      <P>An anti-death penalty group announced an annual film festival Thursday and
called for the abolition of capital punishment, three days before the Oct. 10
World Day Against the Death Penalty.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Alliance to End the Death Penalty (TAEDP) Executive Director Lin Hsin-yi
announced that the 2010 Murder by Numbers Film Festival will screen nine death
penalty-related films from Germany, Japan, Iran, Hong Kong, France, India,
Taiwan and the United States in Taipei, Hsinchu and on university campuses
around the country from Oct. 8-24.</P>
      <P>"We would like to call for an immediate moratorium on executions and
implementation of reasonable punishment and victim protection, as well as call
attention to the importance of judicial justice and scientific analysis, " she
said.</P>
      <P>The film festival will serve as a platform for dialogue between those who
support and those who oppose the death penalty, Lin said, adding that the
dialogue mechanism is especially needed after heated debate about the issue
earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's execution of four prisoners April 30, which ended a five-year
moratorium on the death penalty, drew criticism from various countries and
international  organizations  and ignited nationwide discussion on the Internet
and in the media, she said.</P>
      <P>The festival is also intended to focus on the issue of state violence  by
reviewing  the triangular  relations  between the government, its people and the
death penalty, Yen Chueh-an, a professor at National Taiwan University, said in
a press conference organized by the TAEDP and other civic groups.</P>
      <P>Kao Yung-cheng, head of the Judicial Reform Foundation, said he was happy to see
that discussion of the issue has become more intense.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, "executions have been halted for now, but I'm not sure what
will happen after the European Union approves visa-free privileges in the
Schengen Area for Taiwanese travelers," he said.</P>
      <P>The EU expressed disappointment with Taiwan after the April 30 executions. It
has said that the visa-free treatment and the death penalty are separate issues,
but there have been assumptions in Taiwan that the prolonged review process of
the privileges is related to the executions.</P>
      <P>World Day Against the Death Penalty was launched in 2003 by the World Coalition
Against the Death Penalty. The program this year focuses on the United States,
one of the few developed countries that has refused to abolish capital
punishment.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said Thursday it will hold a seminar
Oct. 18 on British developments in offshore wind turbine technology and wave and
tidal marine energy.</P>
      <P>British experts in wind and marine energy fields will speak at the seminar to

      <P>With a wealth of wind power resources and coastlines for offshore wind power,
Taiwan has potential to develop a strong wind energy sector, the ministry's
Bureau of Energy said.</P>
      <P>As of the end of September, Taiwan had an accumulated wind power generation
capacity of 490,300 kilowatts, which can turn out an estimated 1.226 billion KWh
annually to meet the demand of 306,000 households, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Statistics indicate that wind power generation has helped cut 763,600 tons of

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih promised Thursday that the government will continue granting
low interest loans to Taiwan's small and medium-sized businesses as part of
efforts to improve the investment climate.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the closing ceremony of the International Small Business Congress,

NT$150 billion (US$4.77 billion) to Taiwan's small enterprises. The figure
exceeded NT$200 billion by the end of August, he added.</P>
      <P>The loans were part of a Financial Supervisory Commission policy put in place at
the beginning of this year that required local banks to increase lending to
small businesses.</P>
      <P>Wu described small and medium-sized businesses as the growth engine of the
economy, adding that they account for 98 percent of the country's enterprises
and help create 77 percent of the jobs.</P>
      <P>"It is one of the government's unavoidable responsibilities to provide low

      <P>Taiwan will continue to work toward the goal of reclaiming the top position
among Asia's "four little dragons, " a goal which according to the latest
forecast by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) could be attained in 2012, an
economic official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>According to Council for Economic Planning and Development's Chairwoman
Christina Liu, the economic benefits to be brought about by the tariff-slashing
trade agreement Taiwan signed with China in June and the foreign investment
attracted to Taiwan by the trade pact will together give Taiwan's economy a
strong boost.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan needs to keep working hard to turn the forecast into reality,
Liu said.</P>
      <P>According to the IMF's World Economic Outlook released on Wednesday, Taiwan's
real gross domestic product growth is expected to reach 9.3 percent in 2010,
which is the highest forecast by an international organization so far.</P>
      <P>The projected growth is also the second fastest growth rate forecasted among the
"four little dragons, " behind only Singapore's 15 percent.</P>
      <P>Also known as the "Four Asian Tigers," the "four little dragons" are Taiwan,
Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea - economies that saw exceptionally high
growth rates and rapid industrialization from the '60s to '90s.</P>
      <P>For 2011, the IMF forecast that Taiwan's economy will grow by 4.4 percent,
trailing Hong Kong's 4.69 percent, Singapore's 4.55 percent and South Korea's
4.48 percent.</P>
      <P>During the four-year period between 2012 and 2015, Taiwan's economic growth is
projected at 4.69 percent, 4.9 percent, 4.95 percent and 5 percent,
respectively, all of which are highest among the "four little dragons."</P>

      <P>The vice chairman of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , Chiang Pin-kung, made a
speech at a luncheon he hosted on the sidelines of the British Conservative
Party's annual Oct. 3-6 conference in the city of Birmingham.</P>
      <P>Chiang,  who doubles as chairman  of the Straits Exchange Foundation, Taiwan's
quasi-official intermediary body for exchanges with China, networked with
heavyweights of the Conservative Party, which formed a ruling coalition with the
Liberal Democratic Party in May this year, as well as with political leaders
from other countries, during the conference.</P>
      <P>He met with Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, chairman of the Conservative Party's
International  Office,  and explained Taiwan's existing economic and political
situation, including cross-Taiwan Strait relations, which have warmed up since
President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008.</P>
      <P>Clifton-Brown lauded the pragmatic approach that Taiwan has adopted toward China
over the past two years and expressed his support for closer business and trade
ties between Britain and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During his luncheon, attended by 16 British members of parliament and European
politicians, including Cheryl Gillan, secretary of state for  Wales,  and
Charles  Bannock,  chairman  of the European Parliament-Taiwan Friendship Group,
as well as Katharine S.Y. Chang, Taiwan's representative to the United Kingdom
and KMT Legislator Lin Yu-fang, Chiang talked about Ma's "modus vivendi"
diplomacy over the past two years that has expanded Taiwan's diplomatic
horizons, as well as the improved cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He told his audience that the closer cross-strait economic ties, particularly
since Taiwan and China concluded an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) in June this year, have helped defuse tension across the strait.</P>
      <P>Gillan, who has visited Taiwan, gave a thumbs-up to the KMT's efforts to mend
relations with China and wished the KMT a landslide victory in the municipality
elections slated for Nov. 27.</P>
      <P>Chiang also met briefly at a cocktail party with Secretary of State for Justice
Kenneth Clarke, who praised Taiwan's democratic and economic development and the
government's efforts to improve ties with China.</P>
      <P>It was the second time Chiang had attended the Tory party conference on behalf

      <P>Taiwan's largest shipping company Evergreen Group said Thursday it has been
informed that the group's chairman Chang Yung-fa will be named "Newsmaker of the
Year" by Lloyd's List.</P>
      <P>Lloyd's List is a London-based international marine publication which provides
information and analysis on the global shipping industry. It has scheduled an
awards ceremony in Singapore for Thursday night to announce Chang being named.
The honor to be bestowed on Chang will be one of the 17 Lloyd's List Asia Awards
for 2010.</P>
      <P>Evergreen said the award showed Chang was recognized for having made the
greatest impact on the development of the global shipping industry and of world
trade over the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>A recent exclusive interview with Chang by CNBC's "Managing Asia" made Chang one
of the most impressive newsmakers in the shipping industry, the company said.</P>
      <P>In the CNBC interview, Chang elaborated on his efforts in establishing Evergreen
Marine and then expanding to the airline and hotel businesses, the group said.
Chang's efforts have won positive response from the global business sector, it
added.</P>
      <P>In the previous years when the shipping industry was booming, Chang defied the
trend followed by other shippers which ordered many large container ships. He
believed such expansion would raise operating costs and impact the bottom line,
according to the group.</P>
      <P>When the world's economy was hard hit by the global financial meltdown in 2008,
the world's shipping industry encountered falling cargo volume and declining
shipping rates, and suffered financial difficulties due to the idle capacity
from the aggressive expansion.</P>
      <P>However, due to Chang's decision not to expand, Evergreen, which issued no
orders to build new ships and was sitting on low debt, encountered less
financial pressure, the group said.</P>
      <P>The group added that Chang's foresight has been well recognized by the industry
and media.</P>
      <P>In 2006, Chang was the first Asian to be awarded the "Lifetime Achievement Award
by Lloyd's List."</P>
      <P>The Evergreen  Group is a Taiwan-based  conglomerate  that encompasses
shipping,  transportation,  and associated  service companies. The group was
formed in 1975 from the diversification of the original Evergreen Marine Corp.,
which was founded in 1968 and is one of the world's largest containerized-
freight shipping companies.</P>
      <P>Besides the Evergreen Marine Corp., other companies in the Group include:
Evergreen International Corp.,  EVA Airways, Evergreen Aviation Technologies
Corp., Evergreen Air Services Corp., Evergreen Air Cargo Services Corp., and
Evergreen International Storage and Services Corp. Other subsidiaries include
Uniglory Shipping Corp. and Uni Airways.</P>

      <P>Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport will launch a food festival on Friday as
part of efforts to improve the airport's reputation for poor food service, an
airport spokesman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The two-week event features what organizers called "a showdown" of delicacies,
inviting gourmets and celebrities to rate the food served at the airport,
including beef noodles, coffee and Taiwan's traditional "luroufan" (rice with
stewed pork).</P>
      <P>During the first two days of the event, travelers can try free samples from
participating vendors in Terminal 1.</P>
      <P>The fair is the latest effort to boost the airport's image as travelers
frequently complain about the airport's food service, spokesman Chao Shao-lien
said.</P>
      <P>In a poll conducted in August, foreign travelers gave the airport low ratings
for facilities, food prices and staff conduct.</P>
      <P>"But if you fall off your horse, get right back on it," Chao said of the
airport's renewed efforts.</P>
      <P>A new evaluation system that determines whether food providers can extend their
contracts with the airport will be put in place soon, he said.</P>
      <P>Those who score lower than 70 points will not have their contracts renewed the
following year and will be barred from entering the bidding for three years, the
spokesman said. (By Hsin-Yin Lee)</P>

      <P>Taiwan is likely to see a further boost in its exhibition and conference
industry thanks to the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with
China and the rapid economic recovery in Asia, trade officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chao Yuen-chuan, president and CEO of the semi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) , said at the Asian Meeting, Incentive, Conference
and Exhibition (MICE) forum, which opened in Taipei that day that Taiwan has
reported progress in a recent global survey on the number of international
exhibitions organized last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan advanced from 35th place in 2008 to 32nd place in 2009 in a global survey
released by the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA) in the
middle of this year, as it organized 79 international conferences in 2008 and 91
last year, Chao said.</P>
      <P>On city rankings in the Asia-Pacific region, Taipei City moved up to seventh
place in 2009 from ninth place a year earlier after holding 52 international
conferences in 2008 and 64 in 2009, Chao noted.</P>
      <P>"The global financial crisis hit the exhibition industry hard in the past two
years, but the situation in Asia is recovering faster than those in Europe and
the United States, " Chao said at the forum.</P>
      <P>He made the statement based on new International Monetary Fund (IMF) report
saying that Asia's economic forecasts this year and next year outshine those of
the euro zone and the United States.</P>
      <P>Asia is projected to grow by 7.9 percent in 2010 and 6.7 percent in 2011, the
report said. In contrast, the euro zone is likely to grow 1.7 percent this year
and 1.5 percent next year, while the U.S. is forecast to grow 2.6 percent this
year and 2.3 percent next year, according to the report.</P>
      <P>"As a result, the global exhibition industry is expected to shift its focus to
Asia," he said.</P>
      <P>Grace Chiang, an official of the Bureau of Foreign Trade under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, said at the forum that both the ECFA and direct cross-Taiwan
Strait flights between the two sides are likely to further boost Taiwan's
exhibition and conference industry.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is likely to experience typical winter temperatures this year and will
not be directly affected by a cooling climate system in Europe, the Central
Weather Bureau (CWB) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>While Polish climatologists have predicted that Europe will face "its coldest
winter in 1,000 years, " sparking wide debate over the past few days, the bureau
said the chances of Taiwan being affected are slim.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, temperatures in December are likely to fall between 17
degrees Celsius and 18.3 degrees Celsius, a range that is considered normal.</P>
      <P>A colder Europe will affect Taiwan directly only if the weather system moves
east, said Cheng Ming-dean, director of the CWB's forecast center.</P>
      <P>He explained that although Asia lies downstream from Europe in the global
climate system, which means it can be impacted by weather there, the effects
remain unclear, as factors such as distance and latitude all add to the
uncertainty.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng also said that the Polish forecasts are worth noting, as extreme
weather in Europe can induce global climate fluctuations in the long run, which
could cause an energy crisis and food shortages.</P>
      <P>From that point of view, he said, Taiwan needs to keep an eye on whether Europe
does take a hit of severe cold this winter, as it could lead to sudden rises in
local oil prices.</P>

      <P>She sustained serious head injuries,  as well as multiple fractures, when she
was flung more than 10 meters after being struck by the taxi in Taitung City.
Her colleague suffered only minor injuries.</P>

noted. "Her recovery is going relatively well."</P>
      <P>Lu and her family, from the indigenous Paiwan tribe, have been placed under a
heavy burden by the cost of her treatment and with support from the teachers and

concert has been scheduled for Oct. 11 at the hospital to raise funds for the

      <P>A warm up for the Taipei International Flora Expo will take place this weekend,
with participants to be taken on a floral tour in Taipei where they will see
dozens of sites, each with a different flower theme, city officials said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The tour will be held in concurrence with the Expo's trial run opening. The
Expo, scheduled to open in November, will be one of the biggest international
events Taipei has ever hosted.</P>
      <P>According to Taipei's Department of Cultural Affairs, the Taipei Floral Tour
will be launched in 22 cultural or historic attractions all over the city,
including the Lin Yutang House, the Guling Street Avant-garde Theatre, and the
Taipei Cinema Park.</P>
      <P>Twenty two different kinds of flowers have been chosen for every tour site,
according to their symbolic meaning, said a press release issued by the
department.</P>
      <P>For example, the Taipei Cinema Park, which has a coffee garden, will feature
"coffee flowers." camelias will be the theme flower for the Grass Mountain
Artist Village because former first lady Madame Chiang Kai-shek was said to have
often rested under a camellia tree near achateau in the village when she and her
husband stayed there.</P>
      <P>People are encouraged to join the tour and collect all the 22 flower stamps at
every site in exchange for eight different amulets, the department said.</P>
      <P>Other plant-themed activities are also scheduled at the various stops on the
tour.</P>
      <P>The Flora Expo, which is set to run from November 6 to April 25, marks the first
time such an exposition will be held in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>A clinical research organization (CRO) that placed advertisements on online job
placement company websites to solicit volunteers for human trials of new drugs
might face serious fines for classifying the trials as "work opportunities, " a
Department of Health (DOH) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The CRO, also described as a contract research organization, could face fines of
up to NT$500,000 (US$15,873) for advertising human trials as "work
opportunities" and defining volunteers as "part-time student workers" in the
ads, said Lu Nien-tsi, a section chief of the Bureau of Medical Affairs under
the DOH.</P>
      <P>The ads were called to attention by opposition Democratic Progressive Party
Legislator Huang Sue-ying in a press conference at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Huang said that people who would volunteer to undergo clinical trials for new
drugs do so based on altruism, more like blood donors, and that such trials
should not be falsely described as "work opportunities."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the ads, Lu said the CRO was additionally wrong in the first place
by running the ads without first applying for DOH approval.</P>

      <P>HTC Corp. will focus more on Asia following successes in Europe and the United
States, the company said Thursday at its largest product launch in Asia. HTC is
the largest manufacturer of smartphones using Google's Android operating system.</P>
      <P>"This year, our business sales in Asia have grown more than 200 percent," HTC
chief executive officer Peter Chou said in Taipei. He would not give any sales
figures.</P>
      <P>"Our team has set a goal of making 2011 the year of Asia for HTC," he told
senior telecom executives from Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Australia, South
Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>The event featured the HTC's new Desire HD and Desire Z, which will be available
in Asia in November.</P>
      <P>HTC first unveiled these two new smartphones running on Android 2.2, the latest
version of the operating system developed by Google, in the United Kingdom in
September.</P>
      <P>During a press meet later at the event, Chou said that the acceptance of HTC
smartphones in Asia is increasingly higher and he saw a great potential in the
Asian markets.</P>
      <P>Asked if HTC will create an online application store, Chou said that its
partners Google and Microsoft have launched similar services.</P>
      <P>"There is no added value for HTC if we follow suit," he said.</P>
      <P>HTC is now the world's fourth largest smartphone brand with more than 9 percent
of the global market share.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chou said that HTC has expanded users' experience from smartphones
to other devices by entering the field of cloud computing.</P>
      <P>HTC launched "HTCSense.com," an Internet platform using the cloud computing
technology, to allow users to "manage,  control and customize their own
smartphones through the Internet," according to a company statement.</P>
      <P>The service also allows users to synchronize their content on their smartphones

      <P>Canada is trying to facilitate stronger business exchanges with Taiwan through a
"block-building" process and to take advantage of the favorable environment
following the signing of a cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact, Canada's
representative in Taiwan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Canada has "re-positioned Taiwan as an ideal partner in light of the economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) , " said Scott Fraser, Executive Director
of the Canadian Trade Office in Taipei (CTOT), the North American country's
representative office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With direct flights and liberalized trade across the Taiwan Strait, "a lot of
people are taking a second look at Taiwan's regional relevancy... (the ECFA)
certainly makes Taiwan a much more attractive investment location for Canadian
companies and a good base for doing business with China, " Fraser said at a
media briefing.</P>
      <P>Responding to a reporter's question about the possibility of a free trade
agreement (FTA) between Canada and Taiwan, Fraser said neither side has ever
raised the issue. He added, though, that Canada is pursuing FTAs with several
other countries, including the European Union, South Korea and Singapore.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the issue of visa-free privileges for Taiwanese entering Canada, he
said that "consultations in Canada are still continuing and we hope a final
decision will be made fairly soon." He also noted that the issue is not linked
to Taiwan's ban on imports of Canadian beef.</P>
      <P>In terms of the beef ban, Fraser said that since the Canadian authorities  have
provided data and scientific  evidence  that guarantees the safety of the beef,
his office does not understand the ban.</P>
      <P>He said Canada hopes to foster closer collaboration with Taiwan, particularly on
energy, which could help reduce Taiwan's dependence on foreign energy imports.</P>
      <P>Fraser added that Canada also hopes to see positive results on negotiations for
avoidance of double taxation and for customs cooperation.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan High Court ruled Thursday to extend former President Chen Shui-bian's
detention for two more months to Dec. 18 for his failure to honor a promise to
return all the money that he and his family have stashed in foreign counties</P>
      <P>Chen and his wife, Wu Shu-chen, were both sentenced to 20 years by the High
Court June 11 on charges of embezzling state funds, taking bribes, forgery and
money laundering. The former president has been in detention since Dec. 30,
2008.</P>
      <P>Chen and Wu have appealed to the Supreme Court, which asked the High Court to
hold a hearing Oct. 1 on whether to extend Chen's detention, due to end Oct. 18.</P>
      <P>Chen told the hearing that the presiding judge of the panel dealing with his
case had previously told him he would stand a good chance of being released on
bail if all the money hidden by his family abroad was remitted to bank accounts
designated by the prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The former president argued that he should be released, as he has returned all
the money.</P>
      <P>The High Court said in the ruling that Chen's family has remitted US$18.41
million back to Taiwan, over US$3 million short of the total of US$22.42 million
that is believed to have been salted away overseas during Chen's eight-year
term.</P>
      <P>"The former president is to be detained for two more months, as he has been
unable to prove that all the money stored in foreign countries has been wired
back to Taiwan, and because there is still a possibility that he might flee the
country if released, " the court said.</P>

      <P>A New York-based Taiwanese fashion designer who rose to global fame in early
2009 after U.S. first lady Michelle Obama wore one of his designs to her
husband's inauguration ball presented one of his latest creations Thursday to
Taiwan's first lady Chow Mei-ching.</P>
      <P>Jason Wu, who returned to Taipei a day earlier for a week-long visit,  asked
President Ma Ying-jeou during a meeting at the Presidential Office to pass on
his gift to Chow on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the local media later, Wu said his design for Chow is in a classic,
graceful style.</P>
      <P>"It is one of my newest creations and I hope it will still be fashionable 20 or
30 years from now," Wu said.</P>
      <P>In his meeting with Ma earlier in the day, the 28-year-old fashion designer said
he hopes to help bring the local fashion industry into the international
limelight.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan has had great influence on him and that he looks forward to
giving something back to his homeland.</P>
      <P>As a Taiwanese, Wu said, he would be very happy if his return could help draw
the world's attention to Taiwan's fashion industry.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question from Ma about how he became interested in fashion
design, Wu said he was "born loving design."</P>
      <P>"I don't know how to explain my love for design. It is in my blood, " Wu said.
"I began designing costumes and accessories for dolls when I was 5 years old."</P>
      <P>Wu said he was grateful for his mother's support, saying that she used to buy
him foreign fashion magazines when he was a child, a move that not only helped
enrich his knowledge about fashion but also allowed him to become good at
English.</P>
      <P>The one-shoulder gown he designed for Obama has already become a museum piece.
It was donated in March this year to the National Museum of American History,
where it joined the museum's collection of 24 other gowns worn by previous U.S.
first ladies, including 12 worn on inauguration days.</P>
      <P>Wu urged up-and-coming Taiwanese designers to travel extensively and learn from
the work of other fashion designers and designers in other fields, which he said
will help inspire their own creativity.</P>
      <P>On a question from Ma about his design concepts, Wu said he draws from Oriental
cultures and colors and that he prefers simple yet elegant styles.</P>
      <P>Despite having lived away from Taiwan for most of his life, Wu said he still
misses  Taiwanese  food very much,  especially quintessential Taiwanese snacks,
and that he will visit Taipei's Shilin night market during his stay. He will
also attend his brother's wedding.</P>
      <P>Wu left Taiwan when he was nine and moved to Vancouver, Canada, where he learned
to sew by designing and making doll's clothes. He went on to study sculpture in
Tokyo and later enrolled at Parsons the New School for Design in New York City.</P>
      <P>At the age of 16, Wu began to make freelance doll's clothing designs and later
traveled around the world studying fashion design. Four years ago, he launched
his own fashion store in New York with earnings from sales of his doll's clothes
and accessories.</P>
      <P>He launched his first full collection in 2006 and won Fashion Group
International's Rising Star award in 2008.</P>
      <P>In June this year, Wu won the Swarovski Womenswear Designer of the Year award
presented by the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which is the top honor
in the U.S. fashion industry.</P>

      <P>A group of female workers from the Philippines filed a class action complaint
Thursday against the company for which they work in Sanchung City, Taipei
County, accusing it of violating their privacy by monitoring them with
surveillance cameras round the clock.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Cheng Li-wun and Taiwan
International  Workers' Association (TIWA)  advisor Chen Su-hsiang, the 10
workers alleged at a news conference that they are monitored by the company 24
hours per day, for "management and security reasons."</P>
      <P>AVTech Corp. claims to be the biggest manufacturer of digital surveillance video
recorders and employs more than 40 Filipinas.</P>
      <P>One of the protesters at the news conference said she felt extremely humiliated
by being so closely watched by the management in their dormitories, which have
cameras even trained on the doors to bathrooms and toilets.</P>
      <P>"Some managers have even printed out segments of the images and criticized our
moves or bodies," she said.</P>
      <P>Tsai Meng-liang, a section chief of the Council of Labor Affairs, stressed that
company management must not breach the personal privacy rights of the workers.</P>
      <P>If AVTech is found guilty of doing so, it will have violated the Gender Equality
Labor Law and Employment Services Act and will be fined in accordance with the
law, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>The Taipei county government labor affairs bureau has told the company to remove
the cameras and will continue to investigate the case, he added.</P>
      <P>The 10 women have been taken to a safe haven by the TIWA, according to Tsai, who
said they will be shifted to other companies if the allegations against AVTech
are proven.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the company claimed innocence over the allegations, arguing that an
outsourcing company is in charge of the management and that the eight monitoring
cameras were not aimed at toilets or bathrooms.</P>

      <P>Buying a home in Taiwan's capital has become harder for ordinary wage earners,
as property prices have continued to rise in the first half of this year, but
their incomes have not, according to findings of a government survey revealed
Thursday.</P>
      <P>In Taipei City, where soaring property prices have recently prompted the
government to launch tightening measures, the property purchase price is 10.87
times the average buyers annual income, according  to the survey released by the
Interior Ministrys Construction and Planning Agency.</P>
      <P>This means Taipei residents would have to save all their salary for nearly 11
years to be able to afford a home.</P>
      <P>The ratio between the home purchase price and the average annual income has been
rising from 8.89 in the first half of last year, to 9.06 in the second half of
last year, and then to the current ratio, Chang Chin-oh, who is in charge of the
survey, told a news conference.</P>
      <P>This is a big problem for residents in Taipeias housing prices are continuing to
go up, but incomes are not going up,he said.</P>
      <P>The semi-annual survey, which was conducted in July, found that 50.19 percent of
the respondents in Taipei City considered the government's measures to rein in
the housing market to beapparently ineffective.</P>
      <P>Since June, Taiwan's central bank has launched a series of tightening moves on
bank lending to curb the upward spiral of housing prices. Soaring prices have
ignited complaints and fears that many local residents would not be able to buy
a home.</P>
      <P>More than 77 percent of Taipei's residents think that property prices are
eithervery unreasonableorunreasonable, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that a healthy property market is conducive to economic growth.</P>
      <P>A healthy housing market will help spur economic growth. After all, the economy

reiterated Thursday.</P>
      <P>"It is even more dangerous to keep such patients in hospitals, as the bacteria
are most easily transmitted through medical procedures, "Yaung said in a report
delivered at the Legislative Yuan's Social Benefits and Health and Environment
Committees on preventive measures for the superbug NDM-1 (New Delhi metallo
beta-lactamase).</P>
      <P>Chang Feng-yee, director-general of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control (CDC),
also contended that preventing superbug patients from leaving hospitals lacks a
legal basis in Taiwan and poses a violation of their basic human rights.</P>
      <P>In line with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on dealing with people
found to be carriers of NDM-1, hospitals need not isolate such people as long as
they show no symptoms, Chang explained.</P>
      <P>Various countries around the world, including Australia, Belgium, Canada, Japan,
the United Kingdom and the United States, have reported a total of more than 200
NDM-1 cases, all from the Indian subcontinent, he noted. Judging from this, it
is possible that a recently identified Taiwanese carrier picked up the bacteria
through a hospital procedure in India rather than in Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>The CDC will talk on the telephone with officials of the Indian hospital in an
effort to trace the origin of the man's infection, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Former CDC Director-General Su Ih-jen, who is now vice president of National
Cheng Kung University Hospital, said it is extremely important to keep the
superbug NDM-1 from entering Taiwan, and infected patients who are discharged
from hospitals must conduct periodic self-health examinations at home.</P>
      <P>Following  Yaung's decision,  a Taiwanese cable TV station cameraman was
discharged by a local hospital after having been infected at an Indian hospital
where he had been received treatment for gunshot wounds sustained in a terrorist
attack in New Delhi.</P>
      <P>Yaung said he will hold himself responsible if the issue is mishandled and
causes widespread infections.</P>
      <P>DOH Deputy Minister Chang Shan-chwen said earlier that same day that the Indian
hospital is the most likely source of the infection, as no one else in his TV
crew were infected and he was the only one to have undergone surgery at the
hospital.</P>

      <P>A lawmaker of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said Thursday that there are no laws
to regulate online trading in many wild animals, as some species sold on the
Internet are not included on the list of protected species.</P>
      <P>Legislator Ting Shou-chung said the current Wildlife Conservation Law only
prohibits the sale of endangered animals, but some animals sold online are not
considered endangered, which he said could result in a potential threat to the
environment should such animals later be abandoned.</P>
      <P>Ting said the government should provide an effective mechanism for animal
trading, better quarantine conditions for all species and should pass laws on
animal protection and online marketing.</P>
      <P>Michelle  Chou,  a spokeswoman  for the Life  Conservation Association, told CNA
that the association has found 66 websites in Taiwan selling a total of 263
species of animals, of which only 71 are protected by law.</P>

arthropods.</P>
      <P>While stores have a policy of taking back abandoned pets such as hedgehogs, for

      <P>Lee Tao-sheng, deputy director-general of the Forestry Bureau, said the bureau,

insufficient human resources, noting that it has cracked down on 25 illegal

      <P>Lee agreed to meet with experts in a month's time to further discuss the

    <TEXT>
      <P>Since the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008, major economies, led
by the United States, have lowered their interest rates to near zero and at the
same time have adopted a quantitative easing of their monetary policies. Instead
of stimulating a global economic recovery, however, the measures have led to
liquidity overflows that are blamed for the stock and property bubbles in many
countries.</P>
      <P>Amid the hot money flood, the worst thing a country can do is raising its
interest rates, because this attracts more speculators to the country for
arbitrage trading.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is exactly such an example. Just when hot money is making a fierce attack
on emerging markets, especially those in East Asia, Taiwan's central bank has
bravely increased its key interest rates by 0.125 percentage points twice since
June, and claims that interest rates "must be restored back to normal levels."</P>
      <P>As a result, the central bank has been busy fighting the influx of hot money day
after day since the interest rate hikes.</P>
      <P>A country must have a way to protect itself in such a crazy world. (Editorial

      <P>Shares of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. Inc., the world's largest contract
electronics manufacturer, were higher in early trading Friday, bucking a
downturn on the broader market as buying interest was ignited by its record-high
September sales figure, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai rose 1.27 percent to NT$119.50 (US$3.88) at one point, with 20.4 million
shares changing hands, while the benchmark weighted index fell 0.33 percent to
8,256.56.</P>
      <P>"Investors have been upbeat about the company's earnings outlook, in particular
after it reported a record monthly high in September sales for the second
consecutive month, " Taiwan International Securities analyst Michael Chiang
said.</P>
      <P>The previous day, Hon Hai announced NT$253.48 billion in sales for September, up
18 percent from August and up 69.62 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>In the third quarter, the company's sales rose 29.1 percent from the previous
quarter to NT$664.45 billion.</P>
      <P>"The higher September sales largely reflected strong demand in China due to a
buying spree ahead of the country's extended Oct. 1 National Day holiday,"
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, Hon Hai is expected to enjoy a good fourth quarter as the company
has secured large orders from global high-tech giants, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The September sales also surpassed a previous estimate of NT$232 billion by
Merrill Lynch, which maintained a buy recommendation on the stock.</P>
      <P>Merrill Lynch said Hon Hai's two wage hikes for its Chinese workers in June,
effective from October, are expected to impose little impact on the company's
bottom line.</P>
      <P>Chiang agreed, saying that as the company is relocating its China operations
from coastal Shenzhen to the inland Henan Province, the relatively lower labor
costs there will alleviate the impact on the company's operating costs.</P>
      <P>Chiang said Hon Hai is expected to continue to attract buying, and gave a target
price of NT$130.00-NT$132.00 for the stock.</P>

organizations where appropriate, including ICAO, " an unnamed State Department
official told CNA in a telephone interview.</P>

spokesman for the State Department, said it is "for those international
organizations to decide" upon what "meaningful participation" entails.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is not an ICAO member, although it handles a large flight information
volume, with 49 carriers flying more than 1 million flights over its flight
information zone every year.</P>
      <P>In addition to bidding for ICAO observer status, Taiwan is also hoping to gain a
presence in various ICAO technical seminars, workshops and conferences.</P>

long holiday in China in celebration of its national day -- reached 20,000
people this year, nearly double the level of the same period of last year,
according to government statistics.</P>
      <P>The tallies released by the Tourist Bureau Thursday show that 20,206 Chinese
tourists arrived in Taiwan in the Oct. 1-7 period, marking a growth of 92.5
percent compared with the same period of 2009, when 10,498 Chinese tourists
arrived.</P>
      <P>Based on the assumption that most visitors stay for 6.5 days and spend NT$7,141
(US$232) per day, Taiwan earned NT$960 million by hosting the Chinese visitors
in the so-called "October golden week" this year, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Thanks to the recent appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar, the revenues
represent an increase of over 70 percent compared with the same period of a year
ago, it added.</P>
      <P>The bureau also said that while Sun Moon Lake in the central county of Nantou
continued to top the list of tourist attractions for Chinese tourists during the
holiday week, with the Taipei 101 building in second place, Sizihwan Bay in
Kaohsiung City squeezed out the National Palace Museum in Taipei for third
place.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New Taiwan dollar slows rise after central bank flags risks</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar slowed its appreciation against the U.S. dollar during
morning trading Friday, due to a statement released by the central bank a day
earlier that it might launch further measures to curb an inflow of foreign
funds, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The central bank quoted Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz as saying
Oct. 5 that ultra-loose monetary policies by the U. S. Federal Reserve and the
European Central Bank are throwing the world into chaos rather than helping the
global economic recovery.</P>
      <P>It also noted Brazil's Oct. 4 doubling of a tax on foreign bond purchases that
was seen as aiming to curb an inflow of foreign cash that has pushed up the
value of the Brazilian currency to its highest level in two years.</P>
      <P>Local markets interpreted the central bank's move as suggesting that it might
also launch short-term capital control measures to attack speculators if they
keep pushing up the local currency.</P>
      <P>The U.S. currency opened higher at NT$31.100 on the Taipei Foreign Exchange, and
then dropped back to NT$30.790 at noon, falling NT$0.252.</P>
      <P>The U.S. dollar hit a low of NT$30.675 a day earlier before the central bank
intervened late in the day to boost the greenback to close at NT$31.042.</P>
      <P>Dealers said, however, that after the central bank released the statement, the
market was reluctant to push the greenback lower Friday.</P>
      <P>"The effect of the central bank's `new instructions' was quite obvious, " a
dealer at a local bank said. "The drop of the U.S. dollar against the local
currency in early trading was not as much as it has been in the last few days,"
he added.</P>
      <P>The central  bank underlined  in its statement  Stiglitz's contention that the
recent actions by those countries to curb the strength of their currencies were
"necessary, " and that they are natural in that context, as they cannot allow
their exchange rates to appreciate and destroy their export strength.</P>
      <P>It also pointed out that the difference of 4.6 percentage points between the
year-on-year growth rate of U.S. dollar-denominated import prices at 12.74
percent in the first nine months of this year, and the year-on-year growth rate
of New Taiwan-dollar-denominated import prices at 8.14 percent in the same
period, reflected the appreciation of the local unit against the U.S. currency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Hon Hai Group posts record sales</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/08/10  13:16:54
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hon Hai Group,  the world's  largest electronics  contract manufacturer, also
known as Foxconn Technology Group, reported record sales of NT$253.476 billion
(US$8.18 billion) for September Thursday, surpassing consensus market
expectations for revenues.</P>
      <P>The group's robust business performance will give a badly needed shot in the arm
to the local downstream electronics sector, which has seen its stock prices
plunge in recent days over the New Taiwan dollar's appreciation.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the development:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>Hon Hai's September sales marked an increase of NT$38.67 billion, or 18 percent
over its August sales, and represented a whopping 69.62 percent year-on-year
growth.</P>
      <P>The group's overall sales for the first nine months of the year have already
exceeded NT$1.6 trillion, for a hefty 62.97 percent year-on-year gain.</P>
      <P>Market analysts forecast optimistically that Hon Hai will emerge as the first
Taiwan-based conglomerate to post more than NT$2 trillion in annual sales by the
end of this year.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai spokesman Edmund Ding said consumer electronics remained the strongest
of the company's  three major product lines in September,  followed  by personal
computers  and communications technology.</P>
      <P>Financial  analysts said frenzied sales of the Apple iPad contributed greatly to
Hon Hai's remarkable business record for September. Hon Hai is the sole contract
maker for the iPad.</P>
      <P>Major local electronics stocks, including those of Hon Hai, have remained weak
in recent days due to rises in the local currency's exchange rate against the
greenback amid hot money attacks fueled by domestic interest rate hikes. Stock
market analysts said Hon Hai's encouraging sales record will not only help boost
its stock price but will also help stabilize the stocks of other electronics
giants such as Quanta and Compal. (Oct. 8, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>On Thursday, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) released the country's foreign trade
statistics for September that show a 6.8 percent decrease in exports from the
August level.</P>
      <P>MOF officials attributed the monthly decline in export value mainly to the
onslaught of Typhoon Fanapi and a string of industrial accidents that caused a
drop in petrochemical sector exports.</P>
      <P>Compared with the year-earlier level, September exports posted a 17.5 percent
growth, according to MOF statistics.</P>
      <P>The accumulated exports for the third quarter of this year amounted to US$70.35
billion, a new quarterly record in the country's foreign trade history, MOF
officials said.</P>
      <P>They also forecast that the country's total exports for 2010 will be able to hit
the government's projected target of US$272.9 billion.</P>
      <P>Total exports for the first nine months of the year stood at US$202.25 billion,
up 40.6 percent from the same period of last year, while imports for the nine-
month period increased an even more impressive 51.4 percent to top US$184
billion. As a result, the country's trade surplus declined 17.9 percent to
US$18.25 billion for the first three quarters of the year. (Oct. 8, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Yang Ping-chen, a judge of the Taiwan High Court, was impeached by the Control
Yuan Thursday for whoring and gambling while on duty, as well as for running an
antique business. Both the judicial system and bureaucratic culture have a
responsibility for Yang's descent into disrepute.</P>
      <P>How could a judge have so much money to buy luxury housing and antiques and even
gamble? If the Legislative Yuan had amended the Act on Property Declaration by
Public Servants early to criminalize unexplained wealth, Yang could have been
brought to justice long ago.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the strict seniority-based hierarchy within the judiciary has
strengthened the culture of bureaucrats sticking up for one another, which makes
exposure of corruption in their ranks difficult. In addition, the large amount
of discretion enjoyed by sentencing judges means that it is very easy to bribe
them.</P>
      <P>Another reason for the prevalent corruption within judicial circles is the lack
of checks and balances of the judicial branch. In other words, Yang was not
thrown into disrepute by chance. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 8, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The chief executive of HTC Corp., the world's largest maker of smartphones using
the Google and Microsoft operating systems, declined to confirm or deny Thursday
the company's reported plan to join the global rush to launch a tablet computer
early next year.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters at HTC's biggest product-launch event in Asia, CEO Peter
Chou said he would not comment on reports speculating that HTC will launch a
Google Android-based tablet computer in the first quarter of next year.</P>
      <P>He said an overwhelming number of companies have been trying to occupy a share
of the booming market.</P>
      <P>More than 100 companies said at this year's Consumer Electronics Show that they
will launch e-readers or tablets, Chou said.</P>
      <P>This makes the tablet computer market "less appealing," he added.</P>
      <P>Chao also expressed belief that there is still great potential for smartphone
growth and he predicted that annual sales of the devices will reach 500 to 600
million units in two or three years.</P>
      <P>Chou confirmed that HTC sold 16 million smartphones in the first three quarters
of this year, which is higher than its total sales of 11 million units last
year.</P>
      <P>At the launch event, HTC introduced its new Desire HD and Desire Z, which run on
Android 2.2, the latest version of Google's operating system, and which will be
available in Asia in November.</P>
      <P>Chou forecast that more than 1 million units for each new smartphone will be
sold by the end of this year, as most of the previous models launched earlier
this year have seen sales of at least 1 million units each.</P>
      <P>In the Asian market, he said, the company's sales grew 200 percent this year.
The goal is to boost the Asian market's share of HTC's total revenues to 33
percent, with the U.S. and European markets accounting for the rest, he added.</P>
      <P>HTC is now the world's fourth-largest smartphone brand, with nearly 10 percent
of the global market share.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Elpida Memory Inc., a Japanese-based chipmaker, is planning to set up an R&amp;D
center in Taiwan, a Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu Ming-chi, director of the Department of Industrial Technology under the MOEA,
said Elpida is likely to invest more than US$100 million to establish the DRAM
chip development center.</P>
      <P>Wu said he has held preliminary talks with the Japanese company regarding the
investment, but he added that the investment plan still needs more time to be
finalized.</P>
      <P>He said that if everything goes smoothly, Elpida is expected to become the first
foreign company to open such a large-scale DRAM research hub in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said that while he had not been
informed about the planned Elpida investment, the R&amp;D center could become an
alternative way for Taiwan to develop its DRAM industry now that the ministry
has shelved a plan to start operations of Taiwan Innovation Memory Co. (TIMC)
due to opposition from the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The government set up TIMC in August 2009 as part of its efforts to restructure
the local DRAM industry, which was hit hard by the global financial meltdown.</P>
      <P>However, the Legislative Yuan decided in November 2009 that the Cabinet-run
National Development Fund should not be allowed to pour operating funds into
TIMC,  against the government's  previous expectations.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Hwang Jung-chiou said Elpida's planned
investment is simply a business consideration, as the Japanese firm wants to
collaborate with Taiwan to compete with South Korea, which has taken the lead in
production technology in the global DRAM industry.</P>

advice on how best to lead Taiwan out of the shadow of the recession.</P>
      <P>Mirrlees, who is currently Master of Morningside College at The Chinese

Sinica,  Taiwan's top academic  research institute, and National Taiwan
University on Oct. 8 and Oct. 9, respectively.</P>
      <P>The Scottish economist is known for his analytic research on economic incentives
in situations with incomplete, or asymmetrical, information. He shared the 1996
Nobel Prize with William Vickrey of Columbia University.</P>
      <P>Ma told Mirrlees that although Taiwan has bottomed out of the global recession
triggered by the financial storm that began in 2008 after taking a series of
financial and economic measures, "the country's economic outlook is not so
clear."</P>
      <P>Taiwan is still being affected by the aftermath of the recession, with an
imbalance of income distribution and high unemployment, he said.</P>
      <P>Ma asked Mirrlees how Taiwan, an export-reliant country, can maintain its
economic development, and how it can avoid the influence of the withering
European and American markets.</P>
      <P>Mirrlees' responses were not available, as the meeting at that point became

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.47 percent Friday amid lingering fears that a
strengthening local currency could undermine the island's global
competitiveness, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 39.73 points to 8,244.19, after moving between 8,232.02
and 8,309.91, on turnover of NT$114.44 billion (US$3.72 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.27 percent and moved to the day's high before selling
emerged, focusing on flat panel display makers, to reverse early gains on
currency concerns. Investors also pocketed recent profit by unloading select old
economy stocks and financial shares, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,565 stocks closed down and 1,227 up, with 293 unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile sector suffered the heaviest pressure, down 1.46 percent. Cement
stocks shed 1.06 percent, financials lost 1.09 percent, construction shares
dropped 0.55 percent, paper and pulp stocks fell 0.54 percent, and foodstuffs
closed down 0.48 percent.</P>
      <P>The plastics and chemical sector fell 0.42 percent and the machinery and
electronics sector closed down 0.32 percent.</P>
      <P>"A stronger Taiwan dollar still weighed on market sentiment," Hua Nan Securities
analyst Stan Chang said. "Along with the upside of other Asian currencies
against the greenback, the Taiwan dollar could not be isolated. The local bourse
was affected accordingly."</P>
      <P>Chang said turnover was reduced, with many investors sidelined ahead of a U.S.
job report for September scheduled to be released later Friday.</P>
      <P>Investors in Taiwan were afraid that Wall Street will go choppy if the September
jobless rate disappoints U.S. markets, Chang said.</P>
      <P>"For the moment, it was wise for investors to keep cash and adjust their
portfolios to cushion the possible impact," Chang said.</P>
      <P>He said he expects the local bourse to move between 8,200 points and 8,400
points next week on lingering currency worries.</P>
      <P>Among flat panel makers, Chimei Innolux fell 4.53 percent to NT$41.05 and AU
Optronics shed 3.91 percent to NT$30.70.</P>
      <P>In the old economy sector, Far Eastern New Century lost 2.41 percent to NT$41.50
and Taiwan Cement dropped 1.58 percent to NT$34.35.</P>
      <P>Hon Hai Precision, the world's largest contract electronics product maker,
closed up 0.42 percent at NT$118.50, off a high of 121.50, after it posted

      <P>Taiwan's electronics hardware industry has made a foray into publishing at the
Frankfurt Book Fair 2010, with the "Taiwan Pavilion" including an e-reader
section for the first time.</P>
      <P>Electronics manufacturers and digital publishers from Taiwan including Qisda,
Moker Information Technology, and Newtonkids shared the results of applying
e-books to digital learning at the world's biggest book fair.</P>
      <P>"As long as technology cooperates with the culture and creative industry, there
will be a lot of room for e-publishing in Taiwan to grow, " said Wang Jung-wen,
chairman of the Taiwan Book Fair Foundation.</P>
      <P>Wang, who heads local publisher YLib, said most e-readers around the world are
made by Taiwanese producers, which suggests the country has a favorable
environment to develop the device.</P>
      <P>Qisda Vice President Alpha Tsai, who led a group to promote his company at the
event from Oct. 6- 10, said publishing had its cultural and linguistic
boundaries, making it necessary for e-reader device makers to work with
publishers in different countries to open local markets.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-based personal computer vendor Acer Inc. will launch its e-reader sales
through German book service provider Libri in October, according to an
announcement last month.</P>
      <P>"E-books will probably have two major potential reader groups in the future.
People over 40 years old who are used to reading paper books are likely to buy
text e-readers with e-paper display,"  Tsai said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, "young people who have grown up with multimedia would rather
choose devices with interactive content, " he said.</P>
      <P>This year, the exhibition attracted 7,533 exhibitors from 111 countries,  with
over 309,000 books on display,  according to statistics from fair organizers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A welfare organization held a press conference Friday in which it urged
candidates running in the Nov. 27 five special municipality elections to put
forward concrete policies and set aside budgets for the mentally challenged.</P>
      <P>Taipei Life of Heart Association Director-General Chin Lin said the organization
operates several projects contracted from the government  and that without a
long-term  budget and concrete development plan, the benefits for the mentally
challenged will be at risk.</P>
      <P>"The voices of the mentally challenged are often overlooked by politicians, "
said Liu Li-ju, director-general of the Taipei County Mental Rehabilitation
Association.</P>
      <P>"I once asked a mayoral candidate about his plans for the mentally challenged
when I attended his book signing party, " said Liu. "I was not at all surprised
to receive no answer."</P>
      <P>According to Chin, the Department of Health will in 2011 stop funding a home
visit service, a mechanism that sends social workers to the homes of the
mentally challenged at regular intervals to provide regular consultation and
assistance.</P>
      <P>"We are afraid that the service will disappear for good if government officials
keep on neglecting this issue, " said Chin, noting that about 90 percent of the
mentally challenged live in the community rather than being confined to medical
institutions, and often need help with their daily lives.</P>
      <P>The service has benefited people like "Mr. Bright" (not his real name) , a 40
-year-old who has suffered from schizophrenia since the first year of high
school.</P>
      <P>"He used to shun people and lock himself away in his home, " said Liu Hsiao-yu,
a social worker who has been working with him for some time. Since receiving the
weekly visits, she said, he has learned to care for his family and his
community.</P>
      <P>Liu said that Mr. Bright, who has an obsession with memorizing words in the
dictionary, has even developed English to Chinese translation skills, thanks
largely to the encouragement of the social workers.</P>
      <P>Displaying  a printed statement of support she wanted the candidates to sign,
Chin urged voters to ensure that their chosen candidate supports the rights of
the mentally challenged before casting their votes in the year-end elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with China delivered a speech at a leading European
think-tank Thursday on Taiwan's cross-strait policy and its efforts to
strengthen economic ties with other countries.</P>
      <P>Chiang Pin-kung, chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) , Taiwan's
quasi-official intermediary body for exchanges with China, encapsulated the
policies that President Ma Ying-jeou's administration has adopted over the past
two years to ease tensions across the Taiwan Strait and improve "people-to-
people" ties across the strait.</P>
      <P>During his speech at the European Institute for Asian Studies, one of the major
think-tanks in Europe, Chiang said that cross-strait relations have been hoisted
to a much higher level of engagement since Taiwan signed an economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) with China in June this year.</P>
      <P>He said that the signing of the ECFA has led other Asian countries, including
Japan and Singapore, to become interested in entering closer economic ties with
Taiwan, and has given Taiwan a boost in its pursuit of signing free trade
agreements with other countries.</P>
      <P>Responding to a Singaporean scholar's question on whether the ECFA will lead to
a unification of Taiwan and China, Chiang said that reunification with China and
Taiwan independence were sensitive matters in Taiwan society, and that the
public was not in consensus on the issue.</P>
      <P>He said that Ma would continue his "three noes" policy of no reunification, no
independence and no use of force, meaning Taiwan will pursue a policy of
maintaining the cross-strait status quo.</P>
      <P>When an official with the Japanese embassy in Belgium asked about Taiwan's plans
to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with other countries, Chiang said that
Taiwan and Singapore agreed in August to begin bilateral talks on the
feasibility of signing an FTA-like economic cooperation agreement.</P>
      <P>Chiang, a vice chairman of Taiwan's ruling Kuomintang (KMT) , arrived in the
Belgian capital Wednesday after attending the British Conservative Party's

    <TEXT>
      <P>The central bank said Friday it auctioned NT$100 billion (US$3.25 billion) in
364-day negotiable certificates of deposit (NCDs) to drain excessive funds from
the market.</P>
      <P>The NCD sale attracted total bids worth NT$322.11 billion from financial
institutions such as banks, credit cooperative associations and Chunghwa Post,
the central bank said.</P>
      <P>The NCDs were sold at an average interest rate of 0.715 percent, it added.</P>
      <P>The central bank said it has sold NT$700 billion worth of 364-day NCDs since
April in its monthly NCD auctions, and the fund absorption in the seven auctions
was equivalent to a hike of 2.72 percentage points in the deposit reserve
requirement ratio.</P>
      <P>Banks are required to set aside a certain portion of their deposits and place
the funds with the central bank. The central bank raises or cuts the deposit
requirement reserve ratio to tighten or loosen money supply.</P>
      <P>Dealers said the market is awash in idle money, with continued inflow of funds
from overseas. The value of the bids in the latest auction clearly demonstrated
the high liquidity level, they added.</P>
      <P>The local market's funds remain ample because the central bank repeatedly
intervenes in the foreign exchange market by buying U.S. dollars to shore up the
value of the greenback against the Taiwan dollar, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>The latest NCD auction was consistent with the central bank's plan to tighten
its monetary policy after the local economy staged a strong rebound, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The organizers of an international basketball tournament who stopped fans from
displaying Taiwan's national flag at a game Thursday night acted
"inappropriately" and misinterpreted the "Chinese Taipei" formula, Taiwan's top
sports administrator said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Sports Affairs Council (SAC) said in a statement that it was a "pity" to
learn of the action taken by officials of the Chinese Taipei University Sports
Federation (CTUSF) at a game between Taiwan University All-Stars and China's
Tianjin Polytechnic University at the 2010 Asian University Basketball
Championship.</P>
      <P>It described the handling of the incident by the CTUSF, the tournament's
organizer, as inappropriate.</P>
      <P>The competition, being held in the northern township of Luzhu, Taoyuan County,
from Oct. 3-8,  is an official international tournament and must follow the
"Chinese Taipei" formula set up by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).</P>
      <P>The formula was devised in 1981 by the IOC to enable Taiwan to participate in
the Olympics under the name of "Chinese Taipei" after the People's Republic of
China was admitted to the organization in 1979.</P>
      <P>Since then, Taiwan has participated in almost all international sporting events
and some international organizations under the name.</P>
      <P>"Though the formula has been in place for years, some sports administrators
still don't quite understand the regulations and principles. We want to make
sure this will not happen again, " said Chou Jui, head of the SAC's
International Sports Department.</P>
      <P>Chou explained  that the Chinese  Taipei formula regulates protocols in areas
such as competitions, training, meetings and ceremonies and also covers
personnel, including athletes, officials and staff.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese event organizers, for example, are not allowed to hang the country's
national flag (which differs from Taiwan's Olympic flag) at competition venues.</P>
      <P>The formula, however, does not regulate spectators and what happens  in the
stands  unless  organizers  announce  specific restrictions prior to a
competition.</P>
      <P>SAC Deputy Chairman Chen Hsien-tsung said the council has contacted the CTUSF to
explain the regulations.</P>

      <P>This year's Patient Safety Awareness Week will center on building an interactive
partnership between doctors and patients, an official from Department of Health
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The event is an annual health care safety education campaign in the third week
of October. This year it will run from Oct. 10 to Oct. 16 and feature seminars
and activities in Taipei and seven other municipalities for both patients and
physicians.</P>
      <P>Wang Tsung-hsi, deputy director-general of the Bureau of Medical Affairs at the
health department, said that most Taiwanese patients are too shy to speak out to
doctors, when in fact they should engage in dialogue about their symptoms and
notify doctors of any possible mistakes.</P>
      <P>"It is proven in Western countries that patient awareness campaigns can
efficiently reduce false diagnoses, death rates and re-infection rates," Wang
said.</P>
      <P>Throughout the year, 50 hospitals nationwide will cooperate to improve
communication between patients and doctors, he said.</P>
      <P>Patient awareness is also one of the factors in hospital evaluations, Wang

      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corp.
(UMC), the world's top two contract chip makers, both said Friday that they
posted growth in sales for the third quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>TSMC said it recorded NT$112.25 billion (US$3.64 billion) in sales for the third
quarter, a quarterly record high, up 6.94 percent from the second quarter, while
UMC registered NT$32.65 billion, a record high since the third quarter of 2004
and up 9.77 percent from the previous quarter.</P>
      <P>In September, TSMC sales rose 0.7 percent from August to NT$37.64 billion, while
UMC saw sales for the month grow 0.53 percent from the previous month to reach
NT$10.94 billion.</P>
      <P>"As the two companies operated at full capacity in the third quarter on the back
of strong demand for consumer electronics, the quarterly growth came as no
surprise, " Grand Cathay Securities analyst Julian Wang said.</P>
      <P>However, as the global foundry business has entered the fourth quarter --
traditionally a slow season for the sector -- Wang said he expects both TSMC and
UMC will see sales declines over the next three months.</P>
      <P>He said TSMC, which commands a lead in production technology, is likely to fare
better than UMC during the cyclical downturn.</P>
      <P>Wang said he expects TSMC will see a 3 percent-5 percent quarterly decline in
sales for the fourth quarter, while UMC is likely to suffer a 7 percent-10
percent fall in revenue.</P>
      <P>"It is unlikely that the two companies will enjoy full capacity operations in
the fourth quarter, due to slowing demand," Wang said.</P>
      <P>He said the market should watch closely how fast the New Taiwan dollar rises
against the U.S. dollar, as the pace of the appreciation is expected to impact
the high-tech sector's global competitiveness.</P>

      <P>AVTech Corp. on Friday denied allegations that it invaded the privacy of a group

      <P>Tien Cheng-ping,  president of the manufacturer of digital surveillance video

installed at the workers' dormitories for security reasons.</P>
      <P>Tien said all the cameras were aimed at entrances, with none aimed at toilets or

criticized their behavior or bodies.</P>
      <P>The accusations were made a day earlier by 10 Filipina workers from AVTech's
plant in Sanchung, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>The county's Labor Affairs Bureau has launched an investigation into the

      <P>Tien said the workers  were making  false allegations  in retaliation for the

      <P>The workers have been trying to pressure the company to renew their contracts
since July, he said, adding that the Labor Affairs Bureau has hosted a number of

      <P>Sales of the National Palace Museum's souvenir shop grew 10 percent in the first
week of October compared with the same periods of August and September, the
general manager of the museum's souvenir department said Friday.</P>
      <P>Ho Chun-huan told CNA that although the number of Chinese tourists who visited
the museum in the Oct. 1-7 period -- the long national day holiday called
"golden week" in China -- did not appear to be an obvious rise from the previous
two months, souvenir sales were up.</P>
      <P>Most of the tourists spent between NT$1,400 (US$45.27) and NT$1,500 on souvenirs
at the museum in the week-long period, higher than the NT$1,000-NT$1,200 they
spent in August and September, she said.</P>
      <P>One of the tourists spent a whopping NT$1.06 million in a single day, making him
the biggest spender the store has seen since Taiwan opened its doors in 2008 to
tourists from China, Ho said.</P>
      <P>The National Palace Museum was one of five most popular tourist destinations in
Taiwan among Chinese visitors during the week-long holiday, behind Sun Moon Lake
in Nantou County, the Taipei 101 building and Sizihwan Bay in Kaohsiung City,
according to the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>However, shops and vendors in the Sun Moon Lake scenic area said nothing had
changed during the week, with no discernible increase in the number of Chinese
visitors.</P>
      <P>Tea egg vendor Chou Chin-pen  complained  of low business throughout the
holiday, especially in the last three days.</P>
      <P>"We were so idle we could fall asleep in the daytime," she said.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Sun Moon Lake National Scenic Area
Administration, Chinese tourist arrivals in the first week of October were not
as numerous as expected.</P>
      <P>As of the end of September, the number of Chinese visitors to Sun Moon Lake had
reached nearly 840,000 people, which breaks down to 3,100 per day, the
administration said.</P>
      <P>The peak for arrivals was in April and May, with a daily average of 4,756
Chinese visitors per day, it said.</P>
      <P>In comparison, the golden week tallies reached only 3,169 people per day, it
added.</P>
      <P>China is one of Taiwan's biggest sources of tourists. In 2009, 560,000 Chinese
people visited the country, while the first seven months of the year saw 740,000
Chinese tourist arrivals, according to Tourism Bureau statistics.</P>

      <P>New criteria will be used to evaluate bids to provide food services at Taiwan
Taoyuan International Airport, Transportation and Communications Minister Mao
Chi-kuo said Friday, a move aimed at improving the airport's much-maligned food
services.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of a two-week "airport food festival, " Mao said
quality, price and customer satisfaction rather than the amount of the rights
fee bid will determine who is selected to sell food at the airport.</P>
      <P>The new policy, Mao said, addresses concerns that the food services provided by
vendors have been constrained by the excessively high rights fees they have had
to bid to win airport concessions.</P>
      <P>In response to public complaints that food vendors' prices are too high, the
airport will adopt a differentiated pricing strategy to give travelers a
complete range of low-, medium- and high-end choices, Mao added.</P>
      <P>Also under the new policy, existing vendors will be subject to a new evaluation
system that requires them to meet certain performance standards if they want to
have their contracts renewed.</P>
      <P>The quality and prices of the food sold at the airport have been among a litany
of complaints that have tarnished the facility's image in recent months.</P>
      <P>The food festival, held to restore the airport's image, has invited
participating vendors, such as Ever Rich, Honbaryu and Tasa Meng, to showcase
their best dishes until Oct. 22.</P>
      <P>Besides food services, Mao said, the airport is also working to improve its
trolleys, toilets and transit facilities, which have also drawn criticism from
the public and passengers.</P>

      <P>An optical fiber vibration sensor that won a silver medal at the 2010 Taipei
International Invention Show in late September, has proved effective in
monitoring and providing early warnings of landslides, an academic source said
Friday.</P>
      <P>The sensor, developed in 2008 by a research team from National Kaohsiung First
University of Science and Technology, was able to detect landslides or
rockslides that were about to occur during flood seasons, said Tsair-Chun Liang,
dean of the university's College of Electrical Engineering and Science, who
guided the project.</P>
      <P>The sensors have been installed and tested since 2009 in a river watershed in
central Nantou County's Shenmu Village,  an area vulnerable to landslides during
heavy rains.</P>
      <P>"The sensors have been working as well as similar products from abroad, but cost
only about one-seventh as much as imported models, " he said.</P>
      <P>They also are more reliable than traditional monitoring sensors, whose cameras
are easily disabled during flash floods, he said.</P>
      <P>The device's sensors capture vibrations between rocks and in the ground and then
the vibration frequency and vibration amplitude is transmitted to a monitoring
station scale through the optical fiber system.</P>
      <P>The station can then issue warnings to people in areas where there are
potentially dangerous vibrations so that they can evacuate their homes or move
to safe ground.</P>
      <P>The 6-cm-long, 3.5-cm-wide and 4.5-cm-high device stored in a stainless steel
case can also be used to monitor earthquakes, Liang said.</P>
      <P>The university has applied to patent the product, developed by its Graduate
Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering with the support of the Council of
Agriculture's Soil and Water Conservation Bureau, according to Liang.</P>

      <P>The incoming Judicial Yuan president on Friday reaffirmed his commitment to
carry out sweeping judicial reforms, eliminate corrupt judges and restore public
trust in the country's court system.</P>
      <P>"We need to protect and respect competent, conscientious judges while also
working to get rid of the unethical ones in a clear-cut, no-nonsense manner,
because one rotten apple can spoil the whole barrel, " Central Election
Commission Chairman Rai Hau-min said after his nomination was approved by the
Legislative Yuan earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Rai, a veteran lawyer versed in criminal procedure law, criminal policy and
constitutional law, said he will direct the formation of a national judicial
reform committee. The group, to be composed of representatives from all walks of
life, will draft a reform agenda within one year after he assumes the post, Rai
added.</P>
      <P>With district courts around the country as the "home base of judicial reform,"
Rai said integrity, professionalism and trust will be the top goals of the
reform programs.</P>
      <P>Rai outlined his plan during a visit to the legislature to thank lawmakers for
supporting his nomination.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 24, President Ma Ying-jeou nominated Rai as the new Judicial Yuan head,
with law professor Su Yeong-chin as his deputy.</P>
      <P>Of the 112 incumbent  legislators,  107 took part in the confirmation vote on
Friday morning and Rai obtained 71 "yes" ballots.</P>
      <P>Su, widely known as one of Ma's confidants who once served as chairman of the
National Communication Commission, also saw his nomination passed with a vote of
73-34.</P>
      <P>The two Judicial Yuan posts became vacant after Lai In-jaw and Hsieh Tsay-chuan
resigned in July as president and vice president, respectively, to take
responsibility for a scandal in which three senior judges were detained for
alleged corruption.</P>
      <P>According to the Constitution, the president and vice president of the Judicial
Yuan are appointed by the country's president from among 15 justices of the
Constitutional Court, and confirmed by the legislature.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said Ma was grateful for the
legislative support of his nominations for the Judicial Yuan posts.</P>
      <P>"The president is also hopeful that Rai and Su will work determinedly and
efficiently to complete a judicial overhaul and meet public expectations," Lo
said.</P>
      <P>On Friday,  the legislature  also approved President  Ma's nominations for two
Examination Yuan minister-without-portfolio posts -- professor Kao Yung-kuang of

      <P>A visiting Chinese university basketball team withdrew Friday from a tournament
being playing in Taoyuan County after seeing hundreds of Taiwanese national
flags displayed outside the arena.</P>
      <P>After arriving Friday afternoon at Kainan University Arena, where the 2010 Asian
University Basketball Championship was being held, the bus carrying the Tianjin
Polytechnic University basketball team turned around and left.</P>
      <P>The team missed its game against a Mongolian All-Star team, and was officially
credited with a 20-0 loss.</P>
      <P>Though nobody from the Chinese delegation commented on its pull-out, the team
may have been angered by the hundreds of Taiwan national flags displayed in and
around the parking lot and along the road leading to the arena that greeted
their bus.</P>
      <P>They were put there by a "national flag rally" organized by two local university
students in protest of a move the night before by an official from the
tournament's  organizer,  the Chinese Taipei University Sports Federation
(CTUSF) , to stop a fan from displaying the country's national flag in the
stands.</P>
      <P>The students were incensed by reports that the CTUSF official, Lee Hung-chi,
clamped down on the fan at China's insistence, though subsequent reports
indicated Lee acted of his own volition.</P>
      <P>"This is a silent protest to the Chinese team that made the flag issue a big
deal, " said one of the two student protest organizers identified only by his
surname Hsieh.</P>

was held to express "freedom of speech."</P>
      <P>Lee described the Chinese team's withdrawal as "silly, " but he himself was
criticized by the Sports Affairs Council (SAC), Taiwan's top sports
administrator, for going after the fan.</P>
      <P>In a statement released Friday, the SAC called Lee's move inappropriate and said
he had misinterpreted the "Chinese Taipei" formula, devised in 1981 by the
International Olympic Committee to enable Taiwan to participate in the Olympics
after the People's Republic of China was admitted to the Olympic movement.</P>
      <P>Under the convention,  Taiwan participates in international competitions under
the name "Chinese Taipei, " and uses an Olympic flag that differs from its
national flag.</P>
      <P>Organizers of competitions in Taiwan are not allowed to fly the country's
national flag at competition venues, but the convention does not regulate
spectators and what happens in the stands unless organizers announce specific
restrictions prior to a competition.</P>
      <P>Previous sporting events in Taiwan against Chinese teams have seen fans wave
small national flags during the competition, generally without incident.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan beat Universite Saint-Esprit De Kaslik of Lebanon 85-77
Friday, the tournament's final day, to capture the title. Even with its forfeit
to Mongolia, China finished third in the seven-team tourney.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's government on Friday congratulated Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo for
winning the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize and urged the Chinese government to engage in
the promotion of human rights as its economic power grows.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said in a press release Friday that Liu's award was "not
only an individual honor but also has great historical significance for the
development of human rights in China."</P>
      <P>Quoting his own speech of June 4, Ma urged China to treat dissidents with
lenience because "it would convince people throughout the world that the rise of
mainland China contributes not only to the cause of peace, but is also a
positive development from the standpoint of the universal values of freedom,
democracy, and human rights."</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih told reporters that Taiwan and Liu Xiaobo both promote
freedom and human rights.</P>
      <P>"With China's economic development and integration into the world, the ideals of
freedom, the rule of law and human rights will be accepted by the majority of
its people in the future, " he predicted.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Lai Shin-yuan said Liu's honor underlined
the importance of human rights as a universal value.</P>
      <P>Taiwan "looks forward to China's good faith in promoting human rights and
advancing political reform," she added.</P>
      <P>The main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) called for the immediate
release of Liu and voiced its support for China's democratization.</P>
      <P>Political commentator Paul Lin, formerly a Chinese professor who specialized in
the history of China's Communist Party of China and now a naturalized Taiwan
citizen, also praised the award.</P>
      <P>"Justice has prevailed. And Liu Xiaobo has now become the new-generation
torchbearer  of China's  democracy  and freedom movement," he said.</P>
      <P>Liu's award is indicative of the global trend of most countries believing that a
rising and powerful China still needs thorough reforms, Lin said.</P>
      <P>He praised the Norwegian Nobel Committee for upholding the true value of the
award and fending off Chinese pressure.</P>
      <P>"The ball is now back in China's court. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, who pledged
political reform, should publicly voice his support for Liu, who also called for
reform 'within the system' rather than a flat-out revolution. If not,  Wen's
pledge was questionable, " he said.</P>
      <P>Lin said he did not expect the Chinese government to release Liu in the near
future.</P>

      <P>The status of a Taiwanese fishing boat suspected of being hijacked in the Indian
Ocean not far from Mauritius remained unclear as of Friday evening, a Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official has said.</P>
      <P>The ministry was informed by the Council of Agriculture's Fisheries Agency at
noon Wednesday that the vessel "Feng Guo 168, " with a Taiwanese captain, eight
Vietnamese, two Indonesians and three Chinese on board, might have been hijacked
in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the island country.</P>
      <P>The ministry was still unsure whether the boat had been hijacked by pirates or
its own crew on board, MOFA spokesman James Chang said.</P>
      <P>France, which sent a reconnaissance aircraft to locate the ship and has
monitored its course since Wednesday, has agreed to continue its assistance,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>The vessel is now heading south to Mauritius after sailing north Thursday.</P>
      <P>The MOFA also officially requested the assistance of Mauritius' government to
ensure safety of the longliner in the country's EEZ.</P>
      <P>The ministry said it has been trying to gather information about the ship
through its representative offices in South Africa and France as well as

      <P>Taiwan will not allow Chinese citizens to enter Taiwan for employment under the
guise of receiving training or attending courses, Premier Wu Den-yih said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding to ruling Kuomintang Legislator Chen Chieh at a general
administrative interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan. Chen said he was
worried about a news report Friday that said some Taiwanese companies had taken
advantage of legal loopholes to hire Chinese citizens to work in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The premier suggested companies or organizations inviting Chinese citizens to
Taiwan for training should have them wear special vests to prevent people from
"trying to pass fish eyes for pearls."</P>
      <P>Wu quoted tallies from the National Immigration Agency as indicating that 553
domestic companies applied for the entrance of 3,642 Chinese citizens into
Taiwan for business workshops or training courses in the first nine months of
this year.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,591 were approved by the agency and entered Taiwan, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"These figures do not look like illegal schemes and I believe a great majority
of these people indeed came to Taiwan for training, " he said.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the interpellation, Council of Labor Affairs Minister Wang Ju-hsuan
said that the council had never issued a work permit to a citizen of the
People's Republic of China under stipulations of the Statute Governing the
Relations Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area.</P>
      <P>According to Article 95 of the statute, introducing workers from China into
Taiwan would require approval by the Legislative Yuan, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said that according to Taiwan's
regulations, training sessions that mainland Chinese take in Taiwan should not
be longer than three months, but most trainees actually stayed for about one
month.</P>
      <P>These people, numbering no more than 20 in each group, should not receive
payment from any Taiwanese company during their stay, he added.</P>

      <P>The Taiwanese company accused by local media of illegally employing Chinese
workers in Taiwan did not violate government regulations, the Investment
Commission said Friday.</P>
      <P>The commission said that Young Fast Optoelectronics Co. (YFO) filed six
applications to host 101 technicians from its manufacturing operations in China
for technical training in Taiwan over the past nine months.</P>
      <P>All of the technicians came to Taiwan to learn advanced touch panel
manufacturing and processing procedures, the commission said.</P>
      <P>Although they were approved to stay 60 days or 70 days for the training
sessions, the first two groups -- one of five people, and the other of 20 --
returned to China after 29 days and 59 days, respectively, according to the
commission. The other four groups are still receiving training in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Regulations stipulate that Taiwanese companies with manufacturing operations in
China may apply to train Chinese employees in Taiwan for up to three months, the
commission said.</P>
      <P>Local media had reported that YFO was illegally paying Chinese employees to work
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The commission  said it dispatched inspectors,  along with officials from the
National Immigration Agency, to the YFO plant in Taoyuan and found that the
Chinese technicians received training or attended classes eight hours a day and
had not worked as regular staff at the company.</P>
      <P>YFO is one of the world's leading manufacturers of small to medium-sized touch
panel sensor products. It is a key supplier for HTC Corp. and Samsung

      <P>With Taiwan facing financial inflows that have pushed the local currency higher
in the past month, Premier Wu Den-yih said Friday that Taiwan will guard against
"hot money" but still welcomes foreign investment in the country's
infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Answering questions at a legislative hearing on a possible "hot money tax, " Wu
said the government will take measures to curb the inflow of speculative funds
to avoid a repeat of the 1997-1998 Asian Financial Crisis.</P>
      <P>The crisis was precipitated by speculators aggressively driving down the values
of many Asian currencies that left some countries on the verge of bankruptcy and
dependent on bailouts from international organizations.</P>
      <P>"However,  foreign  investment  in  Taiwan's  infrastructure development will be
more than welcome," Wu stressed.</P>
      <P>Perng Fai-nan, the governor of Taiwan's central bank, was reserved about
imposing a "hot money tax, " and he said that doing so was beyond his bank's
power and required the legislature's approval.</P>
      <P>Fueled by a weakening U.S. dollar, large amounts of speculative funds have been
entering Asian markets, including Taiwan, to profit from the expected
appreciation of currencies in the region.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar has appreciated by nearly 3 percent over the past month. It
closed at NT$31.095 to the greenback Friday, slightly down from its 28-month
closing high of NT$31.042 to the U.S. dollar a day earlier.</P>
      <P>The signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement with China, a rising
Chinese yuan and a depreciating U.S. dollar have created room for Taiwan's
currency to appreciate against the U.S. unit, said Huang Yin-ji, chief economist
at SinoPac Financial Holdings Co.</P>
      <P>Perng stressed Thursday that measures by governments around the world to allow a
gradual appreciation of their currencies have been necessary, but he hinted that
his bank might intervene to stop any rapid upswing in the Taiwan dollar.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Liu Xiaobo, who just won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, has been called a Chinese
dissident. We think it would be more appropriate to refer to him as a democracy
activist.</P>
      <P>There are shocking similarities between recent remarks advocating political
reforms by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and Charter 08 -- a manifesto calling for
free elections, greater freedom of expression and human rights co-authored by
Liu in 2008 that led to his arrest and imprisonment.</P>
      <P>While Charter 08 identifies what the Chinese government "has failed to do," Wen
states what the government "ought to do."</P>
      <P>For example, Charter 08 says the absence of political reforms "has restrained
the development of the Chinese nation and the progress of human civilization."
Wen says without political reform as protection, the achievements of economic
reforms will slip away.</P>
      <P>Also, Charter 08 urges the Chinese government to "end the criminalization of
free speech, " and Wen pledges to "create the conditions to allow people to
criticize government affairs."</P>
      <P>The greatest difference between Wen and Liu probably lies in their positions. As
the premier, Wen can voice his promises for political reforms. Liu, however, was
jailed because of his push for political reforms.</P>
      <P>At a time when Liu has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his "non-violent
struggle for fundamental human rights in China, " Wen's remarks appear
especially stimulating. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 9, 2010)</P>

      <P>Pharmaceutical firms have been ordered to recall slimming capsules, including
Meridia, which contain the substance sibutramine, within a month, after reports
showed the weight-loss drug increases risks of cardiovascular disease, the
Department of Health announced in a statement issued Saturday.</P>
      <P>The health department's announcement came after the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration this week demanded Abbotte Laboratories to stop selling its
sibutramine-based diet pill Meridia in North America, following the reports.</P>
      <P>Sales of the drug have been suspended in the European Union.</P>
      <P>Meridia is used in combination with a reduced calorie diet and exercise to help
people lose weight and maintain their weight loss. It is in a class of
medications called appetite suppressants which act on appetite control centers
in the brain to decrease appetite.</P>
      <P>In addition to the product recall, the authorities in Taiwan have also decided
to annul the approval for 15 kinds of medications containing sibutramine,
starting Oct. 11.</P>
      <P>Besides Meridia, other sibutramine-based medications that have received
regulatory approval include: Reductil, Sytramee, Losfat, Moi-Allison, Sibutil,
Shapedesign and Controkilo.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from Taiwan's health authorities, 302 people experienced
discomfort after taking medications containing sibutramine. Of the cases, 115
were proven related to cardiovascular disease, but no death was reported.</P>

National Day with a spirit of optimism and a positive attitude.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the upcoming event:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Thousands of users of Facebook, an Internet social networking Website, have
replaced their profile photos on their web pages with pictures of the ROC
national flag in its three colors of blue, white and crimson, in celebration of
National Day.</P>
      <P>This was part of a campaign launched by several Facebook users in the hope of
attracting at least 10,000 people to decorate Facebook with "a sea of ROC
national flags."</P>
      <P>As of Friday, the campaign drew five times as many people as the organizers had
expected. They hoped the number will double the following day.</P>
      <P>"Putting your party flags down, picking our national flag up, waving it and
chanting 'Hail the Republic of China', " the initiators of the campaign wrote on
their Facebook pages. (Oct. 9, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The National Day celebration will begin Saturday with an evening party at the
Taipei Arena. And the biggest event for the celebration will be the grand flower
floats parade in downtown Taipei City on Sunday.</P>
      <P>A 40 meter-long, 4.5 meter-high caterpillar-style float made by the Paper Wind
Mill Foundation will be a highlight of the parade. The foundation was
commissioned by the 2010 Taipei International Flora Exposition to make the float
to promote the exposition, which will open in November.</P>
      <P>The float is a colorful caterpillar made entirely of green materials and
recycled objects. It took 10 months and nearly NT$20 million (US$646,200) to
make.</P>
      <P>The foundation said it hopes the caterpillar will remind people to value their
living environment and work together to stop global warming. (Oct. 9, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chen Liang-bin never imagined that booming demand for his anthuriums -- also
called flamingo flowers -- could bring him headaches.</P>
      <P>Customers in China want to sharply increase orders to 3 million a year -- 300
times the total number of orders last year, said Chen, chief of a floriculture
production and marketing group in Neimen Township in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung
County.</P>
      <P>"The demand from China is really too much, " said Chen, who has planted
anthuriums in Neimen -- Taiwan's largest plantation zone for the flowers -- for
11 years. "We cannot simply cut our supply to Japan in order to meet the growing
Chinese demand -- at least not for now."</P>
      <P>Anthuriums rank second on Taiwan's cut flower export list, following orchids.
Japanese like to use them for a traditional type of flower arrangement, and have
made Taiwan the top source of anthurium imports to Japan.</P>
      <P>As of the end of September, anthurium production in Neimen reached 2 million,
already surpassing its full-year production in 2009.</P>
      <P>Although production is expected to rise to 2.5 million by the end of this year,
it is still not enough to meet growing demand from China, Chen said.</P>
      <P>A Chinese flower trader offered Chen a down payment of 1 million Chinese yuan
(US$149,900) to secure a deal for 3 million anthuriums ayear -- or 250,000
flowers per month.</P>
      <P>Chen said, however, that at present his group is only able to supply 50,000
flowers to China per month.</P>
      <P>"My Chinese client told me that would not even meet the demand from Shanghai
alone," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that his group will not be able to meet China's orders until 2012,
after it expands plantation areas for the flowers.</P>
      <P>Although anthuriums are popular in China, they were not included in the "early
harvest" list of items that will enjoy preferential tariff treatment under the
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) signed with China in late June,
unlike oncidiums and other orchids.</P>
      <P>In August, Chen Liang-bin met Chen Yunlin, chairman of China's quasi-official
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), in Tianjin, China.
The flower farmer expressed his hope that anthuriums could be included on the
early harvest list.</P>
      <P>The ARATS chief, however, told Chen to consider moving his people and
technologies from Taiwan to China.</P>
      <P>"We don't want to go to China. We want to keep our roots in Taiwan, " Chen said,
adding that his biggest concern about working in China was unexpected policy
changes.</P>
      <P>Chen set up a flower store in Shanghai earlier this year to handle his business,
but said he would rather ship his flowers to China than be based there.</P>
      <P>"With direct cross-strait flights, Chinese orders can be taken in the morning
and delivered by late afternoon," he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said the planting cost of anthuriums is NT$7-8 per flower, and the average
selling price in Taiwan is about NT$20 (US$0.65).</P>
      <P>At present, Chen sells his flowers in his Shanghai store at about NT$40 apiece,
slightly higher than his flower's wholesale price in Japan.</P>
      <P>Before Chen set up his shop earlier this year, traders sold his flowers in China
for as much as NT$130 apiece.</P>
      <P>Anthuriums grown in China's Yunnan and Hainan provinces are not as good as
flowers from Taiwan, which are superior in terms of the color and petal size,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>Chen's group, which produces 32 colors of anthuriums, has won major awards in
local floral competitions, including a "triple crown championship" at a 2008
floral competition in Kaohsiung in which the group won in categories for red,
green and pink flowers.</P>
      <P>Although the most common color of anthuriums is red, Chen said he is proud of
his recent development of a large white anthurium. At about 15 centimeters in
diameter, the flowers have sold in Japan for more than NT$100 apiece.</P>
      <P>His high-quality green anthurium, at about 17 cm in diameter, fetched over
NT$140 on the Japanese market last year.</P>
      <P>In addition to demand from Japan and China, Chen was approached recently by a
trading company from Singapore that asked him to provide 20,000 flowers a month.</P>
      <P>"I was afraid of not being able to meet their demand, so I didn't take the
order," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He also said that because of holidays such as Christmas and the Chinese New
Year, business in Taiwan would soon be picking up.</P>
      <P>Though he's unable to take lucrative new contracts at the moment, Chen said he
wouldn't be averse to rearranging his orders after a few months.</P>
      <P>"My contract with Japanese traders runs through the end of the year, " he said.
"I told the Singaporeans that we could talk again on January 1st."</P>

    <HEADLINE>Flora Expo meets mixed reviews on first day of trial run</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Visitors to the Taipei International Flora Expo on the first day of a trial run
gave it a "thumbs-up" Saturday despite complaints about the lack of benches and
poor English translations in the 91.8-hectare exhibition grounds.</P>
      <P>The expo opened its doors on Saturday morning for more than 5,000 volunteers,
residents of two nearby districts, members of the press and invited guests from
international schools in Taipei. The trial period will run for 20 days before
the grand opening on Nov. 6.</P>
      <P>Chang Chien-hua, 73, a long-time Taipei City resident who toured the park with
her 83 year-old husband, said she was thrilled to visit the expo, which she had
been anticipating for a long time.</P>
      <P>"I have loved flowers all my life. Gorgeous flowers always put me in a good
mood. I have been walking around the park for almost three hours and I still
don't want to go home," she said with a smile.</P>
      <P>Walking with the help of canes, however, the elderly couple complained about the
lack of benches in the park and said the organizers should set up sitting areas
so visitors can relax while enjoying the flowers.</P>
      <P>A family of five visiting from South Africa also complained of the lack of rest
areas in the park, and suggested covered spaces for people who want to take a
breather while sheltered from the sun or rain.</P>
      <P>Linda Kuys, a South African expatriate who has been to the Chelsea Flower Show
in London,  described the Taipei expo as "awesome, " but while giving kudos to
the organizers on architectural designs  and flower  arrangements,  she lamented
the lack of English-language maps of the park.</P>
      <P>The erroneous or "quirky" English translations in the park confused some
English-speaking visitors.</P>
      <P>For example, a sign that reads "Decoding Pavilion of New Fashion" left visitors
from the Dominican International School baffled about the actual content of the
pavilion.</P>
      <P>One English speaker pointed out that the organizers wrote "tradition's flowers"
instead of "traditional flowers, " and a sign reading "Multimate rial Fashions
and Environment" left another visitor scratching her head.</P>
      <P>Michael Lee, a Singapore-based Taiwanese businessman, said he was impressed by
the size of the expo and the selection of flowers, but disappointed at the
dullness of colors presented in the park.</P>
      <P>"I was expecting to be visually stunned by lots of vibrant colors, but I didn't
see that at all. The park is big, but there is not a whole lot of life to it,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Two separate power outages also put an unwelcome kink in Saturday's trial
opening.</P>
      <P>Expo spokeswoman Ma Chien-hui said the organizing committee appreciated all
comments from the fairgoers and hoped the feedback would keep coming ahead of
the official kick-off early next month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A six-day international meeting for the southern bluefin tuna industry began in
Taipei Saturday, with participants expected to decide policy that will lead to a
new total allowance catch (TAC) in 2012, the organizer said.</P>
      <P>According  to the Fisheries  Agency under the Council  of Agriculture, the most
important mission of this year's meeting is to finalize a management procedure
for the the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) , a
quota-setting body comprising Australia, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, South
Korea and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The management procedure is scheduled to be finalized in 2010 for implementation
in 2011. It will be the basis for setting the TAC beginning in 2012, the
Canberra-based commission said on its website.</P>
      <P>The CCSBT has agreed to reduce fishing of southern bluefin by an average of 20
percent this year and in 2011 from 11,810 metric tons to an average of 9,449
tons.</P>
      <P>A total of 90 representatives from the six members of CCSBT, three cooperating
non-members -- the Philippines, South Africa and the European Union -- and
several non-profit organizations are participating in the meeting.</P>
      <P>Participants will take part in a series of meetings from Oct. 9 to Oct. 14.</P>
      <P>Annual southern bluefin catches reached 80,000 tons in the 1960s. The commission
was set up in 1994 amid declining fish populations.</P>

      <P>The recent controversy surrounding the Ministry of the Interior's plan to
introduce absentee voting in the 2012 presidential election highlighted the
damage to a democratic society caused by extreme political confrontation.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry's plan, people who do not live in their hometowns will
be eligible to vote at a more convenient polling station. To reduce the chance
of vote-rigging, the ministry decided to exclude citizens living overseas and
not to adopt postal voting.</P>
      <P>Even so, the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has criticized the
plan, saying it will facilitate vote buying by the ruling Kuomintang to secure
President Ma Ying-jeou's re-election. The DPP's reaction demonstrates that it
has become a party that "opposes habitually."</P>
      <P>Absentee voting is an issue concerning the public's right to political
participation, and partisan interests should carry little weight. The DPP, which
hails human rights protection as one of its founding principles, has no reason
to oppose the policy. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 9, 2010)</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Saturday that he is willing to assume full
responsibility for the mistakes committed by the Kuomintang (KMT) in Taiwan in
the past, doing whatever it takes to dissolve hostilities.</P>
      <P>"No matter what position I am in, I am willing to be held accountable for the
past mistakes and suppression by the KMT rulers, such as the 228 Incident, " Ma
said at the 10th National Prayer Breakfast ahead of the 99th founding
anniversary of the Republic of China on Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>The 228 Incident refers to an anti-government uprising that began in February
1947 and led to a brutal crackdown by the then-Kuomintang government, widely
believed to have resulted in thousands of deaths.</P>
      <P>"Justice must be served to heal the wounds, " said the president, who also
serves as KMT chairman.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, Ma has repeatedly apologized for the White Terror -- a
crackdown on advocates of communism, Taiwan independence and democratic reforms
by the KMT in the 1950s and 1960s.</P>
      <P>"I found that family members of many victims have shown a new attitude  toward
me and toward this country after my sincere apologies," he said.</P>
      <P>National Security Council Secretary-General Hu Wei-jen, Control Yuan President
Wang Chien-shien and Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin were also present at the annual

    <TEXT>
      <P>The global exhibition and conference industry should prepare for the increasing
use of virtual meetings as the industry recovers from the global recession, a
specialist from Canada said at a forum in Taipei earlier this week.</P>
      <P>Barbara Maple,  the former president  of the International Association of
Congress Centres and now the head of a consultancy firm, said at a MICE
(meeting, incentive, convention and exhibition) forum on Thursday that the
industry had experienced many corporate meeting cancellations and delays in the
past two years due to the global economy.</P>
      <P>Although the world's economy is improving,  the convention industry will face a
threat from the continued use of virtual meetings to cut costs, and the industry
should turn virtual meetings into "an added value," Maple said.</P>
      <P>"Virtual meetings? Is this is a trend for future? It is certainly something much
more available now, " she told the audience in a keynote speech.</P>
      <P>She said Cisco Systems Inc. recently organized a successful virtual meeting for
several thousand employees, sparking concern over the fate of face-to-face
meetings.</P>
      <P>"Some will be concerned in our industry whether people will continue to meet,
continue to go to exhibitions because all this information is readily available
over the Internet, " she said. "We need to know how to engage (virtual meetings)
in our exhibitions and conferences, use them as an added value as opposed to an
alternative to what we do."</P>
      <P>Maple told the Central News Agency later in that day that meeting organizers
should make virtual meetings part of their services for clients.</P>
      <P>"We need to look at virtual meetings as an added value because you can
incorporate them into your program, " she said. "So you can use it for attendees
that maybe can't come to your exhibition. You can extend the value of that
meeting broadly by creating a virtual meeting."</P>
      <P>Maple also cited security as an issue that she said should not be seen as
"regional" because everyone could suffer from global security concerns.</P>
      <P>"Security right now is a concern in the United States because they have a direct
threat against them. But I believe that people worldwide, when they hear about
security, they start maybe (thinking) 'We won't travel, we won't go to such
large exhibitions, '" she told CNA.</P>
      <P>"So we globally need to think about that issue and try to look at security as a
worldwide problem that we all need to deal with, even though it may be happening
in one particular area right now, " she said.</P>
      <P>Her remarks came after U.S. authorities recently warned American travelers in
Europe of possible terrorist attacks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin on Saturday hailed the first trial day of the
Taipei International Flora Expo as a smashing success despite several complaints
reported by visitors.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference seven hours after the Yuanshan Park Area opened
its doors for a selected audience, Hau thanked the visitors for their candid
comments and asked for more feedback in the coming days.</P>
      <P>"The goal of the trial period is to find as many faults as possible so we can
resolve them before the grand opening on Nov. 6, and we were able to achieve
that goal today," Hau said.</P>
      <P>The expo began a 20-day trial period that runs until Oct. 28 in four phases,
covering each of the four exhibition areas one at a time.</P>
      <P>The organizing committee said the entire 91.8-hectare complex, which includes
Yuanshan Park, Fine Arts Park, Xinsheng Park and Dajia Riverside Park, will be
open to all visitors between Oct. 25 and Oct. 28.</P>
      <P>Hau said the number of visitors to Yuanshan Park Saturday was over 9,350 by 3:
00 p.m., far surpassing the original plan of 5,000. Many people came without
being invited, he said, blaming the media for giving out the wrong information.</P>
      <P>Earlier reports had said residents of two neighboring districts were welcome on
the first trial day, but Hau said organizers had not planned on them attending.</P>
      <P>Organizing director Chen Wen-hsiung urged the public not to come to the expo
uninvited until the last phase of the trial period.</P>
      <P>Two of the major wrinkles on Saturday were traffic congestion on Minzu East and
Minzu West roads, and two power outages in the morning.</P>
      <P>Many visitors complained about the lack of rest areas in the park as well as
insufficient garbage bins at the eatery area -- all of which Hau promised  would
be ironed  out before the official commencement early next month.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Government is aiming to attract at least 8 million visitors to
the six-month expo, which is being held in Taiwan for the first time.</P>

      <P>Liu was arrested in 2008 on charges of "inciting subversion of state power" for
co-authoring Charter 08, a manifesto calling for free elections, greater freedom
of expression and human rights. He was sentenced in 2009 to 11 years in prison.</P>
      <P>Ma said China should release Liu to show benevolence toward its people, and
should realize that freedom of speech is a very important foundation of modern
society.</P>
      <P>The president expressed hope that the Chinese leadership would fulfill its
promise for political reforms because they would be "highly significant" to all
Chinese people.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, Ma said, Taiwan has worked very hard to improve
relations and seek closer economic cooperation with China. The government hopes
that the two sides can also close gaps in other areas, such as freedom,
democracy, human rights and the rule of law, he added.</P>
      <P>In this sense, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, of which both
Taiwan and China are signatories, can serve as a common ground on which to bring
them together, Ma said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's largest air carrier said Saturday that the decision to offer discounted
cross-Taiwan Strait flights starting Sunday was voluntary and not a concession
to government pressure.</P>
      <P>China Airlines (CAL) told the Central News Agency that the cut was based on the
company's steadily improving performance following the 2008 economic downturn.</P>
      <P>"Since the first quarter of this year we have seen our revenue much higher than
expected, " said company spokesman Hamilton Liu.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that cross-strait flights have played a major role in generating
profits, Liu said the discount was initiated to pay back CAL customers.</P>
      <P>Starting Sunday, the fare for popular CAL routes such as Songshan-Hongqiao and
Taoyuan-Nanjing will fall to NT$9,500 (US$301) from NT$10,580 for roundtrip
tickets with a stay of up to 14 days.</P>
      <P>Currently, the carrier provides 61 roundtrip flights to 14 destinations in China
every week.</P>
      <P>The price cut comes amid public complaints that prices for direct cross-strait
flights are excessively high. The government has said it cannot intervene, but
launched what it called a "morality advice" campaign to persuade the carriers.</P>
      <P>"We have discussed the issue with the carriers five times since early this year,
" said Yeh Yung-ching, director of the air transport division of the Civil
Aeronautics Administration (CAA).</P>
      <P>What the government could do, he said, was use its position as the company's
biggest shareholder to urge the airline to lower fares, prompting other carriers
to follow suit.</P>
      <P>Two other major Taiwanese carriers, EVA Airways and TransAsia Airways,  said
earlier  this month they will cut cross-strait ticket prices from Sunday and
Oct. 26, respectively.</P>
      <P>As demand for direct cross-strait flights still greatly exceeds supply, both
carriers and the travel industry have said the best solution would be to allow
more flights, letting the market adjust itself.</P>
      <P>"We're limited to 370 flights a week, and you can't expect the fare to be
desirable in that case, " said Spicer Lee, a spokesman for the Taipei

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said in his National Day speech Sunday that while Taiwan
has achieved feats that were unprecedented in the global Chinese community,
comprehensive reform focusing on social justice was still necessary and would
continue.</P>
      <P>"We cannot put off reform for the sake of winning elections. Reform will not be
put aside for elections, " Ma told the country during the National Day
celebration ceremony. "I believe that only reform can secure our future, and
that by securing our future we can win people's hearts."</P>
      <P>Ma also announced that a human rights consultative committee, headed by Vice
President Vincent Siew, will soon be established under the Presidential Office
to monitor human rights development and publish a human rights report annually.</P>
      <P>The president said that Taiwan's democratization and economic development were
achievements never seen before in the global Chinese community but that plenty
remained to be done.</P>
      <P>With fewer than two years left in his four-year term, Ma said his main policy
focus in the future will be to promote  social, environmental and judicial
justice while also tending to economic growth in response to incidents that have
indicated the desperate need for reform.</P>
      <P>"Strategies for Taiwan's economic development will not focus exclusively on
growth, but must place equal importance on growth and fairness, " Ma said.
"Though we must pursue economic growth, it is even more important to protect our
environment and health."</P>
      <P>He promised to fight poverty, reduce unemployment, adopt fair tax regulations
and continue judicial and educational reforms as Taiwan has "begun a robust
economic recovery" from the global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>In cross-Taiwan Strait relations, President urged China to remove missiles
directed at Taiwan as soon as possible and reiterated his "mutual non-denial"
approach.</P>
      <P>Both sides belong to one Chinese community and engage in exchanges under the
basis of the "1992 consensus, " he said, also lauding 14 agreements he has
signed with China since his inauguration in May 2008, including an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA).</P>
      <P>In foreign relations, Ma said Taiwan has been able to rebuild its ties and
mutual trust with the United States as arm sales and negotiations under the
Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) have resumed.</P>
      <P>It has also established a special partner relationship with Japan, and was
granted visa-free treatment by countries including the United Kingdom, Ireland
and Fiji, among others, he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan intends to be an active participant in the international community as "a
peacemaker, a provider of humanitarian aid, a promoter of cultural ties, and as
a creator of new technologies and business opportunities," Ma said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The following is the full text of President Ma Ying-jeou's National Day address
titled "Reform, Innovation and the Pursuit of Justice."</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, Sao Tome and Principe President
Fradique Bandeira Melo de Menezes, Solomon Islands Prime Minister Danny Philip
and Mrs. Philip, Honorable Elizabeth F.Y. Renner, Speaker of the National
Assembly of the Republic of The Gambia, delegations from around the world,
members of the diplomatic corps in the ROC, Vice President Vincent C. Siew,
Presidents of the Five Yuan of the ROC,  distinguished guests, compatriots from
overseas,  fellow citizens,  journalists,  and friends watching television:</P>
      <P>Good morning to you all!</P>
      <P>The bond between the ROC and Taiwan</P>
      <P>Today we celebrate the grand occasion of the 99th National Day of the Republic
of China.  As we commemorate the sacrifices and contributions made by the
revolutionary idealists of yore to save a nation in peril, we are keenly aware
that we must dedicate ourselves to the historical mission of building on past
accomplishments to create a brighter future.</P>
      <P>The course of the ROC's development has been a winding path full of
difficulties. Everyone in Taiwan is both a participant in and a contributor to
that development. We have warded off Communist China s attempts at invasion and
ensured the security of Taiwan and the Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu islands; we have
striven energetically to progress, making it safely through several global
economic crises. On this piece of land we have toiled hard, instituting local
self-governance and universal education, building a strong national defense, and
creating the dual miracles of a prosperous economy and a democratic political
system. These are achievements unsurpassed in the Chinese-speaking world, for
which reason we are deeply proud of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Today, we continue to grow and develop on this land. We share a collective
destiny and embrace a common dream. We cherish Taiwan and identify with the
Republic of China. We wish the best for Taiwan and want the ROC to flourish.
Next year will mark the Republics centennial. Let us celebrate the birth of our
nation together and create for it a more resplendent second century.</P>
      <P>Doing what it takes to push reform</P>
      <P>My fellow citizens: Since the second rotation of power between political parties
two years ago, the most important missions of this administration have been
reform, innovation and the pursuit of justice. The isolationist policies and
corruption of the previous administration caused a great deal of damage to
Taiwan, so we must boldly pursue thoroughgoing reform without delay.</P>
      <P>Over the past two-plus years, this administration has pushed forward with a
number of groundbreaking reforms touching upon society, the economy, education,
environmental protection, national defense, cross-strait relations, and foreign
affairs. Our goal has been to improve Taiwan in every respectXto create a brand
new, more competitive Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taking governmental re-engineering as an example, we have acted to reduce the
executive branch from 37 to 29 Cabinet-level ministries and commissions. This is
a project that previous administrations over the past two decades wanted to do
but could not accomplish. We are accomplishing it.</P>
      <P>We have increased the number of our special municipalities to five by merging
and upgrading several counties and cities, and have scheduled elections for them
with the aim of achieving balanced development in northern,  central and
southern Taiwan, thereby enhancing the competitiveness  of cities and boosting
regional economies. This is another momentous reform that we have succeeded in
doing.</P>
      <P>Some say that promoting reform will offend vested interests and cost election
votes. I cannot go along with that way of thinking. Taiwan is now in a race
against time. We cannot put off reform for the sake of winning elections. Were
we to do so, we would let down our people as well as generations to come. We
have a well-informed public. I believe that only reform can secure our future,
and that by securing our future we can win peoples hearts.</P>
      <P>My fellow citizens: The world is changing rapidly. Taiwan must recognize the
importance of economic integration in the Asia-Pacific region and the economic
rise of mainland China. We certainly cannot afford to play the ostrich by
burying our heads in the sand.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years and more, we have improved cross-strait relations and
pushed for peace and prosperity while expanding our participation in
international affairs. The commencement of direct cross-strait flights and
visits by mainland Chinese tourists to Taiwan has coincided with resumption of
our participation in the World Health Assembly, from which we had been absent
for 38 years, and our accession to the Government Procurement Agreement of the
World Trade Organization after earlier bids to do so had failed for six years.
Further, in our relations with the United States we have re-established high-
level trust, resumed important arms purchases, and re-started talks on the Trade
and Investment Framework Agreement. As a special partner of Japan, we
established a new representative office in Sapporo last December and are
scheduled at the end of this month to inaugurate two-way flights between
Songshan Airport in Taipei and Haneda Airport in Tokyo. Elsewhere, travelers
with ROC passports now enjoy visa-free entry to the United Kingdom, Ireland, New
Zealand, and Fiji. The European Parliament, moreover, has adopted resolutions in
support of Taiwan on numerous occasions, and we have successfully advanced
substantive relations with other friendly nations.</P>
      <P>In addition, we have concluded 14 agreements with mainland China. Each one is
premised on the principles of parity, dignity and reciprocity, and puts Taiwan
first for the benefit of its people. Throughout this process, we have staunchly
defended the sovereignty and dignity of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Cross-Straits Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) that Taiwan
and mainland China inked this June came into force on September 12. It is the
most important cross-strait agreement in the past two years, a milestone in
economic cooperation between Taiwan and mainland China. We have not opened up to
mainland laborers or allowed additional agricultural import items but, instead,
have created more business and job opportunities for our agricultural sector as
well as our traditional  manufacturing  and service industries. The early
harvest provisions of the ECFA could generate fully 60,000 job opportunities and
NT$190 billion in business for Taiwan. This course of action puts us in position
to join in the process of Asia-Pacific regional economic integration. We have
averted  economic  marginalization   and  accelerated   the internationalization
of our economy.</P>
      <P>My fellow  citizens:  Our pragmatic  policies  in handling cross-strait
relations  and foreign  relations  have  won the international communitys strong
affirmation, and the efficacy of government reforms has begun to show. The
Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the Executive Yuan
has forecast that our economy will grow by 8.24% this year, among the best
performances in Asia. Of the worlds top 30 trading nations, we had the highest
import growth rate and the second-highest export growth rate in the first two
quarters of this year, demonstrating that we have begun a robust economic
recovery following a recession that lasted for over a year.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, the number of employed people has increased by 285,000, and
in August the unemployment rate dropped to 5.17%, the first time in 19 years
that it decreased in that month. The average salary has increased as well,
manifesting the growing vigor of our labor market.</P>
      <P>Thanks to our policies of liberalization and deregulation, Taiwan's
competitiveness has made great strides. In the 2010 World Competitiveness
Yearbook released in May by the Switzerland-based International Institute for
Management Development, Taiwan ranks as the eighth most competitive economy
among the 58 countries surveyed, up 15 notches from the previous year. This is
Taiwans best performance in the survey in 16 years, and we are confident of
doing still better in the future.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economic recovery is the fruit of the collective efforts of all its
people. This government has considerable room for improvement, however, in its
handling of various social and environmental problems as well as educational and
judicial reform issues. We must humbly listen to the voice of the people, and
strive constantly to do better. I will persist in pursuing reform and move
boldly forward in order not to betray the publics trust.</P>
      <P>Meeting public expectations with concrete action</P>
      <P>Issues  concerning  disparities  of  wealth,  environmental protection,
educational reform and judicial reform have recently become the focus of intense
public scrutiny. Here, I would like to stress that the core principle of this
administration is the imperative to build a just society, and I promise that
with regard to any issue pertaining to social justice, environmental justice or
judicial  integrity,  we will take active  steps to meet the expectations of our
people.</P>
      <P>Narrowing the wealth gap</P>
      <P>The wealth gap in Taiwan has been widening for the past decade, reflecting an
imbalance in wealth accumulation. Taiwans economy is making a rapid recovery, to
be sure, but if the fruits of economic development cannot be shared by all, what
is the point of economic growth, however fast it may be?</P>
      <P>The pursuit of economic growth, while important, is no more than a means to an
endXthe end being to build a just and prosperous society with egalitarian
distribution of wealth. I therefore wish to stress that,  from now on,
strategies for Taiwans economic development will not focus exclusively on
growth, but absolutely must place equal importance on growth and fairness. In
other words, as we boost economic growth, we must devise means to alleviate the
problems of unemployment and poverty.</P>
      <P>This government will do all in its power to adjust industrial structure,
increase employment opportunities, expand social welfare benefits, and look
after the needs of vulnerable groups. At the same time, we must also continue to
promote tax reform. Putting it simply, the government will definitely not sit
idly by and leave impoverished families with nowhere to turn to for help.
Wherever there is poverty, our government must give caring attention and extend
a helping hand.</P>
      <P>Balancing economic and environmental concerns</P>
      <P>My fellow citizens: Last years Typhoon Morakot disaster caused the loss of more
than 700 precious lives. This government has taken to heart the bitter lessons
of that experience. For over a year now, we have dedicated ourselves to post-
disaster reconstruction work and reorganization of disaster preparedness
systems. At the same time we have pushed for central and local government
agencies to carry out disaster preparedness and relief drills. We are working to
raise the level of vigilance at all levels of government and society in the hope
that tragedies of this nature will not recur.</P>
      <P>Last month as Typhoon Fanapi approached, our central government, armed forces,
police and fire departments, and local governments at all levels were fully
mobilized to prepare for disaster. To minimize the damage, they first evacuated
more than 16,000 people from risky areas. If the more than 100 people of Laiyi
Village in Pingtung County had not been evacuated in time, for example, there
may have been a replay of last years Xiaolin Village tragedy [in which hundreds
of lives were lost in a landslide]. This again demonstrates the  correctness  of
our strategy,  in the face  of extreme, ever-changing weather conditions, to
emphasize disaster preparedness over disaster relief,  and evacuation  over
other preparedness measures; to hope for the best, but prepare for the worst;
and to prepare for disasters in advance, deploy troops with an eye to disaster
preparedness, and ensure readiness for rescue operations.</P>
      <P>A number of issues have given rise to controversy over the question of
environmental protection versus economic development. Some of the more notable
disputes concern the Academia Sinica biotechnology park, the Central Taiwan
Science Park environmental impact assessment, and Kuokuang Petrochemical
Technology Companys development plans. From the perspective of our nations
sustainable development, equal importance should be placed on environmental
protection and economic growth. But in the event it is judged that economic
development will severely impact or damage the environment, environmental
protection should take priority. The severity of possible impacts or damage
should be determined by scientific, rational assessments. Though we must pursue
economic growth, it is even more important to protect our environment and
health.</P>
      <P>More comprehensive concern for our land is therefore essential. Priority must be
given to the restoration and preservation of environmentally sensitive areas,
including important agricultural land, mountain forests, wetlands, grasslands
and rivers, as well as of cultural heritage sites and scenic areas. At the same
time, we must improve the industrial structure as well as the current
environmental  impact assessment system,  incorporating them as essential
aspects of national land planning. With the goal of sustainable development of
the nations lands in mind, in the future this government must pay greater
attention to peoples opinions concerning the development or expropriation of
land, show greater concern for the land, and take a long-term perspective so as
to ensure sustainable development.</P>
      <P>Deepening educational reform</P>
      <P>My fellow citizens: Children are our hope for the future. I pledge to expedite
efforts to forge public consensus and create the necessary conditions to
institute 12-year compulsory education. First, we will start compulsory
education a year earlier so that all five-year-olds can attend kindergarten
tuition-free. We already began with offshore islands and remote areas this year,
and will expand the program next year to cover the whole nation.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, we absolutely must not neglect impoverished and disadvantaged
children.  Through  reallocation  of  educational resources,  we must revamp
learning environments that are not beneficial to them and help them acquire
effective knowledge and skills from their schools so they can rise above
poverty. We definitely must ensure that impoverished children have the same
opportunities as others to realize their lifes dreams.</P>
      <P>Spearheading participatory judicial reform</P>
      <P>Bribe taking by judges, the quality of court verdicts and the efficiency of
judicial processes have recently been the focus of sharp public criticism. We
believe that the judiciary must of course be independent, but it must not be
isolated from society or behave in a manner contrary to reasonable expectations
of the public. The judiciary must be able to protect law-abiding citizens. This
is the most fundamental standard of justice.</P>
      <P>Future judicial reform must be participatory in nature. It should be undertaken
from the perspective of ordinary people, with an understanding of what the
public expects of the judicial system, and with empathy for the suffering they
must undergo in the litigation process. A new Judicial Yuan president and vice
president have been installed.  Together  with  the minister  of justice  and
the prosecutor-general, who took office half a year ago, they constitute a new
judicial team. I am confident that this team will be responsive to public
expectations and play an active role in participatory judicial reform.</P>
      <P>Government  agencies will also work together to re-examine relevant regulations
and legal procedures, improve the quality of court verdicts, enhance efficiency,
and institute a friendly court environment. They will also expedite the passage
of a Judges Act and establish mechanisms for evaluating the performance of
judges and prosecutors, with an eye to keeping the good, eliminating the
corrupt, and re-establishing the publics trust.</P>
      <P>Our plan to establish an anti-corruption agency demonstrates our determination
to eliminate and prevent all manner of corruption. This administration is
committed to eradicating criminality. We absolutely will not compromise with the
forces of corruption.</P>
      <P>Human rights protections are another important aspect of judicial integrity. In
May of last year, we ratified two United Nations human rights covenantsXthe
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural RightsXand are now actively working to
amend any domestic laws and regulations that may run counter to the standards
set out therein. To further promote the development and protection of human
rights and basic freedoms, I hereby announce the establishment of a Human Rights
Consultative  Committee  under the Office of the President. Vice President Siew
will chair the committee, and is in charge of setting it up. The committee will
be composed of both public officials and private citizens, who will discuss and
develop human rights policies and issue regular human rights reports, so as to
raise the level of human rights in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Promoting  cross-strait  relations,  expanding  international participation</P>
      <P>Fellow citizens: We have recently seen great improvement in relations between
Taiwan and mainland China and a marked relaxation in cross-strait  tensions.
Mainland authorities  have recently mentioned the possibility of removal of
missiles aimed at Taiwan. We feel this has a positive significance for cross-
strait relations and hope that it becomes a reality as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Of course, our hopes for Taiwans security cannot rest solely upon improvements
in cross-strait relations. Thus,  it is our necessary and unchanging policy to
develop our independent military capabilities while continuing to import weapons
of a defensive nature that we cannot manufacture ourselves. We will also
continue to boost multilevel cross-strait economic, cultural and social ties,
building confidence and resolving differences, so as to maintain lasting peace
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China is a country with independent sovereignty. We conduct
relations with mainland China under the framework of the ROC Constitution and on
the basis of the1992 Consensus.Although at this stage the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait cannot accord de jure recognition to each other, we nevertheless
should be able to pragmatically adopt a policy of de factomutual non-denial.</P>
      <P>The people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are ethnic ChineseXdescendants
of the legendary emperors Yan and Huang.As the two sides pursue closer cross-
strait ties, we hope to also expand cooperation with mainland China in the
international sphere. We want to avoid antagonism and gradually develop a
virtuous cycle of mutually beneficial, win-win interaction.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a full democracy. Any agreement that we sign with the mainland must
receive public support, and is subject to parliamentary supervision. At the same
time, we will maintain the cross-strait status quo ofno unification, no
independence and no use of force under the framework of the ROC Constitution,
uphold the principle of putting Taiwan first for the benefit of its people,
safeguard the Republic of Chinas sovereignty, and maintain Taiwans dignity.</P>
      <P>In the future, we will continue to strengthen cooperation with all of our
diplomatic partners as well as other nations, including the United States,
Japan, countries in Southeast Asia, New Zealand, Australia and European Union
member states. We will actively seek to participate in international
organizations and their activities and, in the spirit of humanitarianism,
provide aid to developing partner countries. This administration is committed to
enhancing the ROCs international status and, with a pragmatic and flexible
approach, will actively work to sign free trade or economic cooperation
agreements with our trading partnersXall with the aim of building up Taiwan
while linking with the Asia-Pacific region and deploying globally.</P>
      <P>Here, I would like to stress that the ROC plays four roles in the world: first,
as a peacemaker; second, as a provider of humanitarian aid; third, as a promoter
of cultural ties; and fourth, as a creator of new technologies and business
opportunities. Though our territory is small,  our aspirations are ambitious. We
look forward to integrating with the world community. We are eager to take on
the challenges of globalization, and hope to make contributions to the
international community. We want to win respect for the ROC, and be the type of
country that stirs peoples hearts. Conclusion</P>
      <P>My fellow citizens: The people who live on this piece of earth have never meekly
bowed to fate. We have managed to grow amid adverse circumstances and, step by
step, realize the ideal of a democratic republic as envisioned by our founding
father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Looking to the future, we are full of confidence and
optimism!</P>
      <P>Democracy and freedom have come to define the spirit of Taiwan. A rich social
diversity has made Taiwans culture and lifestyle a benchmarkfor Chinese
communities around the world. Many of Taiwan s young people have become
international standouts in the areas of academics, sports, art, cuisine, design
and invention. We see embodied in them Taiwans potential, Taiwans confidence and
Taiwan s hope.</P>
      <P>Fellow citizens: The ROC centennial is just around the corner. The story of the
first century of the Republic opened against a background of social upheaval,
but our nation went on to record extraordinary achievements through peaceful
development. The ROCs second century will kick off with agolden decadeprelude.
Now, we begin to write a brand-new chapter.</P>
      <P>This is the responsibility we undertake in remembrance of our ancestors and
national martyrs, as well as our promise to our children and future generations!</P>
      <P>In closing, please join me in shouting: Long live the Republic of China! Long
live Taiwans democracy! Thank you.</P>

    <DATELINE>10/10/10  14:51:27
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Today, people in Taiwan observe the 99th National Day of the Republic of China
(ROC) -- the first democracy in Asia -- and in 82 days, the 100th year of the
country's founding will begin.</P>
      <P>Over the past century, the ROC has survived political and social turbulence
based on the mutual agitation of two key elements: the Chinese and democracy.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, the ROC's future fate hinges mainly on how well it gets along
with the Chinese across the strait and solves the cross-strait political
conundrum.</P>
      <P>Taiwan  is about to free itself  from the no-win  Taiwan independence dogma and
return to the of-the-people, by-the-people, and for-the-people discourse that
ROC founding father Sun Yat-sen espoused a century ago.</P>
      <P>In short, Taiwan would not fare well and cross-strait relations would hit a snag
if Taiwan alienates China. Cross-strait relations will see no light at the end
of the tunnel if both Taiwan and China deviate from the path of democracy.

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the Day -- President calls for release of Liu Xiaobo</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/10/10  15:11:13
(Oct. 10, 2010)

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou urged Chinese authorities Saturday to release jailed
human rights activist Liu Xiaobo, who was awarded the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize a
day earlier.</P>
      <P>"If Liu can be released, Taiwan would be very appreciative of China's move, " Ma
said at a gathering held in Taipei by the Overseas Compatriot Affairs Commission
for Taiwanese citizens returning for National Day celebrations.</P>
      <P>Opposition politicians criticized Ma for not calling for Liu's release sooner
after the Nobel Peace Prize winner was announced Friday.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of Ma's comments on the
subject: China Times:</P>
      <P>Ma said he believes all Chinese are happy to see Liu be awarded the prize,
describing it as not only an individual honor but one that represented the high
expectations of China.</P>
      <P>Ma also said that he was appealing for Liu's release based on four
considerations.</P>
      <P>First, he hoped China would follow the tradition of kingly rule in the East,
which is to exercise benevolent governance and to be kind to its people.</P>
      <P>Second, Ma noted that both sides have signed the International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights, which he said can serve as common ground on which the two sides
can encourage each other.</P>
      <P>Third, Chinese leaders have recently stressed political reforms on many
occasions, which Ma said was encouraging. He expressed his hope that Chinese
leaders would carry out the reforms, saying they are historically significant to
Chinese people.</P>
      <P>Finally, Ma said he has worked to improve cross-strait relations since his
inauguration in May 2008. A trade pact signed in June has removed trade barriers
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>After all of this, Ma said, he hoped, that both sides could begin to close the
gap in the areas of freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. (Oct.
10, 2010)</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>While the world community called for the release of Liu Xiaobo immediately after
the announcement of his being awarded the Nobel Peace Award Friday, President Ma
only congratulated Liu, and called for China to be lenient toward dissidents.</P>
      <P>After evading the issue for one day, Ma finally followed suit and called for
Liu's release.</P>
      <P>Kuan  Bi-ling,  caucus  whip of the opposition  Democratic Progressive (DPP) ,
said Ma has never had the courage to insist on what is right.</P>
      <P>"After the world condemned China, Ma was forced to join it to call for Liu's
release, but at the same time he lauded Chinese leaders' recent call for
political reforms, " Kuan said, contending that this showed an attitude of a
subordinate defending his boss.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui panned Ma for wavering and only acting after
watching what others do.</P>
      <P>While the world rejoiced over Liu's winning the award, why is there is still
"someone" in Taiwan who's not happy, Lee asked.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen expressed disappointment over Ma's delay.</P>
      <P>She said political reforms in China and progress in its human rights, freedom
and democracy can best ensure cross-strait peace. Without them, there cannot be
lasting cross-strait peace, she added.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>President Ma will announce the formation of a human rights advisory commission,
to be headed by Vice President Vincent Siew, in his National Day speech Sunday.</P>
      <P>The announcement should be seen as a response to Liu's winning the Nobel Peace
Prize.</P>
      <P>Liu was honored by the Norwegian Nobel Committee "for his long and non-violent
struggle for fundamental human rights in China." He became the first Chinese to
have won the award. (Oct. 10, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Another hand needed to rein in housing prices</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/10/10  15:46:12
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank has twice raised interest rates this year in an attempt to
curb skyrocketing housing prices. The measure, to our disappointment, has only
had a limited impact.</P>
      <P>If higher mortgage interest rates are the government's left hand, we need a
right hand -- changing the property tax system -- to help rein in soaring
housing prices.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will remain a paradise for property speculators as long as land and home
transactions are taxed based on government assessed values that are far lower
than the properties' actual values.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong authorities raised tax rates for luxury homes in July and China
announced in September that property owners in some cities will be assessed
taxes on the homes they own.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Taiwan's government has appeared unresponsive and inactive. The
once much-ballyhooed idea of a luxury home tax has disappeared  from view as the
administration  remained on the sidelines.</P>
      <P>The government must reform the property tax system, especially the excessively
low base values on which taxes are assessed. For the 6.1 million cars in use in
Taiwan, drivers have paid NT$51.3 billion in license taxes this year, but the
owners of the country's 9.2 million homes, including luxury homes, contribute
only NT$56.6 billion in property taxes annually.</P>
      <P>In short, Taiwan's people pay an average of NT$8,409 in license tax per vehicle
but only NT$6,152 in property tax per home.</P>
      <P>Prohibitively high housing prices have been the top complaint of Taiwan's people
for a long time, and in the capital of Taipei, the average cost of a home is
10.87 times the annual income of the average buyer.</P>
      <P>The administration should not pretend not to notice the situation any longer. It
should move now to change the country's property tax system, which is skewed in
favor of the wealthy. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 10, 2010)</P>

      <P>The National Day celebration parade marking the 99th anniversary of the Republic
of China (ROC) on Sunday entertained hundreds of thousands of spectators from
home and abroad with an unusually wide array of performances and floats.</P>
      <P>The grand parade, organized by Council for Cultural Affairs and the Centenary

35 decorative floats sponsored by the government and private companies, 20
performance troupes, honor guards and high school bands, and larger-than-life
inflatables.</P>

      <P>Many of those who did show up found the experience enjoyable.</P>
      <P>"This parade has made my trip more interesting and worthwhile, " said an Irish
tourist surnamed Toolan, who was visiting Taiwan for the first time.</P>
      <P>He was especially impressed with the parade's inflatable figures dressed in
traditional costumes of different ethnic groups. "Those here are definitely
bigger compared to those in Ireland," he said.</P>
      <P>Children at Liberty Square were equally thrilled to see other huge inflatables
of different sizes and styles. Asked what she liked best about the parade, a
little girl surnamed Lo answered without hesitation, "the colorful four-headed
dragons over there."</P>
      <P>For Sandra Tschauner and Martina Spitzhuettl, two German women who came to
Taiwan from Hong Kong, the parade was like a cultural festival that highlighted
different facets of the country.</P>
      <P>"If given the chance, we will come back next year, " said Tschauner, as the two
waved Taiwanese flag in their hands.</P>
      <P>Two lamas traveling from Nepal to Taiwan for religious purposes said everything
about the parade was wonderful.</P>
      <P>"We especially liked the confetti coming down from the skies; it's like
fireworks," one said.</P>
      <P>The parade started from National Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall at 2 p.m. and
proceeded 4.8 kilometers along Renai Road before reaching its final point, the
National Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, at 6 p.m.</P>
      <P>The parade is one of the first in a series of events to keep Taiwan in a festive
mood in welcoming the coming of the ROC's centenary year, the organizers said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's announcement Sunday to establish a human rights
committee under the Presidential Office has drawn mixed reactions from the
ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Ma pledged in his National Day address to set up a Human Rights Consultative
Committee under the Office of the President, with Vice President Vincent Siew
acting as its convener.</P>
      <P>The committee will be composed of both public officials and private citizens,
who will discuss and develop human rights policies and issue regular human
rights reports to raise the level of human rights in Taiwan, the president said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the plan, ruling Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Wu Yu-sheng  said the
former Democratic  Progressive  Party (DPP) administration had paid only lip
service to similar initiatives.</P>
      <P>The  president's  announcement,  however,  underscored  the administration's
resolve to address human rights issues with tangible actions, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Another KMT lawmaker, Justin Chou, called the announcement a timely response to
Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo winning the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, at a time
when Taiwan continues to improve its relations with China.</P>
      <P>"President Ma's plan is also tantamount to calling for efforts to spur China's
human rights development, using Taiwan's edge in freedom, democracy and human
rights," Chou said.</P>
      <P>The opposition DPP was less impressed by the initiative, seeing it as a
political ploy.</P>
      <P>DPP Chairwoman  Tsai  Ing-wen  labeled  Ma's Human  Rights Consultative
Committee plan as an "improvisation" drafted hastily after news emerged that Liu
had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the president put forth the plan after he was accused of condoning the
Chinese government's actions by keeping silent while "important global leaders
all" urged Beijing to release Liu, a dissident currently sitting behind bars in
China.</P>
      <P>"If he really cared about the human rights issue, Ma should have established the
committee in his inaugural year," she contended.</P>
      <P>Also scoffing at the president's announcement, DPP legislative caucus whip Ker
Chien-ming accused Ma of toying with the country's people over serious human
rights issues.</P>
      <P>Ker said the administration has not submitted any proposal to the Legislative
Yuan for concrete action on the issue since Taiwan ratified  two United Nations
human rights covenants  --  the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
-- in May of last year.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese human rights groups urged Beijing on Sunday to release immediately and
unconditionally jailed human rights activist Liu Xiaobo, who was announced as
the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Friday.</P>
      <P>The rights activist groups, including the Humanistic Education Foundation and
the Homemaker's Union and Foundation, issued a joint statement at a press
conference that called on Beijing to end its "savage" behavior against human
rights advocates and political dissidents once and for all.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities should take concrete measures to improve human rights in
China and build up a free and democratic system in the country, including
ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) that
was adopted by the United Nations in 1960, the statement said.</P>
      <P>"President Ma Ying-jeou should also publicly ask Beijing to ratify the U.N.
charter on human rights quickly," it said.</P>
      <P>The groups also pushed for human rights protection measures and methods ensuring
the safety of Taiwanese people visiting or doing business in China to be
included in the investment guarantee agreement that Taiwan and China are
currently negotiating.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the statement offered an invitation to Liu to visit Taiwan once he is
freed, and it asked the president to also make known his stance on welcoming Liu
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih Ying, chairman of the Humanistic Education Foundation, said it was
regrettable that Ma had not called for Liu's release in "real time."</P>
      <P>The president urged Chinese authorities Saturday to release the jailed Chinese
dissident, one day after he was named the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.</P>
      <P>Liu was arrested in 2008 on charges of "inciting subversion of state power" for
co-authoring Charter 08, a manifesto calling for free elections, greater freedom
of expression and human rights. He was sentenced in 2009 to 11 years in prison.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Once the world's fifth ranked women's doubles player, Chuang Chia-jung has
struggled this year to find the same level of success she achieved with partner
Chan Yung-jan in 2007 and 2008 to achieve her lofty status.</P>
      <P>Currently ranked 42nd in the world, Chuang had posted an 18-19 record with eight
different partners and reached only two women's doubles finals in 2010 prior to
this week's women's tour event in Beijing.</P>
      <P>But early Sunday  morning,  Chuang  scored  a long-awaited breakthrough, teaming
with Olga Govortsova of Belarus to beat the top-seeded duo of Gisela Dulko of
Argentina and Flavia Pennetta of Italy 7-6 (2), 1-6, 10-7 in one hour and 44
minutes to win the China Open.</P>
      <P>In the first set of the match, which started late Saturday night, the two teams
exchanged service breaks before Chuang and Govortsova took command in the
tiebreaker.</P>
      <P>But Chuang and her partner seemed listless in losing the second set, only to
regain their aggressiveness in the decisive first-to-10 super tiebreaker.</P>
      <P>Chuang and Govortsova won US$266,000 for taking the title, which also will
likely propel Chuang back into the top 30 in the women's doubles rankings.</P>
      <P>The victory was anything but a fluke. Chuang and her partner also eliminated the
tournament's fourth seeds Vania King of the United States and Yaroslava Shvedova
of Kazakhstan 7-6 (5) , 6-2 in the semifinals and second seeds Czech Kveta
Peschke and Slovak Katarina Srebotnik 4-6, 6-3, 10-3 in the quarterfinals.</P>
      <P>King and Shvedova won both the Wimbledon and U.S. Open women's doubles this
year.</P>
      <P>Chuang's only other doubles title this year came in Hobart in January paired
with Peschke.</P>
      <P>She and Govortsova had played in eight consecutive events together prior to
Beijing, with an unimpressive 5-8 match record.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's decision not to call for the release of Chinese
dissident Liu Xiaobo immediately after Liu was announced the winner of this
year's Nobel Peace Prize Friday was based on careful thought, Presidential
Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The award had historical significance in China and the Chinese world, and
President Ma thought any statement on the matter should be made cautiously,
according to Lo.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said Ma wanted to choose an appropriate public venue on Oct. 9 to
comment further on the matter after releasing a statement on Liu's award a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>The president on Saturday urged China to free Liu as soon as possible and called
on Chinese leaders to push for political reforms. He also expressed the hope
that China could follow Chinese cultural tradition under which ordinary people
are treated "kindly."</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, however, criticized Ma for not
immediately calling for Liu's release after the Chinese human rights activist
was announced as the Nobel Peace Prize winner.</P>
      <P>In response, Lo said that a series of statements issued by Ma reflected his
consistent stance on human rights. The president, for example, urged China to be
lenient toward dissidents in a statement issued on June 4 to mark the June 4,
1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office then reiterated the stance in a statement on Oct. 8
congratulating Liu for winning this year's Nobel Peace Prize for promoting human
rights in China, Lo said.</P>
      <P>The Oct. 8 statement, Lo said, also gave China a reason to free Liu.</P>
      <P>"If (China) can make more progress and breakthroughs on human right issues, it
would help achieve its goal of a peaceful rise and win the recognition of people
in Taiwan and the international community," Lo said.</P>
      <P>The statement was followed by a call for Liu's release by Ma personally at a
gathering in Taipei held Saturday as a warm-up to Sunday's National Day
celebrations.</P>

      <P>XtraLab Design, a Taiwan-based design company, formally opened an art gallery
Sunday to showcase its new interactive technology that it says will create
innovative art forms and make it easier to operate consumer-oriented businesses.</P>
      <P>One of the applications of the new technology on display was the use of a
restaurant menu on an iPad in the gallery's coffee shop, a feature which XtraLab
believes will bring people closer to commercial products or works of art.</P>
      <P>XtraLab's iPad application for its coffee shop allows customers to preview their
orders with pictures or written introductions seen on the tablet computer.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the iPad application will attract people to visit our gallery to
experience other interactive devices that combine different fields of art, "
said XtraLab General Manager Frankie Fan at the gallery's opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Another example of the interactive technology is a "water table" in the main
gallery that produces virtual creations similar to traditional Chinese ink
paintings.</P>
      <P>A projector is used to create colorful images in water, guided by an infrared
sensor that detects hand movements as people touch the water's surface.</P>
      <P>The company, in cooperation with modern Chinese painter Liu Kuo-sung, is
scheduled to demonstrate the digitized  art in an exhibition opening at the
Taipei Fine Arts Museum on Oct. 16.</P>
      <P>Another infrared technology on display at the gallery transforms a song into
animations, such as a cat's walk or piano keys, that react to one's gestures or
movements.</P>
      <P>When asked about the prospects for the development of the interactive technology
in the Asian market, Fan said Taiwan is more favorably positioned than other
countries XtraLab has done business with, including China and Singapore.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has better opportunities in the sector because it is good at integrating
related technologies and talent," Fan said.</P>
      <P>"We hope this place is not only a gallery or a coffee shop, but also a
laboratory or an exchange platform where one can explore new digital art
concepts in Taiwan," he said.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese human rights groups urged Beijing on Sunday to release immediately and
unconditionally jailed human rights activist Liu Xiaobo, who was announced as
the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize winner Friday.</P>
      <P>The rights activist groups, including the Humanistic Education Foundation and
the Homemaker's Union and Foundation, issued a joint statement at a press
conference that called on Beijing to end its "savage" behavior against human
rights advocates and political dissidents once and for all.</P>
      <P>The Chinese authorities should take concrete measures to improve human rights in
China and build up a free and democratic system in the country, including
ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) that
was adopted by the United Nations in 1960, the statement said.</P>
      <P>"President Ma Ying-jeou should also publicly ask Beijing to ratify the U.N.
charter on human rights quickly," it said.</P>
      <P>The groups also pushed for human rights protection measures and methods ensuring
the safety of Taiwanese people visiting or doing business in China to be
included in the investment guarantee agreement that Taiwan and China are
currently negotiating.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the statement offered an invitation to Liu to visit Taiwan once he is
freed, and it asked the president to also make known his stance on welcoming Liu
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shih Ying, chairman of the Humanistic Education Foundation, said it was
regrettable that Ma had not called for Liu's release in "real time."</P>
      <P>The president urged Chinese authorities Saturday to release the jailed Chinese
dissident, one day after he was named the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize.</P>
      <P>Liu was arrested in 2008 on charges of "inciting subversion of state power" for
co-authoring Charter 08, a manifesto calling for free elections, greater freedom
of expression and human rights. He was sentenced in 2009 to 11 years in prison.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Once the world's fifth ranked women's doubles player, Chuang Chia-jung has
struggled this year to find the same level of success she achieved with partner
Chan Yung-jan in 2007 and 2008 to achieve her lofty status.</P>
      <P>Currently ranked 42nd in the world, Chuang had posted an 18-19 record with eight
different partners and reached only two women's doubles finals in 2010 prior to
this week's women's tour event in Beijing.</P>
      <P>But early Sunday  morning,  Chuang  scored  a long-awaited breakthrough, teaming
with Olga Govortsova of Belarus to beat the top-seeded duo of Gisela Dulko of
Argentina and Flavia Pennetta of Italy 7-6 (2), 1-6, 10-7 in one hour and 44
minutes to win the China Open.</P>
      <P>In the first set of the match, which started late Saturday night, the two teams
exchanged service breaks before Chuang and Govortsova took command in the
tiebreaker.</P>
      <P>But Chuang and her partner seemed listless in losing the second set, only to
regain their aggressiveness in the decisive first-to-10 super tiebreaker.</P>
      <P>Chuang and Govortsova won US$266,000 for taking the title, which also will
likely propel Chuang back into the top 30 in the women's doubles rankings.</P>
      <P>The victory was anything but a fluke. Chuang and her partner also eliminated the
tournament's fourth seeds Vania King of the United States and Yaroslava Shvedova
of Kazakhstan 7-6 (5) , 6-2 in the semifinals and second seeds Czech Kveta
Peschke and Slovak Katarina Srebotnik 4-6, 6-3, 10-3 in the quarterfinals.</P>
      <P>King and Shvedova won both the Wimbledon and U.S. Open women's doubles this
year.</P>
      <P>Chuang's only other doubles title this year came in Hobart in January paired
with Peschke.</P>
      <P>She and Govortsova had played in eight consecutive events together prior to
Beijing, with an unimpressive 5-8 match record.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou's decision not to call for the release of Chinese
dissident Liu Xiaobo immediately after Liu was announced the winner of this
year's Nobel Peace Prize Friday was based on careful thought, Presidential
Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>The award had historical significance in China and the Chinese world, and
President Ma thought any statement on the matter should be made cautiously,
according to Lo.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said Ma wanted to choose an appropriate public venue on Oct. 9 to
comment further on the matter after releasing a statement on Liu's award a day
earlier.</P>
      <P>The president on Saturday urged China to free Liu as soon as possible and called
on Chinese leaders to push for political reforms. He also expressed the hope
that China could follow Chinese cultural tradition under which ordinary people
are treated "kindly."</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party, however, criticized Ma for not
immediately calling for Liu's release after the Chinese human rights activist
was announced as the Nobel Peace Prize winner.</P>
      <P>In response, Lo said that a series of statements issued by Ma reflected his
consistent stance on human rights. The president, for example, urged China to be
lenient toward dissidents in a statement issued on June 4 to mark the June 4,
1989 Tiananmen Square Massacre.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office then reiterated the stance in a statement on Oct. 8
congratulating Liu for winning this year's Nobel Peace Prize for promoting human
rights in China, Lo said.</P>
      <P>The Oct. 8 statement, Lo said, also gave China a reason to free Liu.</P>
      <P>"If (China) can make more progress and breakthroughs on human right issues, it
would help achieve its goal of a peaceful rise and win the recognition of people
in Taiwan and the international community," Lo said.</P>
      <P>The statement was followed by a call for Liu's release by Ma personally at a
gathering in Taipei held Saturday as a warm-up to Sunday's National Day
celebrations.</P>

      <P>XtraLab Design, a Taiwan-based design company, formally opened an art gallery
Sunday to showcase its new interactive technology that it says will create
innovative art forms and make it easier to operate consumer-oriented businesses.</P>
      <P>One of the applications of the new technology on display was the use of a
restaurant menu on an iPad in the gallery's coffee shop, a feature which XtraLab
believes will bring people closer to commercial products or works of art.</P>
      <P>XtraLab's iPad application for its coffee shop allows customers to preview their
orders with pictures or written introductions seen on the tablet computer.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the iPad application will attract people to visit our gallery to
experience other interactive devices that combine different fields of art, "
said XtraLab General Manager Frankie Fan at the gallery's opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Another example of the interactive technology is a "water table" in the main
gallery that produces virtual creations similar to traditional Chinese ink
paintings.</P>
      <P>A projector is used to create colorful images in water, guided by an infrared
sensor that detects hand movements as people touch the water's surface.</P>
      <P>The company, in cooperation with modern Chinese painter Liu Kuo-sung, is
scheduled to demonstrate the digitized  art in an exhibition opening at the
Taipei Fine Arts Museum on Oct. 16.</P>
      <P>Another infrared technology on display at the gallery transforms a song into
animations, such as a cat's walk or piano keys, that react to one's gestures or
movements.</P>
      <P>When asked about the prospects for the development of the interactive technology
in the Asian market, Fan said Taiwan is more favorably positioned than other
countries XtraLab has done business with, including China and Singapore.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan has better opportunities in the sector because it is good at integrating
related technologies and talent," Fan said.</P>
      <P>"We hope this place is not only a gallery or a coffee shop, but also a
laboratory or an exchange platform where one can explore new digital art
concepts in Taiwan," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- President urges China to remove missiles soon</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/11/10  12:20:56
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou on Sunday used his Double Ten National Day address to
call for China to remove its more than 1,000 missiles targeting Taiwan as early
as possible.</P>
      <P>"The mainland authorities have recently mentioned the possibility of removing
missiles. We think it bears a positive significance for cross-strait ties and
hope that it will become a reality as soon as possible," Ma said in his address.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Ma was referring to remarks made by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in New York in
late September. During a meeting with the media, Wen mentioned the possibility
of the missile problem being resolved at some point.</P>
      <P>Government sources said Ma deliberately used his National Day address to
recognize Wen's statements as a positive development in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Ma was "delivering a message" to Chinese authorities, the sources said.</P>
      <P>In his National  Day speech at a rally in front of the Presidential Office, Ma
stressed that Taiwan conducts cross-strait engagements "under the framework of
the Republic of China (ROC) Constitution and on the basis of the '1992
consensus.'"</P>
      <P>"Although at this stage the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can not accord de
jure recognition to each other, we should nevertheless adopt a pragmatic policy
of de facto ' mutual non-denial,'" Ma said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out the common cultural origin shared by the people on the two sides of
the strait, Ma called on China to "avoid antagonism" and to develop a "virtuous
cycle of mutually beneficial, win-win interaction" with Taiwan. (Oct. 11, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Ma said in his National Day address that cross-strait relations have improved
significantly and tensions across the strait have eased substantially since he
took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>He said, however, that Taiwan could not hinge its security solely on cross-
strait detente, and that it is necessary for Taiwan to continue beefing up its
defense capabilities by procuring advanced defensive weapons that the country
cannot manufacture itself.</P>
      <P>"We will also continue to boost multilevel cross-strait economic, cultural  and
social ties,  building confidence  and resolving differences, so as to maintain
lasting peace across the Taiwan Strait," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the ROC is a sovereign state, Ma said the country hopes to expand
cooperation with mainland China in the international sphere.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is a full democracy. Any agreement that we sign with the mainland must
receive public support, and is subject to parliamentary supervision. At the same
time, we will maintain the cross-strait status quo of 'no unification, no
independence and no use of force' under the framework of the ROC Constitution,
uphold the principle of putting Taiwan first for the benefit of its people,
safeguard the Republic of China's sovereignty, and maintain Taiwan's dignity.</P>
      <P>"In the future, we will continue to strengthen cooperation with all of our
diplomatic partners as well as other nations, including the United States,
Japan, countries in Southeast Asia, New Zealand, Australia and European Union
member states. We will actively seek to participate in international
organizations and their activities and, in the spirit of humanitarianism,
provide aid to developing partner countries," Ma said in the address. (Oct. 11,
2010).</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank said Monday it expects to
open a branch in Vietnam by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The bank said it has obtained a green light from Vietnamese authorities to
upgrade its representative office in Bien Hoa City, the capital of Dong Nai
Province in southern Vietnam, into a branch.</P>
      <P>The bank's Bien Hoa office was established in March 2006. It will become the
bank's second overseas branch after its Hong Kong branch opened in June 2008.</P>
      <P>"Dong Nai Province is Vietnam's industrial zone, where many Taiwanese investors
have set up production facilities. We look forward to providing services to
them," a bank spokeswoman said.</P>
      <P>The bank said the Dong Nai branch will specialize in corporate banking services,
providing Taiwanese firms there with deposit, remittance, currency exchange,
trade financing and fund management services.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman said that the Dong Nai branch is expected to serve Taiwanese
investors in Ho Chi Minh City and its neighboring Binh Duong Province.</P>
      <P>Among the Taiwanese firms that operate in the Vietnamese province are Formosa
Plastics Group, Tainan Spinning Co., Optical storage media firm Ritek Corp. and
Cheng Shin Rubber Industry Co., according to the bank.</P>
      <P>As of the end of August, Taiwan had invested a total of US$2.78 billion in
Vietnam.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior has outlined a plan to offer people not living in
their hometowns a chance to cast their ballots in the 2012 presidential
election, allowing them to vote at a polling station close to where they work,
study or serve in the military.</P>
      <P>It is a progressive measure that protects people's rights to political
participation. Despite the fact the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) advocates democracy and progressiveness, it is against the plan, which it
said was an attempt by the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) to "gather and control"
military votes.</P>
      <P>It is not a proper reason to oppose a system that can not just save millions of
people the trouble and money needed to return to their hometowns to cast
ballots, but also increase the public's political participation.</P>
      <P>Why would the DPP oppose an absentee voting system that has been implemented in
other advanced democratic countries for dozens of years? It is assumed that the
party does not want more KMT supporters to have the opportunity to vote, while
the DPP can only secure the votes of grassroots supporters who tend to stay in
their hometowns.</P>
      <P>It is pathetic for a political party to build its dream for power on
restrictions against people's right to political participation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan will continue to lead foundry business: UMC ex-chief</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 11 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Robert Tsao, the former chairman of United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , said
Monday that he expects Taiwan's technology lead in the global foundry business
will not be swayed in the short term.</P>
      <P>Tsao, who currently serves as UMC's honorary chairman, said that although Taiwan
faces fierce competition from South Korea's Samsung Electronics and U.S.-based
GlobalFoundries, Taiwan's better product quality and higher production
efficiency will help it maintain the lead.</P>
      <P>Market analysts said Samsung and GlobalFoundries are making massive investments
this year in an attempt to challenge UMC and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. (TSMC).</P>
      <P>"Production quality and efficiency are the most important factors in the global
foundry business, " Tsao said in an interview with the Central News Agency.</P>
      <P>"The money to expand production capacity is not the only decisive factor. I do
not think Taiwan's status will be easily challenged in the short term," Tsao
said.</P>
      <P>TSMC and UMC are the top two contract chip makers in the world.</P>
      <P>Samsung's capital expenditure for 2010 is expected to total 1.8 trillion South
Korean won (US$1.59 billion) , 1.1 trillion won of which will be used for
semiconductor production.</P>
      <P>For its part, GlobalFoundries is investing US$2.7 billion in capital expenditure
for 2010.</P>
      <P>Tsao said that GlobalFoundries will largely expand its production capacity in
the U.S., rather than in its Asian complex in Singapore, and that he doubts the
U.S. production facilities will be efficient enough to compete with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Riding a recovery in the global high-tech sector, TSMC has raised its 2010
capacity expenditure to US$5.9 billion from US$4.8 billion, while UMC has hiked
its spending to US$1.8 billion from the previous range of US$1.2 billion to
US$1.5 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsao said Taiwan's foundry sector should pay more attention to
technology innovation.</P>
      <P>Only innovation to upgrade production technology will boost profit margins as
the foundry business encounters rising pressure on its bottom line to cut
prices, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government has listed a budget of NT$66 billion (US$2.15 billion) to repay
some of the national debt next year, more than the minimum debt repayment
requirement, which is estimated at NT$57.6 billion for 2011, the minister of
finance said Monday.</P>
      <P>The move shows "the government's determination to reduce the degree of state
debt accumulation, " said Lee Sush-der. The minimum debt payment requirement is
based on the criteria of 5 percent of the annual tax revenues paid to the
government, which is estimated at NT$1.16 trillion for 2011.</P>
      <P>In a report on the general budget plan for 2011 at the Legislative Yuan, Lee
told lawmakers that the NT$66 billion will all be used to repay the debt
principal.</P>
      <P>Lee noted that in the 2011 budget plan, government borrowing has been limited to
a total of NT$225 billion to fund the general budget, less than the liability
ceiling of NT$268.4 billion.</P>
      <P>An additional NT$204 billion will be raised to finance next year's special
budgets for flood control and other infrastructure projects, bringing the total
national debt to an estimated NT$4.96 trillion in 2011.</P>
      <P>The amount is still within the debt allowance of 40 percent of the mean of the
Gross National Products in 2010, 2009 and 2008, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Also at the Legislative Yuan, Council for Economic Planning and Development
Chairwoman Christina Liu reported that the council has listed the special budget
for public construction projects in 2011 at NT$159.74 billion.</P>
      <P>The projects are expected to increase the Gross Domestic Product next year by
0.88 percent and create 51,000-64,000 jobs, she said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.81 percent Monday in thin trade as investors
took profits, eroding early gains despite the strong end of last week on Wall
Street, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 67.43 points to 8,176.76, after moving between 8,165.20
and 8,277.78, on turnover of NT$95.85 billion (US$3.11 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.41 percent and reached the day's high on the back of Wall
Street's gains, but pressure emerged to reverse the upside after the index moved
near technical resistance at around 8,300 points, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,713 stocks closed down and 1,053 up, with 273 stocks remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The construction sector suffered the heaviest selling, down 2.19 percent. Cement
stocks lost 1.51 percent, plastics and chemical shares fell 1.2 percent,
financials shed 1.14 percent, and paper and pulp stocks closed down 0.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The foodstuff sector fell 0.82 percent and the machinery and electronics sector
dropped 0.49 percent, while the textile sector rose 0.4 percent.</P>
      <P>"The reduced turnover showed many investors preferred to keep cash at the
moment, waiting for incentives to trade after recent strong gains, " said Mega
Securities analyst Alex Huang, referring to upcoming third quarter corporate
earnings reports in the U.S. and in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Although Wall Street stood above the key 11,000 point level Friday,  investors
remained cautious about the global economic climate," Huang said.  "Rising fears
about a major pullback in the U.S. market have discouraged investors here to buy
at the moment."</P>
      <P>Huang said that the technical hurdles remained high ahead of 8,300 points,
adding that the relatively small trading volume recently has made it hard for
the market to overcome the barriers.</P>
      <P>In the construction sector, Prince Housing lost 3.80 percent to NT$24.05 and
Kindom Construction fell 3.18 percent to NT$27.40.</P>
      <P>Among high-tech stocks, flat panel maker AU Optronics closed down 1.30 percent
at NT$30.30 and rival Chimei Innolux fell 2.43 percent to NT$40.05.</P>

    <DATELINE>10/11/10  16:36:04
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Western countries have long been hoping that China's phenomenal economic growth
over the past three decades will lead to the development of Western-style
democracy in that country.</P>
      <P>Beijing's hysterical reaction to the Norwegian Nobel Committee's decision to
award the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize to imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo,
however, has proved that such an assumption could be wishful thinking and
hopelessly unrealistic.</P>
      <P>When China began its "reform and opening" measures in 1978, its leaders clearly
stated that they would adhere to the tenets of "socialism  with Chinese
characteristics, " while easing some restrictions in the economic field as part
of efforts to transform the country's stagnant, impoverished planned economy
into a market economy capable of generating strong economic growth.</P>
      <P>Banking on Western technology,  capital and market economy concepts, China has
emerged as a new economic powerhouse. However, it has not made any of the
political progress hoped for by Western countries.</P>
      <P>Ever since the communist leadership sent in the military to crush the Tiananmen
Square democracy movement in 1989, setting back the regime's relations with its
people, the Chinese government has merely been trying to promote nationalism as
a unifier rather than making any positive responses to calls for political
reform.</P>
      <P>The house arrest of the reform-minded late Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang and the
imprisonment of Liu Xiaobo and other pro-democracy activists  should serve as
wake-up call for those who harbor unrealistic expectations about China's
democratization. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 11, 2010).</P>

      <P>Three trade shows highlighting electronics and communication technologies opened
in Taipei Monday and are expected to attract more than 70,000 visitors,
organizers said.</P>
      <P>The 36th Taipei International Electronics Show (Taitronics), the fourth Taiwan
International RFID Applications Show and the third Broadband Taiwan will feature
a total of 800 local and foreign exhibitors, the Taiwan External Trade
Development Council (TAITRA) said in a statement.</P>
      <P>This year marks the second time the three shows will be held together, after a

for professionals only. The fairs will open to the public on Oct. 13-14.</P>
      <P>Wayne Wu, vice chairman of the semi-official TAITRA, said that Taiwan ranked
sixth globally and second in Asia in a study on competitiveness in green
technologies. The study was released in July by the International  Institute for
Management Development  in Lausanne, Switzerland.</P>

have an annual business volume exceeding US$50 million, including companies from
Japan, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Mexico and Ukraine, to help Taiwanese
vendors increase their exports.</P>
      <P>The total output of Taiwan's electronics industry amounted to US$177.3 billion

in Taiwan, said Shulin Mayor Chen Shih-jung.</P>

categories including geography, politics, economics, development, education,
culture, religion and people.</P>
      <P>The Shulin City Office has spent nearly two years editing the chronicles and
gathering precious historical photos of aspects of city life such as coal mining
and wine making, which were the city's major industries in the past, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The city's famous sons noted in the chronicles include Sung Ching-hung, who has
been coaching taekwondo for more than 28 years and his son Sung Yu-ling, who won

    <DATELINE>10/11/10  18:05:42
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With its huge foreign exchange reserves, the Central Bank of the Republic of
China (CBC) has managed to make the New Taiwan dollar's value close at below
NT$31 against the greenback, no matter how high it had appreciated during the
daily trading amid growing hot money inflow over the past week.</P>
      <P>The central bank's repeated late-session interventions seem to prove the
existence of the so-called "Perng Fai-nan barrier, " which means the CBC will do
whatever it can to prevent the local currency's exchange rate from surging past
the NT$31 to the U.S. dollar level projected by CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan.</P>
      <P>The CBC's market operations have made it difficult for local commercial banks to
determine their currency exchange rates at the opening of daily trading because
the closing rate no longer reflects the average level of the New Taiwan dollar's
exchange rates against the greenback in the previous trading session.</P>
      <P>More worrisome is that the CBC's action might prove ineffective in stabilizing
the local unit's exchange rate amid the current global liquidity overflows
fueled by the U.S. Fed's and the European Central Bank's quantitative easing of
their monetary policies.</P>
      <P>The central bank should now explain the significance  and necessity of upholding
the "Perng Fai-nan barrier" if it wants to win more support and trust for its
currency policy.</P>
      <P>The central bank's priority for the moment should be seeking cooperation  with
other major Asian countries  to adopt joint strategies  against a looming
currency war ignited by Western countries rather than safeguarding the "Perng
Fai-nan barrier" at all costs. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 11, 2010).</P>

Chen, director-general of the Department of African Affairs under the ministry.</P>
      <P>"It was misidentified as a piracy case at first because the vessel's sailing

after sailing north toward Somali waters.</P>
      <P>The crew members contacted their families and the boat owner after reaching Port

      <P>The ministry said it was informed by the Council of Agriculture's Fishery Agency
at noon on Oct. 6 that the fishing boat, which is registered in the southern
port of Tungkang, Pingtung County, could have been hijacked in the Exclusive
Economic Zone (EEZ) of Mauritius.</P>
      <P>The case was reported as the most southerly hijacking case by Somali pirates
since the European Union's anti-piracy mission began in December 2008.</P>
      <P>The European Union Naval Forces Somalia, which was established to fight Somali
piracy, protect vessels and monitor fishing activities off the coast of Somalia,
had reported the boat as safe Oct. 8 after sending out a false report the
previous day saying the vessel had been hijacked.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman James Chang said on the same day that the ministry was still
unsure whether the boat had been hijacked by pirates or its own crew.</P>

      <P>More than 1,000 members of the China Ports Association will arrive in Taiwan
aboard a cruise liner sailing direct from China for talks on cross-Taiwan Strait
cruise liner transport, according to a statement released Monday by the Ministry
of Transportation and Communications (MOTC).</P>
      <P>The 1,300 delegates are scheduled to arrive Oct. 13 in the southern Taiwan port
of Kaohsiung from Xiamen in China's Fujian Province aboard the Costa Romantica
cruise vessel.</P>
      <P>They are mostly representatives of port operators from Shanghai, Nanjing,
Ningbo, and Wuhan on China's east coast, the ministry added.</P>
      <P>The delegates, along with the directors-general of Kaohsiung, Taichung, Keelung
and Hualien harbors, will attend an Oct. 15 forum for discussions -- the first
of their kind -- of issues regarding cross-strait voyages by cruise ships.</P>
      <P>Currently, cross-strait direct sea transport is only open to companies that
register on both sides, along with certain vessels flying flags of convenience
that already sail between offshore shipping centers in China and Taiwan,
according to the MOTC.</P>
      <P>Direct transport links between Taiwan and China only resumed in 2008 after a ban

      <P>Vice President Vincent Siew inaugurated the Taiwan Cloud Computing Pavilion at
the Taitronics 2010 trade fair Monday in a show of the government's resolve to
accelerate the development of cloud computing,  which is revolutionizing  the
information technology (IT) industry.</P>
      <P>It is the first time an exhibition pavilion has been devoted exclusively to
cloud computing at any IT trade fairs that have taken place in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A total of 40 companies are displaying their technology, products and
applications related to cloud computing at the pavilion, part of Taitronics
2010, which opened that day at the Taipei World Trade Center's Nangang
Exhibition Hall for a four-day run.</P>
      <P>The fair serves to show that cloud computing technology not only makes people's
electronic lives more convenient and efficient but also integrates up- mid- and
down-stream sectors of the industry to create an industrial clustering effect,
said Chunghwa Telecom Co. Chairman Lu Shyue-ching, who doubles as chairman of
the Taiwan Cloud Computing Consortium (TCCC), one of the key sponsors of the
fair.</P>
      <P>"Application services, including hardware, servers and storage, will play a
pivotal role in the development process of the cloud computing industry," Lu
said at the inauguration ceremony.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing, which refers to outsourcing online data storage and
applications, effectively lowers companies' operating costs and reduces
systematic risk, according to Lu.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing provides "highly available" services and data stored on an
Internet network (the cloud) that users can access with devices such as desktop
PCs, TVs and smart phones connected to the Web, with the advantage that users do
not have to install or maintain these services on their devices.</P>
      <P>A cloud computing  environment  provides its users with a distributed computing
environment that can handle a massive amount of data and file sharing. It is
expected to become the preferred solution in an era of rapid industrial
development, experts believe.</P>
      <P>Cloud computing is also among the four innovative and strategic industries that
the government has spared no efforts to develop. The government and the private
sector jointly formed the TCCC in April in a bid to grab a share of the growing
market.</P>
      <P>The two sides plan to pour NT$24 billion (US$774 million) over the next five
years into the development of the cloud computing industry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Government to close land tax loophole used by private developers</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government's plan to limit tax restrictions and exemptions on idle privately
held plots of land merely involves closing a tax loophole rather than imposing
an "idle land tax" as reported, Deputy Minister of Finance Chang Sheng-ford said
Monday.</P>
      <P>News reports indicated that the government was trying to levy an "idle land tax"
to curb the hoarding of property for resale when land values rise and keep a lid
on real estate prices, a measure that has been supported by some property
experts.</P>
      <P>Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der may have added to the confusion Monday morning
at a legislative hearing when asked about the government's plan and the
possibility of imposing an idle land tax.</P>
      <P>"The narrowing of the land area and definition of tax-exempt land will have the
same effect as an 'idle land tax,'" he said.</P>
      <P>But Chang later responded that under the new plan, privately held land that has
in the past been given tax-exempt status because it provides free access to the
public, such as landscaped grounds of properties still waiting to be developed,
would once again be subject to the land value tax beginning in 2011.</P>
      <P>Only land used as roads or public passageways will continue to be tax exempt, he
confirmed.</P>
      <P>"In the past, the ministry has allowed many parcels of private land used at no
charge by the public to be exempted from taxation. But the preferential
treatment has been abused,  " he said, necessitating a revision of Taiwan's tax
regulations.</P>
      <P>Many developers who are sitting on idle land, hoping that its value will rise,
have landscaped the plots to avoid having to pay the land value tax, assessed at
1 percent or higher of the land's publicly appraised value.</P>
      <P>Chang said the revisions will also fulfill one of the resolutions passed by the
Executive Yuan Tax Reform Commission last year that called for amending land tax
regulations to broaden the tax base.</P>
      <P>He said closing existing loopholes did not amount to levying an "idle land tax,
" which would be actually be imposed as a punitive surcharge on the land value
tax of a property classified as being for development but not used for that
purpose.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A study conducted by a Taiwanese hospital has shown that drinking a moderate
amount of red wine daily could potentially lower the risk of cardiovascular
disease by helping give a boost to cells that repair blood vessels.</P>
      <P>A cardiovascular team from Taipei Veterans General Hospital came to the
conclusion based on a study that investigated the effect of red wine on
endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) , rare cells with the ability to repair
damage to blood vessel walls, representatives of the team said at a news
conference Monday.</P>
      <P>In the study, 80 healthy adult volunteers aged 20 to 40 were divided into four
groups, with members of three groups consuming a different alcoholic beverage --
100 cc of French red wine, 250 cc of beer,  or 30 cc of vodka -- and one control
group drinking nonalcoholic beverages for three consecutive weeks.</P>
      <P>"We discovered that the volume of EPC multiplies after the moderate drinking of
red wine, " said Huang Po-hsun, an attending physician involved in the study,
suggesting a positive correlation between red wine and repairing injured blood
vessels.</P>
      <P>Asked whether patients should adopt the habit of drinking red wine, Chen Jaw-
wen, a cardiologist at the hospital, was not sure.</P>
      <P>"Since the study was done on healthy human beings, we cannot say whether it is
equally effective on unhealthy people," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In terms of prevention and health care, moderate red wine consumption can make
blood vessels healthier, Chen said, but he also warned that excessive drinking
could hurt body organs.</P>
      <P>Huang said that daily consumption of beverages containing 10 percent alcohol
should not exceed 30 cc per day, and individuals with cirrhosis and other
chronic diseases should be especially careful about their drinking habits.</P>
      <P>Citing another study, the Bureau of Health Promotion also warned that while a
small amount of wine consumption could lower the risk of coronary artery
diseases, excessive drinking could lead to many other health problems.</P>
      <P>The study cited by the bureau found that the risk of a person drinking 250 cc of
red wine daily is 1.9 times and 2.9 times at risk of getting oropharyngeal
cancer and cirrhosis, respectively, than those who never drink.</P>
      <P>Red wine has been widely touted as having beneficial medical properties and
attributed by some as the explanation for the French paradox -- the fact that
the French have a diet heavy in saturated fats but have a lower incidence of
cardiovascular disease.</P>
      <P>Other studies,  however,  have been unable to establish a verifiable link
between red wine and improved cardiovascular health.</P>

      <P>Taiwan has not put a U.S.-built unmanned aerial vehicle, the RQ-4 Global Hawk,
on its arms procurement list, opting instead to have its military-run research
institute develop an indigenous unmanned aircraft system, a defense official
said Monday.</P>
      <P>"The Air Force has identified the need to acquire unmanned aircraft, but has not
included the U.S.-built reconnaissance aircraft system on its arms procurement
list, " Minister of National Defense Kao Hua-chu said at a Legislative Yuan
session.</P>
      <P>The minister said the military-run Chung-Shan Institute of Science and
Technology is already researching and developing the unmanned surveillance
aircraft system.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks following a report in the Taipei-based China Times daily
that same day that Japan has come up with an RQ-4 Global Hawk procurement plan
after the U.S. military formally stationed the aircraft in Guam last month.</P>
      <P>The paper also quoted unidentified military sources as saying that the Air Force
is conducting an assessment on whether to follow suit and that it will put both
F-16C/D jet fighters and the RQ-4 Global Hawk on its priority procurement list.</P>
      <P>Asked for his views on the report by ruling Kuomintang Legislator Lo Ming-Tsai,
Kao said Taiwan has been developing unmanned aerial vehicle for quite some time,
with the Chung-Shan institute leading the effort.</P>
      <P>The minister also said that it remains unclear whether the United States will
agree to sell Japan the advanced RQ-4 Global Hawks.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, the Ministry of National Defense's 2011 arms procurement
budget will mainly be used to finance items that the U.S. has already agreed to

      <P>Construction shares faced heavy pressure Monday after reports emerged that the
government plans to impose a special tax on privately owned land left idle
without any plan for immediate development, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Construction stocks closed down 2.19 percent, while the benchmark weighted index
fell 0.81 percent to 8,176.76.</P>
      <P>Cathay Real Estate fell 3.02 percent to NT$17.65,  Kindom Construction shed 3.18
percent to NT$24.05 and Prince Housing shed 3.80 percent to NT$24.05.</P>
      <P>Media reports on Monday hinted that the government would impose a land value tax
(an annual tax on land holdings) that would actually serve as an "idle land tax"
to curb property speculation.</P>
      <P>Developers have hoarded many prime lots of land in recent years without
developing them, waiting for land prices to rise before selling them for a hefty
profit.</P>
      <P>This is one of the factors driving up property prices, especially in the Greater
Taipei area, and the rumored tax was said to be part of a government strategy to
put a lid on such practices, scaring investors.</P>
      <P>After the reports surfaced, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) clarified that the
planned tax adjustment would only be to narrow the scope of land value tax
reductions and exemptions on privately owned land used by the general public.</P>
      <P>Many developers currently receive land value tax exemptions when they landscape
idle land holdings and give the public access to them.</P>
      <P>But under the new plan, only private land used for roads or other passage
without payment will receive preferential tax status, while companies "greening"
their land and opening it to the public will have to pay land value tax
beginning next year, the MOF said.</P>
      <P>"Despite  the clarification,  the first idea that came to investors' minds was
that the government would tighten measures to cap high flying property prices, "
Hua Nan Securities analyst Henry Miao said.</P>
      <P>Miao said the construction sector had recently staged a strong showing on a
rising Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar on hopes that a higher local
currency would boost asset prices in the domestic market.</P>
      <P>"Regardless of whether investors misunderstood the MOF's plan or intentionally
interpreted the plan as a measure to cap property prices, it was time for
investors to pocket the recent significant gains," Miao said.</P>
      <P>Miao said rapidly rising property prices in the local market have drawn
complaints from the public, and he expected that the government would not sit
back to allow the situation to get worse.</P>
      <P>A recent indication of that was the central bank's 0.125 percentage point rate
hike on Sept. 30, which followed a rate boost in late June.</P>
      <P>"Investors should stay on the sidelines before adding property holdings to
closely watch what further measures the government will come up with to deal
with the local property market," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hengdeli Holdings, China's largest luxury watch retailer, won an auction Monday
to buy a bank property in one of Taipei's busiest shopping areas, a move seen as
an attempt to capitalize on Taiwan's future opening to individual Chinese
tourists.</P>
      <P>Hengdeli's Taiwan branch acquired the 161.68-ping (534.4 square meters) property
on Zhongxiao East Road from Taiwan-based EnTie Commercial Bank with a bid of
NT$900 million (US$29.3 million) , or NT$5.56 million per ping.</P>
      <P>The winning bid was well above the auction's floor price of NT$727 million.</P>
      <P>Under the deal, however, EnTie will be able to continue to rent the property for
18 months after the transaction at a rate of NT$720,000 per month.</P>
      <P>The rental income will give Hengdeli a rate of return of 0.96 percent, one of
the lowest in the bustling shopping area where the average rate of return is
closer to 2 percent, said Jessica Hsu, a spokeswoman for real estate brokerage
firm H&amp;B Business Group.</P>
      <P>Hsu believes the acquisition indicates that Hengdeli plans to expand its
presence in Taiwan before the country opens its doors to individual Chinese
tourists, which is expected to happen next year.</P>
      <P>At present, Chinese travelers can only visit Taiwan in groups.</P>
      <P>Hengdeli has opened at least four outlets in northern and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bright Lee, spokesman for real estate agency Evertrust Rehouse Co., said that
Hengdeli had been looking to buy a new property since last year to cash in on an
expected surge in the number of Chinese tourists in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Legislation and funding are crucial if Taiwan is to realize its goal of
implementing a completely volunteer-manned military service system by 2014, the
premier said Monday.</P>
      <P>The volunteer military -- pledged by President Ma Ying-jeou during his 2008
presidential election campaign -- will change the existing military system,
which consists of voluntary service and conscription, to a completely voluntary
program.</P>
      <P>It is "extremely  difficult"  to turn a civilian  into a professional soldier in
the current one-year conscription period, which is why an all- volunteer system
is the right track, Premier Wu Den-yih said in an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu said the system will only be successful if the Ministry of National Defense
(MND) secures sufficient funding and is able to train elite soldiers, to
maximize military capability with minimum personnel.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  National  Defense Minister Kao Hua-chu said an amendment to the Act
of Military Service System will also be necessary if the plan is to advance. He
added that the new system would still require males of conscription age to go
through four months of basic military training.</P>
      <P>Funding appears to be the most serious problem for the new program. In March,
the MND's Department of Manpower estimated that the volunteer military service
system will increase personnel costs by NT$210 million (US$6.81 million) for
every 10,000 servicemen.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 2011 military budget accounts for only 2.6 percent of its national
gross domestic production, according to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to a Control Yuan report in 2008, the MND had planned to cut its
military personnel from 275,000 to 215,000.</P>
      <P>Last month, Kao told a legislative session that the progress of the program has
fallen behind schedule  because of recruiting difficulties and insufficient

      <P>Taiwan will promote mid-priced, high quality consumer products in Southeast
Asia, where interest in such items has grown substantially over the past year, a
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Deputy Chairman Wayne W. Wu, who led a Taiwan trade delegation to
Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam in late September and early October, said made-
in-Taiwan products have enjoyed increasing popularity in those markets because
of their good quality and reasonable prices.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-made items, from green products, innovative housewares, and information
technology  goods,  to auto parts,  hardware, construction materials and health
foods, are more competitive in terms of both quality and price in ASEAN markets
than similar goods from Japan, Europe and the United States, Wu said.</P>
      <P>After the 2008-2009 global economic meltdown, the number of middle class
consumers, who generally seek luxury or novelty items at affordable prices, has
risen in Southeast Asian nations, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, consumers from the younger generation make up nearly half of the
populations of these countries, forming a strong consumer base that Taiwanese
exporters and manufacturers should tap into, he added.</P>
      <P>Wu told the Central News Agency that the just-concluded trade promotion tour had
paid dividends, with Pasaraya, one of the biggest department stores in Jakarta,
deciding to devote a section of its store exclusively to Taiwanese cosmetics and
beauty products.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the owner of Taipei-based Aplus Integrated Circuits Inc. said his
company would work to explore possibilities related to Koran chanting in the
Muslim country.</P>
      <P>Kuo Shan-tsan, chairman and CEO of Aplus, a maker of datasheets and voice chips,
told the Central News Agency that a majority of Indonesia's 240 million
population are mostly Muslims, who pray five times a day chanting verses from
the Koran from mosques or their homes in the direction of Mecca.</P>
      <P>A handy electronic Koran chanting device the size of a business card developed
by Aplus could find success there, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>"It would be a US$100 million business if some 10 million Indonesians buy one,"
he envisioned.</P>

      <P>Germany became the fifth country to sign a working holiday program with Taiwan
when representatives from Germany and Taiwan completed the signing of a joint
statement Monday in Taipei, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said in a

      <P>According to the statement, Birgitt Ory, director of the German Institute
Taipei, signed the joint statement Monday while Wei Wu-lien, representative of
Taiwan's office in Germany, signed the statement Sept. 28.</P>
      <P>Under the joint statement that took effect immediately, people aged 18-30 from
Germany and Taiwan can travel and work in each other's territory for up to one
year. Each side has offered a quota of 200 multiple entry visas in the first
year of the program.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday that his stance on human rights issues has
been consistent, as he defended making his call for Beijing to free jailed
dissident Liu Xiaobo a day after Liu was named this year's Nobel Peace Prize
winner.</P>
      <P>"As head of state of the Republic of China, I have long been consistent in
safeguarding human rights and have always urged China to treat dissidents with
greater leniency, " Ma was quoted as saying by Su Jun-pin, head of the ruling
Kuomintang's (KMT's) Culture and Communications Committee, after the ruling
party's monthly meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Su, Ma also showed a copy of his June 4 statement marking the June
4, 1989 Tiananmen Massacre to prove that he had repeatedly asked Beijing to deal
with political dissidents more leniently.</P>
      <P>Ma's move to clarify  his stance on China's human rights conditions came after
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) criticized him for not urging
Beijing to free Liu immediately after Liu was announced as the winner of the

      <P>Ma said he issued a statement congratulating Liu after learning the news. But he
did not call for Liu's release until Oct. 9 during a gathering ahead of the
country's National Day on Sunday, drawing the opposition's condemnation.</P>
      <P>Apart from asking China to set Liu free, Ma said he also made other concrete

      <P>Taiwan's HTC Corp. unveiled on Monday five new smartphones that run on
Microsoft's new operating system, hoping to help the U.S. software giant regain
some of its dwindling share of the global smartphone operating system market.</P>
      <P>HTC, the world's largest maker of smartphones using Google and Microsoft
operating systems, said in a statement that these new smartphones -- HTC 7
Surround, HTC 7 Mozart, HTC 7 Trophy, HTC 7 Pro and HTC HD7 -- will be available
in markets in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region from late
October.</P>
      <P>Microsoft's  new operating system for smartphone is called "Windows Phone 7,"
"on which HTC is excited to be going big," HTC CEO Peter Chou said.</P>
      <P>Microsoft has been losing operating system market share to Google's Android
operating system, having seen its 9 percent share a year ago fall to 5 percent
today, according to market research firm Gartner.</P>
      <P>During that same period, the Android system's share has grown from 2 percent to
17 percent.</P>
      <P>HTC, which has partnered with Microsoft for nearly 10 years and produced the
first smartphone with Microsoft's mobile platform in 2002, is now the world's
fourth-largest smartphone brand, with a nearly 10 percent share of the global
market.</P>
      <P>The announcement came days after HTC said at a product launch event that its new
Desire HD and Desire Z, which run on Android 2.2, the latest version of Google's
operating system, will hit the Asian market in November.</P>

      <P>Legislation and funding are crucial if Taiwan is to realize its goal of
implementing a completely volunteer-manned military service system by 2014, the
premier said Monday.</P>
      <P>The volunteer military -- pledged by President Ma Ying-jeou during his 2008
presidential election campaign -- will change the existing military system,
which consists of voluntary service and conscription, to a completely voluntary
program.</P>
      <P>It is "extremely  difficult"  to turn a civilian  into a professional soldier in
the current one-year conscription period, which is why an all- volunteer system
is the right track, Premier Wu Den-yih said in an interpellation session at the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu said the system will only be successful if the Ministry of National Defense
(MND) secures sufficient funding and is able to train elite soldiers, to
maximize military capability with minimum personnel.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  National  Defense Minister Kao Hua-chu said an amendment to the Act
of Military Service System will also be necessary if the plan is to advance. He
added that the new system would still require males of conscription age to go
through four months of basic military training.</P>
      <P>Funding appears to be the most serious problem for the new program. In March,
the MND's Department of Manpower estimated that the volunteer military service
system will increase personnel costs by NT$210 million (US$6.81 million) for
every 10,000 servicemen.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's 2011 military budget accounts for only 2.6 percent of its national
gross domestic production, according to the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>According to a Control Yuan report in 2008, the MND had planned to cut its
military personnel from 275,000 to 215,000.</P>
      <P>Last month, Kao told a legislative session that the progress of the program has
fallen behind schedule  because of recruiting difficulties and insufficient
funding.</P>

      <P>Taiwan will promote mid-priced, high quality consumer products in Southeast
Asia, where interest in such items has grown substantially over the past year, a
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>TAITRA Deputy Chairman Wayne W. Wu, who led a Taiwan trade delegation to
Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam in late September and early October, said made-
in-Taiwan products have enjoyed increasing popularity in those markets because
of their good quality and reasonable prices.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-made items, from green products, innovative housewares, and information
technology  goods,  to auto parts,  hardware, construction materials and health
foods, are more competitive in terms of both quality and price in ASEAN markets
than similar goods from Japan, Europe and the United States, Wu said.</P>
      <P>After the 2008-2009 global economic meltdown, the number of middle class
consumers, who generally seek luxury or novelty items at affordable prices, has
risen in Southeast Asian nations, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, consumers from the younger generation make up nearly half of the
populations of these countries, forming a strong consumer base that Taiwanese
exporters and manufacturers should tap into, he added.</P>
      <P>Wu told the Central News Agency that the just-concluded trade promotion tour had
paid dividends, with Pasaraya, one of the biggest department stores in Jakarta,
deciding to devote a section of its store exclusively to Taiwanese cosmetics and
beauty products.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the owner of Taipei-based Aplus Integrated Circuits Inc. said his
company would work to explore possibilities related to Koran chanting in the
Muslim country.</P>
      <P>Kuo Shan-tsan, chairman and CEO of Aplus, a maker of datasheets and voice chips,
told the Central News Agency that a majority of Indonesia's 240 million
population are mostly Muslims, who pray five times a day chanting verses from
the Koran from mosques or their homes in the direction of Mecca.</P>
      <P>A handy electronic Koran chanting device the size of a business card developed
by Aplus could find success there, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>"It would be a US$100 million business if some 10 million Indonesians buy one,"
he envisioned.</P>

policies and issue regular human rights reports to raise the level of human
rights in Taiwan, the president said Sunday.</P>
      <P>All of the committee members will serve without pay, Lo said.</P>
      <P>The five-man  group determined  that similar  human rights committees will also

    <TEXT>
      <P>According to a recent study released by the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics, Taiwan's Okun coefficient ranged between 0.1 and 0.16
over the past decade. This means that a 1 percentage point increase in Taiwan's
gross domestic product (GDP) corresponds to only a 0.1-0.16 percent decrease in
the unemployment rate.</P>
      <P>The performance is not only inferior to 14 developed countries but also the
worst among the four "Asian Tigers, " trailing South Korea's 0.35, Hong Kong's
0.23 and Singapore's 0.17.</P>
      <P>At the most fundamental level, the excessive tilt of Taiwan's industrial
structure toward the high-tech sector and increased overseas production by
Taiwanese manufacturers are the reasons why GDP growth has failed to boost
employment.</P>
      <P>Although we have on many occasions called the government's attention to the
issue, it has so far not been able to abandon its "high-tech obsession, " with
R&amp;D, human resource and administrative resources still concentrating on a

      <P>Weaker Asian currencies Tuesday slowed the pace of the Taiwan dollar's
appreciation against the U.S. dollar, dealers said.</P>
      <P>They said investors in other regional markets were rushing to sell Asian
currencies, including Chinese yuan and Japanese yen, to pocket recent gains
against the greenback, but the trend of a falling U.S. dollar in Taiwan remained
intact.</P>
      <P>At 11 a.m., the U.S. dollar fell by NT$0.106 to NT$30.8920 against the Taiwan
dollar.</P>
      <P>A stronger U.S. dollar in Asian markets alleviated pressure on the Taiwan dollar
to appreciate, in a sharp contrast to the jumps made during trading sessions in
recent days, dealers said.</P>
      <P>In the local market, dealers said, investors followed the lead of other Asian
markets by locking in profits, igniting buying in the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Their renewed interest in the greenback gave a breather to the central bank,
which had engaged in aggressive intervention to support the U.S. dollar on fears
that a rapid appreciation of the Taiwan dollar would hurt the island's export
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the central bank abandoned its efforts to maintain the U.S. dollar
above NT$31.00 to the Taiwan dollar as the market widely anticipated that the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board will take further measures to ease the money supply
to boost the economy after the U.S. September jobs report pointed to a sluggish
economic climate.</P>
      <P>Dealers said the Taiwan dollar is expected to consolidate and move in a narrow
range for the rest of the trading session.</P>

honorary director, told the company when visiting its rehearsal.</P>
      <P>This is the 80-year-old Ming Hwa Yuan troupe's first performance tour in Europe.
It has performed previously in individual European cities, most recently in
Paris more than 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>In addition to Berlin, the 10-day tour will cover six other European cities --

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Indonesia offers Taiwan an island</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/12/10  13:58:31
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A local newspaper reported Tuesday that Indonesia has offered Taiwan an island
named Morotai in the hope that Taiwan will help develop the remote islet that
has a population of 50,000 people and abundant fishery resources and served as a
key military post in World War II.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>It all started with Taiwan's signing an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) with China on June 25 to further promote trade and economic links between
the two sides across Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The deal created an ECFA effect, attracting the interest of regional economies.
First, Singapore resumed free trade agreement talks with Taiwan in August. Now,
Indonesia, which has long kept its distance from Taiwan, both politically and
economically, has taken the initiative.</P>
      <P>A ranking government official who declined to be named said the proposal was
presented by Indonesian  President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono through his
ministers to Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang in early October,
during Shih's visit there to study the local economic and trade environment.</P>
      <P>The official also disclosed that Indonesian officials will visit Taiwan next
month for talks on the proposal. It is hoped there will be concrete details on
the deal by early next year, he said.</P>
      <P>Morotai, one-fifteenth the size of Taiwan with an area of 2,400 square
kilometers, is located on the northern tip of Indonesia (northwest of the island
of New Guinea) . Its natural environment remains pristine because of its remote
geographic location.</P>
      <P>What the Morotai development project represents is more the rise of a "crazy
about Taiwan" atmosphere than actual commercial benefits. Such an atmosphere has
emerged from the ECFA effect, and Taiwan should cherish and take advantage of
it.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has finally restored economic and trade links with Indonesia, a member of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, after relations soured during the
Chen Shui-bian administration.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan economic and trade delegation, headed by Shih, won local media
attention when it arrived in Indonesia Sept. 30 for a visit.</P>
      <P>Officials responsible for economic affairs said Taiwan has listed Indonesia as
one of four key investment markets in the region, aside from China, India and
Vietnam. Taiwan plans to invest in the automobile, bicycle, textile, electronics
and shoes manufacturing sectors there.</P>
      <P>Rising labor and land costs in China forced four Taiwanese shoe makers that
produce shoes for international brands such as Nike and Reebok to relocate their
production lines to Indonesia earlier this year, the officials said. (Oct. 12,
2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier: Talks needed for Taiwan-Indonesia investment</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said on Tuesday that talks with Indonesia are needed to work
through the details of a proposal to co-develop one of the Southeast Asian
country's islands.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News reported on Tuesday that the Indonesian government has
invited Taiwan to join a project to develop Morotai Island, the northernmost of
the Maluku Islands situated between New Guinea and the Philippines.</P>
      <P>The island is heavily wooded, producing timber, and boasts abundant fishery
resources.</P>
      <P>Wu spoke cautiously about the initiative, saying that what Taiwan is willing to
invest in Morotai Island and what the Indonesian government wants Taiwan to
invest remain to be seen.</P>
      <P>Morotai Island has an area of about 2,400 square kilometers, roughly one-
fifteenth the size of Taiwan, and a population of some 50,000 people, according
to the report.</P>
      <P>Because Morotai Island is not a small island,  any joint investment will need
further discussion between the Taiwanese and Indonesian governments, Wu said,
and he pledged that his Cabinet will conduct a serious and careful assessment of
the project.</P>
      <P>This latest joint investment initiative, the premier said, is one of many that
have emerged after the implementation of the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) , which was signed with China in late June.</P>
      <P>Wu stressed, however, that the government has made investing in Taiwan its top
priority while mulling business opportunities overseas and said overseas
investments will not drain Taiwan of the capital it needs for development at
home.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang said Indonesia, which is full of
rich natural resources and gearing up to improve its domestic political and
economic climate, has attracted much attention from Taiwanese investors.</P>
      <P>But because the Morotai Island project remains in its early stage, Shih said he
did not want to talk too much about the issue at the moment. He added that he
has never visited the island.</P>
      <P>Shih led a delegation to Indonesia for a three-day visit in late September,
introducing Taiwan's investment environment and preaching made-in-Taiwan goods.</P>
      <P>During the visit, Shih also met with Indonesian officials, including Gita
Wirjawan, head of Indonesia's Coordinating Investment Board. It was at that time
that the Morotai Island project was first broached.</P>

      <P>A delegation departed for the Indonesian island of Morotai Tuesday as Taiwan
mulls the Indonesian government's offer to have Taiwan help develop the island,
officials of the two countries said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Southeast Asian country has contacted Taiwan to participate in developing in
the island, which is located between the Philippines and New Guinea and has a
population of 50,000 people, confirmed Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
spokesman James Chang on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan welcomed the offer, he said.</P>
      <P>Indonesia's representative to Taiwan Harmen Sembiring, officials from the MOFA's
Department of Asian and Pacific Affairs and a group of Taiwanese businessmen
embarked on a trip to the underdeveloped island Tuesday to conduct a preliminary
evaluation, said Irene Pan of the Indonesian Economic and Trade Office to
Taipei's Investment Department.</P>
      <P>The delegation is scheduled to return to Taiwan Oct. 19, she said.</P>
      <P>Pan said Indonesia's Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries first made
contact with Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) in September when
Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang was in Indonesia at the head of a
trade and investment delegation.</P>
      <P>"The Indonesian side hopes to attract Taiwanese investment in the sectors of
seafood production, fishing, aquaculture and tourism, " said Kuo Fu-chuan, a
senior technical specialist in the MOEA's Department of Investment Services.</P>
      <P>The evaluation is still in its initial stages, Kuo said, and the Fisheries
Agency still needs to gather data on Morotai's hydrology, fish species  and
fishing  regulations  before conducting  its evaluation.</P>
      <P>After that, government agencies will be able to brief local businessmen on
investment opportunities.</P>
      <P>Indonesia has also offered Taiwan Sugar Corporation and state-run oil refiner
CPC Corp. Taiwan the opportunities to establish an oil refinery and development
land in other parts of the archipelago country, respectively, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said at a legislative hearing Tuesday morning that there is
no timetable yet for the development project because further assessment is
needed.</P>
      <P>The MOEA's Shih said it was still too early to go into the specifics of the
project, but he noted that there has been a lot of interest among local
businesses to invest in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's accumulated investments in Indonesia total US$13.95 billion, according
to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Morotai is best known as the site of the Battle of Morotai in World War II in
1944 and was used as a springboard for the Allied invasion of the Philippines in
1945.</P>

    <DATELINE>10/12/10  15:51:31
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>According to the latest forecast released last week by the International
Monetary Fund, Taiwan's economic growth is expected to reach 9.3 percent in 2010
but will slow down to 4.4 percent in 2011 as stimulus policies in developed
economies wind down.</P>
      <P>This means that Taiwan will need to increase its domestic demand to support its
economic growth next year, and the unemployment rate has to be lowered to boost
private consumption.</P>
      <P>In terms of increasing private investment, the government should seek to draw
foreign investment into the service sector, because investment in the
manufacturing sector is likely to slow down as a result of an unstable
international economic situation.</P>
      <P>Also, the government should make good use of the business opportunities brought
by the economic cooperation framework agreement and step up its efforts to
attract inflows of Chinese investment and get overseas Taiwanese businesses to
return home to invest.</P>
      <P>The government's top priority,  therefore, is to eliminate existing barriers on
investment and improve its administrative efficiency. (Editorial abstract --

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 1.05 percent Tuesday as investors took note of
the losses suffered on other regional markets amid concern over the rapid
appreciation of Asian currencies, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 86.54 points to 8,090.22, after moving between 8,058.59
and 8,180.39, on turnover of NT$102.14 billion (US$3.30 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 0.06 points and selling accelerated after regional
markets, including Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul, expanded losses to drag the local
index down below the 8,100 point support level, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,820 stocks closed down, 1,065 finished up, and 237 stocks remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector encountered the steepest decline, down 1.65 percent.
Financials lost 1.18 percent, machinery and electronics stocks dropped 1.17
percent, plastics and chemical shares fell 1.12 percent, and textile stocks
closed down 0.94 percent.</P>
      <P>The cement sector fell 0.69 percent, the construction sector lost 0.41 percent
and the foodstuff sector closed down 0.13 percent.</P>
      <P>Taiwan International Securities analyst Michael Chiang said market sentiment has
turned cautious as governments in the region, including Taiwan, are taking
action to cap the appreciation of their currencies against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>"Measures adopted by central banks in the region could limit inflows of foreign
funds, and liquidity in the capital market will fall accordingly. Investors do
not like that," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"Investors had better watch closely what measures Taiwan's central bank will
come up with to curb infusions of hot money, " Chiang said. "Any move by the
central bank to handle idle funds is expected to trigger the drainage of
liquidity."</P>
      <P>Chiang said that with investors cautious, once the market falls below the key
8,000-point barrier, further selling will follow.</P>
      <P>"It is time for investors to cut their holdings and raise their cash positions,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Among old economy stocks, Shihlin Paper fell 4.03 percent to NT$71.40 and Nan Ya
Plastics shed 3.11 percent to NT$62.30.</P>
      <P>In the high tech sector, PC vendor AsusTek dropped 2.06 percent to NT$213.50 and
Hon Hai Precision, the world's largest contract electronics maker, fell 3.41
percent to NT$113.00.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Foreign Minister Timothy C.T. Yang admitted Tuesday that Vietnam's
government has interfered with the proceedings  of an annual  cocktail  party
held  by Taiwan's representative office in Hanoi to celebrate the island's
Double Ten National Day since 2007.</P>
      <P>The Vietnamese government  "has exercised a great deal of pressure" on such a
celebration event, banning the office from using Taiwan's official name -- the
Republic of China -- and terms like "national day" at the party, Yang said.</P>
      <P>He was responding to legislators' questions during a question and answer session
at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Yang added that the authorities in Vietnam have even threatened to block guests
from entering the party venue if the office refused to meet its requests.</P>
      <P>Yang  did not say why Vietnam  interfered  with  Taiwan's celebrations of its
National Day. Hanoi has been steadily improving relations with China over the
years. Beijing considers Taiwan one of its provinces, to be reunified, and
objects to other countries viewing Taiwan as a country.</P>
      <P>Vietnam's attitude has not changed over the years despite the ministry's
frequent protests, Yang said. "The ministry has never stopped protesting, " Yang
stressed, noting that he has instructed Taiwan's liaison office in Hanoi to
strongly defend and maintain Taiwan's national dignity.</P>
      <P>The problem was reported by a Taiwanese daily newspaper, Liberty Times, Tuesday.
The report said Taiwan's representative office in Hanoi has recently yielded to
the Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' request to take two Chinese
characters, which mean National Day celebration, off a banner that reads the
"99th Double Ten National Day Celebration Party" in Chinese.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lee Chun-yee asked about the report at the legislative session,
questioning whether Vietnam's actions only began this year, and if so, who
should be held responsible.</P>
      <P>In Hanoi, Huang Chih-peng, who took office as Taiwan's top representative to
Vietnam on Oct. 6, confirmed that the suppression on the office's national day
celebration parties began in 2007. He pledged to try harder to boost
communications with Vietnamese authorities.</P>
      <P>Officials at Vietnam's Economic and Cultural Office in Taipei could not
immediately be reached for comment.</P>

pocket the strong gains these currencies made recently against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Losses on Taiwan's stock market also raised selling pressure on the local
currency, they said. The benchmark weighted index fell 1.05 percent.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-based HomeScenario, Inc. unveiled at the Broadband Taiwan 2010 technology
fair Tuesday a prototype of its "supersmart" electricity meter that can help
homeowners closely monitor their power consumption.</P>
      <P>According to HomeScenario, the meter is equipped with censors that detect total
power consumption of a home and inform homeowners of the data via their cell
phones or personal computers through broadband.</P>
      <P>The company said the newly developed meter can also be used to monitor
electricity use patterns and the power consumption of individual home
appliances.  It can also automatically control lighting, air-conditioning,
audio-video equipment and door security.</P>
      <P>HomeScenario and its partner, National Chiao Tung University, spent more than a
year developing the product and are planning to launch commercial production.</P>
      <P>HomeScenario is one of 16 Taiwanese and foreign high-tech developers showing
their products in the exhibition's theme pavilion titled Broadband Universe.</P>
      <P>Apart from the broadband technology, the exhibition, which is organized by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Industrial Technology Research Institute,
also features wireless technology, telecommunications components and equipment.</P>
      <P>The fair, which began a day earlier, houses a total of 750 exhibitors in 1,600
booths and will run through Oct. 14, the organizers said.</P>

      <P>A proposal to relax restrictions on exit applications by male citizens of
conscription age planning to study in China met with strong opposition from
lawmakers of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party Tuesday, who said the
move could trigger "a wave of desertions."</P>
      <P>According to Legislator Kuan Bi-ling, the proposal would "widely open the doors
for deserters."</P>
      <P>It would also increase the outflow of local students to China, further battering
local university enrollments, which have been declining due to a dropping birth
rate, she said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the Legislative Yuan put the draft bill by Kuomintang
lawmakers to revise the enforcement regulations of the Conscription Law on the
agenda of the next plenary session.</P>
      <P>In the draft bill, the legislators said the current regulations impose stricter
restrictions on applications for exit filed by those of draft age who want to
travel to China to study than similar exit applications by those planning to
study in other countries.</P>
      <P>The regulations, which restrict the departure of the citizens of conscription
age at 18 years old unless they have fulfilled their national service, are
greatly inconvenient for draftees who have begun study in China, the lawmakers
said.</P>
      <P>These young people are either forced to suspend their studies and stay in Taiwan
to fulfill their military duties or stay in China for the long term, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Centers for Disease Control (CDC) urged the country's residents to keep
their living environments clean to prevent a full-blown outbreak of dengue fever
after reporting on Tuesday a sharp rise in the incidence of the disease
recently.</P>
      <P>A total of 111 new dengue fever cases originating in Taiwan were reported last
week, setting a new single week record, with most of the  cases  concentrated
in  southern  Taiwan,  CDC  Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi said at a news
conference.</P>
      <P>Shih also said four different strains of the virus have emerged, increasing the
threat of an outbreak of the more dangerous dengue hemorrhagic fever, which
often occurs when a different strain of the virus infects a patient who
previously had dengue fever.</P>
      <P>To counter the threat,  the Department of Health and the Environmental
Protection Administration will jointly conduct spot checks of potential breeding
grounds for the mosquitoes that spread the virus, Shih said.</P>
      <P>He also urged southern  Taiwan  residents  to clean their neighborhoods of
standing water to prevent a wider outbreak.</P>
      <P>Since August, 483 cases have been reported in Taiwan, of which 300 have occurred
in Kaohsiung City and 108 in Tainan City, said CDC medical officer Kuo Tsung-
wen, who attributed the rising infection numbers to the high incidence of dengue
fever around the world.</P>
      <P>Aside from Southeast Asian countries, which are experiencing an increase in
dengue fever cases, there were 387 imported cases of the tropical disease in
Germany, said Kuo, the highest in its history.</P>
      <P>Dengue fever is transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical regions. Its symptoms
include fever, headache, dizziness and loss of appetite.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Goldman Sachs said Tuesday that it was maintaining a "buy" recommendation on
smartphone maker HTC after the company launched five new models running on
Microsoft's new Windows Phone 7 (WP7) operating system.</P>
      <P>Goldman said the new models highlight HTC's competitive advantage of being a
Microsoft partner in commercializing new technologies.</P>
      <P>The brokerage said it does not expect WP7 smartphones to be an immediate growth
driver for HTC, but forecast that the benefits will be seen in 2011.</P>
      <P>HTC unveiled its five WP7 smartphones a day earlier -- the HTC 7 Surround, the
HTC 7 Mozart, the HTC 7 Trophy, the HTC 7 Pro and the HTC HD7 -- and the
products will hit markets in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region
from later in the month.</P>
      <P>"We expect the products to incrementally fuel HTC's momentum in the fourth
quarter of this year and beyond," Goldman said.</P>
      <P>HTC, which has partnered with Microsoft for nearly 10 years and produced the
first smartphone with Microsoft's mobile platform in 2002, is now the world's
fourth-largest smartphone brand, taking a nearly 10 percent share of the global
market.</P>
      <P>Goldman  said it expects  HTC will  launch  two to three Android-based
smartphones over the next two quarters.</P>
      <P>In the third quarter, HTC posted sales of NT$75.85 billion (US$2.44 billion) ,
higher than an earlier company estimate of NT$70 billion made in July.</P>
      <P>Goldman set a 12-month target price of NT$1,000 for HTC stocks.</P>
      <P>HTC fell 2.24 percent to NT$699.00 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange Tuesday.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that Taiwan's "Lamp for Africa " solar
lighting project will be expanded to benefit rural residents of the Solomon
Islands in the South Pacific.</P>
      <P>Ma noted during a meeting with visiting Solomon Islands Prime Minister Danny
Philip at the Presidential Office that Taiwan has signed a cooperation agreement
on solar power development with the Pacific ally, under which Taiwan will
provide lighting for remote areas of the country.</P>
      <P>Ma also congratulated Philip, who was elected prime minister in August,
describing him as a leader with vision who can lead the country to making big
progress on both the domestic and international stages.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, Philip will work on building good relations with Taiwan and
made particular mention of the partnership with the Republic of China in his
policy white paper.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan will play an essential role and provide assistance and support to the
new government," Ma said.</P>
      <P>Since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1983, Taiwan has
focused on improving exchanges and providing the Solomon Islands with
development in the fields of agriculture, medicine and education.</P>
      <P>For example, the Solomon Islands' minister of agriculture and livestock is
studying at Taiwan's National Pingtung University of Science and Technology, Ma

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Tuesday that the positive effects of a major trade
deal between Taiwan and China is beginning to emerge, with more countries
showing interests in cooperating with Taiwan economically.</P>
      <P>The president was referring to an economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) which Taiwan signed with China on June 29. The agreement reduces tariffs
on exports between the two sides and eliminates some non-tariff trade barriers.
It was widely seen as a breakthrough in relations as it was one of the most
important agreement reached between the two sides in six decades.</P>
      <P>Ma's remarks came amid news report that Indonesia intends to invite Taiwan to
help develop an island called Morotai, located on its northern tip.</P>
      <P>Ma said that after the Taiwan-China trade pact, Southeast Asia, Europe, New
Zealand and Australia have "looked at Taiwan with new eyes."</P>
      <P>"The signing of the pact has further eased cross-strait tensions and created
more trade opportunities," the president said.</P>
      <P>He cited as an example that Singapore is talking with Taiwan about signing an
economic cooperation agreement, while talks on a trade and investment framework
agreement with the United States will resume at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that amid warming ties with China, many countries have seen that
Beijing is willing to improve relations with Taiwan, and they ask themselves
"Why can't we?"</P>
      <P>The effect, Ma said, is that Taiwan's friends will no longer have to "take
sides," and they can make friends with both Taiwan and China at the same time.</P>
      <P>He stressed that his administration will actively seek to sign economic
cooperation pacts or free trade pacts with its trading partners, especially
countries with whom Taiwan has complementary ties, so as to expand Taiwan's
participation in the international community.</P>

      <P>The upcoming International Flora Expo in Taipei will feature a garden in which
hundreds of electronic flowers will "dance" to sound and light effects when
visitors approach them, the designer said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A total of 438 electronic flowers designed by Asus, the world's fifth largest PC
maker, will be highlighted at the "Pavilion of Dreams" of the expo.</P>
      <P>A limited number of visitors will get a sneak preview of the flowers dancing
during a trial period on Oct. 15-20.</P>
      <P>The pavilion will officially open to the public at the formal launch of the expo
on Nov. 6.</P>
      <P>"We hope that people will reflect  on and seek a better relationship with nature
by interacting with the electronic plants, " said Mike Tsai, director of the
design center in Asus.</P>
      <P>The flowers, created by an Asus team of over 10 members, are designed to "dance"
to sound and light effects as one approaches them. They can detect approaching
spectators with the infrared sensors placed under the floor.</P>
      <P>Patrick Chiu, a senior designer of Asus, said the company has spent more than a
year and about NT$10 million (US$326,690) to develop the technology.</P>
      <P>"We found that everything in nature moves with certain rules, like migratory
birds flying in lines," Chiu said.</P>
      <P>"We tried to recreate these natural behaviors in the form of technology," he
noted.</P>
      <P>The Taipei City Government is aiming to attract at least 8 million visitors to
the six-month expo, which will be held in Taiwan for the first time.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Children should be vaccinated against seasonal flu: DOH</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) urged mothers to get their children vaccinated
against seasonal flu Tuesday in the face of low vaccination rates.</P>
      <P>Compared to last year, only half of the country's children of pre-school age had
received the free seasonal flu vaccination as of that day, said Shih Wen-yi,
deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</P>
      <P>The situation was similar for those aged over 65, with the inoculation rate in
this group down 30 percent compared to last year's statistics, said Shih.</P>
      <P>Asked about the side effects of this year's flu vaccine, Shih said only that
"there is no need to be worried" and said parents should be more anxious if
their children are not vaccinated against seasonal flu, which has already caused
42 cluster infections this year.</P>
      <P>This year's vaccine is good for the prevention of infection by the H1N1 virus,
H3N2 virus and influenza B virus, all of which are expected to be common and
widespread in the upcoming season.</P>
      <P>Shih warned that there have been many cases of children being infected with the
flu at school and bringing the virus home to their grandparents, who are also
vulnerable.</P>
      <P>Rolling up his sleeve to get a shot, Minister of Health Yuang Chih-liang
described the seasonal vaccination as effective.</P>
      <P>Shih said the center has purchased nearly 3 million doses of seasonal flu
vaccine this year, only 720,000 of which had been used since the beginning of
the vaccination program 12 days ago.</P>
      <P>The free vaccination program runs from Oct. 1 to Nov. 30, for citizens aged over
65, children aged between six months and 10 years, medical personnel in charge
of disease control and prevention, poultry breeders and patients  with rare or
serious diseases, according to Shih.</P>
      <P>People who are not on the priority list for free inoculation can still get
vaccinated at a cost of between NT$500 (US$15.63) and NT$700 at clinics and
hospitals, Shih pointed out.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The 40th supervisory committee meeting on the No. 6 naphtha cracker plant ended
in deadlock Tuesday with Yunlin Magistrate Su Chih-fen calling for an open
debate with Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) over the environmental hazards
reportedly caused by the plant since its establishment in 1991.</P>
      <P>The plant, located in the southern agricultural county's Mailiao Township has
faced a string of incidents in recent months including two major fires in July
and two reports of foul odor leaking from the plant last month.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the meeting held at the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) headquarters, Su said the county government has repeatedly voiced its
concerns over the plant, especially after the two fires, but the pleas have gone
largely ignored by the Industrial Development Bureau and the conglomerate.</P>
      <P>"Even now, there is no designated lane for the oversized vehicles used by the
plant. The plant has become a nuisance for local residents and this is just one
of the many examples," said Su.</P>
      <P>The county government complained about FPG's failure to reduce the noise, air
and water pollution caused by the facility and lambasted it for its shoddy fire
control management.</P>
      <P>A representative of the Yunlin Fire Department recalled that the July 7 fire
lasted for three days before it was completely extinguished, and he blamed the
plant's own firefighters of failing to contain the blaze in its initial stages.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the county's Environmental Bureau said the plant's daily waste water
discharge is as high as 180,000 metric tons and the pH level is as low as 6.3 --
barely meeting the legal permitted level of a 6.0-9.0 range for agricultural
irrigation use, said the representative.</P>
      <P>However, according to experts commissioned by the conglomerate, research shows
that the plant does not pose any eco-hazard to the local environment and that
the toxic waste emissions, as well as the noise pollution and traffic levels
caused by the facility, all fall within legal standards.</P>
      <P>The meeting ended without any solid conclusion, but FPG is required to submit an
overall health impact assessment report by the end of this month.</P>
      <P>The complex was proposed in 1973. In 1991, FPG won government approval  to build
the petrochemical  complex on two offshore industrial zones in Yunlin.</P>
      <P>The company was fined NT$1 million (US$32,211) for the foul odor episodes in
September and an additional NT$3 million for the two July blazes. The damage
caused by the two fires was reportedly estimated at over NT$500 million.</P>

      <P>More than 25 percent of the health expenditure in 2009 went on patients with
major illness or injury, according to statistics released Tuesday by the Bureau
of National Health Insurance (BNHI).</P>
      <P>There were 783,121 people under the category of major illness or injury in
Taiwan last year, whose combined health care costs accounted for 26.99 percent
of the total,  according  to the statistics.</P>
      <P>Although individuals with major illness only accounted for 3 percent of the
total population, the amount spent on treating these patients was around $130
billion (US$42 million), said Tsai Shu-ling, director of the bureau's medical

      <P>The statistics also show that clinical fees were highest for patients with
cancer, chronic mental disorder, auto-immune disease and hemophilia, as well as
those requiring dialysis.</P>
      <P>Despite the heavy cost of treatment for major illnesses, Tsai said, it is the

    <TEXT>
      <P>The most popular investment for Taiwan's wealthy are cable TV systems, with many
business tycoons prepared to offer tens of billions of New Taiwan dollars to bid
for such companies.</P>
      <P>Cable TV system  operators'  steady  cash flow and proven profitability are what
attract these billionaires, including Fubon Group's Daniel Tsai and Richard
Tsai, Want Want Group Chairman Tsai Eng-meng and Ruentex Group President Samuel
Yin.</P>
      <P>"For investors with a large capital position, a cable TV system is a good
investment target because of its stable cash flow, as such people are unlikely
to put capital in a bank, especially when the stock market fluctuates more and
property prices are high, " a major shareholder of a cable TV system said.</P>
      <P>The industry's landscape has been undergoing great changes since Fubon Group's
Tsai brothers announced their NT$65 billion (US$2.06 billion) deal to buy Kbro
Co. in July, which makes the previous five major multi-system operators into
three groups.</P>
      <P>As Fubon Group already owns Taiwan Mobile -- which also has a cable TV
operation, the combined market share of Kbro and Taiwan Mobile's cable TV unit
will reach 35 percent, making the Tsai family the biggest player in the
business.</P>
      <P>The second-largest operator, CNS, is also up for sale and the auction process is
set to conclude in October, while most of the other operators are managed by
Lien Tai-sheng, chairman of ERA Communications Inc., which has its own cable
system and channels.</P>
      <P>The price tag of the CNS sale is estimated at NT$70 billion and has attracted
several groups of investors, including Sony, Yin, the team led by Tsai, Bain
Capital Partners and the Macquarie Group.</P>
      <P>The most active among them is the Tsai group, which includes former media tycoon
Gary Wang and Tsai Chen-yu, who recently sold a 15 percent stake in the family
run Cathay Financial Holding. Each of them have different agendas.</P>
      <P>Tsai Eng-meng is continuing his expansion in the media industry after his 2008
purchase of the terrestrial broadcaster  China Broadcast Co. and CTiTV Inc.,
which operates several cable channels, while Wang is trying to get back into the
business after his involvement in an embezzlement scandal in 2007. Tsai Chen-yu,
on the other hand, was approached for the cash he owned from the Cathay stock
sales.</P>
      <P>However,  these high prices  might lead to delays  in TV digitization, as it is
unclear if these investors will be willing to invest in the necessary equipment,
which is the major cost for system operators.</P>

positions and strategic choices following the June signing of the Economic
Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) with China.</P>
      <P>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is likely to be the axis and
driving force of Asian economic integration, which is why Taiwan cannot afford
to overlook the region, said economist Liu Da-nien, who serves as a researcher
at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research.</P>
      <P>Although the ECFA has given Taiwan some leverage, South Korea, Taiwan's fierce
trade competitor, is also active in Northeast Asia, Liu said, adding that a
South Korea-European Union free trade agreement (FTA) is expected to take effect
this year and it could also launch FTA talks with China soon, which would pose a
major challenge for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>China has put a lot of resources into Southeast Asian countries, said Lin Chien-

either develop bilateral relations with ASEAN countries or do so via China's
integration with ASEAN.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's semi-official industrial institute ITRI said Tuesday that it has been
selected by the U.S. transport ministry as the only partner in Asia to be part
of a program aimed at enhancing the safety of drivers when they are driving.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Department of Transportation decided last month to choose Taiwan's
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to be one of the eight
participants in the IntelliDrive Safety program, the institute said in a
statement.</P>
      <P>The program is aimed at improving connectivity among vehicles and roadway
infrastructure in order to significantly raise the level of safety in the U.S.
transportation system.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's institute said it believes one of the reasons it was chosen to
participate  in the program is because of its new technology, which can alert a
driver to bad road conditions, such as automobile accidents or traffic jams,
even when his vehicle is several hundred meters away.</P>
      <P>The technology can also help a driver identify various acts of reckless driving
to avoid potential threats to the driver in hundreds of metersdistance.</P>
      <P>Being selected to take part in the U.S. transportation ministry's program will
help ITRI gain a foothold in the U.S. intelligent transportation market, the
institute said.</P>
      <P>"This major breakthrough means that Taiwan has got a key to the door to the
United States' intelligent transport system market, " the institute said.</P>
      <P>"The partnership also sets a new example for Taiwan's future overseas

      <P>Shih Wen-yi, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC),

      <P>"Those eligible can go to appointed hospitals to receive the vaccine for free,"
said Shih, "There will be no mix-ups."</P>
      <P>Compared with the same period of last year, numbers receiving the vaccine in

County Health Department official.</P>
      <P>"In addition to a decrease in the number of children getting shots, there has
been an especially low rate of old people being vaccinated," he said.</P>
      <P>Lin confirmed that according to officials who have gone to places where H1N1

circulating among old people that this year's vaccine has been mixed with old
batches.</P>
      <P>International  vaccines are produced according  to seasonal influenza strains,
the H1N1 vaccine is commonly produced and safe. There is no possibility that new

      <P>According to the Statute on Renewable Energy Development enacted in June, the
state-run Taiwan Power Company will purchase electricity at NT$11.1883 per
kilowatt-hour from households with solar power generation capacity of over 10
megawatts.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the measure is to encourage the private sector to engage in
alternative energy generation, which will help the company save expenses for
power plant construction and land acquisition, lower carbon emissions, and
reduce its electricity reserve margin, the amount of unused capacity needed to
cover peak demand.</P>
      <P>Surprisingly,  both Environmental  Protection  Administration Minister Stephen
Shen and Atomic Energy Council Chairman Liang Chi-yuan are concerned that solar
power generation could become "overly  feverish."  Liang has even opposed solar

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese pitcher Chien-Ming Wang of the Washington  Nationals threw two shutout
innings in an instructional league game Tuesday, his second consecutive
scoreless outing after missing the entire 2010 season.</P>
      <P>Wang needed only 17 pitches to retire all six batters he faced, four on ground
outs and two on fly balls. His velocity hit 89 miles per hour (143 kilometers
per hour) , his best since taking to the mound in a game situation during his
rehab stint.</P>
      <P>The Washington Nationals trainer monitoring Wang's progress told the Central
News Agency that Wang's shoulder, which was operated on during the 2009 season
and kept him out of action for the 2010 season, was recovering quickly.</P>
      <P>The trainer also said he was satisfied with the 30-year-old Tainan native's
progress, as Wang's velocity had improved from 70 mph when he started throwing
to around 90 mph recently.</P>
      <P>In his first instructional league outing last Wednesday, Wang hit 87 mph on the
radar gun in one inning of work.</P>
      <P>Wang's outings in the instructional league -- used by teams primarily to help
minor league prospects improve their skills -- are likely to determine his
future.</P>
      <P>After Wang was plagued by injury in 2008 and 2009 when he was with the New York
Yankees, the Yankees decided not to offer him a deal for the 2010 season, and he
ended up signing a one-year, US$2 million contract with the Nationals.</P>
      <P>The Nationals are waiting to see how Wang progresses before they decide whether
to offer him a new contract. If they do not, Wang will become a free agent.</P>
      <P>Wang starred for the New York Yankees from 2005-2008, posting a 54-20 record,
before suffering a foot injury in June 2008 that kept him out the rest of the
year.</P>
      <P>He returned in 2009 but performed poorly and suffered a torn right shoulder
capsule that required surgery in July 2009. He was expected to return to the
mound for the Nationals midway through the 2010 season, but his recovery was
slower than anticipated.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics is in a serious dilemma as a "science."</P>
      <P>Unlike chemistry and physics, which study inanimate objects, economics studies
human behavior and its relationship with markets. Yet it still insists in
borrowing physics as an analytic tool. This leads to many theories that exist
only in a non-human environment.</P>
      <P>It is little wonder, therefore, that the world has failed to recover from the
global financial crisis over the past two years despite the use of the strongest
possible cures prescribed by economists.</P>
      <P>Lebanese-born bestselling author Nassim Nicholas Taleb recently threatened to
sue the Swedish Central Bank for awarding the 1990 Nobel Prize for Economics to
three economists for their risk models, which according to Taleb were
responsible for the breakdown of the global financial system.</P>
      <P>We welcome Taleb's action, because this allows the world to examine the huge,
irremediable gap that exists between economics and reality. Only if we see
economics in a calm and rational manner can economics become a true blessing for
human society. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 13, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China Merchants Bank has filed an application to open a representative office in
Taiwan, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The commission has received the bank's application and will consult with the
central bank about the bank's request soon, " FSC Chief Secretary Ling Tung-
liang said.</P>
      <P>China Merchants Bank, founded in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, in 1987, is the
third Chinese bank to seek approval to set up an office on the island.</P>
      <P>On Sept.  23,  the FSC gave Bank of China  and Bank of Communications the green
light to establish offices in Taiwan after they had filed applications earlier
in the month.</P>
      <P>To ensure domestic financial stability, the FSC said, it will review the
application from China Merchants Bank and check whether it meets the
requirements stipulated by regulations governing financial exchanges and
investments across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to the FSC, China Merchants Bank had total assets of 2.22 trillion
Chinese yuan (US$333 billion) as of the end of June, making the bank the 65th
largest in the world. It posted NT$17 billion in pretax profit in the first half
of this year.</P>
      <P>As of the end of June, the bank had a return on assets of 1.21 percent, a return
on equity of 4.27 percent, a non-performing loan ratio of 0.67 percent and a
capital adequacy ratio of 11.06 percent.</P>
      <P>China Merchants Bank,  which operates 52 branches and 738 sub-branches in China,
has a branch in New York and another one in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Under existing regulations, Chinese banks are required to operate a
representative office in Taiwan for no less than one year before seeking
approval to upgrade the office into a branch.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>With the curtain set to rise on the Taipei International Flora Expo in 25 days,
the city government is making all-out efforts to promote the first-ever event of
its kind in Taiwan globally.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday,  Taipei  Mayor Hau Lung-bin  invited  renowned Taiwan-born singer
Betty Pai, better known locally as Pai Chia-li, to serve as "the global
publicity ambassador" of the flower expo, which will take place from Nov. 6
through April 25, 2011.</P>
      <P>Pai,  who now lives in Indonesia, said after accepting a certificate for her new
job that she will do whatever she can to help promote the expo, even though she
is not in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the city government said it will host a star-studded concert Oct. 17
at the Taipei City Hall plaza to drum up support for the floral show.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts of the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>While conferring the "flora expo ambassador" certificate to Pai, Hau said he
hopes the retired singer will use her international reputation and personal
charisma to help upgrade the Taipei Flora Expo's global profile.</P>
      <P>In response, Pai said it is a great honor for her to serve as the flower show's
spokeswoman.</P>
      <P>"I take pride in helping promote the event and I will do my utmost to attract as
many foreigners as possible to visit the show, " said Pai, who held the
reputation of being the "most beautiful TV show host" in her 1970s heyday.</P>
      <P>Hau also used the occasion to thank the many heavyweight pop idols and rock
bands scheduled to perform at the Sunday concert, including Jay Chou, Wu Bai,
Lin Chi-ling, Mayday and S.H.E., for their support for the city government's
cause. (Oct. 13, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Local people have shown keen interest in the upcoming expo as a larger-than-
expected number of uninvited ordinary people have swarmed to the 91.8-hectare
exhibition site that has been opened since Oct. 9 for a trial run, city
officials said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>According  to the city government's  plan,  only certified volunteers and
invited guests were to have been allowed to enter the exhibition ground in the
first stage of the trial run from Oct. 9-20. However, many uninvited people
entered the site in the first four days of the trial run, causing protests from
people who have bought tickets for entry after the show is formally inaugurated.</P>
      <P>City government  spokeswoman  Chao Hsin-ping said uninvited citizens were
allowed to enter mainly because the invited volunteers did not show up in the
numbers expected.</P>
      <P>"As the number of people at the exhibition site is capped at 10,000 during the
trial period, if the ceiling is not met, ordinary citizens are allowed to
enter," Chao explained.</P>
      <P>From Friday, the trial period will enter the second stage, in which volunteers
with invitation cards will be eligible to enter the exhibition halls, while
uninvited people will only be allowed to visit the open-air exhibition grounds,
Chao said.</P>
      <P>In the first three days of the trial run, Chao said, the city government
collected 2,478 responses from invited volunteers to gauge their opinions of the
facilities. Among them, 73 percent gave positive responses, she added. (Oct. 13,

      <P>Cho Shih-chao, who was recently named to take over as director-general of the
Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) , is expected to assume his new post on Oct. 18,
the BOFT said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Cho, who at present is Taiwan's representative to Kuwait, will return to Taipei
Oct. 17 and take the official seal the next day from BOFT acting director-
general Chang Chun-fu, with Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Sheng-chung

agreement (ECFA) signed in late June, the BOFT said.</P>
      <P>Before being dispatched to Kuwait, Cho had served as the director of the

and the director of the MOEA's Department of Economic Trade Affairs, the BOFT
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Labor groups pan CLA over reward plan to catch runaway workers</HEADLINE>

10/13/10  15:24:12

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs' (CLA's) plan to offer a NT$5,000 (US$161.29)
reward for catching runaway migrant workers elicited an angry reaction Wednesday
from labor rights groups, which accused the council of ignoring the root of the
problem.</P>
      <P>"The CLA has failed to resolve the crux of the matter, which is the heavy
exploitation that many migrant workers are subjected to. Putting a reward on
those who run away will not solve the problem, " said Son You-lian, secretary-
general of Taiwan's Labor Front.</P>
      <P>The CLA on Tuesday said it plans to revamp its reward system by giving
informants the NT$5,000 reward for each person they help catch rather than for
confirmed reports on runaways.</P>
      <P>The council also plans to raise the existing NT$2,000 reward for nabbing illegal
employers and unscrupulous brokerage firms by 10 to 25 times.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training Deputy-Director Liao Wen-jen said
the policy's details will be announced in two weeks.</P>
      <P>Son and the Taiwan International Worker's Association (TIWA) also questioned
whether the CLA had looked at the issue from the broader perspective of how many
foreign workers should be in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"What we want the government to do is examine the legitimacy and practicality of
the overall policy of importing workers into Taiwan. Do we really need that many
foreign workers in Taiwan?" Son asked.</P>
      <P>Unless the CLA has enough safeguards in place to ensure the safety of the
migrants' working conditions, he added, the government should think twice before
opening Taiwan's doors to them.</P>
      <P>The dangers foreign workers face in Taiwan and the problem of runaway workers
came into focus again last month when six Indonesian workers -- all undocumented
-- were killed in an accident at a construction site off National Freeway No. 6
in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking to reporters at the Legislative Yuan on Wednesday, Premier Wu Den-yih
estimated that there were 30,000 undocumented foreign workers at large in
Taiwan,</P>
      <P>According to the TIWA, there are actually 33,510 runaway foreign workers from
2005 to the present in Taiwan who are still unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>Wu told reporters that the Cabinet has already requested the CLA, the National
Immigration Agency, and the National Police Agency to come up with suitable
measures to locate the runaways.</P>
      <P>The premier added, however, that related government agencies should also handle
the matter carefully to ensure that the workers are fairly treated, especially
those who were exploited on the job.</P>
      <P>CLA Chairwoman Wang Ju-hsuan said at the beginning of October that the council
will hold a meeting in two weeks to discuss the possibility of allowing migrant
workers to change employers at will -- a policy strongly supported by labor
groups.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.20 percent Wednesday on a technical rebound from
the previous session, but the gains were compromised by selling in large-cap
electronics stocks amid renewed concerns over the earnings outlook, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 16.44 points to 8,106.66, after moving between 8,067.87
and 8,143.19, on turnover of NT$104.80 billion (US$3.38 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.33 percent and buying in select old economy stocks lifted
the index to the day's high, while fears of falling global demand for high-tech
products capped the gains on the broader market, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,680 stocks closed up and 1,975 were down, with 400 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector scored the highest gains, up 2.13 percent on global
rising pulp prices, according to the dealers.</P>
      <P>Plastics and chemicals rose 1.39 percent, construction stocks added 0.6 percent,
foodstuffs gained 0.44 percent, cement stocks added 0.38 percent and textile
stocks closed up 0.08 percent.</P>
      <P>The financial sector rose 0.06 percent, while machinery and electronics stocks
gained 0.01 percent.</P>
      <P>"With recent U.S. economic data pointing to a sluggish economic climate, fears
of a slowing fourth quarter for the electronics sector came back to haunt
investors, " Concord Securities analyst Allen Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said a rising New Taiwan dollar further dampened market sentiment as
investors were afraid that the local high-tech sector will suffer foreign
exchange losses that are expected to impact fourth quarter earnings.</P>
      <P>"As the high-tech sector remained lackluster, it was difficult for the market to
get out of the current trade range, although some rotational buying boosted the
traditional industrial sector, " Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that ahead of the strong technical resistance at around the 8,200
point-mark,  the market is expected to continue in consolidation mode.</P>
      <P>Among the large electronics stocks, smartphone maker HTC fell 4.29 percent to
close at NT$669.00 and cell phone camera lens producer Largan Precision shed
6.54 percent to finish at NT$543.00.</P>
      <P>In the paper and pulp sector, Shihlin Paper rose 1.62 percent to end the day at
NT$72.60 and Chung Hwa Pulp gained 2.55 percent to NT$16.10 at the close of

      <P>Judges should take the lead in judicial reform in order to win back public trust
in the country's court system, new Judicial Yuan President Rai Hau-min said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Judges should act like a 'get-out-the-vote organizer' in an election campaign
in order to speed up much-anticipated judicial reform to restore public faith in
our judiciary and court system, " Rai said after accepting the post's official
seal from the top judicial body's acting president, Hsieh Tsay-chuan, at a
changeover ceremony.</P>
      <P>In the wake of a spate of scandals involving senior judges that have marred the
judiciary's image, Rai said restoring public trust in the judicial system is his
priority concern and task.</P>
      <P>"Integrity, professionalism and public trust will be our top reform goals," he
added.</P>
      <P>Rai, a veteran lawyer who once served as chairman of the Central Election
Commission, said he will direct the formation of a national judicial reform
committee to work out a detailed reform agenda within a year.</P>
      <P>"In carrying out reform programs, we will follow the principles of establishing
an incorruptible,  transparent,  responsive and efficient judicial system," Rai
pledged.</P>
      <P>Also assuming office Wednesday was Judicial Yuan Vice President Su Yeong-chin, a
law professor and a confidant of President Ma Ying-jeou who once headed the
National Communications Commission.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 24, President Ma nominated Rai as the new Judicial Yuan head, with Su
Yeong-chin as his deputy.</P>
      <P>The two Judicial Yuan posts became vacant after Lai In-jaw and Hsieh Tsay-chuan
resigned in July as president and vice president, respectively, to take
responsibility for a scandal in which three senior judges were detained for
alleged corruption.</P>
      <P>The nominations of Rai and Su were confirmed by the Legislative Yuan in two
separate votes last Friday.</P>

      <P>Turnover totaled US$709 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at the day's high of NT$31.070 and moved to a low of

      <P>An initiative that helps poor families by distributing free fish to them will
continue again this year in an effort to bridge the health gap between the rich
and the less well-off, an association for the underprivileged said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Under the initiative begun in 2008, at least 50,000 fish will be distributed for
children living in poverty and old people living alone in Yunlin,  Nantou  and
Chiayi  counties,  the Care of Underprivileged Communities Society said at a
press conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Two mothers who have previously been given the free fish attended the event with
their children, one of whom said she seldom cooks fish for her child because the
family cannot afford it.</P>
      <P>"When my kid told me the fish we were given was really delicious, I got mixed
feelings. I felt kind of sad but touched by society's warmth," said the young
mom known by surname as Lai.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Chia-chun, one of the initiators of the plan, said the charity
drive is expected to continue until next January.</P>
      <P>The program was launched out of concern over the gap in development between
children in the cities and the countryside, said Yayu Wong, the co-organizer of
the project.</P>
      <P>Doctors in Taiwan have found that children in disadvantaged communities fall
behind their urban peers in physical growth and intelligence due to insufficient
intake of fish, which contains nutrients essential to brain development, Wong
noted.</P>
      <P>He added the society gave away more than 45,000 fish to 4,000 poor families from
2008 through last January.</P>

      <P>From the adventures of a peeping Tom to Chinese martial arts action to the
comical yet touching tale of a blind man and his niece, the Taiwanese film
industry is posed to tickle funny bones and jerk tears with 15 new films to be
released in the next six months.</P>
      <P>The wave of new movies signifies the once-waning Taiwanese motion film sector is
reviving on a steady and upward pace, Government Information Office Minister
Johnny Chiang said at a press conference on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"In recent years, the Taiwanese film industry has been performing extremely well
in terms of both quality and quantity. I believe the upcoming 15 films will also
be successful blockbusters, " said Chiang, calling on Taiwanese directors and
producers to set Hollywood as their ultimate goal.</P>
      <P>The 15 films slated to hit the silver screen include "When Love Comes" directed
by Chang Tso-chi, who is currently at the Pusan International Film Festival to
showcase the movie in the prestigious "Gala Presentation" category. The film has
also won 14 Golden Horse nominations, including Best Supporting Actor and
Actress.</P>
      <P>Oscar-nominated director John Woo's "Reign of Assassins" is a US$10 million
action-packed epic set during the time of ancient Chinese warlords and sword
fighters. The movie is already set to be distributed in over 60 countries,
including the United States, said co-executive producer Tang Chai-yang.</P>
      <P>Described  by some film critics as a Chinese version  of Brangelina's "Mr. and
Mrs. Smith, " the film features international superstar Michelle Yeoh and South
Korea's Jung Woo-sung as a married couple, with each spouse seemingly unaware
the other is a clandestine world-class assassin.</P>
      <P>"The movie is completely unique from other Chinese martial arts films such as
'Hero' or 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' because it is not based on any
historical figure or event. It is purely about the warrior and fighter society
of ancient China," said Tang.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first 3-D animation film "Memory Loss" is scheduled to dazzle
moviegoers in January as the audience accompanies the young heroine, Hsiao Ta,
on an incredible journey to a magical place where lost memories are stored.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's sweetheart Megan Lai will star in the romantic comedy "Will You Still
Love Me" with eye candy actor Tony Yang, who is also starring in three other
films: "Snowfall in Taipei, " "Tempest of First Love, " and "Dancing Without
You, " which features mega singer and actress Vivian Hsu.</P>
      <P>One of the most noticeable films in the ensemble of 15 is "My Blind Uncle, "
featuring Lin Fu-sheng, who is a 39-year-old visually impaired masseur in real
life, and a young Teng Yun-ting, who plays a traumatized niece learning to live
with her blind uncle.</P>

      <P>The government launched a subsidy program Wednesday in an effort to increase the
number of electric cars on the roads in the next three years as part of a long-
term plan to boost the industry.</P>
      <P>Woody T.J. Duh, director-general of the Industrial Development Bureau under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, said the government has set aside about NT$2.3
billion (US$74 million) in subsidies for 10 cases, with the aim of getting 3,000
electric cars on the roads by 2013 and increasing the number to 60,000 by 2016.</P>
      <P>The bureau said the program -- which offers subsidies of up to 40 percent of the
vehicle budgets for the cases whose applications for the subsidies are accepted
-- will encourage local companies to use the electric vehicles.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's dense population and short distances between cities make it suitable
for developing intelligent electric vehicles, " Duh said during the
International Forum of Intelligent Electric Vehicle Pilot Run that took place in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The program is expected to generate NT$120 billion in benefit for the
manufacturing sector and NT$31.2 billion for the service sector over a six-year
period, as well as to provide 24,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>Jacques Saint-Marc, general manager of a group that promotes electric vehicles
in France, said at the half-day forum that the French public enjoy a subsidy of
5,000 euros plus tax breaks when they purchase an electric car.</P>
      <P>Peter Nimmo, chief executive officer of ECOtality Australia, a company committed
to developing clean energy technologies, said that more effort should be made
that goes beyond just the subsidy program.</P>
      <P>"Government support in the early stages is vital," he noted. "For the long term,
battery-charging infrastructure should be sustainable without public funding."</P>

      <P>A Taiwan-based solar cell firm - Motech Industries, Inc - said Wednesday it has
extended its foothold to photovoltaic (PV) module production by unveiling two
models of poly-crystalline modules under its brand name.</P>
      <P>Solar cells are devices that convert sunlight into electricity by the
photovoltaic effect. Solar cells are welded together into a matrix,  which  are
sealed  with other components  to produce photovoltaic modules, also known as
solar panels.</P>
      <P>The company said its two new models -- IM60 and IM72 modules -- have  been
certified  by Underwriter  Laboratories  Inc.  and International
Electrotechnical Commission, and the first shipments have hit the U.S. market.</P>
      <P>The two models, powered by Motech's cells, are designed for both residential and
commercial markets, the company said.</P>
      <P>Motech said the PV module production is the company's efforts to engage in
vertical integration and expand its role in the solar energy equipment supply
chain.</P>
      <P>"Our quest to enter the module business is to provide more value to our
customers and help them succeed, " Motech President and Chief Executive Office
P.H. Chang said in a statement.</P>
      <P>"Our intent is to produce our modules in alignment with the market demand and to

      <P>A majority of Taiwan's office workers were not happy with their jobs, mainly
because of the long work hours and low salary, according to the results of a
survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>More than 60 percent of the respondents to the online survey conducted by two
job banks, iJob and Jcase, said the longer they worked, the less happy they
were.</P>
      <P>Fifty-six percent even said they have often put on fake smiles in the workplace,
especially when talking to colleagues they do not like.</P>
      <P>Almost 80 percent of the office workers even said they get depressed whenever
they think about their job.</P>
      <P>If the level of happiness could be measured by a 1-to-10-point scale, the office
workers would only get an average point of 5.65, the survey said.</P>
      <P>The imbalance between wages and work hours have brought down the happiness
level, Hsu Chin-huang, general manager of Jcase, said.</P>
      <P>The report also indicated that more than 56 percent of the workers said they
will feel happy only if they get a pay raise, while nearly 30 percent said they
would be happier if the colleagues or managers they loath have been punished or
leave the workplace.</P>
      <P>In terms of the reasons why the respondents hold negative attitudes against
their colleagues, the survey found 87 percent of the office workers have been
betrayed at work.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-mei, marketing manager of iJob, said in order to create a harmonious
working environment, workers should learn how to deal with stress since it is
the main factor causing conflicts between colleagues.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese opera troupe Ming Hwa Yuan wowed a packed German audience at the
Admiralspalast theater in Berlin Tuesday with its fascinating signature show,
The Living Buddha.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that a Taiwanese opera, also known as Gezaixi, has ever
been performed on a German stage.</P>
      <P>The play was also the opener of the 80-year-old Taiwanese troupe's first-ever
performance tour in Europe, although it had performed previously in individual
European cities, including in Paris more than 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>To help German theater goers understand the plot of the opera, the troupe
projected German-language subtitles of the libretto on both sides of the stage.
The audience seemed to be very receptive to the show as they often burst into
laughter throughout the play. All troupe members received enthusiastic applause
during the curtain call.</P>
      <P>Kristina Weinert,  a German ballet dancer,  said that for Europeans, the show
was like a fairy tale full of humor that were often seen in real everyday life.
Although the show contained cultural elements that were strange to her, Weinert
said she found great fascination in it.</P>
      <P>Guenter Knabe, a journalist with Voice of Germany's Asian department, said he
believes that Gezaixi should not be too difficult for European audiences to
understand.</P>
      <P>At the end of the show, Taiwan's first lady Chow Mei-ching, who is accompanying
the troupe on the tour, stood up from her seat to greet and thank the audience
in her capacity as honorary director of the Ming Hwa Yuan troupe.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a cocktail reception marking the success of the show, Chow said she
takes pride in accompanying the popular opera group on its ongoing six-country
European performance tour.</P>
      <P>"I hope more Taiwanese performing groups will present shows in Germany to boost
cultural exchanges," she added.</P>
      <P>Chow also exchanged greetings and chats with German officials, parliamentarians,
journalists and diplomats of Taiwan's diplomatic allies stationed in Germany.</P>
      <P>In the coming few days, Chow will visit the Berlin municipal library and several
tourist attractions before returning to Taipei Oct. 16.</P>
      <P>The Ming Hwa Yuan troupe will give one more show in Berlin Wednesday and will
then perform in six other European cities -- Prague, Vienna, Paris, London,
Edinburgh and Amsterdam.</P>
      <P>Apart from formal performances, the troupe will also hold workshops at
universities to introduce the traditional Taiwanese art form to audiences in

a government-sponsored program that promotes the growth of high-quality leaves,
a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Since late 2009, the council has provided consulting and advanced techniques for

certifications including ISO 22000 and HACCP, Tsai Hsien-tsung, director of the

      <P>Taiwanese tea has become more competitive against foreign teas, Tsai said,

      <P>Tea growers in areas such as Taipei County's Pinglin and Sansia townships,
Taoyuan County, Hsinchu County, and Nantou County's Mingjian Jhushan townships

      <P>Tsai said that as tea grown in the Taipei Sansia area has no pesticide residue,
its price has risen from NT$70 (US$2) for 600 grams last year to NT$120 for now.</P>

      <P>Taiwan on Wednesday welcomed a plan by the Hong Kong government to set up its
office in the country, according to the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , the
government agency in charge of policies toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong's Chief Executive Donald Tsang Yam-kuen said in his administrative
report to the legislature earlier Wednesday that his government  will discuss
with Taiwan  plans  to establish  a "comprehensive" office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In response, a MAC official who asked not to be named, confirmed that both sides
have begun contacts with each other on the proposed office.</P>
      <P>The official said the Hong Kong government will submit a concrete plan,
including details about the office's structure, operations and number of
personnel, for discussions with Taipei by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The new office will be another breakthrough  in bilateral relations between
Taiwan and Hong Kong following the establishment of two semi-official
organizations -- the Taipei-based Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic and Cultural
Cooperation Council and the Hong Kong-based Hong Kong-Taiwan Economic and
Cultural Cooperation and Promotion Council -- earlier this year to deepen
exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-Hong Kong ties only began to warm up following improved relations between
Taipei and Beijing after President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008. The former
British colony returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.</P>

      <P>Two more Taiwan banks have been given approval to set up branches on mainland
China, bringing to six the number of local financial institutions that have
gotten the green light to do business in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Hua Nan Bank and Cathay United Bank hope to open a branch each, in Shenzhen and
Shanghai respectively, before the end of the year, bank officials said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The approval, given by China's Banking Regulatory Commission, came about a month
after four other major banks of Taiwan were allowed to set up branches in China.</P>
      <P>In mid-September, the Chinese banking regulator approved plans by the Land Bank
of Taiwan, Taiwan Cooperative Bank, First Bank and Chang Hwa Bank to set up
branches in Shanghai and two cities in neighboring Jiansu Province.</P>
      <P>No Chinese banks have been allowed to set up branches in Taiwan although the
Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have been given permission by
Taiwanese regulators to have a representative office here, a usual step prior to
officially opening a branch.</P>
      <P>A third Chinese institution, China Merchants Bank, has filed an application to
establish a representative office on the island.</P>

      <P>Preparations for conducting formal negotiations on an economic cooperation
agreement between Taiwan and Singapore  have been going smoothly,  Premier Wu
Den-yih said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the sidelines of a ceremony for the 11th National Standardization
Award in Taipei, Wu said the two countries still have more work to do before
official talks on the trade deal can begin.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Singapore agreed to explore the feasibility of signing a trade
agreement in August this year, and since then they have been in close contact
regarding the issue, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Singapore still have to decide who will head the negotiations for
each side, he said, adding that the two countries would alternate hosting
discussions.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Taiwan has also initiated talks with Japan over the signing of

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's lowest housing supply ratio not a problem: official</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  13 (CNA)
10/13/10  23:06:06</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has recorded the lowest ratio of housing supply to households in the
second quarter of this year in 10 years, but that does not mean there is an
inadequate supply of housing here, said the Construction and Planning Agency
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ratio of 99.89 to 100 -- meaning there are 99.89 units of housing for every
100 households -- is still a relatively healthy ratio, according to Wang An-
Chiang, an official of the agency.</P>
      <P>Wang attributed  the lower ratio to inconsistency  between household
registration and residency, which has resulted in an increase in the number of
households registered.</P>
      <P>For example, he added, some people buy or rent property in a popular school
district without actually living there, but they register their kids under that
address so that the kids can go to a prestigious school in the neighborhood,
practices contributing to inflated household number.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the ratio was also affected by an underestimate of the housing
supply, Wang said.</P>
      <P>More than 7.86 million units of housing were registered in the second quarter.
The main reason for the underestimation is that the basic supply figure comes
from the last population census taken nearly 10 years ago.  Wang said the agency
will adjust the number once the next census, scheduled to begin later this year,
is completed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, central Taiwan's Taichung City has the highest ratio of housing units
to households - a ratio of 118.37 to 100.</P>
      <P>Cities and counties with a housing supply ratio of over 100 percent include
Keelung City, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City, and Taipei County, according to the
statistics.</P>
      <P>The outlying Kinmen Island has the lowest figure of below 50 percent, while
Penghu County, Yulin County and Taitung County were all below 90 percent. (By

    <HEADLINE>Trade-related Taiwan-China dialogue platform to begin this year</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A platform that will allow regular dialogue between Taiwan and China will be set
up and put to use before the end of this year, to deal with issues or disputes
related to the landmark trade deal signed between the two sides in June, Premier
Wu Den-yih said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Through this dialogue platform, Wu said, the two sides will consult  with each
other on matters related  to the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA)
, as well as other economic issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Despite decades of booming trade between Taiwan and China, as well as billions
of dollars of Taiwanese investments in China, no such platform has existed
between the two sides for investors or business people to resolve disputes. And
since there are no formal ties between the two sides, there were no government
representative offices in each other's territory.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese investors encountering problems in the mainland, for example, could
only go through China's government offices for help, with no representation by
Taiwanese authorities.</P>
      <P>The ECFA reduces tariffs on exports, eases or lifts non-tariff trade barriers
and gives each side greater access to the other's market - which could
potentially bring about more trade between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The pact stipulates that a "cross-strait economic cooperation committee" should
be created to handle follow-up negotiations or disputes. Since the trade deal
took effect on Sept. 12, Wu said, the platform should be established, Wu said.</P>
      <P>As to when the platform will be inaugurated, the premier said it depends on when
the two sides' existing quasi-official intermediary bodies -- the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), finalize their consultations.</P>
      <P>According to Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Sheng-chung, the platform or
"committee" will comprise several working panels in charge of merchandise trade,
service trade, dispute mechanism and investment affairs.</P>
      <P>The panels will be headed by department or bureau chiefs under the Ministry of
Economic affairs who will meet with their Chinese counterparts biannually, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>He added that both sides have reached a preliminary consensus that the
"committee" will be headed by a vice ministerial-level official from each side.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Wednesday that Taiwan would not accept any preconditions
from China in its overture to dismantle missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan and China want to build mutual trust and ensure peace, neither side
should set any preconditions or attach any terms to the cause, "  Wu told a
legislative committee when fielding questions on cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>"The two sides should be fully sincere so as to work best together and guarantee
progress toward peace," he added.</P>
      <P>Yang Yi, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's State Council,
said earlier in the day that both sides of the strait could start contact on
military issues, including confidence building measures (CBMs) through
appropriate methods.</P>
      <P>Yang's remarks came after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao suggested in late September
that Beijing could "eventually" remove its missiles pointing at Taiwan "sometime
in the future."</P>
      <P>A spokesman for China's defense ministry also said recently that under the "one
China" precondition, Beijing would consider removing the missiles it has aimed
at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"But how can we accept Beijing's offer if the 'one China' precondition is
attached?" Wu asked.</P>
      <P>Stressing that conditions are "not yet ripe" for Taiwan and China to hold a
political dialogue, the premier said that Taiwan would not agree to proposals
calling for the abolishment of the "imaginary border" in the strait, because
doing so would leave Taiwan unable to defend itself.</P>
      <P>Citing results of a public opinion poll, Wu said around 43 percent of Taiwan's
people think the government's pace in handling cross-strait affairs is adequate,
while 37 percent, a two-year high, think it is too fast and 12 percent believe
it is too slow.</P>
      <P>"Judging from this, it is clear that we should not move too fast in dealing with
China, " he said.</P>

      <P>Judges should take the lead in judicial reform in order to win back public trust
in the country's court system, new Judicial Yuan President Rai Hau-min said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Judges should act like a 'get-out-the-vote organizer' in an election campaign
in order to speed up much-anticipated judicial reform to restore public faith in
our judiciary and court system, " Rai said after accepting the post's official
seal from the top judicial body's acting president, Hsieh Tsay-chuan, at a
changeover ceremony.</P>
      <P>In the wake of a spate of scandals involving senior judges that have marred the
judiciary's image, Rai said restoring public trust in the judicial system is his
priority concern and task.</P>
      <P>"Integrity, professionalism and public trust will be our top reform goals," he
added.</P>
      <P>Rai, a veteran lawyer who once served as chairman of the Central Election
Commission, said he will direct the formation of a national judicial reform
committee to work out a detailed reform agenda within a year.</P>
      <P>"In carrying out reform programs, we will follow the principles of establishing
an incorruptible,  transparent,  responsive and efficient judicial system," Rai
pledged.</P>
      <P>Also assuming office Wednesday was Judicial Yuan Vice President Su Yeong-chin, a
law professor and a confidant of President Ma Ying-jeou who once headed the
National Communications Commission.</P>
      <P>On Aug. 24, President Ma nominated Rai as the new Judicial Yuan head, with Su
Yeong-chin as his deputy.</P>
      <P>The two Judicial Yuan posts became vacant after Lai In-jaw and Hsieh Tsay-chuan
resigned in July as president and vice president, respectively, to take
responsibility for a scandal in which three senior judges were detained for
alleged corruption.</P>
      <P>The nominations of Rai and Su were confirmed by the Legislative Yuan in two
separate votes last Friday.</P>

      <P>An initiative that helps poor families by distributing free fish to them will
continue again this year in an effort to bridge the health gap between the rich
and the less well-off, an association for the underprivileged said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Under the initiative begun in 2008, at least 50,000 fish will be distributed for
children living in poverty and old people living alone in Yunlin,  Nantou  and
Chiayi  counties,  the Care of Underprivileged Communities Society said at a
press conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Two mothers who have previously been given the free fish attended the event with
their children, one of whom said she seldom cooks fish for her child because the
family cannot afford it.</P>
      <P>"When my kid told me the fish we were given was really delicious, I got mixed
feelings. I felt kind of sad but touched by society's warmth," said the young
mom known by surname as Lai.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chang Chia-chun, one of the initiators of the plan, said the charity
drive is expected to continue until next January.</P>
      <P>The program was launched out of concern over the gap in development between
children in the cities and the countryside, said Yayu Wong, the co-organizer of
the project.</P>
      <P>Doctors in Taiwan have found that children in disadvantaged communities fall
behind their urban peers in physical growth and intelligence due to insufficient
intake of fish, which contains nutrients essential to brain development, Wong
noted.</P>
      <P>He added the society gave away more than 45,000 fish to 4,000 poor families from
2008 through last January.</P>

      <P>From the adventures of a peeping Tom to Chinese martial arts action to the
comical yet touching tale of a blind man and his niece, the Taiwanese film
industry is posed to tickle funny bones and jerk tears with 15 new films to be
released in the next six months.</P>
      <P>The wave of new movies signifies the once-waning Taiwanese motion film sector is
reviving on a steady and upward pace, Government Information Office Minister
Johnny Chiang said at a press conference on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"In recent years, the Taiwanese film industry has been performing extremely well
in terms of both quality and quantity. I believe the upcoming 15 films will also
be successful blockbusters, " said Chiang, calling on Taiwanese directors and
producers to set Hollywood as their ultimate goal.</P>
      <P>The 15 films slated to hit the silver screen include "When Love Comes" directed
by Chang Tso-chi, who is currently at the Pusan International Film Festival to
showcase the movie in the prestigious "Gala Presentation" category. The film has
also won 14 Golden Horse nominations, including Best Supporting Actor and
Actress.</P>
      <P>Oscar-nominated director John Woo's "Reign of Assassins" is a US$10 million
action-packed epic set during the time of ancient Chinese warlords and sword
fighters. The movie is already set to be distributed in over 60 countries,
including the United States, said co-executive producer Tang Chai-yang.</P>
      <P>Described  by some film critics as a Chinese version  of Brangelina's "Mr. and
Mrs. Smith, " the film features international superstar Michelle Yeoh and South
Korea's Jung Woo-sung as a married couple, with each spouse seemingly unaware
the other is a clandestine world-class assassin.</P>
      <P>"The movie is completely unique from other Chinese martial arts films such as
'Hero' or 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' because it is not based on any
historical figure or event. It is purely about the warrior and fighter society
of ancient China," said Tang.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first 3-D animation film "Memory Loss" is scheduled to dazzle
moviegoers in January as the audience accompanies the young heroine, Hsiao Ta,
on an incredible journey to a magical place where lost memories are stored.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's sweetheart Megan Lai will star in the romantic comedy "Will You Still
Love Me" with eye candy actor Tony Yang, who is also starring in three other
films: "Snowfall in Taipei, " "Tempest of First Love, " and "Dancing Without
You, " which features mega singer and actress Vivian Hsu.</P>
      <P>One of the most noticeable films in the ensemble of 15 is "My Blind Uncle, "

      <P>The government launched a subsidy program Wednesday in an effort to increase the
number of electric cars on the roads in the next three years as part of a long-
term plan to boost the industry.</P>
      <P>Woody T.J. Duh, director-general of the Industrial Development Bureau under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs, said the government has set aside about NT$2.3
billion (US$74 million) in subsidies for 10 cases, with the aim of getting 3,000
electric cars on the roads by 2013 and increasing the number to 60,000 by 2016.</P>
      <P>The bureau said the program -- which offers subsidies of up to 40 percent of the
vehicle budgets for the cases whose applications for the subsidies are accepted
-- will encourage local companies to use the electric vehicles.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's dense population and short distances between cities make it suitable
for developing intelligent electric vehicles, " Duh said during the
International Forum of Intelligent Electric Vehicle Pilot Run that took place in
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The program is expected to generate NT$120 billion in benefit for the
manufacturing sector and NT$31.2 billion for the service sector over a six-year
period, as well as to provide 24,000 jobs.</P>
      <P>Jacques Saint-Marc, general manager of a group that promotes electric vehicles
in France, said at the half-day forum that the French public enjoy a subsidy of
5,000 euros plus tax breaks when they purchase an electric car.</P>
      <P>Peter Nimmo, chief executive officer of ECOtality Australia, a company committed
to developing clean energy technologies, said that more effort should be made
that goes beyond just the subsidy program.</P>
      <P>"Government support in the early stages is vital," he noted. "For the long term,

      <P>A Taiwan-based solar cell firm - Motech Industries, Inc - said Wednesday it has
extended its foothold to photovoltaic (PV) module production by unveiling two
models of poly-crystalline modules under its brand name.</P>
      <P>Solar cells are devices that convert sunlight into electricity by the
photovoltaic effect. Solar cells are welded together into a matrix,  which  are
sealed  with other components  to produce photovoltaic modules, also known as
solar panels.</P>
      <P>The company said its two new models -- IM60 and IM72 modules -- have  been
certified  by Underwriter  Laboratories  Inc.  and International
Electrotechnical Commission, and the first shipments have hit the U.S. market.</P>
      <P>The two models, powered by Motech's cells, are designed for both residential and
commercial markets, the company said.</P>
      <P>Motech said the PV module production is the company's efforts to engage in

      <P>Several health and medical institutions that entered the 2010 health education
material contest organized by the Department of Health (DOH) were awarded
Wednesday for their outstanding entries.</P>
      <P>This year, a total of 335 health-related materials were submitted by hospitals
and clinics, health authorities and non-government organizations as entries in
the contest, which has taken place every two years since 2004, said Kung Hsien-
lan, deputy director-general of the Bureau of Health Promotion under the DOH.</P>
      <P>The materials,  divided into four categories  --  posters, brochures, booklets
and videos -- were evaluated by eight experts in the relevant fields for
accuracy, readability and creativity.</P>
      <P>Kung said that the winning materials -- 12 awards of excellence and 20 awards of
merit -- had already been put online on the Health 99 Education Resource, the
bureau's website.</P>
      <P>One of the contestants, Lee Li-ting of the John Tung Foundation, said that
putting together a promotion brochure on health and medical issues is no easy
task.</P>
      <P>Lee's team, which won an award of excellence for a simple diagnostic
questionnaire  for college  students  with possible depression, spent about one
year collecting medical information, consulting psychologists and designing the
questions.</P>
      <P>The questionnaire is already being used by Tamkang University, Fu Jen Catholic

      <P>Government agencies, local authorities and social groups will create a care
network  to help immigrants nationwide from next year, Hsieh Li-kung, director-
general of the National Immigration Agency (NIA) , said at a conference in
Kinmen County Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the network, which will seek to integrate resources among the
agency, local governments and non-governmental organizations, would start a
trial run later this year in 10 cities and counties including Kinmen County,
Taipei County and Kaohsiung County.</P>
      <P>All the nation's 25 local governments will eventually be able to share and
benefit from the network, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>"We really want to invite all kinds of resources from every possible channel to
demonstrate  our commitment  to respecting different cultures," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of the Interior, the number of foreign spouses in
Taiwan had surpassed 430,000 by August, accounting for 1.9 percent of the total
population in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Li Wo-shi said the new immigrants were a vital part of
the county, adding that it would fully support the new integration to help
assimilate various cultures to Kinmen.</P>
      <P>By the end of this August, new immigrants made up 1,958 of Kinmen's 95,873
residents, or 2.04 percent, the Kinmen County government said. Of the 32,248
households in Kinmen, one in 16.5 includes immigrant family members, it said.</P>

      <P>A majority of Taiwan's office workers were not happy with their jobs, mainly
because of the long work hours and low salary, according to the results of a
survey released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>More than 60 percent of the respondents to the online survey conducted by two
job banks, iJob and Jcase, said the longer they worked, the less happy they
were.</P>
      <P>Fifty-six percent even said they have often put on fake smiles in the workplace,
especially when talking to colleagues they do not like.</P>
      <P>Almost 80 percent of the office workers even said they get depressed whenever
they think about their job.</P>
      <P>If the level of happiness could be measured by a 1-to-10-point scale, the office
workers would only get an average point of 5.65, the survey said.</P>
      <P>The imbalance between wages and work hours have brought down the happiness
level, Hsu Chin-huang, general manager of Jcase, said.</P>
      <P>The report also indicated that more than 56 percent of the workers said they
will feel happy only if they get a pay raise, while nearly 30 percent said they
would be happier if the colleagues or managers they loath have been punished or
leave the workplace.</P>
      <P>In terms of the reasons why the respondents hold negative attitudes against
their colleagues, the survey found 87 percent of the office workers have been
betrayed at work.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-mei, marketing manager of iJob, said in order to create a harmonious
working environment, workers should learn how to deal with stress since it is
the main factor causing conflicts between colleagues.</P>
      <P>The online survey, carried out from Sept. 13 to Oct. 1, collected a total of
1,314 valid samples with a confidence level of 95 percent and a margin of error
of 2.7 percent.</P>

      <P>Jiaming Lake, a popular hiking spot in eastern Taiwan, will reopen to the public
in early November after being closed for more than a year following a major
typhoon, a forestry official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The 11.5 kilometer trail linking the Siangyang National Forest Recreation Area

      <P>After a yearlong restoration, the oval lake, with sapphire water that is said to
be "as beautiful as angels' tears, " has become "even more charming," office
director Chang Tieh-chu said.</P>
      <P>The hiking trails have been fully repaired, with wildlife such as Formosan
yellow-throated martens and Taiwan field mice seen by office staffers in the
area. Alishan salamanders, a protected species endemic to Taiwan, have also
inhabited a refuge cottage.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese opera troupe Ming Hwa Yuan wowed a packed German audience at the
Admiralspalast theater in Berlin Tuesday with its fascinating signature show,
The Living Buddha.</P>
      <P>It marked the first time that a Taiwanese opera, also known as Gezaixi, has ever
been performed on a German stage.</P>
      <P>The play was also the opener of the 80-year-old Taiwanese troupe's first-ever
performance tour in Europe, although it had performed previously in individual
European cities, including in Paris more than 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>To help German theater goers understand the plot of the opera, the troupe
projected German-language subtitles of the libretto on both sides of the stage.
The audience seemed to be very receptive to the show as they often burst into
laughter throughout the play. All troupe members received enthusiastic applause
during the curtain call.</P>
      <P>Kristina Weinert,  a German ballet dancer,  said that for Europeans, the show
was like a fairy tale full of humor that were often seen in real everyday life.
Although the show contained cultural elements that were strange to her, Weinert
said she found great fascination in it.</P>
      <P>Guenter Knabe, a journalist with Voice of Germany's Asian department, said he
believes that Gezaixi should not be too difficult for European audiences to
understand.</P>
      <P>At the end of the show, Taiwan's first lady Chow Mei-ching, who is accompanying
the troupe on the tour, stood up from her seat to greet and thank the audience
in her capacity as honorary director of the Ming Hwa Yuan troupe.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a cocktail reception marking the success of the show, Chow said she
takes pride in accompanying the popular opera group on its ongoing six-country
European performance tour.</P>
      <P>"I hope more Taiwanese performing groups will present shows in Germany to boost
cultural exchanges," she added.</P>
      <P>Chow also exchanged greetings and chats with German officials, parliamentarians,
journalists and diplomats of Taiwan's diplomatic allies stationed in Germany.</P>
      <P>In the coming few days, Chow will visit the Berlin municipal library and several
tourist attractions before returning to Taipei Oct. 16.</P>
      <P>The Ming Hwa Yuan troupe will give one more show in Berlin Wednesday and will
then perform in six other European cities -- Prague, Vienna, Paris, London,
Edinburgh and Amsterdam.</P>
      <P>Apart from formal performances, the troupe will also hold workshops at
universities to introduce the traditional Taiwanese art form to audiences in
Europe during its 10-day tour.</P>

      <P>Tea growers in Taiwan have seen profits nearly double since last year thanks to
a government-sponsored program that promotes the growth of high-quality leaves,
a Council of Agriculture (COA) official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Since late 2009, the council has provided consulting and advanced techniques for
applying fertilizer or medicine, helping high-end tea growers obtain
certifications including ISO 22000 and HACCP, Tsai Hsien-tsung, director of the
COA's Tea Research and Extention Station's Wenshan Branch, said.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese tea has become more competitive against foreign teas, Tsai said,
noting that Starbucks Beijing and European tea merchants have placed orders.</P>
      <P>Tea growers in areas such as Taipei County's Pinglin and Sansia townships,
Taoyuan County, Hsinchu County, and Nantou County's Mingjian Jhushan townships
have seen profits rise, he said.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that as tea grown in the Taipei Sansia area has no pesticide residue,
its price has risen from NT$70 (US$2) for 600 grams last year to NT$120 for now.</P>

      <P>Taiwan on Wednesday welcomed a plan by the Hong Kong government to set up its
office in the country, according to the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) , the
government agency in charge of policies toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong's Chief Executive Donald Tsang Yam-kuen said in his administrative
report to the legislature earlier Wednesday that his government  will discuss
with Taiwan  plans  to establish  a "comprehensive" office in Taipei.</P>
      <P>In response, a MAC official who asked not to be named, confirmed that both sides
have begun contacts with each other on the proposed office.</P>
      <P>The official said the Hong Kong government will submit a concrete plan,
including details about the office's structure, operations and number of
personnel, for discussions with Taipei by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The new office will be another breakthrough  in bilateral relations between
Taiwan and Hong Kong following the establishment of two semi-official
organizations -- the Taipei-based Taiwan-Hong Kong Economic and Cultural
Cooperation Council and the Hong Kong-based Hong Kong-Taiwan Economic and
Cultural Cooperation and Promotion Council -- earlier this year to deepen
exchanges between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Taiwan-Hong Kong ties only began to warm up following improved relations between
Taipei and Beijing after President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008. The former
British colony returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's lowest housing supply ratio not a problem: official</HEADLINE>

10/13/10  23:06:06</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has recorded the lowest ratio of housing supply to households in the
second quarter of this year in 10 years, but that does not mean there is an
inadequate supply of housing here, said the Construction and Planning Agency
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The ratio of 99.89 to 100 -- meaning there are 99.89 units of housing for every
100 households -- is still a relatively healthy ratio, according to Wang An-
Chiang, an official of the agency.</P>
      <P>Wang attributed  the lower ratio to inconsistency  between household
registration and residency, which has resulted in an increase in the number of
households registered.</P>
      <P>For example, he added, some people buy or rent property in a popular school
district without actually living there, but they register their kids under that
address so that the kids can go to a prestigious school in the neighborhood,
practices contributing to inflated household number.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the ratio was also affected by an underestimate of the housing
supply, Wang said.</P>
      <P>More than 7.86 million units of housing were registered in the second quarter.
The main reason for the underestimation is that the basic supply figure comes
from the last population census taken nearly 10 years ago.  Wang said the agency
will adjust the number once the next census, scheduled to begin later this year,
is completed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, central Taiwan's Taichung City has the highest ratio of housing units
to households - a ratio of 118.37 to 100.</P>
      <P>Cities and counties with a housing supply ratio of over 100 percent include
Keelung City, Taoyuan County, Hsinchu City, and Taipei County, according to the
statistics.</P>
      <P>The outlying Kinmen Island has the lowest figure of below 50 percent, while
Penghu County, Yulin County and Taitung County were all below 90 percent. (By

    <TEXT>
      <P>A platform that will allow regular dialogue between Taiwan and China will be set
up and put to use before the end of this year, to deal with issues or disputes
related to the landmark trade deal signed between the two sides in June, Premier
Wu Den-yih said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Through this dialogue platform, Wu said, the two sides will consult  with each
other on matters related  to the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA)
, as well as other economic issues of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>Despite decades of booming trade between Taiwan and China, as well as billions
of dollars of Taiwanese investments in China, no such platform has existed
between the two sides for investors or business people to resolve disputes. And
since there are no formal ties between the two sides, there were no government
representative offices in each other's territory.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese investors encountering problems in the mainland, for example, could
only go through China's government offices for help, with no representation by
Taiwanese authorities.</P>
      <P>The ECFA reduces tariffs on exports, eases or lifts non-tariff trade barriers
and gives each side greater access to the other's market - which could
potentially bring about more trade between the two sides.</P>
      <P>The pact stipulates that a "cross-strait economic cooperation committee" should
be created to handle follow-up negotiations or disputes. Since the trade deal
took effect on Sept. 12, Wu said, the platform should be established, Wu said.</P>
      <P>As to when the platform will be inaugurated, the premier said it depends on when
the two sides' existing quasi-official intermediary bodies -- the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), finalize their consultations.</P>
      <P>According to Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Sheng-chung, the platform or
"committee" will comprise several working panels in charge of merchandise trade,
service trade, dispute mechanism and investment affairs.</P>
      <P>The panels will be headed by department or bureau chiefs under the Ministry of
Economic affairs who will meet with their Chinese counterparts biannually, Lin
said.</P>
      <P>He added that both sides have reached a preliminary consensus that the
"committee" will be headed by a vice ministerial-level official from each side.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Wednesday that Taiwan would not accept any preconditions
from China in its overture to dismantle missiles targeting Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"If Taiwan and China want to build mutual trust and ensure peace, neither side
should set any preconditions or attach any terms to the cause, "  Wu told a
legislative committee when fielding questions on cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>"The two sides should be fully sincere so as to work best together and guarantee
progress toward peace," he added.</P>
      <P>Yang Yi, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office under Beijing's State Council,
said earlier in the day that both sides of the strait could start contact on
military issues, including confidence building measures (CBMs) through
appropriate methods.</P>
      <P>Yang's remarks came after Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao suggested in late September
that Beijing could "eventually" remove its missiles pointing at Taiwan "sometime
in the future."</P>
      <P>A spokesman for China's defense ministry also said recently that under the "one
China" precondition, Beijing would consider removing the missiles it has aimed
at Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"But how can we accept Beijing's offer if the 'one China' precondition is
attached?" Wu asked.</P>
      <P>Stressing that conditions are "not yet ripe" for Taiwan and China to hold a
political dialogue, the premier said that Taiwan would not agree to proposals
calling for the abolishment of the "imaginary border" in the strait, because
doing so would leave Taiwan unable to defend itself.</P>
      <P>Citing results of a public opinion poll, Wu said around 43 percent of Taiwan's
people think the government's pace in handling cross-strait affairs is adequate,
while 37 percent, a two-year high, think it is too fast and 12 percent believe
it is too slow.</P>
      <P>"Judging from this, it is clear that we should not move too fast in dealing with
China, " he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Game plans against currency wars</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/14/10  10:25:46
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Over the past two weeks, the United States has stepped up pressure on China to
increase the value of the yuan in a bid to boost U.S. exports and quicken an
economic recovery. Emerging markets, on the other hand, have been competing
against each other to prevent currency appreciation to try to keep their exports
competitive.</P>
      <P>A major concern is whether the United States will list China as a currency
manipulator and impose punitive tariffs on Chinese exports. If this happens, a
global trade war will break out, which would undermine the fragile recovery of
the global economy. Unless all countries around the world lose their mind, the
likelihood for such a scenario should be low.</P>
      <P>It's unlikely Taiwan can do much in the process. Concerned authorities in the
government, however, should work out various game plans to cope with all
possible scenarios. Keeping the U.S. dollar above NT$31 to the Taiwan dollar
should not be the central bank's one and only trick. (Editorial abstract -- Oct.

telling a traditional Chinese story at a community library in an east Berlin

      <P>Speaking through an interpreter, Chow told more than 20 children the tale of how
12 animals were chosen for the Chinese zodiac as part of the students' two-week
autumn vacation activities.</P>
      <P>With  lively  gestures  and body language,  Chow drew the schoolchildren into

young children.</P>

    <DATELINE>10/14/10  12:17:48
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In  business  management,  "risk  in  decision-making"  and "decision-making
under risk" are two important concepts. These ideas also apply when it comes to
managing a country.</P>
      <P>Several recent international incidents can serve as lessons for Taiwan in terms
of calculating risk probability. These include China's ban on rare earth metal
exports to Japan amid the territorial row over the Tiaoyutai Islands. Another
incident is China's delay of its free trade talks with Norway in retaliation
against the Norwegian Nobel Committee's decision to award the 2010 Nobel Peace
Prize to jailed Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan thinks "blood is thicker than water" across the Taiwan Strait and that
it will not receive the same treatment as Japan and Norway, it is totally wrong.
In a recent meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates in Vietnam,
China's Defense Minister Liang Guanglie again raised concerns about U.S. arms
sale to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>To Taiwan,  China is the greatest external  risk that is threatening its
survival and development. Therefore, all political and economic policies toward
China involve "decision-making under risk." If our government lacks the ability
for risk assessment, such a government will become Taiwan's worst internal risk.

    <TEXT>
      <P>In light of the continued increase of incidents in which legal foreign workers
abscond, the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is planning to revamp its reward
system for catching runaway workers. Informants will receive a NT$5,000 reward
for each person they help catch, instead of paying the same amount regardless of
the number of people involved.</P>
      <P>The policy makes no sense at all. Is there a reward for the arrest of drug
dealers, murderers, robbers and rapists? Is running away a more serious offense
than drug trafficking, murder and rape?</P>
      <P>Taiwan's disregard for the rights of foreign workers has already marred the
country's human rights record. The latest "head-hunting" campaign will bring
great embarrassment upon Taiwan if it becomes known in the international
community.</P>
      <P>We advise the CLA to call off the campaign because it obviously runs counter to
President Ma Ying-jeou's reasoning behind setting up a "human rights advisory
committee." (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 14, 2010)</P>

agenda for 2011-2016.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Huang will head a delegation of electronics industry executives to China Oct. 23
to attend a seminar to be held in Fuzhou, Fujian Province on information
technology standardization.</P>

      <P>"France did express concerns over the percentage of e-passports (electronic
passports with fingerprint data) among all Taiwan-issued passports, but it did
not formally make additional requirements in Taiwan's Schengen visa-free

      <P>France did not raise the issue again at the European Parliament's Visa Working

      <P>Taiwan welcomes overseas compatriots to invest in their homeland, Vice President
Vincent Siew said Thursday, noting that the country has become a hot spot for
foreign investment in the wake of the economic cooperation framework agreement
(ECFA) signed with China in June.</P>
      <P>"Many foreign countries have expressed a high level of interests in investing in
Taiwan as the trade pact signed with China on June 29 has raised Taiwan's
economic status, " Siew said while attending a meeting with representatives of
the Federation of Overseas Chinese Associations in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-based Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI) rated Taiwan the
fourth lowest-risk country for investment in its business environment risk
report released in August 2010, Siew said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the ECFA, Taiwan's reduced tax rates and its global investment
task force formed by the Executive Yuan in August have encouraged foreign
investors to put their money here, according to the BERI.</P>
      <P>Overseas Taiwanese will be able to help increase Taiwan's international
visibility by bridging communications between the government  and world business
partners,  with their language capabilities and rich interpersonal connections,
Siew said.</P>
      <P>The ECFA reduces or eliminates tariffs on exports between Taiwan China and opens
each side's market wider to the other's investors. It was also widely seen as
one of the most important agreements signed between the two former rivals, and
an indication of reduced tensions and improved relations between the two sides.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 108.79 points Thursday, marking the largest daily
rise since Sept. 13 as buying focused on the old economy sector amid optimism
over warming cross-Taiwan Strait business ties, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 1.34 percent to 8,215.45, after moving between 8,178.34
and 8,252.20, on turnover of NT$120.89 billion (US$3.90 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.92 percent on Wall Street's overnight gains and momentum
accelerated during trading, with buyers encouraged by gains in other regional
markets including Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,635 stocks closed up and 1,252 down with 355 remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile sector tallied the highest gains, up 4.42 percent. Paper and pulp
stocks rose 4.09 percent, plastics and chemical shares added 4.08 percent,
cement shares gained 2.36 percent and foodstuffs closed up 2.21 percent.</P>
      <P>The financial sector rose 1.11 percent and the machinery and electronics sector
gained 0.86 percent, while construction stocks closed down 0.19 percent.</P>
      <P>"Investors remain upbeat about the implementation of the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) Taiwan and China signed in late June," Grand Cathay
Securities analyst Mars Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"These old economy stocks, in particular the textile, plastics, cement and food
businesses, have already forged close ties with the mainland. The ECFA is
expected to further boost their bottom lines, " Hsu said.</P>
      <P>A total of 539 products and services from Taiwan, most of which are traditional
industry firms, will be granted a preferential tariff status or easier market
access to China under the agreement.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that while the broader market consolidated in recent trading sessions,
the old economy sector has outperformed high-tech firms on institutional buying.</P>
      <P>"As the market is awash in ample liquidity, investors tend to park their funds
in a safe haven, which is currently the old economy sector," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>In the textile sector, Shinkong Synthetic Fiber rose 6.93 percent to NT$14.65
and Far Eastern New Century gained 5.31 percent to NT$44.60.</P>
      <P>Among petrochemical stocks, Formosa Plastics added 5.53 percent to NT$82.00 and

      <P>The Agriculture and Food Agency under the Council of Agriculture will begin a
subsidy program for locally grown oranges earlier than usual this year in an
effort to stabilize prices, an agency official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese oranges are mostly harvested in late November to February, the
agency's director-secretary, Hsu Han-ching, said in an interview.</P>
      <P>He noted that if the crop hits the market all at once, prices might fall,
impacting the profit margin for farmers.</P>
      <P>This year's orange harvest, estimated at 200,000 metric tons, has dropped by 10
percent since the agency encouraged farmers not to grow the fruit to avoid a
glut, said Hsu.</P>
      <P>In addition, the agency will from Oct. 15 subsidize processing factories that
buy more than 10 metric tons to the tune of NT$3 per kilo, Hsu added.</P>
      <P>The fruit will be used for making various products, including jam, ice cream and
essential oil, in a bid to expand the market.</P>
      <P>Tainan,  Chiayi, Yunlin and Nantou counties are the major producers of the

      <P>Hailed as "a leap in aesthetic and artistic sophistication" by a leading film
critic, a Taiwanese film about a complex, polygamous family struggling with
societal issues garnered rave reviews at this year's Pusan International Film
Festival (PIFF), which runs through Friday in Busan, South Korea.</P>
      <P>The 107-minute "When Love Comes" focuses on an uncharacteristic Taiwanese family
in which the father, played by Lin Yu-shun, marries into his wife's family. When
his wife is found to be infertile, she permits him to take on a concubine whose
eldest daughter ends up getting impregnated by an irresponsible boyfriend.</P>
      <P>The film outlines a complex love-hate relationship between a woman and her
daughter, who despises her mother as nothing but a baby-making machine. It also
features an autistic uncle played by Kao Meng-chieh, who is best known for past
roles as a ruthless gangster.</P>
      <P>Directed  by Chang  Tso-chi,  who is no stranger  to the international movie
scene, the film is scheduled to premier in Taiwan on Oct. 29. It is also
expected to dominate next month's Golden Horse Awards after bagging 14
nominations, including Best Feature Film and Best Cinematography.</P>
      <P>Hollywood Reporter's chief reviewer Maggie Lee applauded the movie, saying it is
arguably the best among Chang's repertoire and describing it as a "visually
splendid and life-affirming" film that "reflects the Chinese philosophy of
letting water pass under the bridge."</P>
      <P>Festival executive programmer Kim Ji-seok was also enamored with the film,
applauding it as the best Asian film presented in the history of PIFF, one of
the most esteemed film festivals in Asia since its inception in 1996.</P>
      <P>The 15th edition of the festival began on Oct. 7.</P>
      <P>The movie will also soon make its mark in Europe at the 54th British Film
Institute London Film Festival from Oct. 13-28. Besides "When Love Comes, "
three other Taiwanese films will be part of the London event -- "Taipei
Exchanges, " "I Wish I Knew" and "A Bright Summer Day." (By Jenny W. Hsu)</P>

      <P>The bodies of six Indonesian workers who were killed in a construction site
accident in central Taiwan 15 days ago will be allowed to be shipped home so
long as Indonesia's liaison office in Taiwan produces relevant documents, a
prosecutor said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The bodies of the six dead men, all undocumented migrant workers who had fled
their previous Taiwanese employers and had overstayed their visas for up to
three years, have been kept at a mortuary in Nantou County.</P>
      <P>Seven workers, including the six Indonesians, were killed and two others were
injured after a sprawling network of scaffolding at a construction site for a
No. 6 Freeway exit ramp collapsed on Sept. 30.</P>
      <P>A funeral service was held at the home of Chuang Yung-ho, the only Taiwanese
worker killed in the accident, in Nantou Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>The bodies of the six dead Indonesians, however, remain at the mortuary and
cannot be shipped home because none of their relatives have come from Indonesia
for DNA comparison to facilitate their identification, which is necessary before
the bodies can be sent back to Indonesia, according to Taiwanese authorities.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Huang Chien-ming said that in order to facilitate these dead bodies'
repatriation, the Nantou Prosecutors Office has asked the Indonesian  Economic
and Trade Office in Taipei -- Indonesia's representative office in Taiwan -- to
produce documents proving their identities and their families' authorization
papers.</P>
      <P>So far, the Indonesian office has produced only one family's authorization
paper, Huang said.</P>
      <P>"These documents are necessary for the dead Indonesians' return and their
compensation," Huang noted.</P>
      <P>According to Huang, these dead bodies have been kept at the mortuary in
accordance with Muslim custom -- in caskets, with their hands crossed on the
breast, covered with a white sheet and accompanied with Koran chanting.</P>
      <P>There were 151,723 Indonesian workers in Taiwan as of the end of August,
according to figures from the Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training under
the council. The number accounts for more than 40 percent of the 372,146 migrant
workers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Just over 85 percent of Indonesian workers -- 129,046 out of 151,723 -- were
working in Taiwan in August as caregivers, while less than 1 percent were
employed in the construction industry, the figures showed.</P>
      <P>The accident has raised concerns about the hiring of illegal migrant workers,
with Premier Wu Den-yih pledging to enforce a crackdown on undocumented foreign
workers as well as on domestic employers and contractors who illegally hire
them.</P>

a high-ranking financial official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yuh-chang, chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) , said

      <P>Chen said the two banks are expected to open their offices in Taipei City's
Xinyi district, the financial hub of the capital.</P>
      <P>The two banks are the first two Chinese banks to get approval from the FSC to
establish offices in Taiwan. The permission was granted Sept. 23.</P>
      <P>A representative office of a foreign bank in Taiwan is not allowed to conduct
profit-making activities but can only liaise with local banks and customers and
collect information on the local financial market.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as they cannot engage in profit-making activities such as
extending loans or taking deposits, there are no concerns that they will be able
to obtain customers' credit information.</P>
      <P>Under existing regulations, Chinese banks are required to operate a
representative office in Taiwan for no less than a year before they can seek
approval to upgrade the office into a branch, which can get into profit-making

      <P>The second  phase of the Taipei International Flora Expo is ready to kick off on
Friday in which two of the expo's four areas will be open for up to 15,000
selected guests and invitees, the organizing committee announced on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Yuanshan Park Area made its debut last week, receiving mixed reviews from
visitors. The Xinsheng Park Area which opens Friday, features five pavilions,
including a high-tech interactive hall that houses a circle-vision theatre and a
3-D kaleidoscope.</P>
      <P>Organizers stressed the allotted daily quota for visitors during the trial
period is capped off at 15,000 people. Only selected guests such as expo
volunteers will be allowed to enter the area while others will be kindly turned
away, said Taipei City Deputy Mayor Allen Chiu at a press conference.</P>
      <P>Chiu said the park will be open to the general public only after the ceiling has
not been reached.</P>
      <P>The problem of allowing individual visitors to the expo became a major source of
contention last week when the organizers failed to execute to its policy of only
letting in invited groups during the trial run for the Yuanshan Park Area.</P>
      <P>The number of visitors soared to over 10,000 during the first day of the trial
period, far surpassing the 5,000 limit set by the committee.</P>
      <P>Chu said while the city appreciates the enthusiasm and the feedback from the
general public, it is important to stick to the scheduled plan in order to
really put the expo to the test before the grand opening on Nov. 6.</P>
      <P>The second phase will run for six days until Oct. 20 and will be immediately
followed by the third phase of the trial period in which Dajia Riverside Area
Park will be opened for inspection along with the previous two.</P>
      <P>According to the organizers, as of yesterday, 63,109 people have visited the
park and 6,832 surveys have been filled out. A total of 5,314 of those who gave
feedback gave the expo a thumbs-up.</P>
      <P>Judy Peng, a Taipei City resident and one of the invited visitors to the park on
Thursday, expressed disappointment over what she saw, saying that of the five
international floral expos she has attended in the past 15 years, the Taipei one
was the most "unsophisticated."</P>
      <P>"There was nothing touching or stunning about the expo. I am unhappy how the
city government has spent the publics money to create something so uninspiring,"
she added.</P>
      <P>Peng's husband, however, said he was pleased with the expo and that he is
confident the event will only get better after the official commencement.</P>
      <P>Foreign minister Timothy Yang told the legislature Thursday that so far at least
seven foreign dignitaries, including some heads of states of Taiwan's ally
nations in the South Pacific and Latin America, have accepted the invitation to
visit the expo once it opens next month.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's textile companies will capitalize on their new technologies and a trade
pact with China to expand their market share in China before their South Korean
rivals get similar tariff-cut treatment from China, a local textile association
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Justin Huang, secretary-general of the Taiwan Textile Federation, said at the
International  Cotton  Advisory  Committee  (ICAC) International Seminar in
Taipei that many Taiwanese participants featured their "functional" textile
products at the Taipei Innovative Textile Application Show taking place Oct.
13-15.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is way ahead of China in making products that are ultraviolet-resistant,
electrostatic-resistant or anti-bacterial, he said in an interview with CNA on
the sidelines of the forum.</P>
      <P>These products, coupled with the tariff-free treatment, will boost Taiwan's
business opportunities in China, he said.</P>
      <P>Under the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) that took effect
earlier this year, 136 textile items exported from Taiwan to China will enjoy
first-wave tariff reduction or tariff elimination from the start of next year.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that South Korea has yet to receive similar treatment from China, a
situation that favors Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"As South Korea does not yet get duty-free treatment, Taiwan can take this
opportunity to extend its market share in China, " he said.</P>
      <P>Earlier at the forum, Vice Economic Affairs Minister Francis Liang said in his
opening remarks that Taiwan's textile industry today is still "vital and
active."</P>
      <P>"It used to be called a traditional industry. But now it's a very modern, high-
tech-oriented industry utilizing cutting-edge materials and technologies," he
said.</P>
      <P>To demonstrate the results of Taiwan's research and development in the field at
the trade show, the Taiwan Textile Research Institute showcased a new water-
repelling cloth treated with an environmentally friendly coating.</P>
      <P>The institute also featured a "textile garden" at the show, in which plants were
growing on a textile material.</P>

      <P>Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) Chairman Chen Yuh-chang said Thursday
that the government will only levy a hot money tax after careful consideration
to avoid any undesirable impact, especially on the local bourse.</P>
      <P>With a continued inflow of foreign capital, the New Taiwan dollar climbed by up
to NT$0.4 against the greenback in the morning session of the Taipei foreign
exchange Thursday, triggering an outcry from lawmakers asking whether Taiwan
should follow in Brazil's footsteps by imposing a hot money tax in a bid to curb
foreign exchange speculation.</P>
      <P>Legislator Kao Chih-peng of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, at a
session of the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee, asked whether the FSC will
work with the Ministry of Finance on the proposed tax, a hotly debated issue
after Central Bank of the Republic of China Governor Perng Fai-nan quoted Nobel

money tax was a means to curb the inflow of speculative capital.</P>
      <P>In response, the Ministry of Finance said that if necessary, it will cooperate
with relevant agencies to work out measures for levying the tax.</P>
      <P>According to Kao, a hot money tax would be a double-edged sword and that the
local foreign exchange and stock markets will be deeply influenced if it is
imposed.</P>
      <P>For his part, Chen pointed out to the lawmakers that Perng has not actually
proposed the tax. He also said the FSC will insist that it should only be levied
after prudent consideration.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's eye doctors on Wednesday drew the public's attention to common eye
diseases in response to a World Health Organization (WHO) eye care campaign
ahead of World Vision Day.</P>
      <P>Ophthalmologists at a press conference pointed out common eye diseases which are
often preventable in Taiwan. The press conference was held one day prior to
World Vision Day, a program initiated by the WHO to highlight the importance of
preventable blindness.</P>
      <P>Liu Jung-hung of Cheng Hsin Rehabilitation Medical Center warned the public that
cases of age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease which leads to
possible blindness, is a common problem in Taiwan among the elderly.</P>
      <P>Liu also said that while some eye problems are hard to detect and diagnose,
others are often caused by accidents and could be prevented, citing a case of
blindness in which one boy mistakenly shot a dart into his brother's eye while
playing.</P>
      <P>The director-general of the Ophthalmological Society of Taiwan, Lin Hung- yu,
said that aside from getting regular eye check-ups and enhancing medical
knowledge about eye care, people should do more outdoor activities which are
good for their eyes.</P>
      <P>To promote the importance of eye care and encourage people to get out and enjoy
nature, the society will hold a hiking trip at the end of October at Kuantu,
Taipei.</P>

      <P>The Chilean-made 'Phoenix' capsule may have contributed largely to the rescue of
33 miners who had been trapped more than 600 meters below the earth's surface
for 69 days, but two made-in-Taiwan pieces of electronic equipment also played a
part in the successful rescue.</P>
      <P>Infrared Internet cameras and media converters, manufactured and distributed by
Taipei-based Planet Technology Corp., had been lowered down the tiny boreholes
drilled into a collapsed gold and copper mine in Chile to allow the trapped
miners to communicate with the world above and their activity to be viewed
through the image sensors.</P>
      <P>This enabled the miners underground and mining officials and rescue workers
above ground to prepare for and plan the details of the heartwarming rescue.</P>
      <P>"It was indeed a task to enable the cameras and converters to work under a
humid, hot, and dark environment that was 624 meters underground," said Lin Man-
zu, a spokeswoman for the company based in Xindian, Taipei.</P>
      <P>Amid global acclaim, all 33 trapped Chilean miners had been rescued from the
collapsed mine Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>Infrared Internet cameras and media converters are usually used by industrial
companies for their waterproof and dust-repellent properties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>1.3 children abandoned in Taiwan every day: foundation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An average of 1.3 children have been abandoned every day in Taiwan over the past
five years, according to a report released Thursday by the non-profit Child
Welfare League Foundation (CWLF).</P>
      <P>Citing statistics compiled by the Ministry of the Interior, the report said a
total of 2,407 young children have been abandoned since 2005, meaning that an
average of 481 children have been abandoned each year, or an average of 1.3 per
day.</P>
      <P>A further analysis of the official data shows that 54 percent of the 202
children abandoned between August 2009 and July this year were less than 1 year
old, 28 percent were aged between 1 and 2 years and only 9 percent were older
than 3.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, CWLF Chief Executive Officer Wang Yu-min said the
number of phone calls from people seeking to have their children adopted has
also been on a steady rise since the foundation inaugurated adoption services in
1993.</P>
      <P>In the past five years, Wang said, the foundation has received 3,303 such phone
calls, or an average of 1.8 phone calls a day.</P>
      <P>Analyzing adoption cases handled by the foundation over the past year, Wang said
that 84.2 percent of them were not brought to the foundation by their birth
parents and had been staying with either foster families, orphanages, relatives,
caregivers, hospitals or other temporary shelters.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, 33 percent of them had stayed at more than one institution
and 9.3 percent had been placed in three or even more shelters.</P>
      <P>Only 43 percent could find adoptive families within one year and nearly 25
percent had to wait for two years to find adoptive families, Wang said, adding
that some abandoned children still cannot find a family willing to adopt them
even after waiting for five to six years.</P>
      <P>Wang said the time taken to locate suitable adoptive families is often related
to three issues: vacillation by the birth parents, members of their biological
families suffering from drug addiction or mental diseases,  and children with
special features  such as disabilities, advanced years or of indigenous or
foreign origin.</P>
      <P>Nearly 64 percent of children sheltered by the foundation are in the latter
category, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang said, the foundation has launched a fundraising campaign with
the aim of establishing a NT$15 million (US$483,870) fund to care for abandoned
children waiting for adoption. Popular actor Ethan Ruan attended the news
conference to throw his support for the foundation's cause.</P>
      <P>Wang also urged birth parents and judges to prioritize the interests of children
when considering whether to put their children up for adoption or making rulings
on changes of guardians so that young children will not need to endure such long
waits to find adoptive families.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Environmental activists urged Premier Wu Den-yih Thursday to accept their
invitation for an open debate on the building of the country's eighth naphtha
cracker in central Taiwan's Changhua County, saying that a referendum would be
useless in ending the stalemate.</P>
      <P>Opposition Green Party Convener Pan Han-sheng scoffed at a proposal by ruling
Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator Daniel Huang that the issue, which has been
deadlocked for years, should be put to a nationwide referendum.</P>
      <P>"The people have the obligation as well as the right to make the decision for
themselves. You have to trust that the public has the wisdom to make the best
choice for their future posterity, " Huang said during an interpellation session
at the legislature.</P>
      <P>Pan dismissed the plebiscite idea and said that instead, a public debate with
the premier should be held on the issue.</P>
      <P>"How can people vote on the issue when the government has not fully disclosed
all the information on the plant? The most urgent thing at the moment is for the
government to be transparent about all the facts, both positive and negative,
regarding the complex, " he said.</P>
      <P>Spearheaded by the Kuokuang Petrochemical Technology Corp (KPTC), a subsidiary
of the Formosa Plastics Group, the project has been criticized by environmental
groups as a lethal blow to local agriculture and marine life, such as the nearly
extinct indigenous white dolphins.</P>
      <P>According to the Ministry of Economic of Affairs (MOEA) , the project is
expected to generate revenue of NT$460 billion (US$12.6 billion) and to create
18,000 new jobs directly and 357,000 jobs indirectly.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Industrial Development Bureau under the MOEA has said that based
on the principle of energy-effectiveness  and pollution reduction, the ministry
will support the establishment of the plant in the central county to replace the
aging fifth naphtha cracker.</P>
      <P>The EPA confirmed Thursday that the KPTC has promised to submit supplementary
documents on its own health impact assessment report to the agency Oct. 15, for
review by the Environmental Assessment Impact Committee.</P>

      <P>Excessive ear wax could be an indicator of a developing ear problem, a doctor at
Renai Branch of Taipei City Hospital said at a press conference Thursday.</P>
      <P>He cited the case of a 9-year-old girl who had excessive ear wax production in
her left ear and was later diagnosed with keratosis obturans, a build up of
extra skin cells in the ear canal leading to blockage and a decrease in hearing,
said Chang Chia-wei, a resident doctor at the hospital's otorhinolaryngological
department.</P>
      <P>Chang said that 70 percent of the cases occur in teenagers and although only one
or two are diagnosed each year, people should not overlook ear disease,  which
can be recurrent  and can cause irreparable hearing damage.</P>
      <P>Chang said that while it is not necessary to remove ear wax, which protects the
ear from infection and bacteria, people should seek medical advice when they
have doubts about their ears.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's quest for international space and President Ma Ying-jeou's call for
"mutual non-denial" will not be on the agenda of any cross-Taiwan Strait
negotiations, a senior official responsible for China policy said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Liu Teh-shun, vice chairman of the cabinet's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) ,
made the remarks after Legislator Kuan Bi-ling urged the government to negotiate
with China on these matters in the next round of high-level talks, to be held
before the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Kuan, a member of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) , said
Wednesday that the negotiation was necessary because of China 's continued
interference in Taiwan's participation in international organizations.</P>
      <P>At a weekly press conference, Liu said that the Taiwan side has stated the
country's position in past meetings between Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF)
Chairman Chiang Pin-kung and Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS) President Chen Yunlin, and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>"As both sides have now deepened relations and institutionalized bilateral
exchanges, we hope China understands that if we cooperate in our international
participation, both sides will be able to enjoy stronger global influence," he
added.</P>
      <P>With respect to President Ma's call for "mutual non-denial" between Taiwan and
China,  Liu said that the two sides have established a "fundamentally solid
foundation" on the appeal and have "almost reached" a phase of mutual non-
denial, an issue which Liu described as non-negotiable and something which could
be carried out in practice.</P>
      <P>"Mutual non-denial" is a principle advocated by Ma in a bid to win more
international room for Taiwan in the face of Beijing's success in blocking
Taiwan from most international organizations.</P>
      <P>The president repeated the call on Sunday in a speech marking the National Day.</P>
      <P>"Although at this stage the two sides of the Taiwan Strait cannot accord de jure
recognition to each other, we should nevertheless adopt a pragmatic policy of de
facto 'mutual non-denial,'" he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New stem cell therapy for heart repair developed by local team</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A research team led by a professor at National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) has
succeeded in developing a new therapy for heart repair using stem cells,
according to a press release issued Tuesday by the university in southern Tainan
City.</P>
      <P>Patrick C.H. Hsieh,  an assistant professor at the NCKU's Institute of
Nanotechnology and Microsystem Engineering, College of Medicine, along with his
team, successfully combined self- assembling peptide nanofiber hydrogel with
stem cells from autologous bone marrow to treat an acute heart attack, or
myocardial infarction.</P>
      <P>Their experiment on Lanyu miniature pigs, which have a similar cardiac structure
to that of humans, proved successful, making it possible that the new stem cell
therapy for treating heart disease -- the first of its kind in the world -- can
help boost the regeneration of myocardial muscle.</P>
      <P>The discovery of the novel stem cell therapy was published in Circulation, the
top international journal in the cardiovascular field, in September 2010, and
both foreign and domestic patent applications are being applied for.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, there are approximately 2 million heart disease patients each year
and 400,000 people suffer from heart attacks.</P>
      <P>According to Hsieh, even if patients are lucky enough to survive, their
myocardial cells lack the ability to regenerate. The cells cannot take
intraventricular pressure and thus they will gradually expand and become thin,
leading to heart failure.</P>
      <P>"Even though recent research studies have indicated that many types of stem
cells can be used to improve heart function and be clinically effective and
secure, there is still room for improvement. For instance, when stem cells are
cultured outside the body and injected into the heart, most of them are
immediately carried away by the blood flow or else die quickly," he said.</P>
      <P>To solve these problems, Hsieh's research team injected the self-assembling
peptide nanofiber hydrogel into damaged areas of cardiac infarction, a method
that reduces the problems and in addition, takes only 30 minutes to perform.</P>

      <P>Taiwan is planning to invest NT$6.6 billion (US$215 million) in a new WiMAX
development project that will run through 2013, according to the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) Thursday.</P>
      <P>One of the main goals of the project is to build an environment with more WiMAX
wireless services that can be utilized for disaster relief and education, the
ministry said.</P>
      <P>The other target is to integrate Taiwan's WiMAX industry chain and ultimately
build an end-to-end solution to help the industry gain a bigger share of the
global market.</P>
      <P>The plan is expected to create 20,000 jobs and have a total annual value of over
NT$100 billion, said the MOEA.</P>
      <P>It is also forecast to bring in NT$50 billion in private investment and attract
2.2 million WiMAX wireless technology users, added the ministry.</P>
      <P>The MOEA released the details of the project in a report to Premier Wu Den-yih.</P>
      <P>The country's total WiMAX products were valued at NT$9 billion last year. The
figure this year is estimated to reach NT$15 billion, ministry's statistics
show.</P>
      <P>The ministry  and Intel Taiwan signed two memorandums  of understanding (MOUs)
in 2005 and 2008, respectively, for developing WiMAX wireless technology, which
suggested the world's largest chipmaker's support for the technology.</P>
      <P>Intel's CEO Paul Otellini is scheduled to visit Taiwan on Oct. 28 to sign an MOU
on the development of the cloud computing industry with the ministry, a ministry

the country's status has been downgraded due to objections from China.</P>
      <P>According to its website, the SRA is a multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary,
scholarly, international society that provides an open forum for all those who
are interested in risk analysis.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Kuan Bi-ling told reporters a
day earlier that Taiwan used to be categorized by the society as a state until
China's SRA representative, Huang Chongfu, described Taiwan as not having
sovereign status.</P>
      <P>However, SRA President Richard Reiss said in an email that Taiwan's status "has
not changed since it was formed."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan is in fact classed as a regional organization under
SRA bylaws that "do not require us to take any position on disputes regarding
sovereignty."</P>
      <P>"Regional organizations are not necessarily countries but are simply defined as
'geographically-appropriate areas,'" Reiss said.</P>
      <P>He further pointed out that there are currently more than 20 SRA regional
organizations, including London, Japan, Europe and Latin America.</P>
      <P>In response, Kuan said that even though there has been no change in Taiwan's
classification as a regional organization, its position has been shifted in a

      <P>The Brother Elephants will meet the Sinon Bulls in the best-of-seven Taiwan
Series of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL)  after surviving a
franchise-threatening game-fixing scandal and winning the second half of the
season for a shot at the series title.</P>
      <P>The Elephants, which lost its manager and almost half of its players to a major
game-fixing scandal that came to light in October last year involving more than
40 retired and active players and coaches, won the second half-season
championship, finishing with 36 wins and 24 losses, with a team of young and
inexperienced players.</P>
      <P>It came as a surprise for baseball fans, and even for the first-year Elephants
manager Chen Jui-chen, who said in a press conference Thursday that he was
nervous on the eve of the finals, which match the winners of both halves of the
regular season and will be played Oct. 16-24.</P>
      <P>"What I want from my players is for them to do their best, period, " Chen said.
Peng Cheng-min, the most popular player on the most popular team in Taiwan, gave
credit to the young players, who he described as "playing their hearts out."</P>
      <P>For the Elephants to accomplish a dream season, it has to conquer one more
opponent -- the Bulls, which won the first half season with 36 wins, 23 losses
and one draw, and won the 120-game 2010 regular season with an accumulated
record of 65 wins, 53 losses and two draws.</P>
      <P>The Elephants is making its third straight run at the title after losing in 2008
and 2009, both times to the Uni-President Lions. It has won a total of six
titles, the most among the CPBL teams, in two runs of 1992-94 and 2001-03.</P>
      <P>In a joking and symbolic move, Bulls manager Hsu Sheng-ming ate bananas at the
press conference, as yellow represents the Elephants' team color. The veteran
manager, who is coaching in his sixth Taiwan Series, said he and his team were
determined to win and that he "never gave up an opportunity to win since he
first put on a baseball uniform as a 10-year-old."</P>
      <P>His team won the series in 2004 and 2005.</P>
      <P>La New Bears, which also suffered heavy personnel losses to the game-fixing
scandal, ranked third with 55 wins, 62 losses and three draws, while three-time
defending champions Uni-president Lions finished a disappointing season with 54
wins, 63 losses and three draws to rank last in the four-team league, which was
established in 1990.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Series schedule is as follows: Game 1 Oct. 16 17:05 Taichung City
Game 2 Oct. 17 17:05 Douliou City, Yunlin County Game 3 Oct. 19 18:35 Taoyuan

      <P>The Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR) was criticized  by the Consumer Foundation
Thursday for unfriendly ticketing service and for charging a high transfer fee
on customers who do not use debit cards designated by the THSR.</P>
      <P>The foundation said the THSR has been ignoring public complaints about these
problems since it first began operations in 2007.</P>
      <P>For instance, the ticket machines provide only change in coins, said foundation
chairman Hsieh Tien-jen. It is very inconvenient for ticket buyers to hold 19
NT$50 coins (US$1.6) and one NT$10 coin given by the ticket machine after they
use a NT$1,000 bill to buy a one-way ticket between Taipei City station and
Banciao station, which costs NT$40, he added.</P>
      <P>"I feel the ticket machines pretty much are like slot machines, which is
ridiculous, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Another problem, Hsieh said, is that the NT$17 interbank transfer fee charged by
the THSR on customers who do not use debit cards issued by certain banks only

      <P>The administration will take notice of scholars' opinions and will not approve
the establishment  of red-light zones anywhere in the country, Minister of the
Interior Jiang Yi-huah said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The scholars, who offered their opinions and suggestions in four public hearings
and seminars over the past two months on the issue of decriminalization of the
adult sex trade, did not agree that red-light zones like those in Amsterdam and
Germany's Hamburg should be established in Taiwan, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>However, they did agree that adult sex transactions should be decriminalized,
meaning that neither prostitutes nor their patrons should be punished for their
deals.</P>
      <P>They also suggested that once prostitution is decriminalized, the government
should publish a list of places where prostitutes and sex trade businesses
should not operate, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>"The government will craft its policy on the issue based largely on those
opinions and suggestions," the interior minister said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Jiang's remarks, ruling Kuomintang Legislator Wu Yu-sheng said
that if red-light zones are ruled out, the police will have difficulty cracking
down on the illegal sex trade, which he said might result in Taiwan becoming "an
island of salacity."</P>
      <P>The public hearings and seminars were organized after justices of the
Constitutional Court said last November that a provision in the Social Order
Maintenance Act allowing punishment for prostitutes but not their patrons is
unconstitutional and must be scrapped within two years.</P>
      <P>The ruling has forced the Executive Yuan to face the issue, as it must come up
with measures within two years to not only revise the law but also establish  a
set of rules governing  adult sex transactions.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's workers consume too much fried food and soft drinks high in sugar,
especially blue-collar laborers, high-tech engineers and civil servants,
according to the results of a survey released Thursday.</P>
      <P>These workers therefore have bigger waistlines than average, according to the
Chinese Federation of Dieticians Association, which conducted a survey earlier
this year on the eating habits at eight workplaces.</P>
      <P>A total of eight companies, including two electronics firms, four government
sector facilities and two manufacturing factories, took part in the survey.</P>
      <P>The results show that the main course of a meal for many of those polled is
mostly fried and that workers also consume too many soft drinks. They do not eat
enough fruit or vegetables, with only four workplaces providing fruit or brown
rice, said Chin Hui-min, chairman of the association.</P>
      <P>Most of the companies have vending machines in the workplace selling sugary
beverages, as well as offering soft drinks at every meal, the survey found.</P>
      <P>According  to the survey,  although the employees  of the electronics factories
are fully aware of the importance of a healthy diet, they scored the lowest in
their eating habits and behavior, Chin said.</P>
      <P>Most workers also said they do not have time to use the swimming pool,
basketball or tennis courts provided by their companies due to their heavy
workload, Chin went on.</P>
      <P>Employers should provide healthy meals for employees as part of company benefits
and use calorie counts to help workers make better choices and eat healthier,

      <P>The Journalist, a Taiwan-based news weekly known for its critical editorial

      <P>"The new Chinese-language magazine, to be named I Look in English and Kan (look

      <P>Chou, a veteran journalist and political columnist, said The Journalist will
cooperate with the China News Weekly, a subsidiary of China News Service -- the
second-largest state-owned news agency in China, trailing the Xinhua news agency
-- in launching the new magazine.</P>
      <P>The Journalist will invest 12 million Chinese yuan (US$1.8 million) to control a

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih instructed several government agencies Thursday to cooperate
on building housing for rental to low-income or underprivileged people as part
of efforts to help them find places to live in the greater Taipei area.</P>
      <P>"I have instructed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of National Defense
to fully collaborate with the Interior Ministry to build houses at affordable
prices for low-income households on state-owned land," Wu said following a
weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said a day earlier that the central and local governments
will work together to offer fair-priced housing to the public in Taipei City and
Taipei  County amid widespread complaints that house prices in the greater
Taipei area, particularly in the city, are beyond the reach of most people.</P>
      <P>According to Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah, the housing will be mainly offered
to the physically challenged, victims of domestic violence or elderly citizens
who live alone.</P>
      <P>"The three ministries are slated to iron out a blueprint on the matter by the
end of this month," he added.</P>
      <P>Yeh Shih-wen,  director  of the Construction  and Planning Administration under
the Ministry of the Interior, said the Executive Yuan has instructed that 5
percent of the 226 hectares of land surrounding the A7 station on the Linkuo MRT
line in Taipei County should be reserved for the housing, which will be
exclusively used for rental.</P>
      <P>House prices in northern Taiwan have shown no signs of abating in recent months

    <TEXT>
      <P>The central bank has stabilized housing prices in Taiwan's capital and its
neighboring area in the third quarter of this year as more people in those areas
see the coming six months as a good time to buy a home, a local real estate
agency said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Housing prices in the greater Taipei area of Taipei City and Taipei County
"could have risen at least 10 percent if the central bank had not launched
tightening measures in June, " Yeh Lin-chi, general manager of Evertrust Rehouse
Co., said at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>Since June, the Central Bank of the Republic of China has launched a series of
tightening moves on bank lending to curb the upward spiral of housing prices.
The soaring prices have ignited complaints that many local residents can no
longer afford to buy a home.</P>
      <P>"It is not easy to stabilize housing prices on the back of the bullish market
atmosphere and low interest rates," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's benchmark interest rate now stands at 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>In the short term, he said, housing prices will not post a large increase, but
are also unlikely to fall.</P>
      <P>In the long run, he went on, housing prices will continue to rise as an influx
of Chinese and other foreign investors invest in the Taiwanese market in the
wake of a Taiwan-China pact that took effect earlier this year, paving the way
for more liberalized trade.</P>
      <P>Also seeing this trend, more people in the greater Taipei area told the company
in a quarterly poll conducted Sept. 14-24 that they consider now to be a good
time to buy a home.</P>
      <P>The poll shows that 40 percent of the respondents in Taipei City -- up 12
percent from the previous quarter -- hold that view, while the percentage of
those with an opposing view dropped 6 percent to 52 percent.</P>
      <P>In Taipei County, those who said they see the same period as a good time to buy
rose 3 percent to 38 percent, while those who disagree grew 4 percent to 55
percent.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, a government survey found that in Taipei City, the average
property purchase price is 10.87 times the average buyer's annual income, which
means Taipei residents would have to save all their salary for nearly 11 years
to be able to afford a home.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese golfing sensation Yani Tseng witnessed the 660,000th visitor to the
Taiwan Pavilion at the 2010 World Exposition in Shanghai Thursday when she acted
as director of the pavilion for a day.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that despite being offered a major sponsorship deal by a China-based
multinational conglomerate, she has never thought about representing China
professionally.</P>
      <P>"I have not given it much thought. I'm Taiwanese, and all I want to do is
surpass myself in world tournaments, " said Tseng, currently ranked fourth in
the world in women's professional golf.</P>
      <P>She said she will continue working to add to her professional golf triumphs "for
the glory of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Tseng, at just 21 the youngest-ever champion of the Ladies Professional Golf
Association (LPGA) tournament, said she was proud to have been invited to be
director-for-a-day of the Taiwan Pavilion, which showcases Taiwan's "soft power"
and the cream of Taiwanese culture.</P>
      <P>Tseng returned to Taiwan in September for a short rest after clinching the LPGA
Northwest Arkansas Championship for her fifth career title and her third this
season.</P>
      <P>Of her five LPGA titles, three have been majors. Her latest victory in Arkansas
was her first in a non-major this year after wins at the Kraft Nabisco
Championship in April and the Ricoh Women's British Open in August.</P>
      <P>She won the LPGA Championship in 2008, which means the U.S. Women's Open is the
only major she has yet to win. According to the LPGA website, only seven players
in history have achieved career grand slams.</P>
      <P>The US$300,000 top prize in Arkansas pushed Tseng into second place on the
LPGA's official list of winnings, with US$1.42 million in 2010, after Jiyai Shin
of South Korea, who has so far won US$1.46 million.</P>
      <P>The victory also propelled Tseng past Norway's Suzann Petersen to fourth place
in the Rolex world rankings.</P>

      <P>World Vision Taiwan set up a project known as an Area Development Program (ADP)

      <P>The province lacks basic water and sewage amenities, with broken and muddy
roads, " said Shi-jing Chen, a priest who had been to Aragatsotn to see the

Taiwan, he could see the importance of such donations, he said.</P>
      <P>Shu-zhen Yen, director of World Vision Taiwan's Central Area office, said that
while Taiwan was once itself a receiver of international aid from World Vision,
today it is helping to change the lives of those in poor countries such as
Armenia, where just a small donation can make a big difference for those
children in need, even making their dreams come true.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan has set a goal of helping a total of 2000 children in

      <P>The Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) reaffirmed Thursday that the group is committed
to safety management in the wake of the recent incidents in some of the group's
facilities that have aroused widespread concerns.</P>
      <P>High-ranking FPG officials made the remarks on the eve of the second anniversary
of the death of the group's founder, Wang Yung-ching.</P>
      <P>FPG Chairman William Wang noted that there has been criticism from all sides
since the incidents, and said he "accepted them with humility."</P>
      <P>Amid misgivings that "the management has gradually slackened off" since the
death of the founder, who always stressed hard work and discipline, Wang said
the group's seven-member core team has always trod "gingerly" when making
decisions.</P>
      <P>The group's Nanya Plastics Corp. in Chiayi County went up in flames earlier this
month following two fires in its Mailiao petrochemical complex in Yunlin County
in July.</P>
      <P>FPG Vice Chairwoman Susan Wang said the group attaches great importance to
environmental protection and workplace safety, saying that its waste water and
other waste, as well as sulphur dioxide emissions, have been reduced every year.</P>
      <P>The total injury index was cut to 0.19 in 2009 from 0.471 in 2004, far lower
than the average of 0.645 in Taiwan's manufacturing industry and the 0.734 in
the chemical raw material manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>"If the management has become lax, how could we have achieved such good

      <P>The Brother Elephants will meet the Sinon Bulls in the best-of-seven Taiwan
Series of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL)  after surviving a
franchise-threatening game-fixing scandal and winning the second half of the
season for a shot at the series title.</P>
      <P>The Elephants, which lost its manager and almost half of its players to a major
game-fixing scandal that came to light in October last year involving more than
40 retired and active players and coaches, won the second half-season
championship, finishing with 36 wins and 24 losses, with a team of young and
inexperienced players.</P>
      <P>It came as a surprise for baseball fans, and even for the first-year Elephants
manager Chen Jui-chen, who said in a press conference Thursday that he was
nervous on the eve of the finals, which match the winners of both halves of the
regular season and will be played Oct. 16-24.</P>
      <P>"What I want from my players is for them to do their best, period, " Chen said.
Peng Cheng-min, the most popular player on the most popular team in Taiwan, gave
credit to the young players, who he described as "playing their hearts out."</P>
      <P>For the Elephants to accomplish a dream season, it has to conquer one more
opponent -- the Bulls, which won the first half season with 36 wins, 23 losses
and one draw, and won the 120-game 2010 regular season with an accumulated
record of 65 wins, 53 losses and two draws.</P>
      <P>The Elephants is making its third straight run at the title after losing in 2008
and 2009, both times to the Uni-President Lions. It has won a total of six
titles, the most among the CPBL teams, in two runs of 1992-94 and 2001-03.</P>
      <P>In a joking and symbolic move, Bulls manager Hsu Sheng-ming ate bananas at the
press conference, as yellow represents the Elephants' team color. The veteran
manager, who is coaching in his sixth Taiwan Series, said he and his team were
determined to win and that he "never gave up an opportunity to win since he
first put on a baseball uniform as a 10-year-old."</P>
      <P>His team won the series in 2004 and 2005.</P>
      <P>La New Bears, which also suffered heavy personnel losses to the game-fixing
scandal, ranked third with 55 wins, 62 losses and three draws, while three-time
defending champions Uni-president Lions finished a disappointing season with 54
wins, 63 losses and three draws to rank last in the four-team league, which was
established in 1990.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Series schedule is as follows: Game 1 Oct. 16 17:05 Taichung City
Game 2 Oct. 17 17:05 Douliou City, Yunlin County Game 3 Oct. 19 18:35 Taoyuan

problems since it first began operations in 2007.</P>
      <P>For instance, the ticket machines provide only change in coins, said foundation
chairman Hsieh Tien-jen. It is very inconvenient for ticket buyers to hold 19
NT$50 coins (US$1.6) and one NT$10 coin given by the ticket machine after they
use a NT$1,000 bill to buy a one-way ticket between Taipei City station and
Banciao station, which costs NT$40, he added.</P>
      <P>"I feel the ticket machines pretty much are like slot machines, which is
ridiculous, " Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>Another problem, Hsieh said, is that the NT$17 interbank transfer fee charged by
the THSR on customers who do not use debit cards issued by certain banks only
add to the inconvenience.</P>
      <P>In response, the THSR said it does not make a dime from the transfer fee as it
all goes to the banks, and that the charges are made according to finance
regulations.</P>
      <P>As to ticket machines that only provide coins, the THSR admitted the design is
not perfect, but said that a new generation of ticket machines that provide
change in bank notes will not be available in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Journalist, a Taiwan-based news weekly known for its critical editorial
stance, will join forces with an official  Chinese media outlet to launch a new
magazine  for circulation in China, the weekly's chairman said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The new Chinese-language magazine, to be named I Look in English and Kan (look
or watch) in Chinese, will feature a news digest of major topics or issues
covered by media outlets throughout China, " said The Journalist Chairman Chou
Tien-jui, who arrived in Beijing earlier this week to strike the joint-venture
deal.</P>
      <P>Chou, a veteran journalist and political columnist, said The Journalist will
cooperate with the China News Weekly, a subsidiary of China News Service -- the
second-largest state-owned news agency in China, trailing the Xinhua news agency
-- in launching the new magazine.</P>
      <P>The Journalist will invest 12 million Chinese yuan (US$1.8 million) to control a
49 percent stake in the venture, Chou said, adding that the financial
cooperation marks a new way for Taiwan to think about China's media industry.</P>
      <P>"We hope the joint venture will help lay a foundation for our future forays into
the Chinese news market," Chou said.</P>
      <P>In China,  he said,  news media  organizations  face  few restrictions, so long
as they do not touch on China's central government policies.</P>
      <P>At a time when China is poised to begin reforming its political system, Chou
said he believes the new digest magazine will contribute to that goal.</P>
      <P>In the future, he added, the magazine might also be distributed in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih instructed several government agencies Thursday to cooperate
on building housing for rental to low-income or underprivileged people as part
of efforts to help them find places to live in the greater Taipei area.</P>
      <P>"I have instructed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of National Defense
to fully collaborate with the Interior Ministry to build houses at affordable
prices for low-income households on state-owned land," Wu said following a
weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said a day earlier that the central and local governments
will work together to offer fair-priced housing to the public in Taipei City and
Taipei  County amid widespread complaints that house prices in the greater
Taipei area, particularly in the city, are beyond the reach of most people.</P>
      <P>According to Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah, the housing will be mainly offered
to the physically challenged, victims of domestic violence or elderly citizens
who live alone.</P>
      <P>"The three ministries are slated to iron out a blueprint on the matter by the
end of this month," he added.</P>
      <P>Yeh Shih-wen,  director  of the Construction  and Planning Administration under
the Ministry of the Interior, said the Executive Yuan has instructed that 5
percent of the 226 hectares of land surrounding the A7 station on the Linkuo MRT
line in Taipei County should be reserved for the housing, which will be
exclusively used for rental.</P>
      <P>House prices in northern Taiwan have shown no signs of abating in recent months
and are expected to continue rising amid high hopes in the wake of the
implementation of the tariff-slashing economic cooperation framework agreement
between Taiwan and China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Central bank stabilizes housing prices: expert</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  14 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The central bank has stabilized housing prices in Taiwan's capital and its
neighboring area in the third quarter of this year as more people in those areas
see the coming six months as a good time to buy a home, a local real estate
agency said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Housing prices in the greater Taipei area of Taipei City and Taipei County
"could have risen at least 10 percent if the central bank had not launched
tightening measures in June, " Yeh Lin-chi, general manager of Evertrust Rehouse
Co., said at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>Since June, the Central Bank of the Republic of China has launched a series of
tightening moves on bank lending to curb the upward spiral of housing prices.
The soaring prices have ignited complaints that many local residents can no
longer afford to buy a home.</P>
      <P>"It is not easy to stabilize housing prices on the back of the bullish market
atmosphere and low interest rates," Yeh said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's benchmark interest rate now stands at 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>In the short term, he said, housing prices will not post a large increase, but
are also unlikely to fall.</P>
      <P>In the long run, he went on, housing prices will continue to rise as an influx
of Chinese and other foreign investors invest in the Taiwanese market in the
wake of a Taiwan-China pact that took effect earlier this year, paving the way
for more liberalized trade.</P>
      <P>Also seeing this trend, more people in the greater Taipei area told the company
in a quarterly poll conducted Sept. 14-24 that they consider now to be a good
time to buy a home.</P>
      <P>The poll shows that 40 percent of the respondents in Taipei City -- up 12
percent from the previous quarter -- hold that view, while the percentage of
those with an opposing view dropped 6 percent to 52 percent.</P>
      <P>In Taipei County, those who said they see the same period as a good time to buy
rose 3 percent to 38 percent, while those who disagree grew 4 percent to 55
percent.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, a government survey found that in Taipei City, the average
property purchase price is 10.87 times the average buyer's annual income, which
means Taipei residents would have to save all their salary for nearly 11 years
to be able to afford a home.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese golfing sensation Yani Tseng witnessed the 660,000th visitor to the
Taiwan Pavilion at the 2010 World Exposition in Shanghai Thursday when she acted
as director of the pavilion for a day.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that despite being offered a major sponsorship deal by a China-based
multinational conglomerate, she has never thought about representing China
professionally.</P>
      <P>"I have not given it much thought. I'm Taiwanese, and all I want to do is
surpass myself in world tournaments, " said Tseng, currently ranked fourth in
the world in women's professional golf.</P>
      <P>She said she will continue working to add to her professional golf triumphs "for
the glory of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Tseng, at just 21 the youngest-ever champion of the Ladies Professional Golf
Association (LPGA) tournament, said she was proud to have been invited to be
director-for-a-day of the Taiwan Pavilion, which showcases Taiwan's "soft power"
and the cream of Taiwanese culture.</P>
      <P>Tseng returned to Taiwan in September for a short rest after clinching the LPGA
Northwest Arkansas Championship for her fifth career title and her third this
season.</P>
      <P>Of her five LPGA titles, three have been majors. Her latest victory in Arkansas
was her first in a non-major this year after wins at the Kraft Nabisco
Championship in April and the Ricoh Women's British Open in August.</P>
      <P>She won the LPGA Championship in 2008, which means the U.S. Women's Open is the
only major she has yet to win. According to the LPGA website, only seven players
in history have achieved career grand slams.</P>
      <P>The US$300,000 top prize in Arkansas pushed Tseng into second place on the
LPGA's official list of winnings, with US$1.42 million in 2010, after Jiyai Shin
of South Korea, who has so far won US$1.46 million.</P>
      <P>The victory also propelled Tseng past Norway's Suzann Petersen to fourth place
in the Rolex world rankings.</P>

      <P>A breakdown of the baggage-handling system at Taoyuan International Airport's
Terminal 2 caused delays of about 30 minutes for five departing flights
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The breakdown was caused by a computer malfunction, according to airport
authorities.</P>

flights, " said airport spokesman Chao Shao-lien, who added that this measure
prevented  even greater  delays.  He expressed hope that the computer system
would be back up and running before midnight.</P>
      <P>The  airport's  current  baggage-handling  system  has been operational since

      <P>Aid from Taiwan is helping to change the lives of children living in the poorest
region of the Central Asian country Armenia.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan set up a project known as an Area Development Program (ADP)
in the town of Aparan earlier this year, with the goal of improving the standard
of living of poor children in the area. The town lies in Aragatsotn, an
impoverished province in western Armenia.</P>
      <P>The province lacks basic water and sewage amenities, with broken and muddy
roads, " said Shi-jing Chen, a priest who had been to Aragatsotn to see the
problems faced by local children.</P>
      <P>"The children there face difficult livesKthey are in need of foreign aid," he
said.</P>
      <P>After visiting new classrooms and kindergartens sponsored by the World Vision
Taiwan, he could see the importance of such donations, he said.</P>
      <P>Shu-zhen Yen, director of World Vision Taiwan's Central Area office, said that
while Taiwan was once itself a receiver of international aid from World Vision,
today it is helping to change the lives of those in poor countries such as
Armenia, where just a small donation can make a big difference for those
children in need, even making their dreams come true.</P>
      <P>World Vision Taiwan has set a goal of helping a total of 2000 children in
Armenia, she said.</P>
      <P>The area development program established in Aparan follows the first ADP
established by World Vision Taiwan in Armenia in 2007.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) reaffirmed Thursday that the group is committed
to safety management in the wake of the recent incidents in some of the group's
facilities that have aroused widespread concerns.</P>
      <P>High-ranking FPG officials made the remarks on the eve of the second anniversary
of the death of the group's founder, Wang Yung-ching.</P>
      <P>FPG Chairman William Wang noted that there has been criticism from all sides
since the incidents, and said he "accepted them with humility."</P>
      <P>Amid misgivings that "the management has gradually slackened off" since the
death of the founder, who always stressed hard work and discipline, Wang said
the group's seven-member core team has always trod "gingerly" when making
decisions.</P>
      <P>The group's Nanya Plastics Corp. in Chiayi County went up in flames earlier this
month following two fires in its Mailiao petrochemical complex in Yunlin County
in July.</P>
      <P>FPG Vice Chairwoman Susan Wang said the group attaches great importance to
environmental protection and workplace safety, saying that its waste water and
other waste, as well as sulphur dioxide emissions, have been reduced every year.</P>
      <P>The total injury index was cut to 0.19 in 2009 from 0.471 in 2004, far lower
than the average of 0.645 in Taiwan's manufacturing industry and the 0.734 in
the chemical raw material manufacturing industry.</P>
      <P>"If the management has become lax, how could we have achieved such good
results?" Wang asked.</P>
      <P>After careful review, she said, however, that the group needs to strengthen
safety management in 14 production processes.</P>

      <P>Issuers of Taiwan depositary receipts (TDRs) could be forced to delist their
stocks from the local stock exchange  if  they  fail  to  disclose  sensitive
information simultaneously in Taiwan and in the markets where their primary
listings took place, a high-ranking finance official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chen Yuh-chang, Chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) , said
the commission is pushing for a mechanism to enhance trading information
disclosure of TDR issuers to protect local investors.</P>
      <P>Chen said that under the mechanism, the FSC will impose a range of punishments
on TDR issuers based on the degree of violation of disclosure requirements, with
delisting as the ultimate penalty.</P>
      <P>The stock exchange  said it has been drawing  up related administrative
regulations and is expected to come up with details on the punishments in one or
two months. It added that the punishments might include fines of up to NT$5
million (US$163,000) and might also include trade suspensions.</P>
      <P>Poor information disclosure has sparked an outcry among investors here as TDRs
issued by Hong Kong-listed Kith Holdings Ltd., a China-based packaging product
maker, continued to be traded for two days in Taiwan even after trading of the
company's shares was suspended on the Hong Kong Exchange in mid-August.</P>

rose further by NT$0.19 to close at a 27-month high of NT$30.77 against the U.S.

      <P>In a bid to reduce speculation by foreign investors on the Taiwanese currency,

      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>FSC Chairman Chen Yuh-chang told the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee that
foreign funds remitted into Taiwan are mainly used for stock investment.
However, the investors will sometimes use the money to buy fixed-income
instruments after stock sales, a situation the FSC will closely monitor, Chen
added.</P>
      <P>On the cash collateral for bond borrowing, Chen said that only New Taiwan
dollars were acceptable in the past.</P>
      <P>In August, however, U.S. dollars were added alongside the local unit as
acceptable cash collateral, and the FSC and the central bank recently decided
that only U.S. dollars should be used.</P>
      <P>According  to information  obtained  by the central  bank, international hot
money for currency speculation is mostly hidden in current deposit accounts, the
bond market and cash collateral for bond borrowing in the New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>The move to allow only U.S. dollars to be used is to try to bar the use of bond
borrowing as a means of speculating on Taiwan's currency. (Oct. 15, 2010).</P>
      <P>Commercial Times:</P>
      <P>Also at the legislative meeting, Chen was asked by opposition Democratic
Progressive Party Legislator Gao Jyh-peng to comment on the possibility of
imposing a hot money tax to curb the inflow of speculative capital, a policy
recently adopted by Brazil.</P>
      <P>In response, Chen said that while he did not oppose the proposal, cautious
assessment should be conducted before imposing such a tax, which he said would
inevitably impact foreign investment in the local bourse. (Oct. 15, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The euro's climb above US$1.4 on the back of U.S. dollar weakness spurred an
appreciation of non-U.S. currencies Thursday.</P>
      <P>After successfully breaking the critical NT$31 mark recently, the New Taiwan
dollar further soared by NT$0.19 to NT$30.77 against the U.S. dollar, the
highest level in the past 27 months.</P>
      <P>According to bank officials, it remains to be seen if the central bank can block
the local currency from surging past the NT$30.219 mark. (Oct. 15, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: China's 5th Plenum</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>The 17th Central Committee of the Communist  Party of China (CPC)
10/15/10  12:42:15
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>begins its four-day fifth Plenum in Beijing Friday with a number of critical
issues on the agenda.</P>
      <P>The top concern is its 12th five-year development plan. After three decades of
economic reform, China has emerged as a new economic power. In the second
quarter of this year, it even overtook Japan to become the world's second-
largest economy, trailing only the United States. It is worth watching how China
will chart its new five-year plan to realize its goal of building a prosperous
society with sustainable and inclusive growth as promised by Chinese President
Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Another concern is China's leadership transition. CPC cadres attending the
plenum are expected to approve Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping's appointment
as vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, which will be confirmation
that he is on track to be the next president of China. If Xi fails to get the
post, it could signal elite divisions over succession or possible changes in
China's succession model.</P>
      <P>Although Hu and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao have mentioned political reform on
many public occasions, it would be unrealistic to expect China to move toward
Western-style democracy at this point. Nevertheless, we still look forward to
seeing China including political reform in its new five-year plan to offer a bit
more freedom for its people and make its administrative system more
incorruptible and transparent. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 15, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Foreign labor employment procedures to be streamlined: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 15 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has been working to streamline the
complicated procedures involved in hiring foreign workers without using brokers,
in the hope that the measure will help stem worker exploitation by the brokers,
the CLA minister said Friday.</P>
      <P>"Direct  employment  is a very good way of reducing  the exploitation of foreign
laborers, " Wang Ju-hsuan said outside the Legislative Yuan while answering
questions from reporters on a newspaper report that the council is working to
expand the existing direct employment system.</P>
      <P>She admitted that although the system has been in place since 2007, the
application procedures are indeed "far too complicated and frustrate the
employers."</P>
      <P>Therefore,  she said,  the CLA's Bureau of Employment and Vocational Training is
attempting to work out plans to encourage local employers to hire foreign
laborers without going through brokers.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based China Times daily reported that same day that increasing
numbers of foreign workers have been absconding from their contracted work
places. One of the main reasons for this is the astronomical brokerage bills
they are forced to pay every month, which often prompts them to run away and
continue working illegally under the radar.</P>
      <P>Under the existing regulations on foreign labor employment, each foreign worker
is entitled to a two-year residence permit, and allowed to apply for an
extension of another year. To get their first permit to work in Taiwan, each
applicant has to pay a broker as much as NT$100,000 (US$3,260), the report said.</P>
      <P>If they want to keep working here after completing a three-year contract, they
have to fly back home and renew the application, which requires them to undergo
the same procedures all over again and pay yet another brokerage fee.</P>
      <P>To prevent foreign workers from being exploited any longer by these unscrupulous
brokers, the government set up the Direct Hiring Service Center three years ago,
which is supposed to assist local employers with hiring foreign workers on their
own, to save the enormous brokerage charges for both sides.</P>
      <P>The services, however, are limited to employers seeking to renew contracts for
their existing foreign workers, which the report said is due to the failure of
the foreign workers' home countries -- mostly Indonesia, the Philippines and
Thailand -- to build manpower data banks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Women's rights activists accused the government Friday of having failed to make
its position clear with regard to its sex industry policy and of making rushed
decisions without public consensus.</P>
      <P>"We're not sure about the government's position on the sex industry -- does it
have an open attitude on adult sex transactions or does it intend to prohibit
such activities? " asked Tsai Wan-fen, secretary-general of Taiwan Women's Link,
at a press conference organized by the Anti-Sexual Exploitation Alliance, a
league of more than a dozen human rights non-government organizations (NGOs).</P>
      <P>The alliance voiced its opinion two days after Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah
said his ministry will not approve the establishment of red-light zones anywhere
in the country and agreed that adult sex transactions should be decriminalized.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Interior (MOI) will start formulating its final policy and
submit its recommendations to the Executive Yuan before the end of the year,
Jiang was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the alliance is firmly opposed to the legalization of adult sex
transactions, adding that the government should crack down on the sex industry
and penalize those caught running prostitution rings.</P>
      <P>The MOI "acted on its own discretion, " with only four public hearings held on
the controversial issue. The majority of the six scholars who spoke at those
hearings appear to favor the legalization of prostitution, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>According to a public opinion survey conducted by the MOI last year,  83 percent
of the respondents  said they favored  the establishment  of red-light zones and
over 90 percent of the respondents said they disagreed with the legalization of
adult sex transactions in private homes, said Cheng Kai-jung, secretary-general
of the Taipei Association for the Promotion of Women's Rights.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey show that there is no public consensus on the
controversial issue and that more dialogue is needed before finalizing the
national policy, Cheng added.</P>
      <P>Legalization of the sex trade could lead to serious threats to social order and
human trafficking due to the potential involvement of organized crime, said
Justine Wang of the Taipei Women's Rescue Foundation.</P>
      <P>Until a final consensus is reached, Wang said, the government should not set a
timetable for the issue. If it does decide to legalize prostitution, she went
on, it should also consider levying "a social tax on whoremasters, " since their
behavior brings extra costs and threats to society.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs will set up four emergency task forces to help
Taiwanese businesses deal with a potential computer glitch that could occur as
the Republic of China enters its 100th year in 2011, an official said Friday.</P>
      <P>The task forces will operate around the clock from Dec. 1, 2010 to Jan. 31,
2011, said Wu Ming-chi,  director-general of the ministry's Department of
Industrial Technology.</P>
      <P>The problem, known as the "centenary bug, " is similar to the Y2K bug that
caused panic prior to the start of 2000 until it turned out to be a false alarm.</P>
      <P>The ministry is afraid that there could be a problem in this case because in
older computer systems, the year on the ROC calendar is presented in two digits
and there is concern that these systems might not be able to cope with three-
digit years.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a survey conducted by the MOEA among local
businesses in August, more than 70 percent of the respondents had already
updated their computer systems to prevent the potential glitch.</P>
      <P>Most of the businesses that had not done so were small and micro- enterprises
with fewer than 50 staff, the results show.</P>
      <P>The main obstacles faced by these enterprises were insufficient understanding of
the problem and a lack of technical personnel to handle it, according to the

      <P>Taiwan's economy this year will grow more than previously forecast due to
better-than-expected growth in consumption, investment and exports earlier this
year, a local research institute said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research adjusted upward its prediction
for the whole-year gross domestic product (GDP) in 2010 from 6.94 percent to
8.15 percent.</P>
      <P>"We revised our forecast upward because consumption, investment and exports
posted higher levels of growth than expected in the second quarter, " said Wang
Lee-rong, director of the institute's Center for Economic Forecasting, at a
press briefing.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter, private consumption grew 4.41 percent from a year
earlier, while domestic investment jumped 30.77 percent from the same period of
last year, according to the institute's figures.</P>
      <P>"This year's domestic investment will grow by an estimated 17.3 percent, which
will mark a new high since 1988, " she said, attributing the reason to a major
Taiwan- China trade pact that took effect recently.</P>
      <P>The government has been working to attract foreign and overseas Taiwanese
investors to Taiwan after the signing in late June of the economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) , which is aimed at further liberalizing trade
between Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>The institute's forecast, however, is lower than the 8.24 percent predicted by
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Rick Lo, a senior economist with Fubon Financial Holding Co., said at the press
briefing that Taiwan's economic growth might be close to 9 percent this year and
5 percent next year, due to the ECFA and Taiwan's possible increased opening to
Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>The economic growth for the second half of this year is expected to be
relatively small compared to the same period of last year due to the high growth
at that time and a slowing global economy this year, the institute said.</P>
      <P>Export-reliant Taiwan's GDP is likely to have grown 6.71 percent in the third
quarter of this year and to reach 1.20 percent in the fourth quarter compared to
the year-earlier figures. Tallies for these two quarters were not yet available.</P>
      <P>For next year, the institute predicted the GDP growth forecast at 4.59  percent
after  taking  into consideration  the worrying unemployment and government debt
in the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the institute predicted that the jobless rate might have fallen to
5.16 percent in the third quarter of this year and to 5.06 percent in the fourth
quarter.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate for the whole of 2010 will average an estimated 5.29
percent, and is expected to drop to 4.86 precent for 2011, the institute said.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih has said he will offer his resignation if the jobless rate
does not fall under 5 percent by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>In addition, the institute believes that the consumer price index, a measure of
inflation, will rise 1.08 percent this year and 0.93 percent next year.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The remarkable rescue of 33 Chilean miners trapped 624 meters underground for
more than two months is arguably one of the most uplifting events in modern
history.</P>
      <P>The flawlessly executed operation was an unqualified success that deserves
careful study in terms of both the leadership displayed and the supreme skills
of the disaster rescue and relief workers.</P>
      <P>First and foremost, it shows the power of a common purpose. The rescue was
obviously a multinational, multidisciplinary feat, with contributions from
various institutions and companies around the world. In pursuit of the unique
goal of saving the miners, all the service and equipment  providers  showed
focus and discipline, preventing turf battles from bogging down the whole
effort.</P>
      <P>The rescue also demonstrates the virtue of always having backup plans. The shaft
that ultimately reached the miners was the second of three being drilled. Since
no-one ever before had been rescued through such a long shaft, the operation was
basically an experiment. Trying several different ways at once raised the odds
of success.</P>
      <P>The extraordinary rescue of all 33 miners symbolizes the triumph of human spirit
and the joy of team pride. It also serves as a reminder that people truly can
work together and that every human life is important. (Editorial abstract --

      <P>Traditional markets are a possible source for many of the indigenous dengue
fever cases in southern Taiwan's Tainan City, where as many as 130 cases have
been confirmed, according to the results of a study by the city government.</P>
      <P>The cases have all been reported since Sept. 11, when the first domestic one was
confirmed. One case was fatal, with the death caused by dengue hemorrhagic
fever, a potentially fatal complication of the disease.</P>
      <P>The city health bureau pointed out that many of the people infected had reported
going to traditional markets, where standing water is often left in containers
or in puddles and gutters, creating ideal breeding conditions for the mosquitoes
that carry dengue fever.</P>
      <P>The number of cases in the West Central district alone account for 66 percent of
all the cases in the city's six districts, according to the bureau. Most of them
live in the neighborhood surrounding a traditional market, leading to suspicion
that the market might be a source of infection.</P>
      <P>The bureau urged the public to wear long sleeves and pants when shopping at
traditional markets to prevent mosquito bites.</P>
      <P>The Centers for Disease Control said Oct. 12 that since August, 483 cases have
been reported in Taiwan, over 80 percent of which have been concentrated in
Kaohsiung and Tainan.</P>
      <P>The World Health Organization describes dengue fever as a mosquito-borne
infection that causes a severe flu-like illness that has the potential to be
fatal. The disease is found in tropical and sub-tropical climates worldwide,

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.12 percent Friday after a tug of war between
rotational buying of select old economy stocks and selling of high-tech sector
shares, which were haunted by gloom over the industry's earnings outlook,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 10.15 points to 8,205.30, after moving between 8,184.29
and 8,242.77, on turnover of NT$124.70 billion (US$4.07 billion).</P>
      <P>The weighted index opened flat, rising 1.42 points after a lackluster
performance on Wall Street overnight.</P>
      <P>It seesawed for most of the session, as investors cut their electronics holdings
after a fall on the tech-rich NASDAQ while buying textile and petrochemical
shares, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,393 stocks closed down, 1,570 finished up, and 290 remained
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Cement sector shares suffered the steepest decline, losing 1.02 percent.
Machinery and electronics  stocks fell 0.64 percent, construction shares lost
0.4 percent and foodstuffs closed fell 0.2 percent.</P>
      <P>The textile sector rose 4.04 percent and the plastics and chemical sector gained
1.2 percent, while paper and pulp stocks added 0.33 percent and financial shares
rose 0.01 percent.</P>
      <P>"Ahead of an earnings report period to start later this month, uncertainty over
the electronics sector's profitability continued to haunt high-tech stocks," TLG
Asset Management Arch Shih said.</P>
      <P>Shih said a rising Taiwan dollar has dampened market sentiment on fears that
weakening export competitiveness would further hurt the sector's bottom line at
a time when global demand has appeared to slow.</P>
      <P>"I suspect foreign institutional  investors  kept unloading electronics stocks,
in particular semiconductor related firms, today," Shih said.</P>
      <P>The analyst predicted that amid such cautious sentiment, the market's index
would move between 8,100 and 8,300 next week.</P>
      <P>Among high-tech stocks, integrated circuit designer MediaTek fell 3.47 percent
to NT$390.00 and memory chip maker Nanya Technology fell 3.18 percent to
NT$18.20.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, rising product prices continued to boost textile and petrochemical

      <P>Taiwan's new representative to Vietnam, Huang Chih-peng, has voiced hope that
the two countries can soon begin convening meetings of their ministerial-level
officials in charge of economic, commercial and industrial affairs.</P>
      <P>"Vietnam is an important economic and trade partner" of Taiwan, Huang said in an
interview with CNA, expressing hope that through such meetings, the two sides
can discuss ways to boost bilateral links.</P>
      <P>Huang, who was director-general of the Bureau of Foreign Trade before being
assigned to head the representative office in Hanoi, assumed office Oct. 6.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Huang said Taiwan is Vietnam's second-largest source of
foreign funds and that he expects Taiwan to take over the top position soon,
once several major investment projects are launched.</P>
      <P>For export-reliant Taiwan, Vietnam is an important investment environment, with
abundant natural resources and quality manpower, he said.</P>
      <P>Turning to his new duties, Huang said his office will help trade and investment
activities launched by Taiwanese businesses  in Vietnam,  while  trying  to
boost  Taiwan-Vietnam  relations comprehensively by first seeking progress in
bilateral links in the fields of culture, education and medical care.</P>
      <P>Asked about a recent announcement by Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry
(VCCI) Chairman Vu Tien Loc that the group has organized a research panel to
study the feasibility of signing an economic cooperation agreement with Taiwan,
Huang said that "anything is possible with hard work."</P>
      <P>The VCCI is the authority responsible for the management of state-run
enterprises and other small and medium-sized enterprises. The top post in the
organization is held by a ministerial-level official.</P>
      <P>Vietnam is ruled by a communist regime that follows the "one China" policy

      <P>After a string of serious flood disasters, the Executive Yuan finally accepted
expert advice two years ago to create a cross-agency commission charged with
coordinating river management and flood prevention efforts at different levels.</P>
      <P>The commission, however, has only met once since its formation. Premier Wu Den-
yih did not know its inaction until after opposition Legislator Tien Chiu-chin
exposed the flop at a recent legislative session.</P>
      <P>It was not only shocking but also distressing for members of the public to learn
of the episode. Even more outrageous was that the commission had remained
moribund after Typhoon Morakot wreaked havoc in August 2009 and Typhoon Fanabi
devastated Kaohsiung last month.</P>
      <P>Under current regulations, a number of agencies at local and central levels are
in charge of river management. Even the Council of Indigenous Peoples plays a
role in administration of reserved land in the upper stretches of some major
rivers.</P>
      <P>The complicated system of division of labor has often hobbled river cleanup and
other flood control projects.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu should take Tien's criticism as a driving force to overhaul the river
administrative system. When a package of government restructuring rules take
effect in 2012, a new river management commission with full power and resources
should also be in place to more efficiently protect local people from flooding
disasters. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 15, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- 'Uniform queen' shapes Taiwan's 2010 Expo image</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/15/10  18:44:23
(CommonWealth 456)(Translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Liao Chia-lin's passion and persistence won her the chance to create the uniform
for staff members of Taiwan's pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai Expo, but well
before then she had already won the hearts of many people around Taiwan who have
worn her uniform designs.</P>
      <P>Dubbed the "Uniform Queen" by those who know her, Liao is behind the uniforms of
over 70 percent of the saleswomen at department store cosmetic counters and half
of the bank tellers in the country.</P>
      <P>She has such a loyal following that the wearers of her outfits often say they
want to keep them on after work, and it is that customer loyalty that has helped
her company, Chorong Industrial Co., recently exceed NT$100 million in annual
revenues for the first time.</P>
      <P>Her rise in the intensely competitive industry is remarkable, considering her
complete lack of knowledge about the textile and apparel businesses when she
graduated from college with a degree in tourism management over 20 years ago.</P>
      <P>After working in a hotel's public relations office for six months after
graduating, she entered the industry as a saleswoman at her friend's company.</P>
      <P>Despite her lack of knowledge, she often impressed potential clients with fresh
ideas that were based on her interest in fashion design and in-depth research on
the customer.</P>
      <P>She decided to leave the company, however, because of customer complaints over
the poor quality of the delivered uniforms.</P>
      <P>Liao was looking for a new job when a former client asked her to design a
uniform for some 20 saleswomen for Sonia Rykiel, which had just been introduced
to Taiwan at the time.</P>
      <P>The deal's success brought more business Liao's way, so she set up her own
company named after her daughter Chorong to focus on making uniforms.</P>
      <P>Liao stands out in the business for her willingness to invest in customized
fabrics that make each client's uniform unique. She often visits textile
factories and research institutes such as National Pingtung University of
Science and Technology in southern Taiwan to keep up on the latest innovations.</P>
      <P>Her meticulous attention to how people feel wearing her uniforms also is a key
element in her ability to win over clients.</P>
      <P>Her insistence on doing the fittings for every one of her clients has led her to
even travel to the outlying Nangan Island (part of the Matsu island chain) to
take the measurements of employees at Bank of Taiwan's branch there.</P>
      <P>Liao has also insisted on keeping the company's production in Taiwan, and she
works with over 50 local suppliers and contractors to maintain the quality that
keeps Chorong competitive.</P>
      <P>Still, Taiwan's uniform market has been undermined by cutthroat competition,
leaving players with narrow margins. Liao has battled this odious environment by
generally avoiding open tenders held by corporate clients for uniforms, where
prices are often driven to unacceptable low levels.</P>
      <P>Only 20 percent of the company's business is derived from open tenders, with the
rest coming from contests and clients who seek out her company's services.</P>
      <P>Facing another industry challenge -- a shortage of new-generation tailors and
skilled craftsmen -- Liao has offered internships to students in recent years to
give them a chance to experiment with new ideas.</P>
      <P>That may give her an important advantage in one of her long-term goals --
entering the haute couture business. Though specializing in uniform designs, she
has shown her talent for more sophisticated dresses.</P>
      <P>Her formal dress designs, for example, won the top prize for woman's wear at the
33rd World Congress of Master Tailors in Austria's Salzburg in 2009. Chorong has
twice represented Taiwan in the biennial event.</P>
      <P>Liang Tung-fu, chairman of Lih-shang Tailor and a veteran tailor who has counted
Taiwan's presidents among his clients, believes Liao will achieve whatever goal
she sets out to accomplish.</P>
      <P>Liao's dedication and persistence, he says, has transformed her from an amateur
into "a top professional in the business."</P>

    <HEADLINE>MediaTek shares fall to near 16-month low over price war concerns</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shares of integrated circuit designer MediaTek Inc. fell to a nearly 16-month
low Friday amid concerns that escalating price competition in China will further
impact the stock's bottom line, dealers said.</P>
      <P>MediaTek fell 3.47 percent to NT$390.00 (US$12.72) , the lowest level since June
29, 2009, with 13.25 million shares changing hands, while the benchmark weighted
index closed down 0.12 percent at 8,205.30.</P>
      <P>"There are no signs that a price war in China is going to stop any time soon
with MediaTek's rivals continuing to cut prices for a higher share in China's
cell phone chip market,"  Grand  Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu said.</P>
      <P>According to Hsu, MediaTek's share in China's cell phone chip market has fallen
to 80 percent from a peak of 95 percent seen earlier this year amid fierce
competition.</P>
      <P>Cell phone chips account for about 75 percent of MediaTek's total sales and
"bandit" or unbranded Chinese cell phone makers are the major buyers of the
company's cell phone chips, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"Falling prices are eroding MediaTek's profitability. Investors have been
anxious, waiting for the company's third quarter earnings announcement, due
later this month," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>In July, MediaTek predicted that its gross margin would fall to between 51.5
percent and 53.5 percent in the third quarter from 55 percent recorded in the
second quarter.</P>
      <P>Hsu said it remained to be seen whether the company would maintain its gross
margin within the anticipated range under such unfavorable circumstances.</P>
      <P>Hsu said a stronger New Taiwan dollar has further dampened market sentiment
toward high-tech stocks, including MediaTek, amid fears that their global
competitiveness will weaken.</P>
      <P>"I expect that foreign institutional investors will continue to unload MediaTek
stocks on the back of a gloomy mood about the company's earnings outlook," Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>Currently, foreign institutional investors hold some 51 percent of MediaTek's
shares, which leaves room for them to lower their holdings, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>He added that the stock might fall an additional 10 percent-15 percent before
finding technical support.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Credit Suisse said it has raised its target price for Evergreen Marine Corp.,
Taiwan's largest shipper, to NT$31 (US$1.01) from NT$25 on an improving earnings
outlook.</P>
      <P>In a research note, Credit Suisse said it has also maintained a "outperform"
rating on the stock, which closed up NT$0.10 at NT$22.60 on Friday.</P>
      <P>The brokerage  commented  that while  the company  is not particularly
transparent, the company's earnings in the first half of this year and sales in
recent financial statements pointed to a rebound in line with the global
shipping industry.</P>
      <P>In the second quarter, Evergreen Marine posted about NT$4.0 billion in net
profit, compared with a net loss of NT$87 million registered in the first
quarter.</P>
      <P>In 2009, Evergreen Marine recorded a NT$9.86 billion net loss on the lingering
impact of the global financial meltdown that first battered the world economy in
late 2008.</P>
      <P>"We believe Evergreen Marine's long-term competitiveness is rising on the new
ship orders," Credit Suisse said. "We believe these ships are competitive
compared with its peers in terms of cost."</P>
      <P>The company has commissioned  South Korea's  Samsung Heavy Industries Co. to
build 20 ships, each of which will have a cargo capacity of 8,000 twenty-foot
equivalent units (TEUs) , for US$2.06 billion.</P>
      <P>The delivery of the new ships will start from 2012.</P>
      <P>Credit Suisse has also raised its forecast of Evergreen Marine's net profit to
NT$14.36 billion from an early estimate of NT$3.25 billion for 2010, to NT$15.07
billion from NT$6.53 billion for 2011, and to NT$16.64 billion from NT$9.31
billion for 2012.</P>

      <P>Twelve players ranked in the WTA's (Women's Tennis Association) top 100,
including Jarmila Groth of Australia and Kimiko Date-Krumm of Japan, have
entered the 2010 OEC Taipei Ladies Open, organizers said Friday.</P>
      <P>The top-seeded Groth, who won the tournament in its first year in 2008, has the
highest ranking of any player in the field at No. 42, followed by Date-Krumm at
No. 56.</P>
      <P>They will be joined by local favorites Chan Yung-jan, Chang Kai-chen, Hsieh Su-
wei and Chuang Chia-jung in front of hometown crowds at Taipei Arena.</P>
      <P>The total purse for the ITF (International Tennis Federation) event is
US$100,000,  according  to the Chinese Taipei Tennis Association (CTTA), which
is organizing the tournament.</P>
      <P>ITF tourneys are a tier below WTA events, which have minimum purses of
US$220,000 and attract higher seeded players.</P>
      <P>Forty-year-old veteran Date-Krumm, who retired in 1993 and returned to tennis in
2008, and Alicia Molik, the women's singles bronze medalist at the 2004 Athens
Olympics, who ranked as high as 8th and is now 98th, are among a competitive
group of players capable of winning this year's event.</P>
      <P>Germany's 21-year-old rising star Sabine Lisicki, a women's singles
quarterfinalist at Wimbledon in 2009, is expected to wow crowds with serves that
can reach nearly 200 kilometers per hour.</P>
      <P>Alla Kudryavtseva of Russia, Romani Oprandi of Italy, Ayumi Morita of Japan and
China's Peng Shuai are among other notable foreign competitors.</P>
      <P>Chan Yung-jan, the highest-ranked Taiwanese player on the women's tour at No.

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan will not recognize Chinese diplomas retroactively: premier</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 15 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih reaffirmed Friday that Taiwan's government will not
retroactively recognize Chinese diplomas that were obtained before Sept. 3, when
Taiwan began implementing a policy to recognize diplomas from China.</P>
      <P>The issue of recognizing Chinese diplomas is a contentious one, with critics,
including those from the opposition  Democratic Progressive Party, expressing
concerns that it would hurt Taiwanese graduates and job seekers.</P>
      <P>Wu said Friday that for people who earned diplomas  from Taiwan-recognized
Chinese universities before that date but after 1992,  the government is
considering certifying their academic qualifications through an examination or
verification process.</P>
      <P>The process would be different from "automatic recognition" of their diplomas,
Wu said during a question and answer session in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wu was responding to concerns by opposition lawmakers that such a plan, which is
being drafted by the Ministry of Education (MOE) , could violate the principle
of non-retroactivity for Chinese diploma recognition.</P>
      <P>The legislature passed an amendment to the Statute Governing the Relations
Between the People of the Taiwan Area and the Mainland Area in August to pave
the way for the recognition of Chinese diplomas. The amended law was implemented
on Sept. 3.</P>
      <P>A total of 41 top Chinese universities are currently recognized by Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Minister of Education Wu Ching-ji explained that the plan to certify the
academic qualifications of graduates of these 41 Chinese universities is aimed
at protecting the rights of Taiwan's residents who received education in China
after the statute was enacted in 1992.</P>
      <P>According to the MOE's plan, the diploma holders will need to meet certain
requirements before their academic qualifications can be certified by the
government.</P>
      <P>For bachelor's degree holders, they have to prove that they studied eight
semesters  and stayed 32 months in China.  The requirements for master's degree
holders is two semesters and eights months, and those for doctorate degree
holders are four semesters and 16 months, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Those who earned their degrees through correspondence programs will not get
certification, he added.</P>
      <P>Also Friday, Deputy Minister of Education Lin Tsong-ming said the certification
requirements will apply not only to diploma holders who are Taiwanese but also
to Chinese and other foreign nationals.</P>

They were the mass rapid transit systems (94.2 percent) , the Taiwan High Speed
Rail (93.3 percent) , and public arts and cultural institutions (90.1 percent).</P>
      <P>On the other hand, police and employment services got the worst satisfaction

      <P>Nearly 21 percent of locally sold toys tested in a recent survey  contained  an
excessive  level of plasticizers and 15 percent lacked the proper labeling, the
Bureau of Standards, Metrology, and Inspection revealed Friday.</P>
      <P>Of 52 items tested, including bathtub toys and inflatables, 11 contained a level
of phthalate ester that exceeded the national standard of 0.1 percent of a toy's
weight, said Huang Lai-ho, the bureau's deputy director-general.</P>
      <P>The amount of the plasticizer in the 11 products found to be substandard ranged
from 0.14 percent to 38.79 percent, according to the bureau's test results.</P>
      <P>The bureau said it ordered the manufacturers of the defective items to recall
them within a set timeframe or face fines ranging from NT$100,000 to NT$1
million.</P>
      <P>Plasticizers are additives used in plastic products to increase their
flexibility or plasticity. It is believed that they disrupt a child's hormone
system, with a link to feminization among boys and breast cancer in women.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, eight of the toys checked either did not have safety labels or labels
with complete product information in Chinese, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Companies selling products without the required safety labels can be fined
between NT$200,000 and NT$2 million, and those offering goods without acceptable
Chinese product labels are subject to fines of NT$100,000 to NT$1 million.</P>

      <P>A local research institute forecast Friday that Taiwan's currency will rise from
this year's annual average of NT$31.68 to NT$30.42 against the U.S. dollar next
year on the back of speculative capital inflow into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research predicted that the New Taiwan
dollar will average an estimated NT$31.68 against the greenback for the whole of
2010, up 4.17 percent from last year.</P>
      <P>The institute believes the currency will continue to rise next year, "but to a
relatively lesser extent, " said Wang Lee-rong, director of the institute's
Center for Economic Forecasting, at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>At the press conference, Kuo Nai-fong, an economist at Taipei's Shih Hsin

      <P>"It's very likely that the currency will appreciate (against the greenback) more

      <P>Speculative capital seeking short-term profits has been flowing into Asia,
prompting the local unit to hit NT$30.77 against the dollar a day earlier,
marking a new high in more than two years.</P>
      <P>Kuo predicted bigger fluctuations in Taiwan's exchange rate next year, which
will make local companies face a greater level of uncertainty.</P>
      <P>This, he added, will increase the jobless rate.</P>
      <P>Rick Lo, a senior economist with Fubon Financial Holding Co., forecast that the
New Taiwan dollar will hover at around NT$30.50 to NT$31.00 against the dollar

      <P>He added that the greenback will become stronger by the second quarter of next

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group representing the country's travel agencies criticized a domestic airline
for selling tickets through convenience stores, which they said violated the law
and their exclusive rights.</P>
      <P>The 7-Eleven convenience store chain began offering UNI Air e-tickets on Sept.
28, and the Travel Agent Association of R.O.C. Taiwan (TAAT) contended that the
travel industry has suffered considerably because of it.</P>
      <P>TAAT Chairman Yao Ta-Kuang said the behavior of the carrier and convenience
store chain violated the Act for the Development of Tourism, which stipulates
that only travel agencies are authorized to sell "land, sea, or air
transportation tickets" on a commission basis.</P>
      <P>"We can't tolerate the airline's attempt to manipulate the market, " Yao said,
warning that travel agencies would take strong action to protest if the airline
did not shut down the ticketing system.</P>
      <P>Yao contended that by selling cheaper airline tickets at the convenience stores,
the airline has threatened both the market mechanism and the livelihood of
Taiwan's 2,800 travel agencies.</P>
      <P>UNI Air responded that it had reported the system to Taiwan's aviation
regulator, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA), and said the convenience
stores only provided access to the carrier's website rather than actually
selling tickets on its behalf.</P>
      <P>According to UNI Air, the average number of tickets sold through its website via
convenience store links ranged from 150 to 180 daily.</P>
      <P>The airline said the new service had mostly benefited soldiers on the outlying
islands of Kinmen and Matsu, where sales accounted for more than 90 percent of
the tickets sold through convenience stores.</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau said it had asked the airline and 7-Eleven to explain the
issue and pledged to investigate.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese pitcher Kuo Hong-chih has been nominated for the "Setup Man of the
Year" award for 2010, according to a report posted on the Los Angeles Dodgers
official website Friday.</P>
      <P>Kuo, who concluded the best MLB season of his career Oct. 3 by securing the
Dodgers record for lowest ERA based on a minimum of at least 50 innings pitched,
has already won the "Setup Man of the Year" once, in 2008.</P>
      <P>Given his remarkable performance during the 2010 season, Kuo is likely to clinch
the honor again this year, Dodgers.com reporter Ken Gurnick wrote.</P>
      <P>The left-hander started the season injured but later emerged as the Dodgers'
best reliever and the only one in Major League Baseball to record at least 10
saves and 20 holds during the 2010 season.</P>
      <P>It was his best season since first making the Dodgers roster in 2005. He struck
out 73 while yielding only 29 hits and 18 walks in 60 innings pitched.</P>
      <P>Aside from his record-setting ERA, his WHIP (walks and hits per inning pitched)
was an astounding 0.78. Anything below 1 is considered outstanding.</P>
      <P>The 29-year-old pitcher started the 2010 season as a setup man but was installed
as a closer in mid-August in place of the struggling Jonathan Braxton.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Japanese high school students, in Taiwan to perform on taiko drums,
took advantage of some time off after a performance recently to visit a farm in
Tainan County Friday.</P>
      <P>The Japan Sanyo Daiko Dan, a group from Sanyo Senior High School in Hiroshima,
made the visit four days after putting on a show at the 2010 Nanying
International Folklore Festival, which is taking place in the southern Taiwan
county from Oct. 9 to Oct. 17.</P>
      <P>The group made its way to Houbi Township's Jing Liao Community, made famous
after serving as the backdrop of a prominent 2004 documentary about rice farming
called "Let It Be."</P>
      <P>Farmer Huang Kun-bin, the protagonist in the film, showed the Japanese students
around the village to get a feel for life in the old-time farming community.</P>
      <P>The sixteen boys in the group rode on a water buffalo carriage, a traditional
means of transportation for Taiwanese farmers, and they enjoyed a special meal
that included the village's award-winning rice.</P>
      <P>"We sprinkled sesame on the rice today to make them feel especially at home,"
the 77-year-old Huang said.</P>
      <P>The group's teacher Makoto Sasaki complimented the local rice, saying it tasted
similar to Japan's sushi rice.</P>
      <P>The teenagers were also excited to touch a buffalo's horns and head.</P>
      <P>"It is the first time my students saw a water buffalo grazing and rode on a
carriage pulled by the animal, " Sasaki said.</P>
      <P>Let It Be was the most popular film of its kind in 2004 and sparked a heated
debate about the impact on agriculture of Taiwan's ascension to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in 2002.</P>

      <P>An orange "elephant" from Green Island off Taiwan's southeastern coast arrived
in northern Taiwan Friday in what its owner called a fulfillment of its dream to
travel around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The elephant, actually an old playground slide designed in the shape of the
animal, is serving as a cultural ambassador that embodies the environmental
spirit of Green Island and hopes to unify all of Taiwan's townships, said the
slide's owner Lee Meng-fa.</P>
      <P>"I hope my elephant can make a lot of friends throughout his journey," Lee said.
"He is the guardian angel of Green Island and the friend of every Taiwanese."</P>
      <P>Lee said the elephant's  journey north was made to raise environmental awareness
and encourage eco-friendliness,  as the elephant slide itself barely escaped the
fate of being discarded last year.</P>
      <P>When Green Island Primary School tried to throw away the 24-year-old playground
fixture -- the object of precious childhood memories of many of the island's
3,000 residents -- Lee reached out and bought it for NT$100.</P>
      <P>Determined to turn it into a public art work and a landmark of Green Island, Lee
worked with students of Taitung Gungguan Primary School to paint the slide and
give it a new face.</P>
      <P>Transporting the 3-meter long, 2-meter wide by 1.5-meter high elephant was no
easy task. After being shipped by ferry from Green Island to Taiwan's eastern
Taitung County, it changed cargo trains twice as it proceeded up the east coast
before arriving in northern Taiwan's Yingge Township at 8 a.m.</P>
      <P>Unable to accompany his "elephant" in the cargo train, Lee drove himself north
to wait for his prized animal at the Yingge station, and when the 80 kilogram
elephant finally arrived, its fans and the station master cheered.</P>
      <P>Lee plans for the elephant to visit Taipei City Zoo on Oct. 16 and also to cheer
on the Brother Elephants, one of Taiwan's most popular professional baseball
teams.</P>
      <P>The "Green Island Elephant" has gained fame on Facebook with almost 3,000 fans,
and Lee believes it has plenty more to give as an icon for unity and
environmentalism and a landmark of Green Island.</P>
      <P>"A small NT$100 can create  a big dream far beyond  our imagination, " Lee said.

      <P>Taiyen Biotech Co., Taiwan's former salt monopoly, will soon expand into the
optoelectronics sector after successfully developing and manufacturing high-
performance  heat sinks, Taiyen Biotech Chairman Hung Hsi-yao announced Friday.</P>
      <P>Hung said his company has begun producing aluminum nitride (AIN) heat sinks that
dissipate heat 10-times faster than traditional aluminum oxide models because of
their relatively high thermal conductivity, ideal for a number of high-tech
products.</P>
      <P>"My company  has signed a letter of intent with Forworld Electronics Co. to

      <P>"This is part of Taiyen Biotech's efforts to make inroads into the consumer

      <P>Mass production will help bring down the price of the AIN heat sink, enabling it
to compete with devices made of other materials and even Japanese products, Hung
added.</P>
      <P>Taiyen is applying for a patent for its AIN heat sink in both Taiwan and China,
Hung noted.</P>
      <P>Forworld Chairman Gorden Teng said his company will change to AIN heat sinks in
the future because they will effectively help reduce temperatures in its blue-

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah unveiled earlier this week the
government's plan to decriminalize the adult sex trade but ruled out the idea of
setting up red-light districts anywhere in the country.</P>
      <P>He also said the government will not encourage the establishment of large-scale
sexual service businesses and will permit the existence of self-employed sex
workers.</P>
      <P>After years of debate, the government has finally identified its basic principle
on the sex industry. The history of the past thousands of years has proven that
it is totally ineffective to forbid, block or penalize the sex trade.</P>
      <P>Allowing sexual service provided by self-employed sex workers is a better idea
than setting up red-light districts because this will help reduce human
trafficking and exploitation of sex workers.</P>
      <P>To prevent the sex trade from affecting the life of other residents living in
the same communities with the sex workers, a law can be enacted to ban
residence-based and street-based sex work and require that the sex trade be
conducted in hotels or motels. The Internet should be allowed as a means of
soliciting clients, but street advertising should be prohibited. (Editorial

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Replacing the death penalty with life sentence</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/16/10  13:36:46
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's resumption of executions of death row inmates on April 30, the first
time the death penalty has been carried out in the country since December 2005,
has triggered heated debates on whether or not capital punishment should exist
in a country that advocates human rights.</P>
      <P>The execution incurred the European Union's criticism; it urged Taiwan to resume
the de facto moratorium on the death penalty pending legal abolition and a
policy toward eventual abolition of the death penalty in line with the global
trend toward universal abolition.</P>
      <P>A local newspaper reported Saturday that progress has been made in the Ministry
of Justice's efforts to gradually abolish capital punishment.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>A panel tasked by the ministry with studying the feasibility of the abolition
reached a consensus Friday that suggests replacing the death penalty with "a
special life sentence" that requests the inmates subjected to the punishment not
be eligible for parole.</P>
      <P>The panel also recommended revising laws to adopt more specific standards in the
review of parole applications by prison inmates serving a life sentence, such as
categorically requiring that the convicts should stay in jail for at least 25
years but no more than 40 years.</P>
      <P>Ministry statistics showed that on average, inmates serving life imprisonment
sentences in Taiwan stay in jail for 12.8 years before they are set free on
parole, shorter than in neighboring countries like Japan, in which the average
period inmates on permanent imprisonment are kept in jail reaches 20 years.</P>
      <P>The ministry believes a stricter parole reviewing system would encourage judges
to hand down the life sentence instead of death penalty on the defendants who
are convicted of committing brutal and inhumane crimes.</P>
      <P>However, some family members of the victims of crimes question why the country
has to spend a fortune to keep those people who had committed heaven-condemned
crimes alive.</P>
      <P>Some professionals in the judicial sector think that lifelong punishment is more
cruel than the death penalty, saying that life imprisonment without the chance
of parole would make people live in the shadow of hopelessness.  "Isn't  that a
kind of inhumane treatment?" they asked. (Oct. 16, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Social housing policy</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/16/10  15:22:54
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou recently pledged to promote a social housing policy that
is aimed at increasing the supply of affordable rental housing to low-income
citizens in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The policy deserves our support, but we also hope that the government will
tighten restrictions on the sale of public housing, because most public housing
units in the country are intended for sale, not for rental.</P>
      <P>At present, owners of public housing units are not allowed to sell the units
until they have lived in them for two years. Once they do decide to sell, the
government is supposed to be given the option of buying the unit back before it
goes on the market.</P>
      <P>In reality, however, the sale of public housing units -- which are provided to
low-income citizens at prices lower than their market value -- is subject to no
restrictions at all after the two-year period. This allows the owners to sell
the units in the housing market at a huge profit.</P>
      <P>The rules should be changed in such a way that the public housing units can only
be sold back to the government, so that they can be resold to other needy
people.</P>
      <P>Taiwan can also learn from the examples of other countries. France,  for
instance, requires that developers of large-scale development projects reserve
20 percent of the development area for affordable rental housing. (Editorial

    <HEADLINE>Complaints of untrue, harmful content in Taiwan's media jump</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of complaints Taiwanese people have lodged against the media in the
first half of this year has increased by more than 50 percent from the same
period last year, according  to a report released by the National Communication
Commission (NCC) Saturday.</P>
      <P>The NCC said it received 2,016 complaints over improper media content in the
first six months, up 52.6 percent from last year. Most of the complaints were
about content that were deemed untrue or unfair, according to the report.</P>
      <P>Some of the people who had complained  criticized certain television, Internet
and radio content as being harmful to the physical and mental well-being of
children and teenagers, while others said some TV and radio programs failed to
separate news or programming from commercials.</P>
      <P>Most of the complaints -- 75.2 percent of the total - involved TV content, 22.2
percent were about Internet content, and 2.5 percent involved what was aired on
radio stations.</P>
      <P>The number of complaints about TV programming nearly doubled from the same
period last year, while complaints about Internet content had nearly quadrupled.
Those of radio content remained about the same.</P>
      <P>Jason Ho, the NCC's communication content department director, told the Central
News Agency that the main reason for the increase in complaints is that the NCC
has been publicizing its public complaint channels or windows, encouraging
people to air complaints. So more people are aware there is a way to voice their
displeasure if they see or hear inappropriate material on TV, the Internet or
the radio.</P>
      <P>One person even complained more than 200 times during the six-month period, Ho
noted.</P>
      <P>The NCC pointed out that in the first six months of this year, it handled 126
cases of violations by television operators of television broadcasting and
satellite broadcasting regulations. Following its investigations, it handed down
fines that totaled NT$30.88 million (US$1 million) , a 37 percent increase from
the fines imposed during the first half of 2009.</P>
      <P>The NCC is the top authority in Taiwan responsible for regulating the
development of the communications and information industry, promoting
competition,  consumer protection,  licensing,  radio frequency, spectrum,
broadcasting, content regulation, communications standards and specifications.</P>

      <P>Jason Wu, the young Taiwan-born fashion designer who shot to fame for designing
the gown U.S. first lady Michelle Obama wore to her husband's inauguration
ball,  has attributed his success to "Taiwanese quality, " according to the
online journal of Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou, who met with Wu recently.</P>
      <P>The 28-year-old Wu, who immigrated to the United States when he was a child,
said his success is due to his Asian attitude toward work, according to Ma's
latest journal publication released Saturday. Wu said Taiwanese people are the
most hardworking people he has ever seen, even owners of small grocery shops are
very dedicated to their work.</P>
      <P>This work ethic helped him become successful in a relatively short period of
time, Wu said.</P>
      <P>"I think maybe I succeeded because I have a very Asian way of working... My dad
works every day. That's how I run my company and that's how I work today. I
think that's being a big part of my being able to achieve success in a very
short period of time. We are very efficient and hardworking and I think that is
a very Taiwanese quality," he said.</P>
      <P>Ma said in his journal that while young Taiwanese people admire Wu for his
success, what is more important is that Wu grew up in a family that allowed him
to develop his interest and talents.</P>
      <P>Wu has credited his family for encouraging him to pursue his interest. He noted
his mother was open-minded with her children and she bought fashion magazines
for him to read and helped cultivate his talents in painting and design.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan not only needs to nurture more Jason Wus, but also needs more mothers
like Jason Wu's mom," the president said.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's  youth should look to their own uniqueness  and advantages if they
seek to stand out globally in the field of culture and creative innovation," the
president urged.</P>
      <P>The Manhattan-based Wu returned to Taiwan for a week-long visit this month to
attend his brother's wedding. He met Ma at the Presidential Office on Oct. 7 and
gave a dress he designed to Taiwan's first lady Chow Mei-ching, who wore it to
Taiwan's National Day ceremony on Oct. 10.</P>
      <P>Wu has expressed his hope that his visit to Taiwan will bring global attention
to Taiwan's fashion world.</P>
      <P>"I hope my coming back can be one of the samples to Taiwan that design can be a
very valuable career as well," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu expressed his appreciation to Ma for taking time out of his schedule to meet
him and added that as a Taiwanese he is delighted to be able to return to share
the joy of his success.</P>
      <P>The dress Michelle Obama wore at the inauguration ball in 2009 has been inducted
to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECCT expected to push for Taiwan's signing of TEM with Europe</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  16 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) will recommend in its annual
position paper to be published next week that Taiwan's government work to sign a
Trade Enhancement Measures (TEM) agreement with the European Union.</P>
      <P>In a briefing of the 2010-2011 Position Papers given to reporters Saturday, the
ECCT said it will argue that Taiwan can improve its economic development and
find a position on the international stage if it adjusts its legal systems to
international standards, opens its doors wider to imports from China, and forges
a TEM deal with Europe.</P>
      <P>Negotiating a TEM has been one of the ECCT's key recommendations to the
government in recent years, and the group contended that it would strongly
complement  the economic  cooperation  framework agreement (ECFA) signed with
China in June.</P>
      <P>In its previous position papers, the ECCT suggested that the signing of the ECFA
and TEM would revitalize Taiwan's economy and increase trade.</P>
      <P>"An ECFA and a TEM can work together as a spring board for business, providing
mutual benefit for all concerned. Taiwan can leverage this to promote itself as
an advanced service center and a conduit for business, providing an essential
hub for European business in the region," the ECCT 2009-2010 position papers
said.</P>
      <P>It also predicted that once the TEM is signed, bilateral trade between Taiwan
and the EU will increase by 21.6 billion euros within two to five years.</P>
      <P>This year's position paper series, called "Putting the pieces together:
Positioning Taiwan for growth in the global economic picture, " will be
officially released at its monthly members' luncheon Oct. 19.</P>
      <P>The ECCT promotes the interests of European companies operating in Taiwan by
engaging with the government and institutions and by providing  a platform for
business networking  and development opportunities.</P>
      <P>The position papers help the ECCT convey the concerns of its nearly 700 members
with regards to Taiwan's business environment and offer recommendations to
Taiwan's government for solving specific issues.</P>
      <P>The papers, compiled by the board of directors and 22 of the ECCT's committees,
also serve to keep the European Commission, European national governments and
European companies abroad informed about Taiwan's business environment, the ECCT
said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>New southern bluefin tuna catch quota to be finalized in 2011</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) confirmed
in a meeting held this week in Taipei that a new total allowable catch (TAC) for
the fish will be set in 2011 for implementation in 2012, Taiwan's Fisheries
Agency said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The new quota, expected to be lower than the current limit, will be aimed at
helping the spawning stock of southern bluefin tuna to rebound to 20 percent of
the original stock, the agency said.</P>
      <P>The spawning biomass of the species remains at a very low level, at  about  5
percent  or  less  of  unfished  levels,  the Canberra-headquartered CCSBT said
on its website.</P>
      <P>To alleviate the harvesting pressure on the fish, the global TAC for 2010 and
2011 had already been reduced to 9,449 metric tons from the previously allowed
quota of 11,810 tons.</P>
      <P>The CCSBT has six members -- Australia, Indonesia, Japan, New Zealand, South
Korea and Taiwan -- and three cooperating non-members -- the Philippines, South
Africa and the European Union.</P>
      <P>Currently, Australia has the highest "effective catch limit" -- the effective
catch after additional agreed upon voluntary reductions have been applied --
with 4,015 tons, followed by Japan (2,261 tons), South Korea and Taiwan (859
tons each), New Zealand (709 tons), and Indonesia (651 tons).</P>
      <P>According to the Fisheries Agency, Australia and Japan, which own the world's
largest southern bluefin fishing fleets, will bear the brunt of a further
reduction in the TAC, while Taiwan's quota is not expected to be adjusted much.</P>

      <P>Search engine giant Google and its video-sharing  subsidiary  YouTube launched
websites Friday for Taiwan's five upcoming special municipality elections, the
companies' latest effort to highlight the Internet's role in modern political
elections.</P>
      <P>The Google website and YouTube channel dedicated to the Nov. 27 elections in the
special municipalities of Taipei, Xinbei, Taichung, Kaohsiung and Tainan were
launched as "online platforms to help Taiwanese voters and candidates interact
online, " said Google Taiwan general manager Chien Lee-feng in a statement.</P>
      <P>In addition to basic information on each municipality and its election, the
website also presents each candidate with a Web page that compiles news stories,
blog posts and information from social networking sites such as Facebook and
Plurk.</P>
      <P>Internet users can also post messages on the page's chat board.</P>
      <P>A graphic on the municipality page shows how many times the two candidates were
searched on the Internet during the day, a tool for voters to compare the
candidates' popularity.</P>
      <P>The YouTube channel allows users to upload videos to voice their opinions and
questions for candidates.</P>
      <P>Google and YouTube have previously  launched websites  for political elections
in various countries, including Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom and the
United States.</P>
      <P>U.S. President Barack Obama became the first U.S. presidential candidate to

      <P>The automatic baggage handling system in Terminal 2 of Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport resumed operations early Saturday after being out of order
since early Thursday afternoon.</P>
      <P>According to airport spokesman Chao Shao-lien, technicians were able to finally
solve the computer glitch that idled the system after intensive repairs, in time
for the system to be running again for the first flights out of Terminal 2 at 6
a.m.</P>
      <P>Since the automatic baggage sorting system broke down on Thursday afternoon at
12: 20, airport authorities have deployed between 150 and 200 people to help
sort checked-in bags manually and load them aboard flights leaving from the
terminal.</P>
      <P>The airport's aging computer system was originally slated to be phased out in
2006, but the plan was put off until 2011 when a new system that will be able to
handle in-city check-ins by passengers taking a planned mass rapid transit line
connecting Taipei City to the airport will be commissioned for an estimated
NT$37 million (US$1.2 million).</P>
      <P>The computer system's breakdown has been the latest in a string of incidents
that have tarnished the image of the country's main gateway.</P>
      <P>Among the problems drawing attention over the past few months include the

    <TEXT>
      <P>A string quartet opened a unique concert series on a stage floating down a
tunnel waterway in the Cold War battleground of Kinmen Saturday, enthralling the
crowd of 300 packed into the unique venue.</P>
      <P>The Cold War relic's setting and special acoustic effects gave a dramatic edge
to the music as the sounds of the string instruments and flute echoed clearly
off the enclosure's cold granite walls and resonated throughout the tunnel,
delighting an appreciative audience.</P>
      <P>The opening 40-minute  concert of the day featured Johann Pachelbel's Canon in D
major, Haydn's Serenade, Mascagni's Cavalleria Rusticana interlude, a Taiwanese
folk song medley, and a flute solo.</P>
      <P>The 40-minute concert was the first of three to be played Saturday and six to be
presented during the Oct. 16-17 music festival held inside the 101-meter-long
Zhaishan Tunnel, a war relic that is now a tourist attraction.</P>
      <P>All of the concerts are free of charge, but each one can only accommodate 300
people standing in the limited space around the A-shaped underground waterway.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen National Park Administration, which organizes the festival, said all
openings were booked shortly after registration began Sept. 1.</P>
      <P>The concert series is the second of its kind given in the Zhaishan Tunnel.</P>
      <P>It followed two "watery concerts" given by five local musicians in the same
venue last October for the first time to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the
Battle of Kuningtou, in which an outmanned Nationalist force repelled an
invasion by the Chinese communists.</P>
      <P>Six musicians  --  cellist Chang Cheng-chieh,  flutist  Wu Tsung-hsien, harpist
Hung Chi-mei, violinists Chiang Chih-yi and Liang Chien-wen, and violist Ho
Chun-heng -- are performing in this year's concert series.</P>
      <P>Located in the southwestern part of Kinmen Island, the Zhaishan Tunnel -- 101
meters long, 6 meters wide and 3.5 meters high -- opens into the Taiwan Strait.
Its A-shaped waterway has a pier that can dock up to 42 small boats.</P>
      <P>Completed in 1966, it served as a small boat base for shipments of military
supplies on the island, which was the front line of hostilities between Taiwan
and China during the Cold War.</P>
      <P>With the improvement of cross-strait relations, the number of Taiwanese troops
stationed in Kinmen has been reduced, and the island has been gradually
transformed into a tourist destination, with war sites as the main attraction.</P>

      <P>A concert was also held at the unfinished glass temple, which is part of a glass

      <P>The construction of the 990 square-meter glass temple, the first of its kind in
Taiwan, began in 2007 and is scheduled to be finished in 2013. Statues of Matsu

enshrined there.</P>
      <P>Matsu Ascension Day is celebrated on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month
every year, which fell on Oct. 16 this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwanese company's product meets test in Chilean rescue operation</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwanese company whose surveillance and communications equipment played a
vital role in the Chilean mine rescue effort said Saturday it was not surprised
to see its products used to stay in contact with the trapped miners.</P>
      <P>Christine Hsu, vice president of Planet Technology Corp., said in a telephone
interview with the Central News Agency that it was the first time the company's
IP Camera, an Internet-based device that allows video and voice communications,
had been used in a rescue operation.</P>
      <P>"Our product has never been used this situation before. It is not one of the
purposes for which we designed this product," she said.</P>
      <P>"But we were not surprised when our agent in Chile told us that they planned to
use it because our camera is humidity-resistant, dust-proof, water-proof and
impact-resistant," she added.</P>
      <P>The company has been active in Central and South America since 1995.</P>
      <P>The camera, which was connected to a fiber optic line that ensured video
communications between 33 miners trapped 624 meters underground and rescuers,
transmitted the first video image to the world showing that the miners were
still alive in late August.</P>
      <P>"The camera was very user-friendly, and this was very important for this case
because no one could go down and teach the miners how to use the device," Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>The participation of the company's equipment in the unprecedented rescue was not
made public until mid-October when the miners were lifted from the mine shaft
and after other international brands' had drawn attention for their involvement
in the operation.</P>
      <P>Among them were Oakley's contribution of sunglasses to protect the miners' eyes
and Apple's presentation of an iPod touch to the survivors as a gift.</P>
      <P>Some marketers may have felt Planet Technology  missed an opportunity to promote
itself -- and Taiwan -- by not promoting its gear earlier in the process, and
Tseng Han-son, deputy head of the semi-official Taiwan External Trade
Development Council's (TAITRA) Strategic Marketing Department agreed.</P>
      <P>"When encountering a situation like this, if Taiwanese companies understood
branding better, then they would have immediately sent out the message in
various ways," he said, stressing that timing is a key factor in raising brand
awareness.</P>
      <P>Companies  with big brands would not have missed such an opportunity, Tseng
argued.</P>
      <P>Hsu, however, said that the company was focused more on whether the rescue
operation would end successfully than on promoting its brand, and it therefore
made the announcement after all of the miners were saved.</P>
      <P>She noted that media in Chile also reported on the company's camera during the
rescue mission, which she believed will further boost confidence in the
company's brand among clients there.</P>

      <P>The Brother Elephants barely survived a game-fixing scandal at the end of the
2009 season but are now just three games away from completing a truly improbable
ascent to the top of Taiwan's Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL).</P>
      <P>The Elephants defeated the Sinon Bulls 3-2 in the opening game of the best-of-
seven 2010 Taiwan Series in Taichung Saturday, led by strong performances from
leadoff hitter Chang Cheng-wei and starting pitcher Jim Magrane.</P>
      <P>Chang was 3 for 4 and made spectacular catches in the seventh and eighth innings
to hold off the Bulls' furious rally and lift the Elephants, making their third
consecutive appearance in the Taiwan Series, to the win at Taichung
Intercontinental Baseball Stadium.</P>
      <P>Magrane, a former American minor leaguer, scattered eight hits over 7 2/3 solid
innings.</P>
      <P>The Elephants, who lost the Taiwan Series in 2008 and 2009, are scheduled to
meet the Bulls in Game 2 in Douliou, Yunlin County on Sunday.</P>
      <P>That they are in this position at all is nothing short of amazing. The team lost
almost half of its players before the start of the regular season to a major
game-fixing scandal that came to light in October last year, which involved more
than 40 retired and active players and coaches.</P>
      <P>The team's owner even hinted that he might disband the franchise, but he instead
decided to proceed with a roster largely composed of inexperienced players.</P>
      <P>After a poor first half of the season, the Elephants rallied to win the second
half race with a 36-24 record to earn a berth in the championship series.</P>
      <P>In Saturday's game, a two-run seventh inning, paced by RBI doubles from pinch-
hitter Wang Ching-yung and Chang, helped the Elephants open up a 3-0 lead.</P>
      <P>The Bulls, who outhit the Elephants 11-7 in the game, fought back with three
hits each in the eighth and ninth innings to pull within 3-2, but could not find
the key hit to pull them even.</P>
      <P>Sinon's Japanese left-handed starter Itsuki Shoda, who was 11-5 in his second
season with the team in 2010, gave up six hits in 6 2/3 innings.</P>
      <P>The Bulls, who reached the Taiwan Series by winning the first half race with a
36-23-1 record, had the best overall regular season record in the league at
65-53-2.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's representative office in Singapore said Saturday it is concerned about
two Taiwanese men who have been sentenced to canings and jail terms for loan
shark harassment in the Southeast Asian city state.</P>
      <P>According to a statement issued by Singaporean police authorities on Thursday,
three Taiwanese citizens have recently been given seven- to 24-month prison
sentences after being convicted of loan shark harassment.</P>
      <P>Two of the defendants, identified as Su Wei Ying and Wu Wei Chun in the
Singapore Police Force statement, were also to receive "15 strokes of the cane"
for their offenses.</P>
      <P>Su, 28, and Wu, 24, were both convicted of seven charges of loan shark
harassment in violation of Singapore's Moneylenders Act and sentenced to 24
months and 21 months in jail, respectively, in addition to the caning.</P>
      <P>Su was sentenced on Sept. 14 while Wu was sentenced on Sept. 28.</P>
      <P>An official at the Taipei Representative Office in Singapore said Saturday that
the office sent people to visit the imprisoned Taiwanese citizens more than a
few days ago.</P>
      <P>The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not disclose, however,
whether the two Taiwanese men had already been caned.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the families of the two men were aware of the caning sentences,
the official also declined comment, citing the defendants' right to privacy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a 29-year-old Taiwanese man identified as Wu Ting-yi, was convicted
Oct. 14 on a single charge of conspiring with the two other Taiwanese nationals
to commit loan shark harassment and sentenced to seven months in prison.</P>
      <P>Caning is a form of corporal punishment that has been adopted in Singapore for
more than 40 years. At the end of the caning, those who receive more than three
lashes are usually in a state of shock and their buttocks are covered in blood.
Many collapse from the ordeal.</P>
      <P>The Singapore Police Force statement said the cases served as a good warning to
all foreigners or locals alike who were thinking of earning easy money by
dallying in such criminal activities.</P>
      <P>"Regardless of their role or involvement, police will take such criminal
elements to task and ensure that they are dealt with appropriately in accordance
with our laws," the statement said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) on Saturday began its
two-day final inspection of the Taipei mass rapid transit (MRT) system's Luzhou
Line, one of the line's last major hurdles before beginning commercial
operations.</P>
      <P>The ministry's inspection committee first examined the Minquan West Road
Station, a major junction between the Luzhou Line and the currently operating
Danshui Line.</P>
      <P>"I'll give it 95 points so far, " said Lawrence W. Lan, vice chairman of the
inspection committee.</P>
      <P>"The passenger flow design here is great, and the safety doors that fully block
the platform are pretty impressive," Lan said of the first metro line to be
equipped with platform screen doors to reduce the potential for accidents.</P>
      <P>Besides examining the construction and electrical systems, the committee took a
close look at the breastfeeding room and signs to make sure the new line is
prepared to provide passenger-friendly services.</P>
      <P>Following a preliminary inspection in September, the final inspection this
weekend will play a major role in deciding whether the new line can meet the
central government's target date of launching commercial service by the end of
2010.</P>
      <P>Once the inspection is completed, the committee will present a report on its
findings to the MOTC. If the conclusion is positive, the MOTC will give its
approval to the project and present it to the Taipei City government, which will
make the final decision on when to begin operations.</P>
      <P>The 6.4 kilometer line runs across the Taipei County cities of Luzhou and
Sanchong, both of which border the west side of Taipei City across the Danshui
River.</P>
      <P>The completion of the line is expected to ease heavy traffic congestion to and
from the area at rush hour and benefit the two cities with a combined population
of 570,000 people, said the Department of Rapid Transit Systems.</P>

      <P>More than 100 businesses from the food and beverage sector and franchise chains
offered more than 11,000 openings at a joint job fair sponsored by the Ministry
of Economic Affairs Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a speech opening the job fair, Deputy Economic Affairs Minister Lin Sheng-

that "business conditions have turned for the better.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, Taiwan's unemployment rate can be lowered to less than 5 percent by
the end of this year, " he said optimistically, reflecting the hope that service
businesses in the retail sector could create more jobs by taking advantage of an
improved economy.</P>
      <P>In 2009,  around  2.8 million  workers  were employed  by service-oriented
businesses, accounting for 27.6 percent of Taiwan's total employed workers, Lin

      <P>More than 100 businesses from the food and beverage sector and franchise chains
offered more than 11,000 openings at a joint job fair sponsored by the Ministry
of Economic Affairs Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a speech opening the job fair, Deputy Economic Affairs Minister Lin Sheng-
chung said the large number of openings available at the job fair was a sign
that "business conditions have turned for the better.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, Taiwan's unemployment rate can be lowered to less than 5 percent by
the end of this year, " he said optimistically, reflecting the hope that service
businesses in the retail sector could create more jobs by taking advantage of an
improved economy.</P>
      <P>In 2009,  around  2.8 million  workers  were employed  by service-oriented
businesses, accounting for 27.6 percent of Taiwan's total employed workers, Lin
noted.</P>
      <P>"Of those working in service-oriented businesses, 17.01 percent of them were
absorbed by the retail sales sector."</P>
      <P>Huang Hui-chu, general manager of Sinyi Realty Estate, said her company plans to
open 400 new outlets next year because of the potential opportunities created by
the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) signed with China in June.</P>
      <P>She said her company was recruiting to fill 3,500 openings at the fair,
including 200 high-paying managerial positions for the Greater China area.</P>
      <P>Steven Lee, president of McDonald's Corporation Taiwan, was also upbeat about
Taiwan's business prospects following the signing of the tariff-slashing ECFA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei a model for China as it changes from red to green: author</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 17 (CNA)
10/17/10  14:34:25
(By Jenny W. Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>That China's ecosystems are in peril is not breaking news perhaps, but the speed
of deterioration and slow pace of attempts at recovery and clean up can shock
even watchdogs monitoring the toll of the country's economic boom.</P>
      <P>In his new book "When a Billion Chinese Jump," Jonathan Watts, Asia environment
correspondent  for British newspaper the Guardian, takes readers deep into
China's environmental abyss. The new industrial giant's sprint up the economic
ladder is being made at the expense not only of its ecosystems and climate, but
also of the health of its own citizens -- the very workforce China so
desperately needs to power the countrys annual double-digit growth.</P>
      <P>Regarding the phenomenon of so-called cancer villages, of which there are
between 100 and 400 throughout China, Watts argues that the disproportional
rates of disease among the residents are most likely caused by toxic-waste
discharges from nearby chemical factories.</P>
      <P>"The fear of a red China is outdated. But the hope of a green China is
premature," the investigative journalist who has been based in the PRC for the
last seven years said at a lecture in Taipei last Thursday. "If there is any
color to describe China now, it would be gray,"</P>
      <P>While China's industrial explosion has been the envy of many other countries, it
is teetering on the edge of both environmental and social implosians, Watts
said, giving examples of disappearing species and riotous protests from angry
villagers.</P>
      <P>Being a late bloomer in terms of its economic surge, China is deprived of the
option of "outsourcing" its wastes as was enjoyed by the United Kingdom, United
States, Japan and other nations in their take-off phases. Beijing is therefore
forced to "in-sourceits garbage, he argued.</P>
      <P>The bite marks resulting from China eating itself from the inside-out could be
best illustrated by the wrong hues seen around the country, Watts claimed,
citing examples of once-green paddy fields that are now yellow, blue rivers that
have turned crimson, and crystal white glaciers that used to be feared and
revered but are now brown and balding.</P>
      <P>Pollution-induced human suffering is another bleak picture in China, Watts said.</P>
      <P>In the coal town of Linfen in Shanxi Province, visited by Watts during the
research for his book, the birth-defect rate is more than three times the global
average, and the death rate of local miners per ton of coal extracted is 30
times higher than that of their American counterparts.</P>
      <P>But while China's eco-crisis might be more devastating than most people realize,
Beijing's determination to go green is also much greater than the outside world
gives it credit for, the author argued. As evidence he pointed out that the
Chinese government invested US$34 billion in clean technology in 2009, a figure
that compared favorably with the US$18 billion spent by Washington.</P>
      <P>China also has the world's largest wind-power capacity, and its solar-panel
industry is expanding rapidly, he said.</P>
      <P>A top-down strategy led by government edict would be incapable of solving
China's graying problem, however, and the solution must come from the grass-root
level, Watts believed. This would require a complete overhaul of social values
of consumption and conservation among the general public.</P>
      <P>In fact, Beijing could look to Taiwan as an example of a success story in which
both citizens and government officials have an awareness of global warming and
the dire need for clean alternative energy.</P>
      <P>Watts recalled that while interviewing Taiwanese government leaders last year
during the aftermath of Typhoon Morakot, many acknowledged the unprecedented
rainfall which left over 700 dead or missing was likely a result of climate
change and that the country needed to accelerate its defenses against weather
extremes in the future.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's carbon foot print per person is "very high" and more should be
done to reduce the country's CO2 emissions, Watts said he was "extremely
impressed" by Taipei City's recycling program.</P>
      <P>"I think it is a good model for China. The recycling situation in China is
appalling, frankly. There is so much waste and it is not used properly. In a
sense it is not about techniques, but about the values -- wanting to recycle
used things and I think that [awareness] is stronger here and can be carried
over to the mainland,he said.</P>
      <P>Watts also pointed  out that multi-national  conglomerates, including China-
based Taiwanese companies,  could contribute by cleaning up their supply chains
and increasing their efforts to amplify environmental protection as part of
their corporate social responsibility.</P>
      <P>"In the 19th century, my country, Britain, taught the world how to produce. In
the 20th century, the US taught the world how to consume. And I think in the
21st century, we really need China to teach us how to sustain," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Help flora expo shake off political squabbling</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/17/10  14:40:59
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People  have shown keen interest  in the upcoming  Taipei International Flora
Expo by flocking to two recent trial runs with an enthusiasm  that is in marked
contrast to the criticisms  of politicians.</P>
      <P>With the Nov. 27 municipality elections approaching, candidates from the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party have turned up the heat on the Taipei
City Government, the expo organizer, and Mayor Hau Lung-bin, who is seeking re-
election.</P>
      <P>Organizers of the expo -- one of the biggest international events Taipei has
ever hosted -- seem to have been taken to task at every turn and have become
bogged down by ceaseless put-downs and endless arguments. Moreover, thanks to
the DPP politicians' muckraking, corruption accusations have cast a shadow over
the expo, which is scheduled to open Nov. 6.</P>
      <P>Under the influence of such severe political flak, the public has found it
difficult to appreciate the glory the expo brings to the capital city and the
whole country, and to understand the themes of horticulture, high-technology and
environmental protection that the event espouses.</P>
      <P>Since Taipei has won sponsorship of this international event, we should help the
expo shake off political interference and allow it to showcase Taiwan's strong
horticulatural industry and the power of the nation's beauty. (Editorial

    <HEADLINE>3D Technology enables interaction with virtual fish</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei-based research house launched Saturday a technology that allows
visitors to a museum in eastern Taiwan to see virtual fish on a surround screen
and even "play" with them.</P>
      <P>The 3D-based technology, which was launched on the opening day of the Lanyang
Museum in Yilan County, uses eight projectors to simulate the underwater
ecosystem of nearby coastal areas and display dozens of local fish species on
the 360-degree screen, the Innovative DigiTech-Enabled Applications &amp;
Services Institute (IDEAS) said. se.</P>
      <P>"Using this technology, museums can reduce their hardware costs and the space
required for exhibits, thus making it easier to replace the content of their
regular exhibitions, " said Belinda Chen, deputy director of IDEAS.</P>
      <P>When visitors put the ID card for a particular species onto a sensor, the
relevant fish will then swim toward them and information about it will be
displayed elsewhere on the screen, the institute explained.</P>
      <P>IDEAS is currently working on an advanced mode of this technology in which
visitors will be able to use their hands to give orders to the virtual fish,
such as to make them move together or separate.</P>
      <P>This interactive mode will be available at the Lanyang Museum from December this
year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News -- Is renewable energy so difficult in Taiwan?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/17/10  16:42:27
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Private corporations  in Taiwan's solar power industry ran prominent ads in
major dailies in early October accusing the government of inaction regarding the
country's renewable energy development.</P>
      <P>They blamed the government and state-owned Taiwan Power Co., which on behalf of
the government acts as the only renewable power buyer, for erecting procedural
barriers that make the approval for power purchase impossible.</P>
      <P>Taipower and the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) responded with
their own newspaper ads, arguing that both solar and wind energy are unreliable
and cannot possibly replace energy generated by traditional thermal or nuclear
power plants.</P>
      <P>Taipower and EPA also stated that, under the Renewable Energy Development Act,
the prices at which the government is allowed to purchase electricity generated
by the private sector using solar power or other renewable means were
"unreasonably high" -- five times higher than that for electricity supplied by
Taipower.</P>
      <P>The key point is that nobody in Taiwan has ever espoused that solar energy
should replace traditional power generation. Nevertheless, President Ma Ying-
jeou has put renewable energy development on a priority list, and the
Legislative Yuan lent its support by passing the act.</P>
      <P>Secondly, since the rates at which the government purchases solar power or other
renewable electricity from the private sector were determined by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, should the ministry be blamed for the "unreasonably high"
rates?</P>
      <P>In any case, traditional electricity has been available at rates that were far
too low -- among the lowest in the world. Who decided these low rates and why
has no official had the guts to raise them?</P>
      <P>It is hard to speculate on how this energy bickering will end or even how the
entire issue will be addressed, but it is likely to become a subject of
political  contention  with the Nov.  27 municipality elections approaching.

    <TEXT>
      <P>An intelligent-control system for LED lighting will be launched Monday in Taipei
County in a government-led effort to promote green power.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) told CNA it had invested NT$18 million
(US$586,800) to install more than 500 intelligent LED street lamps in three
major parking lots in Sanchong City, Taiwan County, with the aim of cutting
electricity consumption by at least 70 percent.</P>
      <P>The total electricity saving would be equivalent to almost nine times the
electricity generated annually by the Feicui Reservoir, Taiwan's second largest
reservoir, the ministry predicted.</P>
      <P>"The intelligent system will adjust the intensity of the lights by detecting the
level of usage, such as the presence of pedestrians or vehicles, and thus reduce
electricity consumption," MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Ordinary LED street lamps already save around 50 to 60 percent of electricity,
and those connected to the intelligent system would save 20 percent more, the
officials added.</P>

      <P>Along with all other major Asian currencies that rallied over the past week amid
a weak U.S. dollar and with the market awash in ample liquidity, the Taiwan
dollar moved higher to reach 30.793 against the greenback Friday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar and Malaysia's ringgit topped the other currencies'
appreciation against the U.S. dollar over the past week, both up 0.98 percent,
according to the latest Bloomberg chart on international currency exchanges. The
U.S. dollar fell to 3.0835 Malaysian ringgit Friday.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar gained 3.28 percent against the U.S. dollar over the past
month, and reached a high of NT$30.540 over the past week.</P>
      <P>These gains are seen as being in line with the strength of other Asian
currencies -- the Chinese yuan in particular -- and have become a trend despite
central bank intervention during late trade in sessions over the past week.</P>
      <P>The market widely expects the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will further loosen its
monetary policy to stimulate the country's economy, a move likely to place
further downward pressure on the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>Of the 10 major Asian currencies, only Russia's ruble has depreciated, and that
by just 0.52 percent since the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>In a liquidity-driven rally, the Japanese yen rallied 0.86 percent over the past
week to 81.23 per dollar, amid speculation of further U.S. credit easing.</P>
      <P>Over the past week, the Indian rupee rallied 0.84 percent to 44.065 per dollar,
the Korean won gained 0.78 percent to 1,111.5 per dollar, the Philippine peso
rose 0.57 percent to 43.204 per dollar, and the Chinese yuan was up 0.43 percent
to 6.642 per dollar.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government of the Philippines will improve its services to Taiwanese
businesses and is making the country a better place for Taiwanese investors, the
head of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office (MECO) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Amadeo Perez Jr., a seasoned congressman who was appointed as MECO's chairman
only two months ago, said that President Benigno Aquino III welcomes Taiwanese
citizens to make leisure trips, do business or make investments in the
Philippines.</P>
      <P>MECO is the quasi-official body authorized by the Philippine government to
handle exchanges between the Philippines and Taiwan in the absence of formal
diplomatic relations between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Perez said that topping his priority list were the protection of the interests
of Taiwanese citizens maintaining business operations in the Philippines and
making sure they were accorded equally good and fair treatment as that received
by Philippine citizens.</P>
      <P>The former politician who was mayor of Urdaneta City for three terms said that
since assuming the MECO chairmanship he has been busy meeting Taiwanese business
leaders operating in the Philippines to hear their opinions and suggestions.</P>
      <P>Perez said the Philippine government will spare no effort in protecting
Taiwanese people's personal safety, but admitted the image of his country had
been seriously tarnished when a disgruntled Filipino policeman held hostage a
busful of Hong Kong tourists in August.</P>
      <P>He stressed that incidents of this kind were extremely rare, however, and that
Philippine law enforcement authorities had learned a bloody lesson and had
already started improving related equipment and training.</P>

      <P>Education Minister Wu Ching-ji said Saturday that elementary and high schools
should resume the practice of singing the national anthem and raising flags at
morning and weekly gatherings, stressing the importance of "patriotic
education."</P>
      <P>Since the government lifted martial law in 1987, it has given schools the leeway
to decide whether to sing the national anthem or raise the national flag at
school gatherings, and the Ministry of Education has not asked them to enforce
the practice.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of this issue:</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Minister Wu said that patriotic education should have no partisan
considerations, but that one should say out loud "I love the Republic of China."</P>
      <P>A sense of awe and respect should arise in students' hearts when they see the
national flag or hear the national anthem, Wu said. He lamented that nowadays
such practice was largely ignored.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the singing of the national anthem in schools should be resumed
across the board as it was part of a "basic education."</P>
      <P>He argued that if students do not sing the national anthem at their one or two
meetings each week, it would be hard to nurture their sense of national
identity.</P>
      <P>Wu said that patriotic education would be even more important after the arrival
of Chinese students in Taiwan, saying that previous incidents of removing
national flags or photos of the Republic of China's founding father, Sun Yat-
sen, should not happen again.</P>
      <P>Even when Chinese sports or cultural groups visit Taiwan, similar incidents
should not take place, he added.</P>
      <P>Wu's proposal was met with mixed reactions.</P>
      <P>One elementary school principal who asked for anonymity said that his school had
previously asked teachers to explain the meaning of the national anthem but
canceled such classes following protests by parents. He said that although
students still sang the national anthem, he was afraid that many of them did not
know its meaning.</P>
      <P>Lee Po-chia, principal of Chungshan Elementary School in Taipei City, is in
favor of singing the national anthem, saying that there is nothing wrong in
patriotic education, and it should not be interpreted as authoritarian rule.
(Oct. 17, 2010) Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Will singing the national anthem more make you more patriotic? Students and
parents don't see eye to eye to Minister Wu's views.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Kuo-ching, president of the National Alliance of Parents Organization,
said strict regulations could result in mere formality.</P>
      <P>He suggested instead that teachers share related articles in classes such as
reading out stories about Chien-Ming Wang and Yani Tseng whose achievements in
baseball and golf circles could inspire patriotism.</P>
      <P>A student surnamed Liu from Taipei County's Shuancheng Elementary School said he
could only sing the national anthem in a chorus. Another student surnamed Wang
from Taipei City's Talung Elementary School said that teachers had not explained
the meaning of the lyrics so he had no idea what some passages meant.</P>

      <P>Intel Corp.'s chief executive will visit Taiwan later this month as part of his
Asian trip to visit business partners,  the Taiwan branch of the world's largest
chipmaker confirmed Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini will arrive in Taipei on Oct. 28 to meet
clients in Taiwan. He will have a brief stay here, " an Intel Taiwan spokeswoman
told the CNA in a telephone interview.</P>
      <P>But the spokeswoman declined to confirm whether Otellini would meet Acer Inc.
Chairman J.T. Wang or Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou as local media had
speculated.</P>
      <P>"We cannot offer more details on the trip now, as many things are not confirmed
yet,she said.</P>
      <P>Otellini's visit is highly anticipated in Taiwan following Intel's closure of
its WiMAX Program Office (WPO) in June sparked speculation that it was
withdrawing support for the broadband wireless technology in which Taiwan has
made significant investments.</P>
      <P>Wang, who doubles as chairman of the Taipei Computer Association, has expressed
serious concerns over closure of the WPO, which was set up to promote the
technology.</P>
      <P>Intel Taiwan has said that the closure was "simply a small internal
restructuring plan" and that the plan does not signal any change in Intel's
commitment to WiMAX.</P>
      <P>The spokeswoman said Sunday that Otellini's upcoming visit was not aimed at
clarifying its stance over the WiMAX controversy, but stressed that Intel has an
"ongoing" cooperation with the Taiwan government in the field.</P>
      <P>Asked if Otellini would sign a memorandum of understanding with Taiwan's
Ministry of Economic Affairs on cloud computing industry development or with the
semi-official Industrial Technology Research Institute for the development of 4G
wireless technology,  the spokeswoman refused to confirm.</P>
      <P>"Everything is still under assessment," she said.</P>
      <P>Otellini has visited Taiwan several times and he, during this Asian trip, will
also visit Vietnam, according to the spokeswoman.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Workers not willing to have children due to inadequate wages: poll</HEADLINE>

      <P>Four out of five workers are unwilling to have children because they do not earn
enough money, according to the results of an online survey.</P>
      <P>The employment website yes123 released figures at a press conference Sunday
showing that 79.2 percent of respondents were unwilling to have children or
raise another child despite the recent government subsidies offered in an
attempt to increase the nation's birth-rate.</P>
      <P>Taipei City recently announced a plan to open 100 childcare centers to ease the
burden on parents. This follows a promise by Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin earlier
to offer a NT$20,000 (US$652) subsidy for new-born babies, with eligible
families receiving a further monthly subsidy of NT$2,500.</P>
      <P>Not earning enough money was the main reason given by respondents (75.8 percent)
for why they were unwilling to have children, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>An unsound education system (38.6 percent) and problems in society and concerns
for children's welfare (30.1 percent) were the second and third reasons.</P>
      <P>Respondents showed that being overworked (27.3 percent) was another factor,
while 21.8 percent expressed they felt children's lives would be hard due to
over-competitiveness in the future.</P>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent of workers felt the basic monthly cost for raising a child was
between NT$10,000-NT$30,000, with an overall average of NT$28,875.</P>
      <P>An average household monthly income of NT$85,626 was therefore needed to raise a
child, the poll showed.</P>
      <P>Yes123 manager Hong Xue-zhen said she was "surprised" at the findings, but
admitted that her child's school and after-school-care fees alone amounted to
NT$20,000.</P>
      <P>Hong stated that the current monthly university graduate wage is NT$22,624, and
with a yearly pay rise of 5 percent, it would take a couple 13 years to earn
enough money to be able to raise a child, meaning women would be aged 35 by
then.</P>
      <P>One couple present said that even while their monthly household income was
NT$125,000, due to high property prices in Taipei and pressure at work they
still hadn't had children.</P>
      <P>The survey was carried out by yes123 from Sept. 20-28, collecting a total of
3,630 samples with a confidence level of 95 percent and a margin of error of 2.7
percentage points.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Final inspection of Taipei MRT Luzhou Line satisfactory: MOTC</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Final inspection showed the Taipei mass rapid transit (MRT) system's Luzhou Line
had improved greatly since the preliminary inspection in September and proved
satisfactory, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>"I have participated in 13 final inspections since the operation of the Mucha
Line, and this is so far the most satisfactory experience, " said Lawrence W.
Lan, vice chairman of the inspection committee for the line.</P>
      <P>There were 30 flaws remaining, however, including three major problems that
needed to be fixed by the Taipei City government before operation could begin,
the committee said.</P>
      <P>Safety procedures were the main focus to the committee's concern, that included
the design of emergency exits,  escalators  and facilities for people with
disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Luzhou Line crew proved their ability to maintain operations under extreme
situations, said Chen Yen-po, director of the MOTC's Department  of Railways and
Highways and the chairman of the inspection committee.</P>
      <P>During a simulated flooding incident, the crew successfully closed the flood
gate, keeping the section beneath the Danshui River safe and operations
unaffected, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Luzhou Line connects districts of Taipei City with the cities of Luzhou and
Sanchong in Taipei County on the other side of the river, the Department of
Rapid Transit Systems (DORTS) of the city government explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DORTS Deputy Commissioner Chang Pei-yi said he expects the Luzhou
Line to start commercial operations by the end of October.</P>
      <P>He said the operation commencement ceremony is likely to take place at Daqiao
Elementary School Station located on the border of Taipei City and Taipei
County.</P>
      <P>This schedule was questioned  by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) earlier this month when it claimed the Taipei City government was
attempting to move the operating date forward to before the grand opening of the
Taipei International Flora Expo on Nov. 6.</P>
      <P>The DPP argued that the rush was in an effort to help boost support for
incumbent Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin ahead of the Taipei municipality election on
Nov. 27. Hau is seeking reelection.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Buy sock bunnies to help disadvantaged: charity group</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A childrens welfare group called on the public to purchase a handmade charity
gift to help improve the income of disadvantaged families.</P>
      <P>The sock bunnies, sold at NT$350 (about US$11.3) each, are sewn by unemployed
mothers, foreign-born mothers, and mothers who live in remote or disaster
stricken areas such as Taoyuan Township in southern Taiwan which suffered from
severe flooding during the Morakot typhoon last year, Abby Chen, deputy director
in resource development at Child Welfare League Foundation, said at a press
conference in Taipei Sunday.</P>
      <P>The materials, NT$70 worth of cotton and socks, were provided to 20 mothers in
the handcraft project, who in return received NT$100 for the completion of each
bunny, explained Chen. The remaining NT$180 would go into a childrens relief
fund, she said.</P>
      <P>Launched this May, the sock bunny charity project initially provided stay-at-
home mothers with a stable monthly income of NT$15,000 to NT$20,000 but is now
less popular with consumers and the foundation urged the public to purchase the
remaining 3,000 sock bunnies in stock.</P>
      <P>We didn't expect this to be a long-term project. What we wanted to achieve
through this project was to give confidence and skills to these mothers who were
discouraged from the job market due to their poor academic backgrounds,said
Chen.</P>
      <P>An electronics shop with 18 branches nationwide upon hearing of their difficulty
purchased 600 to 700 sock rabbits to give to shoppers who spent over NT$2500 on
certain appliances between Oct. 8 and Oct. 24.</P>
      <P>Our business partners were very surprised when we chose to work with the
foundation to promote charity. The main reason was the sock bunnies were much
more expensive than most additional gifts, which cost around NT$50 to NT$100,
said Chen Hsin-hong, a special assistant in the companys business planning
department.</P>
      <P>Because information and technology months take place every December, October is
a relatively low season for electronic stores. We hope to cooperate with charity
groups every October to engage the public in philanthropic work,said Chen.</P>

      <P>Thousands of Indonesians gathered in Taipei Sunday to enjoy an annual blow-out
party organized by the city's Department of Labor (DOL) as a token of
appreciation to migrant workers from the southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>With hands waving high in the air and cameras flashing, many screaming fans went
wild as members of Relix, a band composed of Indonesian nationals, jumped up and
down and sang their hearts out for the audience.</P>
      <P>The concert was one of many events that took place during this year's Indonesian
Cultural Day.</P>
      <P>We want to express our highest appreciation and gratitude for the contributions
made by Indonesian workers to Taiwan. The welfare of foreign workers is an
important matter to us, and this is why we set up a Foreign Workers Affairs
section in August to better ensure the rights of our foreign friends, said
department director-general Chen Yeh-shin.</P>
      <P>The highlight of the day-long festivities held in Taipeis 228 Memorial Park was
the performance by Pinkan Mambo, a beloved Indonesian pop diva whose appearance
caused an instant uproar from the crowd.</P>
      <P>I am so happy for today because I am here with my friends, and I have a chance
to enjoy music from my country. I like Taiwan so much, said Saraswati, a
domestic worker who has been working in Taipei for three years.</P>
      <P>Amy Cheng, who has been married to a Taiwanese man for six years, said events
such as this help her to connect with home even though she is so far away.</P>
      <P>According to the DOL, there are over 25,000 registered Indonesian nationals
currently working in Taipei City, as well as around 400 Indonesian women married
to Taiwanese men.</P>
      <P>The latest figures from the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics show that Indonesian workers account for the largest percentage of
the nation's migrant workforce with 39.7 percent or 139,404 people, followed by
workers from Vietnam and the Philippines. (By Jenny W. Hsu)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Final inspection of Taipei MRT Luzhou Line satisfactory: MOTC</HEADLINE>

      <P>Final inspection showed the Taipei mass rapid transit (MRT) system's Luzhou Line
had improved greatly since the preliminary inspection in September and proved
satisfactory, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said
Sunday.</P>
      <P>"I have participated in 13 final inspections since the operation of the Mucha
Line, and this is so far the most satisfactory experience, " said Lawrence W.
Lan, vice chairman of the inspection committee for the line.</P>
      <P>There were 30 flaws remaining, however, including three major problems that
needed to be fixed by the Taipei City government before operation could begin,
the committee said.</P>
      <P>Safety procedures were the main focus to the committee's concern, that included
the design of emergency exits,  escalators  and facilities for people with
disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Luzhou Line crew proved their ability to maintain operations under extreme
situations, said Chen Yen-po, director of the MOTC's Department  of Railways and
Highways and the chairman of the inspection committee.</P>
      <P>During a simulated flooding incident, the crew successfully closed the flood
gate, keeping the section beneath the Danshui River safe and operations
unaffected, Chen said.</P>
      <P>The Luzhou Line connects districts of Taipei City with the cities of Luzhou and
Sanchong in Taipei County on the other side of the river, the Department of
Rapid Transit Systems (DORTS) of the city government explained.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DORTS Deputy Commissioner Chang Pei-yi said he expects the Luzhou
Line to start commercial operations by the end of October.</P>
      <P>He said the operation commencement ceremony is likely to take place at Daqiao
Elementary School Station located on the border of Taipei City and Taipei
County.</P>
      <P>This schedule was questioned  by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) earlier this month when it claimed the Taipei City government was
attempting to move the operating date forward to before the grand opening of the
Taipei International Flora Expo on Nov. 6.</P>
      <P>The DPP argued that the rush was in an effort to help boost support for
incumbent Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin ahead of the Taipei municipality election on
Nov. 27. Hau is seeking reelection.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Buy sock bunnies to help disadvantaged: charity group</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A childrens welfare group called on the public to purchase a handmade charity
gift to help improve the income of disadvantaged families.</P>
      <P>The sock bunnies, sold at NT$350 (about US$11.3) each, are sewn by unemployed
mothers, foreign-born mothers, and mothers who live in remote or disaster
stricken areas such as Taoyuan Township in southern Taiwan which suffered from
severe flooding during the Morakot typhoon last year, Abby Chen, deputy director
in resource development at Child Welfare League Foundation, said at a press
conference in Taipei Sunday.</P>
      <P>The materials, NT$70 worth of cotton and socks, were provided to 20 mothers in
the handcraft project, who in return received NT$100 for the completion of each
bunny, explained Chen. The remaining NT$180 would go into a childrens relief
fund, she said.</P>
      <P>Launched this May, the sock bunny charity project initially provided stay-at-
home mothers with a stable monthly income of NT$15,000 to NT$20,000 but is now
less popular with consumers and the foundation urged the public to purchase the
remaining 3,000 sock bunnies in stock.</P>
      <P>We didn't expect this to be a long-term project. What we wanted to achieve
through this project was to give confidence and skills to these mothers who were
discouraged from the job market due to their poor academic backgrounds,said
Chen.</P>
      <P>An electronics shop with 18 branches nationwide upon hearing of their difficulty
purchased 600 to 700 sock rabbits to give to shoppers who spent over NT$2500 on
certain appliances between Oct. 8 and Oct. 24.</P>
      <P>Our business partners were very surprised when we chose to work with the
foundation to promote charity. The main reason was the sock bunnies were much
more expensive than most additional gifts, which cost around NT$50 to NT$100,
said Chen Hsin-hong, a special assistant in the companys business planning
department.</P>
      <P>Because information and technology months take place every December, October is
a relatively low season for electronic stores. We hope to cooperate with charity
groups every October to engage the public in philanthropic work,said Chen.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thousands of Indonesians gathered in Taipei Sunday to enjoy an annual blow-out
party organized by the city's Department of Labor (DOL) as a token of
appreciation to migrant workers from the southeast Asian country.</P>
      <P>With hands waving high in the air and cameras flashing, many screaming fans went
wild as members of Relix, a band composed of Indonesian nationals, jumped up and
down and sang their hearts out for the audience.</P>
      <P>The concert was one of many events that took place during this year's Indonesian
Cultural Day.</P>
      <P>We want to express our highest appreciation and gratitude for the contributions
made by Indonesian workers to Taiwan. The welfare of foreign workers is an
important matter to us, and this is why we set up a Foreign Workers Affairs
section in August to better ensure the rights of our foreign friends, said
department director-general Chen Yeh-shin.</P>
      <P>The highlight of the day-long festivities held in Taipeis 228 Memorial Park was
the performance by Pinkan Mambo, a beloved Indonesian pop diva whose appearance
caused an instant uproar from the crowd.</P>
      <P>I am so happy for today because I am here with my friends, and I have a chance
to enjoy music from my country. I like Taiwan so much, said Saraswati, a
domestic worker who has been working in Taipei for three years.</P>
      <P>Amy Cheng, who has been married to a Taiwanese man for six years, said events
such as this help her to connect with home even though she is so far away.</P>
      <P>According to the DOL, there are over 25,000 registered Indonesian nationals
currently working in Taipei City, as well as around 400 Indonesian women married
to Taiwanese men.</P>
      <P>The latest figures from the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics show that Indonesian workers account for the largest percentage of
the nation's migrant workforce with 39.7 percent or 139,404 people, followed by
workers from Vietnam and the Philippines. (By Jenny W. Hsu)</P>

      <P>Eastern Taiwan has been hit by heavy rains, with accumulated precipitation
reaching 100 millimeters from midnight to 6 p.m. Sunday at several weather
observation stations in Hualien County.</P>
      <P>Hualien's Xiulin Township has recorded the island's highest precipitation of 169
millimeters, said the Central Weather Bureau (CWB).</P>
      <P>The heavy rain, a result of the combined effects of strong seasonal winds from
the northeast  and Typhoon Megi from the southeast, has claimed one life in
Hualien County in the past two days.</P>
      <P>Around a hundred gorge walkers were surprised by the sudden floods and trapped

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a warning for people in eastern and
northeastern Taiwan Monday, reminding residents in Hualien and Yilan counties to
take precautions against torrential rain as the island came under the influence
of the outer rim of an approaching typhoon in addition to strong seasonal winds
from the northeast.</P>
      <P>The CWB issued the warning at 9: 40 a.m. Earlier, it reported Typhoon Megi would
make landfall on northern Luzon in the Philippines at noon.</P>
      <P>As of 8 a.m., Megi was located 570 kilometers south-southeast of Eluanbi in
Pingtung County, southern Taiwan, moving westward at a speed of 17 kilometers
per hour. The storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 234 kph, with gusts
of up to 288 kph.</P>
      <P>The bureau forecast that the center of the typhoon would be 570 km south-
southwest of Eluanbi by 8 a.m. Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Although the storm radius had expanded from 250 km to 280 km in the past few
hours, the strong typhoon was not expected to batter Taiwan due to its distance

    <DATELINE>10/18/10  12:21:08</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the domestic economy continuing to gather steam after the 2008-2009  global
financial  crisis,  an exceptionally  strong job-hopping trend is hitting the
local employment market, according to recent government surveys.</P>
      <P>The Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) classifies
those who have not yet landed a new job after quitting their original positions
due to discontent with working conditions as "job hoppers."</P>
      <P>In terms of this definition, the number of "job hoppers" has been on a steady
rise since the beginning of this year, making it the longest uninterrupted
upward spiral in local history, DGBAS officials said.</P>
      <P>The following is an excerpt from a local newspaper's coverage of the trend:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>In the past, local people tended to resign after receiving year-end bonuses or
at the end of the lunar new year holiday, and the number of job-hoppers normally
declined steadily after the second quarter of the year.</P>
      <P>"The continued rise in the number of job-hoppers in the first eight months of
this year was rare in our job market, " said a DGBAS official.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, the number of job-hoppers hit 153,000 in August, also a
historic record. The number of job-hoppers rose steadily from 123,000 in
January, 125,000 in February, 126,000 in March, 133,000 in April, 141,000 in
May, 142,000 in June to 148,000 in July, according to DGBAS statistics.</P>
      <P>Ho Chi-sheng, a 111 Job Bank executive,  said many local white-collar workers
have endured "double stress" from increased workload due to work force trimming
and potential threat of layoffs amid economic slowdown over the past two years.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, many of them want[/] to change jobs to seek better
working terms now that the general economic situation has improved to offer
better job prospects," Ho said.</P>
      <P>Hsin Ping-lung, a professor at National Taiwan University's Graduate Institute
of National Development, said the local employment market will definitely see a
stronger job-hopping trend this year because there are far more openings than
those available in the previous two years.</P>
      <P>In his view, Hsin said younger office workers with little or no financial burden
to support their families are more likely to join the "job-hopping" group of
people. (Oct. 18, 2010). ed/MH</P>

      <P>The scam, known locally as the Red Fire Case, surfaced following prosecutors'
intensive investigations into a bid by Chinatrust Financial to take over Mega
Financial.</P>
      <P>Koo was indicted in December 2009 on suspicion of masterminding the scam. The
trial in the district court started in February 2010 and Koo was barred from
leaving the country out of fears that he would avoid the trial.</P>
      <P>Koo was accused of instructing China Financial's unit Chinatrust Commercial Bank
to buy structured notes linked to Mega Financial from issuer Barclays Bank PLC
without approval from the board of directors.</P>
      <P>During the trial, Koo repeatedly denied the accusations, saying the takeover of
Mega Financial and the purchase of the structured notes were simply financial
investments and he had no knowledge of the transaction with Red Fire
Developments.</P>
      <P>Through its branch in Hong Kong, Chinatrust Commercial Bank bought a total of
US$390 million worth of structured notes and then sold the securities at a lower
price to Red Fire in what prosecutors deemed a non-arm's length deal so that the
paper company, which had been capitalized at just US$1, garnered about NT$1
billion (US$32.61 million) in profit.</P>
      <P>After the transaction, Red Fire wired the proceeds to several other offshore
companies to avoid possible tracing of the illegal funds, prosecutors said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The average wage in Taiwan is expected to increase in the next few months to a
figure that is higher than that of before the global economic crisis, Council of
Labor Affairs Minister Wang Ju-hsuan said Monday at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Wang told reporters that according to the Directorate-General of Budget,
Accounting, and Statistics (DGBAS) , a record number of 153,000 people switched
jobs in August, an indication of a high level of confidence among the workforce.</P>
      <P>During the global economic crisis, she said, many people were apprehensive about
changing jobs.</P>
      <P>"However, right now the situation favors the workers, because we are at a point
where we don't have enough people to fill the current job vacancies.
Furthermore,  improvements in wages and working conditions allows job seekers to
have a wider range of options," Wang said.</P>
      <P>She noted that the average wage for the first seven months was NT$47,000
(US$1,516.13) , up from the 2007-2008 figure of NT$44,000, and well up from the
NT$42,000 average last year during the peak of the global economic downturn.</P>
      <P>The latest jobless rate reported by the DGBAS in August was 5.17 percent and
Wang expressed confidence that the figure will drop below the 5 percent mark by
the end of the year as promised by Premier Wu Den-yih.</P>

      <P>The new head of the Bureau of Foreign Trade (BOFT) was sworn in Monday and is
expected to lead a new round of trade negotiations with China in the coming
months.</P>
      <P>Cho Shih-chao, Taiwan's former representative to Kuwait, said in his new
capacity as director-general of the BOFT under the Ministry of Economic Affairs
that foreign government officials and business leaders have changed their
attitudes toward Taiwan since the signing of the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) between Taiwan and China on June 29.</P>
      <P>"I felt an obvious difference in the attitudes of foreign officials before and
since the signing of the ECFA when I was posted overseas, " he said during a
press meet after his swearing-in ceremony.</P>
      <P>"Before  cross-Taiwan  Strait  relations  improved,  foreign government
officials tried to avoid me," Cho added.</P>
      <P>"However, in the wake of the signing, many are now glad to talk with me about
future developments," he said.</P>
      <P>Asked about his thoughts on upcoming Taiwan-China trade talks, he said he needs
more time to study the details, pointing out that he had just returned home a
day earlier.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and China are expected to negotiate deals on cargo trade, service trade,
investment protection and dispute settlement within the six-month period from
mid-September, when the trade pact took effect.</P>
      <P>Cho's predecessor, Huang Chih-peng, left the BOFT to assume his new post as
Taiwan's representative to Vietnam earlier in the month.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Judicial reforms need more than lip service</HEADLINE>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When Judicial Yuan President Rai Hau-min assumed office last week he pledged
determination and effort to speed up much anticipated judicial reform in order
to win back people's trust in the court system.</P>
      <P>His strategies for achieving this goal included promulgating legislation of a
draft Judge Act to make it possible to fire incompetent judges, and promotion of
a system allowing public participation in the trial process.</P>
      <P>Though a mechanism for dismissing poorly performing judges is essential for
maintaining the professionalism and independence of judicial personnel, the
other side of the same coin is promotion of a system that cultivates good
judges.</P>
      <P>More than half Taiwan's judges are under 30 years of age having entered the
profession by passing national certification examinations targeted at graduates
from law schools. Are these young judges really capable of winning public trust?</P>
      <P>As for the proposal for public participation, while the goal is laudable the
means is still a mystery. The Judicial Yuan seems disinclined to introduce a
U.S.- or U.K.-style jury system, nor does it plan to adopt public or expert
participation, which could violate existing laws stipulating judicial procedures
should be closed-door to ensure independence.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that the country's top judicial authority can produce concrete,
effective and achievable measures capable of realizing its promises of judicial
reforms. (Oct. 18, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei human milk bank recognized by U.K. association</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A human milk bank in Taipei has won recognition from an English association,
making it the first internationally certified milk bank in Asia, officials of
the Taipei City Hospital, Branch for Women and Children said Monday.</P>
      <P>Since its establishment in December 2004, the milk bank has collected more than
10 million cc of breast milk from 1,008 donors nationwide, benefiting 1,244
infants born prematurely or who have infectious diseases or feeding intolerance,
said Fang Li-jung, head of the hospital's pediatrics department.</P>
      <P>Fang said that with the milk bank certification by the United Kingdom
Association for Milk Banking, the safety of the donated milk is assured.</P>
      <P>In an effort to recruit more breastfeeding mothers willing to donate surplus
milk, Fang introduced Lee Chen-yi, a regular donor from Hsinchu City, to talk
about being a milk donor.</P>
      <P>Dubbed a "milk donor master" for having donated 98,080 cc of milk, Lee said she
feels proud to be able to help other children in need and that she has even lost
22 kg thanks to donating her milk.</P>
      <P>"Whenever my friends or family members have a problem with breastfeeding, they
come to me for help. While teaching them how to express milk, I also encourage
them to enter the donor program," said Lee, who sends her frozen milk to Taipei
every two weeks via a delivery service paid for by the bank.</P>
      <P>"Breast milk is the gift of nature and the best nutrition for babies, especially
sick ones who need their immune systems boosted," said Yuan Chiou-chung, the
hospital's superintendent.</P>
      <P>Yuan added that there are cases in which newborns cannot get milk from their
mothers and must rely on the milk bank for help, such as when their mothers die
in childbirth or when their mothers have AIDS.</P>
      <P>The milk bank, working with the Bureau of Health Promotion, established a milk
bank station at Taichung Hospital in 2009 to make donating milk more convenient
for women living in southern parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Fang said that while prior to the opening of the Taichung milk station, 80
percent to 90 percent of the donors were from northern regions, there has now
been a rise in the number of southern donors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 1.76 percent Monday as pressure focused on the
bellwether electronics sector amid lingering concerns over weakening global
demand for high-tech products, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 144.76 points to 8,060.54, after moving between 8,057.12
and 8,209.39, on turnover of NT$113.35 billion (US$3.69 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 4.09 points on a mixed performance on Wall Street at the
end of last week. Selling followed to drag down high-tech firms, in particular
large-cap stocks, on fears that a slower global economy will hurt the bottom
line in the fourth quarter of this year, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 3,130 stocks closed down and 795 were up, with 214 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The construction sector suffered the steepest decline, down 2.6 percent. Paper
and pulp stocks fell 2.3 percent, textile shares lost 2.2 percent,  financials
shed 2.0 percent,  and machinery and electronics stocks closed down 1.9 percent.</P>
      <P>The plastics and chemicals sector fell 1.6 percent, the cement stocks lost 1.3
percent and foodstuffs closed down 0.6 percent.</P>
      <P>"The heavy selling has made the market technically weak, " Taiwan International
Securities analyst Benson Huang said. "It is possible the index will test the
key 8,000-point level soon amid cautious sentiment," he added.</P>
      <P>Huang said there have been signs that liquidity is draining out of the market as
the central bank has stepped up measures to shore up the U.S. dollar to prevent
a rapid appreciation of the local currency.</P>
      <P>Huang said the electronics sector needs more liquidity to push itself out of the
current downward trend, in particular as a gloomy mood over earnings has already
haunted share prices of high-tech stocks.</P>
      <P>"But, with more and more investors retreating from the trading floor, the hopes
for a meaningful rebound in the sector were dimmer," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang said he suspected that the selling came largely from foreign institutional
investors who dumped large-cap electronics and semiconductor stocks.</P>
      <P>Smartphone maker HTC fell 6.87 percent to finish at NT$624.00 and integrated
circuit designer MediaTek shed 3.59 percent to end at NT$376.00.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. lost 2.26 percent to close at NT$60.50
and United Microelectronics Corp. fell 2.20 percent to end the day at NT$13.35.</P>

      <P>The band played in the Paraguayan capital of Asuncion Oct. 14 and in the nearby

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is set to accept independent Chinese visitors, Minister of Transportation
and Communications Mao Chi-kuo said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a legislative session, Mao said the Cabinet had determined in
principle that Taiwan would open its doors to three categories of Chinese
visitors -- tourists, business visitors and visitors to outlying islands -- but
that details of the opening were still in the pipeline.</P>
      <P>Management would differ for these three categories, Mao said in response to
questions raised by two Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Details would be publicized in the near future, he said, but for example,
management of general Chinese tourists would be strictest, and would include
restrictions on the number allowed to enter Taiwan each day.</P>
      <P>At present, Chinese travelers can only visit Taiwan in organized groups.</P>
      <P>Operators in the local hospitality industry reacted positively to the
government's initiatives to open Taiwan to independent Chinese travelers.</P>
      <P>Chen Jung-hui, assistant manager with the Ambassador Hotel Taipei, said five-
star tourist hotels had not benefited greatly to date from the country's opening
to Chinese tourist groups because of the cost factor.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to independent Chinese visitors, who will be more likely to
check into hotels of higher rates," Chen said.</P>
      <P>For Liu Chun-hao, marketing manager with the Leofoo Group, the soon-to-open
independent  visitor program had already improved business for the group, with
Chinese travel agencies booking rooms and restaurants at its up-scale facilities
such as the Westin Taipei and the Leofoo Resort.</P>
      <P>In related news, Mao responded to a complaint by KMT Legislator Tsai Chin-lung
regarding high ticket prices for non-stop flights across the Taiwan Strait
compared to those of transit flights. Addressing the issue for the first time,
the minister said it was wishful thinking to expect non-stop tickets to be as
cheap as commuter flights, and that a small fare increase was justifiable.</P>

      <P>A child care center in Songshang district, Taipei City,  was fined for not
reporting suspected cases of enterovirus, Taipei City government announced
Monday, adding that this was the first time the city had issued a fine for this
reason.</P>
      <P>A tip-off from the public led to an on-site investigation Sept. 16 that
confirmed three unreported enterovirus infection cases at the center, said Ou
Chia-ling, assistant director of the city's Division for Disease Control and
Prevention. She noted that the center will be subject to a fine of NT$3,000
(US$94).</P>
      <P>In a regulation announced June 15, kindergartens, child care centers, and all
schools in the city up to high school level must report suspected cases
exhibiting hand, foot and mouth disease, herpangina and enterovirus within 48
hours of detection.</P>
      <P>Ou said that cases of mild enterovirus infection had been discovered recently,

      <P>The International Conference on Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics
(CHEP) opened in Taiwan Monday, the first time the meeting has been convened in
the country since first held in 1985.</P>
      <P>Some 500 physicists and computing professionals from 27 countries are attending
the five-day conference at Academia Sinica, Taiwan's leading research institute.
They are scheduled to present 465 papers covering seven major themes.</P>
      <P>This year's conference comes at an important time in the world of physics. It is
the first global forum to be held since the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) run by
the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) was launched again in
March, said convener Simon Lin, an associate research fellow at Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>The LHC, a huge particle accelerator said to be able to recreate the moments
following the Big Bang, is expected to challenge previous understandings of how
the universe works.</P>
      <P>Teams involved in four detector experiments using the collider -- ATLAS, CMS,
ALICE and LHCb -- will present their latest data and explain their tools of
analysis at this week's forum, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is one of the 34 countries participating in the operation of the
Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) , a distributed computing and data storage
infrastructure, according to CERN's website.</P>
      <P>Speaking further on Taiwan's efforts in basic research and scientific
development on the opening day of the conference, Vice President Vincent Siew
said the government was committed to building Taiwan into an e-Science center in
Asia and promoting scientific collaboration in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>He said applied science development was not possible without a solid foundation
in basic science, which is why Taiwan has increased its funding for scientific
research at local universities and research institutes to 2.8 percent of gross
domestic product in recent years, close to the 3 percent seen in developed
countries.</P>

      <P>Jeffrey Koo Jr., former vice chairman of Chinatrust Financial Holding Co., will
appeal a ruling issued by the Taipei District Court to put him behind bars for
his role in a financial scandal, his lawyer said Monday.</P>
      <P>Koo was sentenced to nine years in jail by the court earlier Monday as the court
found him guilty of violating the Securities and Exchange Act and the Banking
Law in relation to transactions of structured notes linked to Mega Financial
Holding Co.</P>
      <P>The ruling found that Koo and other executives of Chinatrust Financial
masterminded  the illegal transactions  which allowed offshore paper company Red
Fire Developments to pocket US$30.47 million and caused losses for Chinaturst
Financial.</P>
      <P>The scam, known locally as the Red Fire Case, surfaced following prosecutors'
intensive investigations into a bid by Chinatrust Financial to take over Mega
Financial.</P>
      <P>Red Fire Developments, capitalized at US$1, was set up in Hong Kong under Koo's
instruction, the ruling said.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chien-ting, a member of Koo's legal team, expressed regret over the ruling
and said Koo would definitely appeal the case.</P>
      <P>Chinatrust Financial said that, as Koo now held no post at the company, the
litigation was his personal affair, and the ruling would have no impact on the
company's operations.</P>
      <P>According to the ruling, Koo, without approval from the board of directors,
bought the structured notes linked to Mega Financial from issuer Barclays Bank
PLC and then sold the securities in a non-arm's length transaction to Red Fire
Developments, which garnered the windfall from the deal.</P>
      <P>The ruling said that Koo embezzled US$9.57 million out of Red Developments'
windfall to cover his donations to former President Chen Shui-bian in the period
2002-2005, but which he could not report to his company as having spent. He is
said to have then remitted the remaining US$20.90 million to overseas units of
Chinatrust Financial.</P>
      <P>The court also ruled that Koo manipulated Mega Financial's share price before
official approval of China Trust Financial's request to take over Mega Financial
had been made public.</P>
      <P>Yeh claimed the US$9.57 million had been largely appropriated by Steven Cheng,
another former executive of China Trust Financial who is also Koo's brother-in-
law, and that Koo had no knowledge of the use of the fund.</P>
      <P>Cheng is on Taiwan's wanted list as he has fled the island to avoid trial.</P>
      <P>Yeh added that Mega Financial's share price was based on market mechanisms, and
Koo lacked the power to directly or indirectly influence the price.</P>
      <P>During the trial, which started in February, Koo repeatedly denied the
allegations and insisted on his innocence.</P>

      <P>Taiwan must strengthen its soft power if it wants to stand on the world stage,
President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday in a speech to business leaders from Chinese
societies around the world.</P>
      <P>Ma explained that soft power is a country's ability to get others to accept or
recognize its goals by "persuading, attracting and cooperating,  " citing a
definition by Joseph Nye, a Harvard University  scholar of politics who coined
the phrase in the mid-1980s.</P>
      <P>Ma delivered his speech, which also addressed Taiwan's economic strategies in
the economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) era, at the opening of the
two-day 8th Annual Global Business Forum organized by the Taipei-based Chinese-
language monthly business magazine Global Views.</P>
      <P>Hundreds of enterprise leaders from around the world attended the gathering,
including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Chairman Morris Chang and Stan
Shih, founder of the Acer Group and chairman of the iD SoftCapital Group.</P>
      <P>Ma said the ECFA Taiwan signed with China in late June to boost bilateral trade
exchanges is a shot in the arm for Taiwan, which he said can create 60,000 jobs
in the country and increase production value by NT$190 billion.</P>
      <P>"However, the ECFA is not a cure-all but more like a pair of light sports shoes
that help an athlete's performance," he said.</P>
      <P>"If an athlete is weak, it won't matter how good his shoes are, " Ma said,
noting that Taiwan must reinforce its power before making inroads into the
global market.</P>
      <P>Citing the remarkable performances  of Taiwan's North Pole marathon  runner Chen
Yen-po,  tennis player Lu Yen-hsun  and philanthropist vegetable vendor Chen
Shu-chu, who was selected as one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people
of 2010, Ma said they are all examples of Taiwan's soft power.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese enterprises should seize the moment when such people throw Taiwan into
the international spotlight to grab international market share by creating their
own brand names and developing the country's services sector, Ma said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) has not yet decided to adopt an expert proposal to
replace the death penalty with a "special life sentence," a senior official said
Monday.</P>
      <P>"Some scholars recommended the proposal last Friday at a meeting of the
ministry's special panel tasked with studying the feasibility of gradually
phasing out the death penalty," MOJ Deputy Minister Chen Shou-huang said at a
news conference.</P>
      <P>The proposal will serve as reference for the MOJ in formulating policy, but it
has not yet become established policy, as was reported by a local newspaper,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News reported last weekend that the MOJ's "death penalty
research panel" had reached a consensus a day earlier to recommend the adoption
of a "special life sentence" system in place of capital punishment.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the proposed "special life sentence" system will
stipulate that inmates given the special penalty will not be eligible for
parole.</P>
      <P>The report raised the concerns of some crime victims and their families,  who
staunchly oppose abolishing  the death penalty, prompting the ministry to call a
news conference to clarify its stance.</P>
      <P>Chen said the report was not fully correct because the ministry had yet to
endorse the recommendation.</P>
      <P>"The proposal will serve as a reference in deciding whether to revise our
existing law to pave the way for the abolition of the death penalty, but it has
by no means been established as official policy," he said.</P>
      <P>"Our policy has been that existing laws on the death penalty will remain in
place until after a national consensus has been forged on the issue, public
misgivings over abolishing capital punishment have been eased, and a reasonable
alternative has been worked out."</P>
      <P>The ministry's executions of four death row inmates on April 30 ended a de facto
moratorium on capital punishment that had lasted for over four years, triggering
heated debate locally on whether the death penalty should be phased out, in line
with a growing world trend.</P>
      <P>After the executions, the European Union urged Taiwan to resume its de facto
moratorium pending eventual legal abolishment.</P>

outdoor activities in times of typhoon or flood to avoid putting unnecessary
pressure on rescue or disaster prevention resources, according to Su Jun-pin,
director of the KMT's Culture and Communications Committee.</P>
      <P>The president instructed the Executive Yuan to work with the Ministry of the
Interior, the National Fire Administration and the Central Weather Bureau (CWB)
and to jointly come up with relevant policies to dissuade people from going
outdoors during typhoons or when there is a threat of flooding, according to Su.</P>
      <P>Ma issued the instructions after learning that a man, a river tracing guide,
fell to his death in eastern Hualien County over the weekend while trying to
escort his clients to safety after the river rose suddenly, while 26 people in
11 cars were stranded on an island in a river in the northeastern county of
Yilan Sunday.</P>
      <P>In related news, meanwhile, the CWB issued a warning for people in eastern and
northeastern Taiwan Monday, warning residents in Hualien and Yilan counties to
take precautions against torrential rain as the island came under the influence
of the outer rim of Typhoon Megi, in addition to strong seasonal northeasterly
winds.</P>

      <P>The Government Information Office (GIO) invited foreign dignitaries to sample
Taiwanese delicacies Monday at the prize draw ceremony held to conclude the
Taiwan's Yummy Snacks online contest.</P>
      <P>GIO Minister Johnny Chi-chen Chiang served stinky tofu, pig blood cake and eight
other specialty foods to foreign representatives, media and other participants.</P>
      <P>Asked by local journalists how today's stinky tofu tasted, Ambassador William
Manuel Tapia Aleman of Nicaragua said that though the stinky tofu sold at Shilin
night market had a more pungent smell, both tasted equally good.</P>
      <P>Trying pig blood cake for the first time, he said it was much like eating a
popsicle. Representatives from the Jordan commercial office declined to try this
unusual delicacy, which was voted top in a contest of ten weirdest foods by a
U.K. travel website last year, but naturally this was due to religious reasons.</P>
      <P>The Nicaraguan ambassador added that his favorite Taiwanese cuisine was braised
pork with rice because its texture reminded him of a similar dish at home.</P>
      <P>Chiang personally made an oyster omelet, which got the thumbs up from Ambassador

    <TEXT>
      <P>Morris Chang, chairman of the world's biggest contract chip maker Taiwan
Semiconductor  Manufacturing Company Co. (TSMC) , said Monday that the impact of
the Taiwan dollar's recent appreciation was within his expectations.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar closed Friday at NT$30.793 to the U.S. dollar, up 4.1 percent
against the greenback since the beginning  of September.</P>
      <P>Economists fear that the currency's appreciation could hurt the exports of the
country's electronic companies, such as TSMC.</P>
      <P>"The appreciation has in fact had an impact on TSMC's operations, but it was
within the range that I expected, " Chang said after his speech at the 8th
Annual Global Views Business Forum held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The two-day forum, held annually since 2003 and this year focusing on
integrating Chinese talent and resources, is being attended  by business
representatives  from the United States, Singapore, China and Taiwan, organizer
Global Views Monthly said.</P>
      <P>The TSMC chairman  acknowledged,  however,  that TSMC  was structurally
different from others in the electronics industry because of its capital
intensive foundries, which help generate a 50 percent gross margin compared with
8 percent for other players.</P>
      <P>The high gross margin, he said, was generated by the chip sector's high added-
value derived from the development of technology and capital.</P>
      <P>Chang suggested that small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) should tie their
operations more closely together to cooperate on technological development and
attract investment to create well-paid jobs.</P>
      <P>Earlier on the same occasion, President Ma Ying-jeou pointed to the importance
of SMEs in creating jobs. He said 76 percent of Taiwan's employment openings
were from its SMEs, which account for 98 percent of the total number of
companies in the country.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's industrial structure, he added, needs to be adjusted to help narrow the
gap between rich and poor in the country.</P>
      <P>Asked if the leaders of Taiwan and China would meet face-to-face in 2011 or
2012, Ma said with a smile that he would "seriously consider the idea."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Monday that Taiwan-Dominican Republic
relations remain firm despite growing financial ties between Taiwan's Caribbean
ally and China and hints of a possible interest in changing allegiance.</P>
      <P>Bank of China and China's Foreign Trade Bank were reported on Oct. 15 to have
agreed to extend US$462 million in financing for an exclusive tourism complex in
Punta Perla in the eastern part of that country being developed by Spanish
investors.</P>
      <P>Dominican Republic Tourism Minister Francisco Javier Garcia was quoted as saying
that the deal created a precedent that will open the doors for Chinese financing
of Dominican Republic development projects, but Taiwan appeared to take the news
in stride.</P>
      <P>"There are many foreign investments in the Dominican Republic. Our embassy will
closely monitor the situation. However, the Republic of China does not oppose
trade relations between the private sectors of our allies and those in China,"
said MOFA spokesman James Chang.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had already received a jolt earlier this month when Garcia intimated
during a visit to Shanghai that his country was hoping for full relations with
China "sooner than later."</P>
      <P>"We aspire sooner than later, our relations with the People's Republic of China
are complete relations and absolutas, " he was quoted as saying by online news
service Dominican Today on Oct. 5.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Taiwanese embassy in Santo Domingo immediately raised concerns
with the Dominican Republic government regarding Garcia's comments, but stressed
that Taiwan's longstanding friendship with the Dominican Republic remains
unshaken.</P>
      <P>"The Dominican Republic's foreign policies are directed by its president," Chang
added.</P>
      <P>In July, President Ma Ying-jeou received an official delegation led by Dominican
Secretary of Defense Pedro Rafael Pena Antonio and expressed hope for further
bilateral agricultural, educational, security and economic cooperation in the
future.</P>
      <P>Ma also commended the Caribbean ally for playing a vital role in assisting
Haiti, another one of Taiwan's allies, in the post-quake efforts.</P>
      <P>On Oct. 11, the MOFA thanked the Dominican Republic as one of 17 allied
countries that backed Taiwan's bid to join the International Civil Aviation
Organization as an observer.</P>

      <P>National Defense Minister Kao Hua-chu said Monday that he will ask for an
overall review of the country's French-made Mirage fighter jets after a lawmaker
pointed out that the flight hours of the fighters have been reduced due to
concern about a possible engine problem.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Lin Yu-fang  of the ruling Kuomintang  told a legislative committee
that during maintenance operations in May 2009, the engine rotors were found to
have cracks, resulting in reduced flying hours.</P>
      <P>In May this year, a Mirage fighter jet belonging to the French Air Force crashed
in southwestern France, possibly due to the same engine fault.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the total flying hours of Taiwan's Mirage jets were reduced to
less than 5,000 this year from the original target of more than 10,000 hours.</P>
      <P>"The flying hours of the Mirage pilots were also reduced from the standard 15
hours per month to 10 hours, even lower than the 12 hours per month logged by
Chinese fighter jet pilots, " Lin said, adding that this has affected the
nation's air defenses.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased 60 Mirage-2000s fighter jets from France in 1992, the last
batch of which was delivered in 2001. Fifty-six of the planes remain in service,
with four having been lost in crashes.</P>

      <P>A young guitarist from Taiwan beat seven other finalists to bag first prize in
the International Guitar Competition and Festival Berlin Sunday.</P>
      <P>It was 22-year-old Lin Chia-wei's fourth championship title won in Europe so far
this year, following successes in Veria, Greece in April; in Nuertingen, Germany
in July; and in Vienna, Austria earlier this month.</P>
      <P>He played pieces by Astor Piazzolla and Mauro Giuliani in Sunday's final, which
won him a hand-made guitar worth 2,500 euros and the coveted opportunity to
serve as a judge in next year's contest and to give a recital.</P>
      <P>Lin began learning guitar with his father at the tender age of 4 and has chalked
up countless awards in Taiwan and in international competitions. He realized his
childhood dream of going abroad to study last year when he was admitted to the
Koblenz Conservatory beside the Rhine River and became a student of noted German
guitar educator Hubert Kaeppel.</P>
      <P>Asked why he enters so many competitions, Lin said he hopes to accumulate his
performance experience and reach out to as many guitar lovers and artists as
possible.</P>
      <P>"I tend to get information from the Internet and if time permits, I travel by
train by myself to take part in the contests. This way, I can test my guitar
competence and cultivate my presence in the guitar world, in addition to earning
prize money to help finance my tuition," he said.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, Lin won the top prize in a competition sponsored by the
prestigious University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna to secure the
opportunities to perform in Vienna and in St. Petersburg in Russia.</P>
      <P>For a young guitarist, Lin said, these could mark an important turning point in
his career.</P>
      <P>For him, Lin went on, Germany provides an ideal learning environment because it
boasts a large cluster of top-notch guitar mentors and guitarists from around
the world.</P>
      <P>"I hope to gain admission to the Cologne Conservatory of Music next year to
further hone my skills, and my career goal is to become a soloist with a
quintessential presence in Europe," he added.</P>

      <P>Shares of smartphone maker HTC Corp. took a hit Monday amid concerns over
glitches in the Windows Phone 7 (WP7) operating system on which five of the
company's new models will run, dealers said.</P>
      <P>HTC closed down 6.87 percent at NT$624.00, the lowest level since Sept. 3, with
12.94 million shares changing hands, while the benchmark weighted index fell
1.76 percent to 8,060.54.</P>
      <P>"The glitches made investors here very cautious, as they are afraid that the
technical problem will affect HTC's shipments in the fourth quarter," TLG Asset
Management analyst Arch Shih said.</P>
      <P>Last week, HTC unveiled the five new models based on the WP7 operating system --
the HTC 7 Surround, the HTC 7 Mozart, the HTC 7 Trophy, the HTC 7 Pro and the
HTC HD7 -- which will hit markets in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific
region from later in the month.</P>
      <P>While HTC clarified during the trading session that it had noted the problem and
was taking action to resolve it, selling extended until the end of the session.</P>
      <P>"The market had expected that the company would post significant sales for the
fourth quarter. But the technical problem dampened investor sentiment," Shih
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan International Securities analyst Benson Huang agreed, saying that
investors fear HTC will not meet a market expectation of 8.8 million units
shipped for the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Huang said the market is also worried about HTC's falling gross margin amid
fierce price competition.</P>
      <P>"The market anticipates that the new models will lend some support to its gross
margin, " Huang said. "The possible impact on shipments from the technical
problem has unnerved investors."</P>

      <P>In response to a question from Kuomintang legislator Yang Chiung-ying, Wu said a

other agencies, such as the Mainland Affairs Council.</P>
      <P>The ministry hoped to sign the MOU at the end of this year at the earliest to
regulate double-degree and other exchange programs between education
institutions of the two sides, added Wu.</P>
      <P>Students in a cross-strait double-degree program would be able to study at two
participating universities, one in Taiwan and the other in mainland China, to
earn degrees from both in a shorter time than studying separately.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's universities are keen on developing such dual-degree programs with
their Chinese counterparts after the door opened to admit Chinese students,
National Taiwan University President Lee Si-chen said Monday.</P>
      <P>Due to differences in the educational systems of Taiwan and China,  however,
they have difficulties  promoting dual-degree partnerships, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The initiative was made possible by the passage in August of three amendments to
the Law Governing Relations Between the People in the Taiwan Area and the
Mainland Area, the University Law and the College Law.</P>
      <P>The revisions allowed Chinese students to pursue master's and doctoral degrees

      <P>Taiwan may adopt new guidelines for CPR that were introduced recently by the
American Heart Association, a Department of Health (DOH) official said Monday.</P>
      <P>Agreeing with the new guidelines of "first compressing the chest and then
breathing into the victim's mouth, " Shih Chung-liang, director of the DOH's
Bureau of Medical Affairs, said research conducted in the past showed that fast
chest compressions were more useful for sudden cardiac arrest than mouth-to-
mouth resuscitation.</P>
      <P>At the same time,  he said, many people,  including both professional rescuers
and bystanders, did not know how to give mouth-to-mouth  resuscitation
correctly or were hesitant about breathing into strangers' mouths, leading to
delays in administering CPR.</P>
      <P>Noting that CPR guidance has been revised in the West in recent years to put
more emphasis on chest compressions, Shih suggested that Taiwanese rescuers
follow the new guidelines.</P>
      <P>He said his bureau will collect relevant information on the new CPR guidelines
before referring them to the Emergency Medical Services under the National Fire
Administration for discussion.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is expected to adopt the new CPR guidelines next year at the earliest,"
he forecast.</P>
      <P>The  new  guidelines  ditch  the  old  ABC  training  -- airway-breathing-
compressions -- that called for rescuers to give two breaths first, then
alternate with 30 presses, said Michael Sayre, co-author of the guidelines
issued by the American Heart Association Monday.</P>
      <P>Sayre said the ABC approach took time and delayed chest presses, which keep the
blood circulating.</P>
      <P>Also recognizing the value of the new CPR method, Chen Wei-kung, director of
Taichung-based  China Medical University Hospital's Emergency Treatment
Department, said the last breath victims take before sudden cardiac arrest leave
some oxygen in their blood.</P>
      <P>If their heart were massaged before help arrives, the oxygen in the blood could
be pumped to the brain, helping lower the chances that the victims will suffer a

      <P>Taiwanese tennis player Lu Yen-hsun has achieved the highest ranking of his
career after picking up valuable points in this past week's Shanghai Masters in
China, according to the latest weekly rankings issued by the Association of
Tennis Professionals (ATP) Monday.</P>
      <P>After climbing to No. 39 in the world, edging past his previous best of 40th in
mid-August, Lu expressed his excitement over his latest milestone on his
official website and said he hopes to crack the world's top 20 or 30 in the
future.</P>
      <P>Lu was able to move up in the rankings after earning 45 ranking points this past
week for reaching the second round of the 2010 Shanghai Masters. He defeated
Chinese qualifier Wu Di in straight sets before falling to Italian Andreas Seppi
in the second round.</P>
      <P>Dirk Hordorff, Lu's coach and overseas agent, said cracking the top 40 is not
easy for any Asian player, and he attributed the 27-year-old's success to his
fighting spirit and his capacity for hard work.</P>
      <P>Lu is entered this week in a second-tier ATP Challenger event in Seoul, where he
will be the top seed.</P>
      <P>His first round opponent is Korean Chung Hong, and if he takes care of the
Korean as he is favored to do, he could face compatriot Yang Tsung-hua in the

will establish sisterhood ties with the city of Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan.

1987: Wall Street experiences the worst day in its history, known as "Black
Monday," with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeting a record 508.32

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many people think the government lacks the determination to curb skyrocketing
housing prices in northern Taiwan partly because it talks a lot but does very
little.</P>
      <P>The government probably thinks any problem can be solved as long as the economy
recovers rapidly. But despite the high economic growth seen  this  year,  the
unemployment  rate has not come  down significantly, and workers' pay has not
increased much, either.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, the government has recently put forward plans that
are aimed at helping low-income citizens buy or rent homes. But these plans have
been criticized for their poor feasibility.</P>
      <P>The idea to build affordable housing in places far away from Taipei City, for
example, is believed to be very unfair to poor people.</P>
      <P>The fundamental objective of the government's housing policy should be to
prevent an unreasonable rise in housing prices and a potential  housing bubble.</P>
      <P>The government, for instance, should reject advertisements run deliberately by
private developers to fuel consumer expectations of further spikes in housing
prices. Only that and other actions will convince the people that it is
determined to stabilize prices in the residential real estate market. (Editorial

      <P>At an annual conference for ethnic Chinese business leaders held in Taipei
Monday, Chen Charng-ven, president of the Red Cross Society of the Republic of
China, expressed hope that President Ma Ying-jeou could attend the 2011 or 2012
conference to be held in Beijing or Shanghai and meet his Chinese counterpart Hu
Jintao.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that if Ma is not able to meet Hu within the next two years, he
hoped that Ma would continue to be president after 2012.</P>
      <P>It is hard to believe that a lawyer would make such a comment, which runs
counter to the common sense of democracy.</P>
      <P>There are many people in Taiwan who adore Chinese officials, and they often like
to compare who has met the more senior Chinese officials. Chinese leaders are
well aware of the vanity of the Taiwanese and are using the issue as a tool to
control and divide them.</P>
      <P>Should Ma feel depressed for failing to meet China's top leader? Should
Taiwanese voters allow him to win a second term just for this reason? What on

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A sharp rise in the number of tourist arrivals  and the anticipated opening to
Chinese tourists not traveling in tour groups has helped fuel a new investment
craze in the local hotel and leisure sector.</P>
      <P>Britain's Intercontinental Hotels Group and Singapore's Hong Leong Group have
launched new investment projects to expand their presence in Taiwan and a number
of other hotel operators are also following suit.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the trend:</P>
      <P>Economic Daily News:</P>
      <P>In a report delivered to the Executive Yuan Monday, the Tourism Bureau said
Taiwan had 4.02 million overseas visitors in the first nine months of this year,
a 27.01 percent rise year-on-year.</P>
      <P>During the period, China overtook Japan to become the largest source of visitors
to Taiwan, with a record 1.193 million Chinese arrivals, a 73.52 percent
increase from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>The bureau attributed the hefty jump to a combination of factors, including
continued  opening  to China,  expansion  of direct cross-strait flight services
and optimism generated by the signing of the bilateral economic cooperation
framework agreement (ECFA) in June.</P>
      <P>Japan fell to a distant second as a source of visitors, with Japanese nationals
making 782,000 visits to Taiwan between January and September.</P>
      <P>Arrivals from Malaysia posted the highest growth of any inbound tourist market
during the period, growing 86 percent to reach 185,000, according to official
statistics.</P>
      <P>To cash in on the boom, Intercontinental Hotels announced Monday that it will
realize its goal of opening at least 10 hotels around Taiwan by 2012.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Coface upgrades Taiwan's country rating</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Coface has raised Taiwan's country rating to A1 from A2 because of the country's
strong economic rebound, the international credit insurance and credit
management service group said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a statement, Coface said Taiwan has benefited from its expansionary  economic
policies put in place after the global financial meltdown and the revival of
growth in China and United States to post 13.71 percent and 12.53 percent growth
rates in the first and second quarters, respectively.</P>
      <P>Although the central bank began tightening its monetary policy in June, Coface
said Taiwan's economy is still expected to grow 7.7 percent in 2010.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has raised its GDP growth forecast for the country to 8.24
percent from the previous estimate of 6.14 percent.</P>
      <P>According to Coface, its country rating, based on economic, financial and
political data, aims to evaluate the average credit risk of companies in a given
country.</P>
      <P>The A1 rating indicates the political and economic situation and business
environment quality are very good with a positive influence on corporate payment
behavior, and as a result, average corporate default probability is very low.</P>
      <P>Coface said progress has been made on financial cooperation across the Taiwan
Strait, including the opening of the local bourse to Chinese investors and
giving financial institutions easier access to each other's markets.</P>
      <P>"This trend is expected to continue in 2010-2011 with the conclusion of the
Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) in June 2010," said Richard
Burton, regional managing director, Coface's Greater China division.</P>
      <P>Coface said Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves are likely to remain "very high"
in 2010 to protect the island from a foreign currency liquidity crisis.</P>
      <P>At the end of September, the island's foreign exchange reserves rose for the
23rd consecutive month to reach a record high of US$380.51 billion.</P>
      <P>"Under this favorable economic condition, corporate payment behavior in Taiwan
is expected to improve," Burton said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Coface has also raised Hong Kong's country rating to A1 from A2,
while leaving the rating on China unchanged at A3.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said Tuesday it was not aware of a
reported "secret deal" between China and Japan on the disputed Tiaoyutai
Islands, but confirmed that it was gathering information on the matter.</P>
      <P>The ministry has instructed its office in Japan to follow-up on the report that
Japan had an agreement with China on the islets as early as 2004, said Huang
Ming-lung, secretary-general of the Association  of East Asian Relations,  which
is in charge of Taiwan-Japan ties.</P>
      <P>"We have not heard of the deal but we're now investigating and trying to gather
information, " he said of the report, which appeared in the Japanese weekly
magazine AERA, published by Asahi Shimbun newspaper.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutai Islands, which lie about 100 nautical miles off Taiwan's
northeastern tip in the East China Sea, are controlled by Japan and claimed by
China and Taiwan. They are known as the Diaoyu Islands in China and Senkaku
Islands in Japan.</P>
      <P>According to the magazine report, Japan and China agreed in principle following
a conflict in 2004 that China should keep activists from sailing out to the
islands and that Japan would not detain those who land on the islets.</P>
      <P>But if the agreement between Japan and China does exist as reported, it was
still not able to prevent a recent skirmish in the area.</P>
      <P>Japan arrested a Chinese fishing boat skipper after his trawler collided with
two Japanese Coast Guard vessels on Sept. 7. The incident led to a diplomatic
row between the two countries, and the United States also became involved.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Foreign Ministry took a long-term view of the Tiaoyutai dispute
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The Tiaoyutai issue is not an issue that can be solved immediately, but we
believe that its impact on Taiwan-Japan relations will be limited. And I assure
you that Taiwan will not cooperate with China on handling the issue, " Huang
said in response to a reporter's question at a press briefing.</P>

      <P>Robots could be beneficial to both industry and an ageing society, Vice
President Vincent Siew said Tuesday at the opening of a robot show in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Sixty-six companies and research institutions mounted a total of 296 booths

International Robot Show (TIROS), which runs through Friday.</P>
      <P>In his opening remarks, Siew said robots could bring about breakthroughs in life

enhance competitiveness," he said.</P>
      <P>"Robots can also be used in the service industry, such as in the medical-care
sector, especially when the population is ageing, " Siew added.</P>
      <P>He predicted that robots would likely help precision machinery become Taiwan's
third largest industry after semiconductors and flat panels, with output valued
at more than NT$1 trillion (US$32.5 billion) per annum.</P>

      <P>TPK Holding Co. Ltd., a China-based touch panel technology application provider,
is scheduled to list on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSWE) Oct. 29, the TSWE said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The stock exchange said TPK is expected to become the second foreign company to
launch a primary listing on the local main board after U.S.-based integrated
circuit designer Integrated Memory Logic made its debut in May.</P>
      <P>According to the company's prospectus, TPK, founded in 2005 and capitalized at
NT$1.96 billion (US$63.61 million) , intends to issue 28 million new shares, of
which 4.2 million will be reserved for company employees and the remaining 23.8
million will be sold to the public.</P>
      <P>Underwriter Yuanta Securities said the indicative range of the listing price is
set at NT$200 to NT$220 and the share sale is expected to raise up to NT$6.16

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.17 percent in thin trading Tuesday as profit
taking continued to drag down old economy stocks despite a rally on Wall Street
overnight, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 14.31 points to 8,046.23, after moving between 8,018.31
and 8,074.68, on turnover of NT$87.74 billion (US$2.84 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 0.19 percent and remained weak throughout the session as
investors ignored Wall Street's rise and continued to pocket the strong gains
recently posted by non-high-tech firms, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,294 stocks closed down and 1,274 finished down, with 369 stocks
remaining unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector saw the biggest drop, falling 1.42 percent. Textile
shares fell 1.12 percent, foodstuff shed 1.02 percent, cement stocks dropped
0.95 percent, and plastics and chemical shares closed down 0.43 percent.</P>
      <P>The financial sector fell 0.13 percent, while construction stocks gained 0.62
percent, and machinery and electronics shares rose 0.08 percent.</P>
      <P>"After Monday's steep fall, market sentiment has turned very cautious, "
MasterLink Securities analyst Tom Tang said. "Investors, therefore, tended to
leave a higher Wall Street behind."</P>
      <P>The reduced turnover was evidence that many investors have been pushed to the
sidelines by the gloomy mood.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the local bourse fell 1.76 percent amid heavy selling in large cap
stocks and semiconductor firms.</P>
      <P>Tang said selling focused on the old economy sector Tuesday, while the high-tech
sector failed to stage a meaningful rebound to boost the broader market.</P>
      <P>"The market has become technically weaker after Monday's hit. Further selling is
very likely and a fall below the key 8,000 point level is just a matter of
time," Tang said.</P>
      <P>Among old economy stocks, Taiwan Pulp and Paper fell 3.05 percent to NT$17.50
and textile maker Far Eastern New Century lost 1.56 percent to NT$44.10.</P>
      <P>In the high-tech sector, smartphone maker HTC gained 2.40 percent to NT$639.00,

      <P>Since the Taiwan Fund for Children and Families (TFCF) opened its first overseas
branch in Mongolia in 2004, positive results have been achieved in helping
poverty-stricken children and families there escape their plight.</P>
      <P>In a recent review of its activities in the central Asian country, the TFCF said
it had provided aid to over 6,000 poor children  and helped more than 1,000
Mongolian  children from impoverished families become self-reliant.</P>
      <P>As might be expected, the charity organization's operation in Mongolia differs
markedly from its set-up in Taiwan and goes beyond simply providing financial
assistance to needy children, said Hsieh Yi-ju, the TFCF worker responsible for
the aid-to-Mongolia program, on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The organization there has worked with the local government to build traditional
shelters, or "yurts, " a water supply station, a kindergarten, and a shelter
"village" for homeless single-parent families.</P>
      <P>In the village, "we have not just provided financial aid but also offered
counseling services and vocational training," Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>At its peak, the village sheltered 20 households, but under TFCF's guidance,
five of the families have been able to move out after gaining the skills needed
to maintain their own home and support themselves, Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>One of them, led by a single mother named Chi Chi Ke, moved into the TFCF
shelter village in 2007. But thanks to the skills she learned in the village,
she was able to secure a job and build a yurt for her family in Ulan Bator, and
moved out of the village this year.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said Chi Chi Ke told the charity organization that "TFCF helped her
discover self-confidence and see the future."</P>
      <P>The TFCF operates 23 branches, 29 service offices, three shelters for the
physically and mentally challenged, and eight shelters for children and
teenagers around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Since it opened its first family-style orphanage in Taiwan in 1950, it has
helped more than 230,000 poor children at home and abroad with different
sponsorship programs, according to the TFCF.</P>

Strategic Studies.</P>
      <P>Huang's comments came during a discussion that followed a live webcast that
featured the United States Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman and was hosted by
the U.S.-based National Committee on U.S.-China Relations. Local scholars,
journalists and business leaders were invited to the Taipei discussion by the
local American Chamber of Commerce, which organized the event.</P>
      <P>Huang predicted this new generation would be tough in its negotiations with
Taiwan and the U.S., because they grew up in the era of Red Guards and the
Cultural Revolution, and had experienced posts at different levels of government
before taking on greater responsibility.</P>
      <P>This was a different picture from that in Taiwan, which was characterized by a
shorter career span for government officials, especially at Cabinet level, Huang
said. He predicted that Taiwan's next president would probably be one of the
five special municipality mayors who would be elected in November.</P>
      <P>Huang said he was not against a democratic system, but worried that Taiwan's
future leaders could lack the time and experience needed to train them to a
higher level.</P>
      <P>Speaking  at  the  same  occasion,  Bruce  J.D.  Linghu, director-general of the
Department of North American Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said he
was optimistic about the quality of Taiwan's leaders.</P>
      <P>"The current leaders are highly-educated and full of democratic ideas. I believe
they will have no problems dealing with their rivals across the strait. But for
the next generation of leaders, I'm not quite sure, " Linghu said.</P>
      <P>In the 45-minute webcast, Huntsman talked about various issues including the
strategic mistrust and potential currency war between the U.S. and China, as
well as U.S. concern for Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo's well-being.</P>

      <P>Officials of BH Global Marine Ltd, a Singapore-based marine electrical product
provider, said Tuesday that the company was scheduled to list its Taiwan
depositary receipts (TDRs) on the Taiwan Stock Exchange the following day.</P>
      <P>In an investor conference held in Taipei, the company said the listing price has
been set at NT$17 (US$0.55).</P>
      <P>For the listing, BH Marine said, it has issued 30 million TDRs to raise NT$510
million and the sale has received a warm welcome from Taiwanese  investors  with
the security  more than four times oversubscribed.</P>
      <P>One TDR represents two of BH Marine's common shares, the company said.</P>
      <P>BH Marine will be the fourth Singapore-listed company to list TDRs on the local
bourse so far this year after Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) Ltd., instant
coffee maker Super Group Ltd. and textile firm China Taisan Technology Group
Holdings Ltd.</P>
      <P>The company, which provides marine electrical equipment and marine consumables
to the shipbuilding, ship repair, petrochemical, and offshore oil and gas
industries, has been listed on the Singapore Exchange since 2005, with market
capitalization worth about US$100 million.</P>
      <P>Company CEO Vincent Lim said the proceeds of the TDR sale will be used to invest
in a galvanized steel firm in Oman, while some funds will be also set aside for
bank loan repayments.</P>
      <P>The investment in Oman will total US$10 million, Lim said.</P>
      <P>The Middle East galvanized steel firm, which will churn out materials to produce
covers for marine cables, is expected to start operations at the end of next
year, he added.</P>
      <P>Lim said he has high hopes that the TDR listing will enhance the value of the
company's shares, as the Taiwan stock market enjoys higher valuation than its
counterpart in Singapore.</P>

      <P>China Steel Corp., Taiwan's largest steel maker, said Tuesday that it plans to
acquire a 5 percent stake in Dongbu Metal Co. Ltd. of South Korea for 47.80
billion Korean won (NT$1.33 billion).</P>
      <P>The board of directors has approved the investment project and both sides will
enter into talks to iron out further details of the acquisition, China Steel
said.</P>
      <P>"China Steel aims to stabilize the supply of ferroalloy, one of the important
ingredients  in steel production,  through  the investment, " China Steel Vice
Chairman L.M. Chung told CNA.</P>
      <P>Ferroalloy is the main product of Dongbu Metal, and the Korean company has
supplied the material to China Steel for about two decades, according to Chung.</P>
      <P>"The investment is a kind of strategic alliance for both companies," Chung said.</P>
      <P>Dongbu Metal, part of the Dongbu Group conglomerate, which includes metal
production, agriculture, electronics, construction and trade, is the largest
ferroalloy maker in South Korea.</P>
      <P>Chung said it is the first time China Steel has acquired a stake in the South
Korean metal sector.</P>
      <P>Grand Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu said the acquisition shows that China
Steel has engaged in vertical business integration by stepping into the upstream
sector, in particular in value-added materials such as ferroalloy.</P>
      <P>"The investment  also indicates  that China Steel  remains optimistic about the
outlook for the global steel business, " Hsu said.</P>

      <P>Vice Premier Sean C. Chen said Tuesday that Taiwan should put more emphasis on
developing the service industry to benefit more people.</P>
      <P>Chen said the country's past economic development  can be attributed to the
labor-intensive industries, to which many people contributed labor and in return
shared the benefits.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has recorded shining economic growth recently, mainly from its highly
developed technology- and capital-intensive industries, which benefit mostly
those who provide either capital or technology, rather than people who can offer
only labor.</P>
      <P>Taiwan chalked up second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 12.53
percent, and its 2010 GDP growth is forecast by the Chung Hua Institution for
Economic Research at 8.15 percent.</P>
      <P>However, the gap between rich and poor has been widening, and according to
figures released by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics
Aug. 20, the average income of the richest 20 percent of the population was 8.22
times that of the lowest income group in 2009, representing a record high.</P>
      <P>"A cure for the problem is for the country to adjust its economic structure,
with the service industry -- which can create many jobs -- being the priority, "
Chen said in a speech delivered at the 8th Annual Global Views Business Forum
held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>He put forward the idea of "SMILE" -- service, market, innovalue, life and
economy -- as the focus of Taiwan's future economic development.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives of taxi associations and taxi drivers' unions around Taiwan
accused the government Tuesday of breaking promises after the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA) announced that it will withdraw subsidies for
hybrid vehicles next year.</P>
      <P>They said the government launched the subsidy program in 2008 when former
President Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party was in power, to
encourage people to purchase or remodel their vehicles into "gasoline-liquefied
petroleum gas (LPG) hybrids" to save energy and cut carbon emissions.</P>
      <P>At that time, the government also promised to build 150 gas stations supplying
the much-cheaper liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuel around the country within
five years as an incentive to attract drivers to run hybrids.</P>
      <P>It also set a goal of raising the number of hybrid vehicles to 150,000 units in
a five-year period, they said.</P>
      <P>"However, there are now only 41 LPG refueling stations, not even close to 30
percent" of the stated goal, said Chen Teng, chairman of the National Federation
of Taxi Associations.</P>
      <P>"Most taxi drivers are so poor, they will not be able to survive any longer. The
decision to withdraw the subsidies will force them to commit suicide, " Chen
said.</P>
      <P>The government subsidy gives taxi drivers NT$2 per liter of LPG fuel.</P>
      <P>According to federation statistics, there are currently 89,708 yellow cabs in
Taiwan, 22,000 of which are hybrids.</P>
      <P>Ting Ping-ho, an executive of the Taipei City Taxi Drivers' Association,
complained of a high vacancy rate of cabs in the capital. "Taxi drivers are
suffering from low incomes," he lamented.</P>
      <P>According to the state-run CPC Corp., Taiwan, the largest gasoline and fuel
supplier in the country, the LGP price currently stands at NT$19.7 per liter,
considerably less than the cost of gasoline.</P>
      <P>The NT$2 subsidy helps the drivers,  said Legislator Ting Shou-chung of the
ruling Kuomintang, who accompanied the protesters during a coordination meeting
with EPA officials held at the Legislative Yuan earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>"Although it was the policy of the previous government, the current government
is obliged to maintain it," Ting said, noting that neighboring countries like
Japan and South Korea have promoted hybrid vehicles for many years.</P>
      <P>In the coordination meeting, EPA Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen promised to
study the problem with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which is the authority
responsible for matters concerning the construction of LPG stations.</P>

      <P>Acer Inc. Chairman J.T. Wang said Tuesday he would discuss business with Intel
Corp. chief executive Paul Otellini on Oct. 28 during the latter's visit to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We have cooperated many times with Intel. As a very important client to Intel,
we will discuss business affairs during his one or two-day stay," Wang told
reporters after speaking at an international forum in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that he will meet Otellini on behalf of Acer, the world's second
largest PC vendor, and not of the Taipei Computer Association, a promoter for
WiMAX in Taiwan, for which he also serves as chairman.</P>
      <P>Asked if Intel was reducing its support for WiMAX -- an advanced wireless
broadband technology -- Wang said he had recommended Intel increase its
cooperation with Taiwanese companies, since strong consumer demand for wireless
broadband meant the technology had favorable prospects.</P>
      <P>Otellini's visit is highly anticipated in Taiwan following Intel's  closure of
its WiMAX Program Office in June sparked speculation,  including  Wang's serious
concern,  that it was withdrawing support for the broadband wireless technology

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Supreme Court of Singapore ruled Tuesday in favor of a request from Taiwan
to retrieve a total of US$29.8 million embezzled by two middlemen and kept in a
Singapore bank account following a 2006 scam.</P>
      <P>In the fraud case, the Taiwanese authorities were persuaded by the two men to
part with the cash in return for supposed diplomatic relations with Papua New
Guinea (PNG).</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) under the administration of former
President Chen Shui-bian wired the money to an account at Singapore's OCBC Bank
jointly held by the two brokers, Ching Chi-ju, a Taiwanese with an American
passport,  and Wu Shih-Tsai,  a Singaporean, as funds in return for forging
diplomatic relations between Taiwan and PNG.</P>
      <P>The MOFA asked Wu and Ching for a statement of account in early 2008 after
finding that as of Dec. 1, 2006, the money in the joint account had disappeared
without any progress having been made on the initiative with PNG.</P>
      <P>Wu, without knowing that the MOFA was already aware of the fraud, produced a
false bank statement from his own notebook computer and gave it to the ministry.</P>
      <P>He was arrested by the Taiwanese authorities when the scandal came to light at
the end of President Chen Shui-bian's second term in 2008, but Ching managed to
flee to the United States.</P>
      <P>Wu was sentenced to 28 months in jail by a Taiwanese court late that year for
making a false bank statement, and is now serving his time in a Taipei prison.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry filed a civil suit with the Singapore Supreme Court via
Taiwan's representative office in 2008 against Wu and Ching, demanding repayment
of the sum in full.</P>
      <P>In a previous ruling handed down in May, the court said Taiwan is entitled to
recover all the funds illegally kept by the two brokers, but it allowed the
defendants to appeal.</P>
      <P>Chen Shou-han, a division chief with the MOFA's Department of Treaty and Legal
Affairs who represented the ministry at the court session, praised the ruling as
"belated justice" and said his ministry will do its best to make sure all the
stolen funds are returned to the national coffers.</P>
      <P>So far, about US$6 million of the total has been retrieved, including properties
bought by Wu in Taipei.</P>

      <P>The Brother Elephants shut out the Sinon Bulls 3-0 Tuesday in game three of the
2010 Taiwan Series of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) in the
northern city of Taoyuan to move within one win away from its seventh title and
a new record.</P>
      <P>The Elephants, which lost its manager and almost half of its players to a major
game-fixing scandal that came to light in October last year, could wrap up the
best-of-seven series as early as Wednesday night, when game four is played in
Sinjhuang City, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>A title win would be a special one for first-year manager Chen Jui-chen  and his
team,  which consists  mainly of young and inexperienced players brought on
board after the scandal last year. At one point, owner Hung Jui-ho said that he
was considering whether to disband the team.</P>
      <P>Starting pitcher Orlando Roman shut out the Bulls in nine strong innings with
seven strikeouts and allowed only three hits.</P>
      <P>Yeh Chun-chang, who played for Sinon for 10 years before being released in 2009,
had an RBI (runner batted in) single in the bottom of the third inning as Chang
Chih-hao, who had a double in the previous at-bat, scored.</P>
      <P>The Elephants added three hits, including Huang Shih-hao's triple to the
centerfield in the bottom of the eighth.</P>
      <P>Arguably the most storied franchise in the four-team CPBL, the Elephants is
making its third straight run at the title after losing in 2008 and 2009, both

    <HEADLINE>Rice wine issue is matter of Taiwan's credibility: ECCT</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan must follow the international standards that it has previously agreed to,
such as those it agreed to in the case of rice wine, if it wants to become a
bigger international player, the European Chamber of Commerce Taipei (ECCT) said
Thursday upon the release of its annual position paper.</P>
      <P>The European Union and the U.S. objected strongly in August to the Legislative
Yuan's approval to reclassify rice wine from a distilled spirit to a common
cooking ingredient, describing the move as a direct violation of World Trade
Organization (WTO) standards.</P>
      <P>The move will greatly reduce the tax on a 0.6 liter bottle from NT$29.25
(US$0.96)  to N$5.4 and according to the ECCT,  the legislature's decision
undermines the positive perception of Taiwan internationally and reduces the
European business community's desire for increased trade and economic links with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>ECCT committee members said the matter goes beyond merely the price of rice wine
and that its backtracking on WTO obligations rather shows Taiwan's credibility
and accountability as a global trading partner.</P>
      <P>"If we want to be an international player... there are certain rules and
regulations that are created and we have to follow those, regardless of whether
you are from the U.S., Japan, or Taiwan, " said ECCT Chairman Peter Weiss.</P>
      <P>The group also made other suggestions in the 211-page paper, such as forging a
Trade Enhancement Measure (TEM) with the European Union, improving the country's
English environment,  normalizing trade relations with China,  strengthening
trademark protection  and discouraging a Luxury Tax, which the ECCT believes
will adversely affect the foreign car market in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the ECCT suggested that both sides could explore interim
measures based on mutual interests, such as more effective implementation of
government procurement agreements, investment flows and standards.</P>
      <P>Taiwan should also show more goodwill by removing Taiwan-only standards and
adopting best international trading practices, it added.</P>
      <P>The group's Pharmaceutical Committee said that as Taiwan is mulling a revamp of
its national health coverage system, it should also stop its policy of lowering
foreign-made drug prices before international pharmaceutical companies decide to
pull out of the country altogether.</P>
      <P>The group also raised concerns over Taiwan's  Intellectual Property Court,
questioning its fairness.  Many trademarks of international brand names are
still commonly used by local businesses such as hotels, KTVs and even betel nut
stands, the committee said.</P>
      <P>On Taiwan-China trade relations, the ECCT, while applauding the cross-strait
economic cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) signed this June, continued to
urge Taiwan to fully normalize trade relations with China by lifting its import
ban on over 2,000 Chinese manufactured products.</P>
      <P>The ban, said the group, has "diminished the willingness of multinational
corporations to maintain or increase their investments in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>In response, Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman
Christina Liu thanked the ECCT for the suggestions and said the central
government will encourage various agencies to speed up the adoption of
international standards.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the country is stepping up efforts to bolster trade links with the
international community, including re-examining the option of opening its doors
wider to more Chinese goods, under the condition that Taiwan's national security
remains unaffected.</P>
      <P>According to the CEPD, the EU is Taiwan's fourth-largest trading partner.</P>

      <P>A hybrid rocket designed and developed by National Cheng Kung University (NCKU)
was launched recently, the university in Tainan, southern Taiwan announced
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chao Yei-chin, director of the university's Aerospace Science and Technology
Research Center and head of the research team, said the rocket was launched Oct.
13 from a beach area of Mudan Township in Pingtung County, also in the south of
the county.</P>
      <P>Chao said the 68-kg rocket reached an altitude of 8,000 meters and had a flight
duration from take-off to disappearing from the remote tracking sensors of about
90 seconds.</P>
      <P>"Our team will next challenge the altitude of 100 kilometers, " with the aim of
exploring the lower thermosphere, Chao said, adding that he expects the goal to
be reached in three to five years.</P>
      <P>He said the concept of the hybrid rocket originated around 1930 and that the
first successful launch took place in 1994, followed by subsequent research and
development and launches of hybrid rockets by many universities, including
Stanford University in the United States, Hokkaido University of Japan, and the
College of Aerospace Engineering at Beijing University of Aeronautics and
Astronautics.</P>
      <P>NCKU is the first to conduct research and development of a hybrid rocket system
in Taiwan. A 30 kg hybrid rocket was launched by NCKU in May 2009.</P>
      <P>NCKU President Michael Ming-Chiao Lao said the successful launch of the rocket,
entirely designed and manufactured by the university, is a "significant moment"
in the school's history.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the cost of rocket manufacturing is low -- a mere
NT$300,000 (US$9,710) -- in comparison to military rockets or space exploration
rockets, which cost millions of dollars each.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taking care of the elderly is more complicated than most people imagine.
Nevertheless, Taiwan's government must avoid writing a blank check for the long-
term care insurance scheme set for introduction in 2011 by improving both
software and hardware infrastructures.</P>
      <P>Public attention has focused on the issue of how senior citizens are cared for
since elderly residents were left for hours up to their chests in water at a
care facility in Kaohsiung County last month when Typhoon Fanapi caused serious
flooding.</P>
      <P>There were two reasons that care institutions of such poor quality could remain
in business, suggested Tsai Yi-hsuan, head of the Mennonite Social Welfare
Foundation's southern service center.</P>
      <P>First, although Taiwan had sufficient care facilities in total, their
distribution was uneven, Tsai said. A poor quality establishment would still be
able to attract people if it was the only care facility in its region.</P>
      <P>Second, competition on price could lead to the cutting of staff and hence to
worsening conditions.</P>
      <P>But care homes are not the only option for taking care of the elderly. In fact,
of Taiwan's 2.47 million people aged over 65, only 41,000 of them stay in
institutions, according to statistics announced by the Ministry of the Interior
for the end of June.</P>
      <P>Facing an estimated rise in over-65s to around one-fifth of the total population
by 2025, the government began a 10-year plan on long-term care in 2007, said
Huang Pi-hsia, director-general of the ministry's Department of Social Affairs,</P>
      <P>This plan budgets NT$81.7 billion (US$2.64 billion) for non-governmental
organizations to provide care services to communities and homes where seniors
can maintain normal lives.</P>
      <P>In order to improve long-term care, the government has plans for a new insurance
system, similar to the current National Health Insurance scheme, in which young
people will pay a premium so as to enjoy care services at a reasonable price in
their old age.</P>
      <P>But experts are also worried at the insufficiency of care providers and
organizations, and about the system needed to deliver welfare services.</P>
      <P>Although government figures claim there are over 62,000 trained caregivers, Tsai
said that only 16,000 were actually providing care services. She believed this
was because Taiwan's foreign-worker policy was too open.</P>
      <P>The lower pay given to foreign workers, and some employers' expectations that
caregivers should help with domestic chores were both factors influencing
trained caregivers from taking up jobs.</P>
      <P>In facing the issue of Taiwan's aging society, the government cannot just rely
on the proposed insurance scheme but should try to resolve these other problems
hindering the development of long-term care.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping was recently named vice chairman of the
Central Military Commission, which confirmed his status as the country's next
leader after Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>A true challenge faced by China's fifth-generation leadership will be its
people's  demand for freedom and democracy.  The presentation of the 2010 Nobel
Peace Prize to jailed human rights activist Liu Xiaobo is only one of the signs.</P>
      <P>On the diplomatic front, China's faces a currency war with the United States and
territorial disputes with other countries in the region. How China is going to
deal with other world superpowers will be another challenge that the country's
new leaders will not be able to avoid.</P>
      <P>The establishment of a system for leadership succession in China signifies  that
there  is an institutionalized  decision-making mechanism. Major policies,
including those related to Taiwan, will be the result of collective decision-
making by the Central Politburo.</P>
      <P>To predict the future direction of China's policy toward Taiwan, Taiwan should
study the overall background of the new leadership, instead of focusing on Xi's
personal traits and leadership style alone.</P>
      <P>We must also not overlook the possibility that Hu, who might want to leave
behind a legacy, will remain the prime mover behind cross-Taiwan Strait
relations during the final years of his tenure.</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Decriminalizing the sex trade</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/20/10  11:27:39
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of the Interior recently unveiled a plan to decriminalize the adult
sex trade. It was reported that the ministry would permit residence-based sex
services offered by self-employed sex workers.</P>
      <P>To the general public, the greatest concern is not whether prostitution should
be banned or whether the rights of sex workers are protected, but whether the
communities they are living in are invaded by the sex industry. It would be too
naive to think that Taiwan's problem can be resolved by randomly introducing a
new model from other countries.</P>
      <P>Despite the obvious existence of rampant, illegal sex businesses in Taiwan, the
government has done nothing about it. The public is justified, therefore, in
worrying that the opening of residence-based sex services would allow the sex
industry to spread like wildfire around the country.</P>
      <P>The government's top priority now should be to remove legal discrimination
against sex workers. It should also take action to show its ability to crack
down on underground human trafficking rings to allow sex workers to enjoy true
autonomy. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 20, 2010)</P>

      <P>The Taiwan dollar weakened against the U.S. dollar in Wednesday morning trading
after China's surprise move to raise its benchmark interest rates on Tuesday,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>At 10:45 a.m., the Taiwan dollar traded at NT$30.933 to the U.S. dollar,
compared with Thursday's close of NT$30.900.</P>
      <P>The People's Bank of China raised its deposit and lending rates for the first
time in 3 years Tuesday, a move intended to curb inflation and prevent an asset-
price bubble, especially in the property market.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan dollar opened lower against the U.S. dollar and was unable to rebound
early as foreign banks rushed to restore their U.S. dollar positions after
recent massive selling of the greenback, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The U.S. dollar had appeared stronger against the Taiwan dollar in recent
trading sessions as traders pocketed profits from strong gains posted by the
local currency, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The interest rate hikes in China have further boosted buying in the greenback,
they added.</P>
      <P>Dealers said there have been concerns that other central banks in the region
will follow China's step to tighten monetary policies to prevent rapid
appreciation of their currencies against the U.S. dollar.</P>
      <P>They said the Taiwan dollar is expected to move within a narrow range of
NT$30.90 to NT$31.00 against the U.S. dollar for the rest of the trading session

      <P>All of Taiwan is expected to get rain on Wednesday, with Taipei and Yilan
counties especially hard hit, as Typhoon Megi edges north after battering the
northern Philippines, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said.</P>
      <P>As of 8 a.m., Megi was located 640 kilometers south-southwest of Eluanbi, the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, moving north-northwest at a speed of 7 kilometers
per hour.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Two banks to supply Chinese yuan banknotes from Oct. 26</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CAN)
10/20/10  13:29:40
(By Tien Yu-pin and Frances Huang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Bank of Taiwan (BOT) and Mega International Commercial Bank will begin to
directly supply Chinese yuan bank notes from Oct. 26, a move expected to lower
foreign exchange costs and supply the currency more cheaply to banks and
consumers, the banks said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The two banks began to take orders  placed  by financial institutions on
Wednesday and will negotiate the purchase of the yuan with the Hong Kong branch
of Beijing-based Bank of China (BOC), they said.</P>
      <P>The state-run BOT and partially government-owned Mega Bank signed cash
settlement agreements with BOC's Hong Kong branch in July that made them the
first two domestic banks able to supply Chinese yuan banknotes to Taiwanese
customers.</P>
      <P>The move by the two banks to take the orders came after Taiwan's central bank
approved their applications to provide Chinese yuan cash settlement services in
collaboration with the BOC's Hong Kong arm.</P>
      <P>In the past, local financial institutions had to go through HSBC and Bank of
America to get Chinese yuan notes, but the supply from the two foreign banks was
not very stable, the banknotes were often old, and the cost of procuring the
banknotes was relatively high.</P>
      <P>Local buyers will now be able to place their orders for Chinese yuan banknotes
with BOT and Mega Bank once a week and are expected to get the notes they need a
week later, according to the two banks.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, BOT and Mega Bank were quoting a reference price for Chinese yuan
banknotes of about NT$4.8 per Chinese yuan. The two banks said the actual rate
used in final transactions will depend on negotiations with BOC's Hong Kong
branch based on supply and demand.</P>
      <P>The banks believed, however, that the Chinese currency is expected to become
cheaper than before.</P>
      <P>Based on Wednesday's cross exchange rates, the NT$4.8 quoted by the two banks
represents a relative high 3.5 percent mark-up against the two currencies actual
values, which partly reflects the high currency settlement costs.</P>
      <P>The central bank said previously that the new settlement services would have
three advantages: new yuan notes, cheap exchange costs and a stable supply.</P>
      <P>The central bank had also estimated the direct supply could lead to savings of
about NT$1,000 on every procurement of 20,000 Chinese yuan.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou twice denied Tuesday that he has any intention to meet
his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao, anytime soon.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question by some foreign-based ethnic Chinese business
executives about the timing for a "Ma-Hu meeting, " the president said there is
"no hurry" for such a meeting.</P>
      <P>"The government's policy toward cross-Taiwan Strait relations is 'economy first,
politics later, '" Ma told the executives at the Presidential Office. "Until all
major cross-strait economic issues are resolved, it's better not to meet than to
meet."</P>
      <P>Later that day, Ma called an emergency news conference to clarify an Associated
Press report that suggested Ma plans to launch a formal political dialogue with
China if he wins re-election in 2012.</P>
      <P>"I never made any connection between my second term and political issues, " Ma
said at the mews conference held at Taipei International Airport upon his return
from a community outreach visit to the southern city of Tainan.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>According to an AP report Tuesday, Ma said in an interview with the news agency
that he is open to a political dialogue with China once remaining economic
issues are resolved, though he gave no timetable for when those discussions
might start.</P>
      <P>In between the poles of union and separation, the AP report quoted Ma as saying
that his government is prepared to discuss political agreements, including
security issues, as soon as the priority economic issues are dealt with.</P>
      <P>"He suggested that those political talks could start as early as a second four-
year term if he wins re-election in 2012, " the AP report said.</P>
      <P>Ma said, however, that he did not mention any time frame in his interview with
the AP.</P>
      <P>When asked if he would move to political talks in a second term once economic
issues are dealt with, Ma said he just responded: "It depends on how fast we
move."</P>
      <P>"I did not mention anything about 2012," Ma contended.</P>
      <P>The Presidential Office asked the AP to correct its report, but the agency only
filed a backgrounder in response instead of deleting the paragraph reading, "his
government is prepared to discuss political agreements, including security
issues" as requested by the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang later expressed regret and voiced a
protest against the AP report. (Oct. 20, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Ma clarified at the hastily called news conference that he neither mentioned
"political dialogue" or any "timetable" in his interview with the AP.</P>
      <P>The president stressed that "economy first, politics later" has been and
consistently remains the crux of his administration's cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>Although some pundits have urged his government to speed up engagement with
China, Ma said he sees no need to do so because the current pace is appropriate.</P>
      <P>"Our cross-strait policy should meet our national needs, win public support and
proceed under legislative supervision, " he added. (Oct. 20, 2010).</P>

      <P>The Control Yuan impeached two senior judges Wednesday for allegedly  lobbying
other judges to rule favorably in a case involving one of the accused's family
members.</P>
      <P>The body, the branch of government that monitors the behavior of government
officials and civil servants, impeached Supreme Court judge Hsiao Yang-kuei by a
vote of 12-1 and High Court judge Kao Ming-che by a vote of 11-2, said Control
Yuan Minister without Portfolio Lee Fu-dien.</P>
      <P>The two judges were found to have lobbied other judges illegally and violated
laws regulating public servants and the judges' code of conduct, in the process
"damaging the image of justice," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Following the Control Yuan's decision, Hsiao and Kao will be disciplined  by the
Public  Functionary  Disciplinary  Sanction Commission. They had already been
suspended from their posts before the Control Yuan acted on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The case in question involved Hsiao's son, Hsiao Hsien-lun, who was accused of
committing a hit and run in 2008.</P>
      <P>The junior Hsiao was found guilty of the crime and sentenced to six months in
prison and two years of probation by the Keelung District Court.</P>
      <P>The High Court changed the ruling on appeal, however, to "not guilty."</P>
      <P>Citing the results of their investigation, Lee said he found that Hsiao had
attempted to lobby the judges hearing the cases at both the district and high
court levels and that Kao, an old friend of the senior Hsiao, had also lobbied
for a "not guilty" judgment.</P>
      <P>Though the two judges both claimed their innocence, the Control Yuan decided
"not to take that into account, " Lee noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's central bank estimated Wednesday that NT$370 billion in international
hot money is in Taiwan to speculate on the local currency.</P>
      <P>The amount includes NT$120 billion in inward remittances that have not been used
to invest in stocks but remain in transaction accounts, and another NT$250
billion that has been used to purchase two-year government bonds, central bank
Governor Perng Fai-nan told the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee.</P>
      <P>According to Perng, given that the interest rates for two-year government bonds
are lower than those for U.S. dollar deposits, the true purpose of the purchases
is likely to be to speculate on the appreciating Taiwanese currency.</P>
      <P>Perng said the central bank and Financial Supervisory Commission have made an
effort to combat the impact of hot money on Taiwan's currency, including in the
equities market.</P>
      <P>The government, for example, recently forbid foreign investors to use Taiwan
dollars as cash collateral for securities lending and borrowing, allowing only
U.S. dollars to be used for the purpose.</P>
      <P>That has helped decrease the amount of suspected hot money hidden in the sector
from NT$120 billion to NT$60 million, Perng said.</P>
      <P>On China's Tuesday decision to raise its deposit and lending rates by a quarter
point, Perng said he believes the measure will help stabilize China's economy
and reverse its negative real interest rate.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.97 percent Wednesday as bargain hunters emerged
to recoup early losses resulting from China's surprise raising of benchmark
interest rates the previous day, dealers said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's weighted index closed up 78.39 points at 8,124.62 after moving between
7,992.81 and 8,131.19, on turnover of NT$105.06 billion (US$3.41 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 0.66 percent on a reflex response to China's rate hike,
but as investors witnessed a rebound on the Shanghai market, sentiment improved
and they resumed buying, with high-tech stocks particularly favored, dealers
said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,359 stocks closed up, 1,529 fell and 286 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector scored the highest gains, up 1.56 percent.
Plastics and chemical stocks rose 1.2 percent, textile firms gained 1.0 percent,
cement shares closed up 0.56 percent, the construction sector rose 0.31 percent
and the paper and pulp sector added 0.05 percent.</P>
      <P>Fallers included foodstuffs down 0.81 percent and financial stocks down slightly
at 0.09 percent.</P>
      <P>The People's Bank of China Tuesday raised its deposit and lending rates for the
first time in 3 years, a move believed to curb inflation and prevent an asset
bubble.</P>
      <P>Taiwan International Securities analyst Michael Chiang said investors' initial
response showed they feared the rate hike would compromise China's economic
growth.</P>
      <P>"But, as inflation remains a concern in China, the mainland still has room to
tighten its monetary policy," Chiang said, "So, further rate hikes are possible
to attract more foreign funds into China or even into the Asian market."</P>
      <P>"Liquidity is likely to go higher in the long run, as this is one of the things
the stock market likes best," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Electronics looked cheap to investors who wanted to find a safe haven to park
their money, he said, noting that investors resumed buying electronics stocks
which had earlier been hit by fears of falling global demand.</P>
      <P>It remained to be seen, however, whether the electronic sector's strength  would
continue amid the cautious mood ahead of the third-quarter-earnings reports due
to kick off later this month, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>It would not be easy for the bourse to overcome strong technical resistance
ahead of the 8,200-8,300 point range anytime soon, he warned.</P>
      <P>Following recent heavy losses, Smartphone maker HTC rose 5.01 percent to
NT$671.00, and optical lens firm Largan added 5.71 percent to NT$592.00.</P>
      <P>Similarly PC vendor Acer gained 2.68 percent to NT$80.50 and Hon Hai Precision,
the world's largest electronics maker, rose 1.79 percent to NT$114.00.</P>

      <P>The benchmark weighted index closed up 0.97 percent on bargain hunting.</P>
      <P>Dealers said a stronger U.S. dollar has alleviated pressure on the central bank

      <P>The government's plan to build a third terminal at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport aimed to transform the airport into a hub in Asia and to attract more
transit passengers, Minister of Transportation Mao Chi-kuo said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Mao was responding to a question from Legislator Yeh Yi-ching of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party who questioned the need for a third terminal at
Taiwan's main airport, citing a continuous decline in the nation's population.</P>
      <P>The volume of passengers handled by the airport was expected to surpass the
20-million mark this year, Mao told lawmakers on the Legislative Yuan's
transportation committee.</P>
      <P>"If airports in Taiwan only serve local people, they will have no future," he
said. "They must be able to attract transit passengers."</P>
      <P>Mao explained that the ministry was preparing for demand in the year 2018 and
thereafter.</P>
      <P>The government was convinced that the two existing terminals would not be able
to meet the expected surge in demand following the opening last year of
transport links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, he said.</P>
      <P>Asked about the reported budget of NT$60 billion (US$1.9 billion) for the
project, Mao said that sums outlined by the media merely represented the
ministry's rough calculations.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Mao responded to media inquiries by saying the government
had not yet drawn up a budget for the project. Noting that it was still  in an
opinion-collecting  phase,  he said nevertheless that the government hoped
construction of the terminal would be finished by 2018.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, located some 30 kilometers to the south of
Taipei, is one of the country's major international airports and by far the
busiest.</P>

      <P>All newborns aged three days to one month with at least one parent registered as
a Taipei County resident can get a free hearing test at one of the 12 designated
hospitals or clinics located in the county, the county's Public Health Bureau
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Foreign nationals can also enjoy the service as long as one of the newborn's
parents can prove residency in the county, said Chia Shu-li, a section chief at
the bureau.</P>
      <P>Chia said that since Taipei County began offering the service last month, a
total of 998 infants were checked and 22 cases of abnormal hearing detected.</P>
      <P>Studies have shown that one in every 500 newborns will end up needing a hearing
aid during their childhood, but if hearing problems are detected within a
child's first six months of life, many infants can eventually restore their
hearing to a normal level, the bureau said in explaining the rationale behind
the program.</P>
      <P>The 12 medical centers include well-known hospitals such as Far Eastern Memorial
Hospital,  Taipei Medical University Shuang-ho Hospital, Sijhih Cathay General
Hospital, Mackay Hospital Danshui, and Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital Taipei
Branch.</P>
      <P>A detailed list can be found on the Taipei County government's website. Chia

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to set up central command center to curb dengue fever</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A central epidemic command center will be set up this week to stem the spread of
dengue fever as the mosquito-borne disease has been rapidly spreading in the
country, the Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang said at the Legislative Yuan that he and Stephen
S.H. Shen, minister of the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), will
head the command center, which will be set up Thursday exclusively to curb the
spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>The center will also establish ad hoc command centers in Taiwan's southern
counties of Kaohsiung and Tainan, the hardest hit areas, said Chang Feng-yee,
director-general of the DOH's Centers for Disease Control, who was also present
at the Legislative Yuan's Q-and-A session.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH, the number of indigenous cases of the disease rose by 132
last week alone. As of Tuesday, the number of imported cases totaled 138 since
August. From August to date, the total number of indigenous cases has reached
643 nationwide, the DOH said.</P>
      <P>This has led the DOH to speculate that the number of indigenous dengue fever
cases will probably surpass 1,000 this year.</P>
      <P>There is no vaccine for dengue fever. The disease causes severe flu-like
symptoms and has the potential to be fatal.</P>
      <P>Yaung said one of the reasons for the increase in cases in Taiwan is that the
spread of dengue fever has been raging in Southeast Asia this year, indirectly
causing the numbers of both imported and indigenous cases to go up in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Another reason is that some residents have been opposed to health workers
spraying insecticide in their neighborhood, Yaung said.</P>
      <P>"The central epidemic command center will do its best to stem the disease, but I
cannot promise that it will be eradicated once and for all," Yaung said.</P>
      <P>He was responding to questions raised by ruling Kuomintang Legislators Hou Tsai-
feng and Hsu Shao-ping, both of whom criticized the government for not doing a
good enough job in preventing the spread of dengue fever in the past two months.</P>
      <P>Hsu accused the DOH and the EPA of not cooperating with the local governments of
Kaohsiung and Tainan to clean up the environment to facilitate the eradication
of mosquitos.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih reiterated Wednesday that the time was not ripe for a meeting
between the leaders of Taiwan and China, despite their warming ties.</P>
      <P>Before such a meeting could be held, Wu said, a stronger consensus on the issue
needed to be built in Taiwan, and higher levels of goodwill and mutual trust
developed between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"At present, we do not see an opportunity (for such a meeting), " he said while
receiving a delegation of the New York-based Committee of 100, which was in
Taiwan to attend the 8th Global Views Business Forum held Oct. 18-19 in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wu was apparently responding to a proposal raised at the forum by ROC Red Cross
Society President Chen Charng-ven who said the annual event could be a venue for
a meeting between President Ma Ying-jeou and his Chinese counterpart Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>Chen suggested that Ma and Hu could both be invited to the 2011 or 2012 forums,
to be held in Beijing and Shanghai, where they could then meet each other.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, improved relations across the Taiwan Strait were a good sign
for ethnic Chinese around the world, and Taiwan's freedom, democracy and rule of
law were providing an ideal model for China.</P>
      <P>He likened economic development and democratization to a person's two legs,
which should grow at an equal pace to achieve a balanced development.</P>
      <P>Wu said he believed the Chinese leadership was well aware it could not resist
the trends of political reform and opening up, which was the reason Hu had put
forward the goal of constructing a "harmonious society" and Chinese Premier Wen
Jiabao had recently called for political reform.</P>
      <P>During the reception, Wu urged members of the Committee of 100 to help lobby the
U.S. government to approve Taiwan's request to buy F-16 C/D fighters, saying
that such arms procurement was necessary for Taiwan to maintain its self-defense
capabilities.</P>
      <P>The Committee of 100, composed of prominent Chinese Americans, is a group

    <HEADLINE>China's rate hike means end to economic stimulus measures: CEPD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Oct. 20 (CNA)
10/20/10  19:55:31</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tuesday's hike in China's key interest rate would be a prelude to suspension of
its economic stimulus measures, Christina Liu, chairwoman of the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Referring to the rise of 0.25 percentage points in China's benchmark lending
rates, its first increase since onset of the global economic crisis, Liu said
this came as no surprise, given that Beijing had already raised its deposit
reserve ratio several times.</P>
      <P>The rate hike, which included rises to 5.56 percent on a one-year loan and to
2.5 percent on one-year deposits, was aimed at lowering inflation pressure, Liu
said at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's Economic Affairs Committee.</P>
      <P>China experienced an inflation rate of 3.5 percent in August, which exceeded the
3-percent ceiling deemed acceptable by the Beijing authorities, she noted.</P>
      <P>The hike  would  also  mean the beginning  an end to the 4,000-billion-yuan
(US$585 billion) stimulus measures introduced in 2008 to help weather the global
economic crisis, she predicted, calling on Taiwanese businesses operating in
China to better prepare for further withdrawal of the measures.</P>
      <P>For example, Liu said that export-oriented China-based Taiwanese enterprises
should shift their market focus to China instead of the United States or Europe,
and that they should also establish an information-sharing mechanism on China's
domestic market.</P>
      <P>In related news, China's rate hike was described as "healthy" by Central Bank of
the Republic of China (Taiwan) Governor Perng Fai-nan.</P>
      <P>Speaking at Legislative Yuan's Financial Committee meeting, Perng said it would
help maintain a stable economic development for China in the long as well as
middle term.</P>
      <P>Perng declined to say whether China's higher interest rate would influence
Taiwan's stock market. "It's a highly sensitive issue, and I am not in a
position to make any comment," he said.</P>
      <P>Similarly, on whether it would affect Taiwan's monetary policy, Perng said that
policy would be made by the bank's board of directors and supervisors based on
considerations of the domestic and global macroeconomic situation. (By Hsieh

      <P>The Taiwan depositary receipts (TDRs) of BH Global Marine Ltd., a Singapore-
based supplier of marine and offshore electrical products, soared Wednesday on
the first day they were traded on optimism over the global shipping sector,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>BH Global Marine rose 6.76 percent to NT$18.15 (US$0.59) with 84,000 shares
changing hands, while the benchmark weighted index closed up 0.97 percent at
8,124.62.</P>
      <P>The company, which provides marine electrical equipment and marine consumables
to the shipbuilding, ship repair, petrochemical, and offshore oil and gas
industries, has been listed on the Singapore Exchange since 2005.</P>
      <P>"The company is the first marine equipment maker to list its shares on the local
bourse. It appeared unique to investors here, " Grand Cathay Securities analyst
Mars Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"With the rebound in the global shipping business, investors have become more
interested in the stock," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Being based in Singapore also gives the company an advantage, the analyst said,
because the city state's status as a transportation hub makes it an ideal
location for developing marine-related businesses.</P>
      <P>Last year, Singapore accounted for 78 percent of the company's NT$2.4 billion in
total revenue, with other countries in Asia and the Middle East accounting for
the rest.</P>
      <P>The listing price of BH Global Marine's TDRs was set at NT$17, higher than the
previously planned NT$15, after the stock was more than four times
oversubscribed in the underwriting stage.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that because price-earnings ratios in Taiwan's stock market were
generally higher than in Singapore's market, investors here expected that the
price of BH Global Marine's TDRs would climb further.</P>
      <P>"It is possible for the stock to rise an additional 10-15 percent in the short
term as a honeymoon period remains in place, " he said.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih confirmed Wednesday that Indonesia is preparing to offer one
of its islets to Taiwanese businessmen to develop and that discussions have been
underway.</P>
      <P>"The administration is more than willing to help as long as the cooperation
project is Taiwan-centric and good for the people, " Wu said after meeting a
group of outstanding overseas Chinese and Taiwanese business leaders at the
Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>He said that the Indonesian government is preparing to offer the Indonesian
islet of Morotai to Taiwanese businesses and Taiwanese citizens maintaining
business operations in China so they can jointly develop it with the Indonesian
government and local partners.</P>
      <P>"A number of Taiwanese businessmen have visited Morotai and more are planning to
go to explore the co-development offer, " Wu said.</P>
      <P>According to local media reports, the Indonesian government has offered recently
to have Taiwan help develop Morotai, an island with an area of about 2,400
square kilometers and a population of 50,000 people, located between the
Philippines and New Guinea.</P>
      <P>Indonesian officials will come to Taiwan in November for further discussions on
the matter, a local newspaper said.</P>
      <P>A group of Taiwanese businessmen, under the escort of Indonesia's representative
to Taiwan Harmen Sembiring and officials from Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOEA) , embarked on a week-long trip to the underdeveloped island on
Oct. 12 to conduct a preliminary evaluation.</P>
      <P>Indonesia's Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries first made contact with
the MOEA in September about the project when Minister of Economic Affairs Shih
Yen-shiang was in Indonesia at the head of a trade and investment delegation.</P>
      <P>"The Indonesian side hopes to attract Taiwanese investment in the sectors of
seafood production, fishing, aquaculture and tourism, " said Kuo Fu-chuan, a
senior technical specialist in the MOEA's Department of Investment Services.</P>
      <P>Indonesia has also offered state-run CPC Corp. Taiwan and Taiwan Sugar
Corporation the opportunity to establish an oil refinery and develop land,
respectively, in other parts of the country, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Morotai is best known as the site of the Battle of Morotai in World War II in

Foundation of Alzheimers Disease and Related Dementia (CFAD) and Allianz Taiwan
Life Insurance Company said at a press conference that the money raised over a
five-month period had assisted production of "The Long Goodbye" and would also
provide care for elders suffering from dementia.</P>
      <P>The film, which took nearly three years to complete and was directed by Golden
Horse Award winner Yang Li-chou, aimed to help people understand more about
Alzheimer and teach them how to interact with sufferers of the disease.</P>
      <P>A case in point was 96-year-old Eva, one of the film's five main characters,
said Pauline Wang, nursing director of the Alzheimers disease community center
run by CFAD. Eva had taught at the English Department of the National Taiwan

      <P>Seven years ago, at the request of her family, we gave Eva a fake teaching title

      <P>Eva is one of 64 dementia sufferers at the center and one of 120,000 patients

      <P>Clinton, who served as U.S. president from 1993-2001, will arrive in Taiwan for

    <TEXT>
      <P>Thanks to the government's policy of reviving fallow land, the output of young
soybeans -- immature soybeans known as "maodou" in Chinese -- in Sinshih
Township, southern Taiwan's Tainan County has nearly doubled this year from the
previous year, a representative of local farmers said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chao-tang, chief executive of the Sinshih Township Farmers' Association,
said the land area used for young soybean plantation has doubled to 100
hectares. He attributed the growth to the government's subsidies for farmers to
grow crops on fallow land.</P>
      <P>To convince farmers to grow maodou, the association has also taken efforts to
develop new soybean-based products, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He noted that they have successfully developed products like maodou noodles,
maodou ice cream and maodou sauce. The ice cream has turned out to be a big hit
in the local catering market, according to Lee.</P>
      <P>The emerging soybean industry, which helps increase the demand for the crops,
has raised farmers' interests in growing the young soybeans, he added.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Sinshih was once one of the major soybean production areas in
Taiwan since the plantation of the crops began in the years between 1986 and
1988.</P>
      <P>Back in the old days, the soybeans were one of the sources of protein for the
local people. The plantation scale once reached 500-600 hectares in Sinshih, Lee
said.</P>
      <P>Planting of the crop, however, waned many years ago due to the high cost of
harvesting the soybeans by hand and the construction of the Southern Taiwan
Science Park, which turned some farmland into high-tech factories.</P>
      <P>"Young soybean fields had once disappeared in Sinshih" after some farmers would
rather leave their land fallow than grow the soybeans, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Farmers began to grow the soybeans again in recent years, he noted.</P>
      <P>Boiled soybean in the pod is a common dish in Chinese and Japanese restaurants.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Next Chinese leader familiar with Taiwan affairs: NSB chief</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The man in line to be China's next leader was no stranger to Taiwan affairs, but
he was not expected to compromise on any sovereignty- and territory-related
issues, Taiwan's National Security Bureau Director Tsai Teh-sheng said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Xi Jinping, China's vice president who is widely believed to be the anointed
successor to Chinese President Hu Jintao, is known to be versed in Taiwan
affairs as he had extensive contact with Taiwanese businessmen during his years
as communist party boss in Shanghai and the eastern provinces of Fujian and
Zhejiang, all of which have large clusters of Taiwan-owned companies," Tsai said
at a legislative session.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsai said Xi's rich knowledge about Taiwan would not necessarily
make him a "Taiwan-friendly" leader after he took power.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Tsai reminded members of the Legislative Yuan's Foreign and
Defense Committee present at the session that Xi could not solely formulate
China's future policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"China now adopts a collective leadership system instead of a one-man rule as
seen in the Deng Xiaoing era," Tsai said. "Therefore, China's future Taiwan
policy will not be dictated by any single figure but will reflect the collective
views and wills of a number of Chinese leaders."</P>
      <P>In the past, Tsai continued, Chinese officials were branded as "dove faction"
and "hawk faction" in terms of their stances toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Such a characterization is meaningless. As far as the sensitive sovereignty and
territorial issues are concerned, all Chinese leaders are hard-liners and
nationalists," he said.</P>
      <P>Tsai also recalled that during a previous visit to a Hispanic country, Xi
publicly criticized some foreign pundits critical of China's human rights policy
as meddling in its domestic affairs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai confirmed for the first time that a brother of Xi's wife Peng
Liyuan is living in Chiayi in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Peng, a major general with the People's Liberation Army's General Political
Department, is very well-known in China as a folk singer. According to Tsai, she
made an eight-day visit to Taiwan in 1997 for the purpose of cultural exchanges.</P>
      <P>On China's leadership transition, Tsai said Xi's succession to Hu has been on
track since he became vice president in 2008. His recent appointment as vice
chairman of the Central Military Commission -- China's top military body --
would allow him to consolidate his influence over the military and enhance his
political stature, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Without a transparent electoral process, Tsai said, the Communist Party of China
could utilize Xi's new appointment to the powerful military committee to show
that its leadership transition is going ahead smoothly as Hu is expected to step
down as party chief in 2012 and as president the following year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Asian countries 'troubled' by hot money: CEPD head</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 20 (CNA)
10/20/10  21:26:28
(By Hsieh Chu-wei &amp; Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most Asian counties have been troubled by appreciation of their currencies as a
result of the United States increasing its issuance of bank notes, Council of
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Chairwoman Christina Liu said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Almost all Asian counties are suffering an overheated economic climate due to
the massive inflow of hot money, and they will not be able to withstand further
waves of speculative capital if other countries join the U.S. in issuing more
bills, " said the economist- turned head of the CEPD, which is responsible for
charting the nation's economic development.</P>
      <P>Media reports suggested the U.S. was poised for another round of "quantitative
easing monetary policy" in a bid to help prop up its sluggish economy, a move
that could devalue the greenback and prompt further cross-border flows of
speculative money.</P>
      <P>Japan had already followed the U.S. in issuing more bills as part of its efforts
to re-energize its economy, the reports stated, and Britain was likely to follow
suit.</P>
      <P>Concerned about the impact of the hot money, Legislator Lai Shyh-bao of the
ruling Kuomintang raised the possibility of a recurrence of the 1997 Asian
monetary crisis if the world's three leading economies kept issuing money
without limit.</P>
      <P>Liu responded that, if properly managed and if transferred to funds for foreign
direct investment (FDI) , then hot capital would contribute to a country's
economic development.</P>
      <P>While the CEPD was not responsible for managing the flow of capital, Liu said
that personally she was in favor of imposing controls on the hot money.</P>
      <P>"It will be very dangerous if we fail to deal with speculators appropriately,"
she said.</P>
      <P>In related news, Taiwan's central bank estimated Wednesday that NT$370 billion
of international hot money was in Taiwan to speculate on the local currency.</P>
      <P>That amount included NT$120 billion in inward remittances that had not been
invested in stocks but remained in transaction accounts, and another NT$250
billion that had been used to purchase two-year government bonds, central bank
Governor Perng Fai-nan told the Legislative Yuan's Finance Committee. ed/MH</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre (Imec), the world's largest
nanoelectronics research institute based in Belgium, set up a research and
development center in Taiwan Wednesday to focus on bioelectronics and green
electronics.</P>
      <P>"The creation of the ITIC (Imec Taiwan Innovation Centre) , two years after
having established a representative office in Hsinchu, Taiwan, is essential in
our continued efforts to create value for our current and future partners in
Taiwan, " Imec CEO and President Luc Van den hove, told reporters at a signing
ceremony.</P>
      <P>ITIC, co-funded under a project of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to encourage
foreign enterprises to set up research and development centers in Taiwan, is
Imec's first R&amp;D center outside Europe.</P>
      <P>Explaining why Imec chose Taiwan, the chief executive said that his company has
a long-term partnership with local companies, such as Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) , the world's largest contract chip maker, and United
Microelectronics Corp. (UMC).</P>
      <P>"We have already a very long relationship with companies in Taiwan, " said Luc
Van den hove. "It's very clear that Taiwan is one of the leading countries in
this domain."</P>
      <P>"The strategy of Imec has always been that, if we want to be the No. 1 R&amp;D
provider, we need to work with the No. 1 companies in the world," he added.</P>
      <P>The ITIC will focus on information and communications technology, health care
and green electronics, the chief executive said.</P>
      <P>Asked by reporters if Imec will establish a fab in Taiwan, the chief executive
said that there is no such a plan at the moment.</P>
      <P>"Of course, we never say never," he added, however.</P>
      <P>Luc Van den hove declined to confirm local media reports saying that Imec will
invest NT$150 million (US$4.9 million) in the new research center.</P>
      <P>The research institute will hire more than 40 specialists in Taiwan over the
next three years, said Wu Hsiang-wei, general manager of Imec Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Imec, which employs about 1,800 people, has offices in the Netherlands, the
United States, China and Japan. In 2009, Imec's revenue was 275 million euro.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Food products in Taiwan contain high sodium levels: group</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The sodium content of 85 percent of the food products sold in Taiwan is much
higher than the recommended intake of 800 milligrams per meal, the Consumers'
Foundation said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The foundation said 34 out of 40 products tested in January this year exceeded
the average sodium intake suggested for an adult per meal.</P>
      <P>Of the products tested, eight packaged products (around 20 percent of the total)
even contained a higher sodium level than the average daily sodium intake of
2,400 milligrams, the foundation said</P>
      <P>In addition to testing food products, the foundation also tested 17 types of
snack products and found that 12 of them contained more than 800 milligrams of
sodium.</P>
      <P>Seven samples of instant noodles and hamburgers tested all exceeded the
suggested sodium level.</P>
      <P>The foundation also found that eating 100 grams of three types of canned food
tested will give consumers a sodium intake of 1.2 to 1.9 times the recommended
amount.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, seven out of eight condiment packages and microwave food products
tested contained 1,200 milligrams of sodium-- more than half of the recommended
average daily intake.</P>
      <P>The foundation urged the Department of Health to set sodium limits in instant
noodles and snack products and order food suppliers to reduce the sodium content
in food by 30 percent.</P>
      <P>Food companies should also properly label food packages to help customers make
better choices and live healthy lifestyles, the foundation said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's monthly export orders marked a record high in September as shipments
reflected changes in exchange rates, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's export orders for September totaled US$35.98 billion, a year-on-year
gain of 16.68 percent.</P>
      <P>IT and telecom products posted an increase of US$1.71 billion, up 22.17 percent,
with notebook computers and Apple products posting the biggest gains, according
to the ministry.</P>
      <P>Electronics orders followed with a 15.84-percent growth of US$1.22 billion,
while chemical-product orders increased by US$600 million or 44.53 percent.</P>
      <P>Orders from America totaled US$8.807 billion, compared with US$19.542 billion
from Asia -- primarily Japan, China and Hong Kong -- while orders from Europe
totaled US$6.970 billion.</P>
      <P>Export orders for the entire third quarter reached a total value of US$104.69
billion, up 19.32 percent from a year earlier, the MOEA statistics showed.</P>
      <P>The overall good figures resulted from restocking demands and Taiwan's advantage
in currency exchange rates, said Huang Ji-shih, head of the MOEA's statistics
department.</P>
      <P>The euro had risen against the Taiwan dollar since June, leading to September's
rapid growth in exports to Europe, just as orders from Japan probably escalated
due to take off by the Japanese yen, Huang suggested. (By Lin Hui-chun and C.Y.

Thursday, the Chinese Taipei Baseball Association (CTBA) has announced.</P>
      <P>Kuo will arrive in Taipei Thursday and attend an international baseball

      <P>He will throw the first pitch of the opening game between Taiwan and South Korea
Saturday in the 2010 Intercontinental Cup baseball tournament, which will be
played at the Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium in the central
Taiwanese city of Taichung, according to the CTBA.</P>
      <P>The lefthander finished the 2010 season with three wins, two losses and 12 saves

      <P>Kuo, who had four surgeries on his elbow, also broke the Dodgers franchise
record of the lowest ERA (earned run average), finishing the season with an ERA
of 1.20. He struck out 73 in 60 innings.</P>
      <P>Kuo will enjoy a competition-free off season in Taiwan after the Dodgers

      <P>China has sent 62 procurement missions to Taiwan since May 2008, signing letters
of intent to purchase US$16.2 billion worth of locally made products, Taiwan's
intelligence chief said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>This year alone, 14 Chinese procurement missions have visited Taiwan, National
Security Bureau Director Tsai Teh-sheng said at a closed-door session of the
Legislative Yuan's Foreign and Defense Committee.</P>
      <P>Many of those deals have not yet been substantiated, however, and some of them
would require a long period of time to complete delivery, Tsai said.</P>
      <P>Grilled by opposition Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Tsai Hung-liang on
whether China's procurement contracts were part of its efforts to woo Taiwanese
people and build up interpersonal connections and social networks in Taiwan to
promote its ultimate goal of unification, Tsai Teh-sheng responded: "It probably
is."</P>
      <P>Chinese procurement  missions inevitably  carry primary and secondary missions,
the intelligence chief added.</P>
      <P>The NSB director refrained, however, from making a direct response to Tsai Hung-
liang's question about whether China's dispatch of purchase missions was mainly
for unification promotion.</P>
      <P>He instead said the bureau has already alerted President Ma Ying-jeou about
China's ulterior purposes behind its seemingly commercially motivated deals.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai was quoted as having revealed at the meeting that the number of
Chinese missiles targeting Taiwan has risen to 1,410 from 1,328 recorded during

      <P>The second annual "Movies Under the Stars" festival is set to make its debut
starting this Friday, the Taipei County Government announced on Wednesday,
inviting the public to enjoy six films from the U.S., Japan and Taiwan
completely free of charge at a park in Banciao from Oct 22 to the 27.</P>
      <P>The six films include two Hollywood movies: "Confession of a Shopaholic," a
romantic comedy starring Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy as well as the teenage
blockbuster "The Sisterhood of Traveling Pants 2" with Blake Lively and America
Ferrera.</P>
      <P>Although these two young actors are not yet household names in Taiwan, many
festival goers might recognize their faces because of Lively's role in the
popular television series "Gossip Girls" and Ferreira's award-winning portrayal
of a fashionably-awkward secretary in "Ugly Betty."</P>
      <P>Also showing at the make-shift outdoor theater are two Taiwanese films: the
black comedy "Mr. Bedman" about a quirky love triangle of an over-imaginative
mattress salesman, and "Close to You" depicting the stories of two boxers with
differing motivations.</P>
      <P>Those who liked Sandra Bullock's laugh-out-loud movie "Miss Congeniality" might
want to check out "Beauty on Duty, " a Hong Kong remake of the Hollywood
original.</P>
      <P>The only Japanese movie to be showcased in the six-day event is "Tokyo Sonata,"
a tear-jerker about a father who struggles to come to grip with the fact that he
has been laid off. The movie has been lauded for telling the tales of many
Japanese men who have to conceal their joblessness from their families in order
not to lose face in front of their loved ones.</P>
      <P>All the movies will be shown at the Wangping Metropolis Park located close to
the Banciao MRT Station. Organizers said the event will be held irrespective of
the weather; in the case of light rain, tents and plastic chairs will be set up
for the audience. (By Jenny W. Hsu)</P>

      <P>Former U.S. President Bill Clinton will visit Taiwan in mid-November, a Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The former president is scheduled to deliver a speech in Taipei Nov. 14 as part
of an invitational tour of Asia, organized by a Singaporean firm, MOFA spokesman
James Chang said.</P>
      <P>Clinton, who was U.S. president from 1993 to 2001, will arrive in Taiwan for a
private business trip, Chang said, but the foreign ministry will provide
necessary assistance and security during his stay based on a request made by the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , the U.S. representative office in the
absence of official bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Chang said that he was not aware of the details of the tour and declined to
comment on whether Clinton, husband of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton, will meet with President Ma Ying-jeou or other Taiwanese officials.</P>
      <P>The ex-president will share with the audience his views on Taiwan's economic
development and preview the country's economic outlook beyond 2010 in a topical
speech, to be delivered at Taipei International Convention Center, the organizer
UNI Strategic (Taiwan) Ltd.,  a subsidiary  of the Singapore-based  Universal
Network Intelligence, said in a press release late Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A moderated question and answer session will be conducted after the speech, the
organizer said, adding that 10 percent of the total proceeds of the event will
be donated to the Clinton Foundation, which was established by the former
president to tackle issues including fighting AIDS, climate change and promoting
democracy throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Members of the public will be charged between NT$1,800 and NT$12,000 to listen
to the speech.</P>
      <P>It will be Clinton's sixth visit to Taiwan and his first since February 2005,
when he first came to Taiwan after stepping down as president. He met with then
President Chen Shui-bian and then chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Lien Chan during a 22-hour whirlwind tour, which was sponsored by the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy.</P>
      <P>Clinton also visited Taiwan four times when he was Governor of Arkansas from

Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>One of the green products to be featured at the show is an LED street lamp that
relies on solar energy for power during daytime and wind power during nighttime
or when it rains, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>The organizers will also erect a two-story building using green construction
materials and technology applications, which is a warm-up event for next years

promote its ultimate goal of unification, Tsai Teh-sheng responded: "It probably
is."</P>
      <P>Chinese procurement  missions inevitably  carry primary and secondary missions,
the intelligence chief added.</P>
      <P>The NSB director refrained, however, from making a direct response to Tsai Hung-
liang's question about whether China's dispatch of purchase missions was mainly
for unification promotion.</P>
      <P>He instead said the bureau has already alerted President Ma Ying-jeou about
China's ulterior purposes behind its seemingly commercially motivated deals.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Tsai was quoted as having revealed at the meeting that the number of
Chinese missiles targeting Taiwan has risen to 1,410 from 1,328 recorded during
the previous DPP administration.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Free movies in Taipei County starting Friday</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct 20 (CNA)
10/20/10  23:00:19</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The second annual "Movies Under the Stars" festival is set to make its debut
starting this Friday, the Taipei County Government announced on Wednesday,
inviting the public to enjoy six films from the U.S., Japan and Taiwan
completely free of charge at a park in Banciao from Oct 22 to the 27.</P>
      <P>The six films include two Hollywood movies: "Confession of a Shopaholic," a
romantic comedy starring Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy as well as the teenage
blockbuster "The Sisterhood of Traveling Pants 2" with Blake Lively and America
Ferrera.</P>
      <P>Although these two young actors are not yet household names in Taiwan, many
festival goers might recognize their faces because of Lively's role in the
popular television series "Gossip Girls" and Ferreira's award-winning portrayal
of a fashionably-awkward secretary in "Ugly Betty."</P>
      <P>Also showing at the make-shift outdoor theater are two Taiwanese films: the
black comedy "Mr. Bedman" about a quirky love triangle of an over-imaginative
mattress salesman, and "Close to You" depicting the stories of two boxers with
differing motivations.</P>
      <P>Those who liked Sandra Bullock's laugh-out-loud movie "Miss Congeniality" might
want to check out "Beauty on Duty, " a Hong Kong remake of the Hollywood
original.</P>
      <P>The only Japanese movie to be showcased in the six-day event is "Tokyo Sonata,"
a tear-jerker about a father who struggles to come to grip with the fact that he
has been laid off. The movie has been lauded for telling the tales of many
Japanese men who have to conceal their joblessness from their families in order
not to lose face in front of their loved ones.</P>
      <P>All the movies will be shown at the Wangping Metropolis Park located close to
the Banciao MRT Station. Organizers said the event will be held irrespective of
the weather; in the case of light rain, tents and plastic chairs will be set up
for the audience. (By Jenny W. Hsu)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former U.S. President Bill Clinton will visit Taiwan in mid-November, a Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official confirmed Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The former president is scheduled to deliver a speech in Taipei Nov. 14 as part
of an invitational tour of Asia, organized by a Singaporean firm, MOFA spokesman
James Chang said.</P>
      <P>Clinton, who was U.S. president from 1993 to 2001, will arrive in Taiwan for a
private business trip, Chang said, but the foreign ministry will provide
necessary assistance and security during his stay based on a request made by the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , the U.S. representative office in the
absence of official bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>Chang said that he was not aware of the details of the tour and declined to
comment on whether Clinton, husband of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham
Clinton, will meet with President Ma Ying-jeou or other Taiwanese officials.</P>
      <P>The ex-president will share with the audience his views on Taiwan's economic
development and preview the country's economic outlook beyond 2010 in a topical
speech, to be delivered at Taipei International Convention Center, the organizer
UNI Strategic (Taiwan) Ltd.,  a subsidiary  of the Singapore-based  Universal
Network Intelligence, said in a press release late Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A moderated question and answer session will be conducted after the speech, the
organizer said, adding that 10 percent of the total proceeds of the event will
be donated to the Clinton Foundation, which was established by the former
president to tackle issues including fighting AIDS, climate change and promoting
democracy throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Members of the public will be charged between NT$1,800 and NT$12,000 to listen
to the speech.</P>
      <P>It will be Clinton's sixth visit to Taiwan and his first since February 2005,
when he first came to Taiwan after stepping down as president. He met with then
President Chen Shui-bian and then chairman of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Lien Chan during a 22-hour whirlwind tour, which was sponsored by the Taiwan
Foundation for Democracy.</P>
      <P>Clinton also visited Taiwan four times when he was Governor of Arkansas from
1979 to 1981 and from 1983 to 1992.</P>
      <P>The AIT declined to comment on the upcoming visit.</P>

emitting diode (LED) lights, according to the Bureau of Energy under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>One of the green products to be featured at the show is an LED street lamp that
relies on solar energy for power during daytime and wind power during nighttime
or when it rains, the organizers said.</P>
      <P>The organizers will also erect a two-story building using green construction
materials and technology applications, which is a warm-up event for next years
show that will focus on green buildings.</P>

      <P>No evidence of serious oil pollution had been found following sinking Monday of
the Panama-registered cargo ship Xin Yi off the coast of Miaoli in western
Taiwan, an official from the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Lung-chu, section chief of the EPA's Department of Water Quality
Protection, conjectured that as little as 10 percent of the vessel's 300 tons of
heavy fuel oil might be found in the sea, for which he offered two explanations.</P>
      <P>First, northeast monsoon winds might have helped 90 percent of the oil evaporate
within 24 hours of sinking, and second, since the cement carrier's oil tanks
were located in various parts of the ship, not all of them might have cracked
open.</P>
      <P>Three crewmen are still missing and one died when the cargo ship sailing from
China to Brunei sank due to huge waves in the Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Weather bureau issues sea warning for Typhoon Megi</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a sea warning for Typhoon Megi early
Thursday, calling on all maritime traffic south of Taiwan and in the Taiwan
Strait to prepare for strong winds.</P>
      <P>The bureau issued the warning at 2:30 a.m. as the typhoon entered waters south-
southeastern of the Taiwan-held Dongsha Islands in the South China Sea at 2 a.m.
and steadily headed northward toward the Dogsha  Islands,  the Bashi  Channel
and the Taiwan  Strait, meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>As of 8: 30 a.m., Megi was located 440 kilometers southwest of Eluanbi, the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, moving north-northwest at a speed of 10 km per hour,
according to the latest weather report.</P>
      <P>The storm packed maximum sustained winds of 173 kph with gusts of up to 209 kph,
the report said.</P>
      <P>With the typhoon approching, high waves have hit the Hengchun Peninsula at
Taiwan's southern tip as well as the outlying island of Penghu and other
southestern coastal regions. The weather bureau urged local people not to visit
those areas for safety concerns.</P>
      <P>The bureau also maintained its warning against torrential rain for northern,
northeastern and eastern Taiwan after these regions experienced heavy rains in
the past few days under the influence of Megi's outer rim and seasonal winds
from the northeast.</P>
      <P>Megi regained strength after wreaking havoc across the northern Philippines
earlier this week, destroying thousands of homes and killing at least 15 people,
according to foreign wire service reports.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Global money-printing competition</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/21/10  11:04:35
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With outstanding public debt hitting a record high and interest rates dropping
to near zero, the United States is prepared to launch a new wave of
"quantitative easing" programs to further increase the money supply. Many
countries, meanwhile, are forced to join the money-printing competition to fight
against the influx of hot money.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, central bank governor Perng Fai-nan has defended the government's
efforts to intervene in the appreciation of the New Taiwan dollar to keep its
exports competitive,  citing recent criticism by Nobel Prize-winning economist
Joseph Stiglitz who said the U.S. monetary policy is "causing chaos over the
rest of the world."</P>
      <P>Thanks to the central bank's intervention, the Taiwanese currency had risen by
only 3.93 percent in value since the start of this year until Oct. 14. The level
is lower than the 4.79 percent recorded by its main export competitor, South
Korea, and other Asian countries other than China.</P>
      <P>Stan Shih, founder of the world's second largest computer vendor Acer Inc.,
however, has warned that refusing to allow the New Taiwan dollar to appreciate,
as other countries allow their currencies to rise, could hurt the purchasing
power of local consumers.</P>
      <P>In other words,  when trying to protect  Taiwan's  export competitiveness, the
central bank must also ensure that the interests of the people are upheld. No
country is sure to win in this unprecedented money-printing competition, but a
country is sure to lose if it does not act cautiously. (Editorial abstract --

      <P>Los Angeles Dodgers' Taiwanese pitcher Kuo Hong-chih returned to Taipei Thursday
for a vacation after coming off the greatest season of his Major League Baseball
(MLB) career.</P>
      <P>Kuo was all smiles when he met reporters at Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport. He said he was very happy with his performance in the just-concluded
MLB season.</P>
      <P>The lefthander started the 2010 season as a setup man but was installed as a
closer in mid-August in place of the struggling Jonathan Braxton.</P>
      <P>Asked if he is looking forward to becoming a closer in the coming season, Kuo
said it would be great for him to remain healthy and pitch throughout the whole
season.</P>
      <P>On salary and contract issues, Kuo, who has four surgeries on his elbow, said
it's up to negotiations between his agent and the Dodgers franchise.</P>
      <P>Kuo will throw the first pitch of the opening game between Taiwan and South
Korea Saturday in the 2010 Intercontinental Cup baseball tournament, which will
be played at the Taichung Intercontinental Baseball Stadium in the central city
of Taichung.</P>
      <P>The 29-year-old pitcher finished the 2010 season with three wins, two losses and
12 saves in 56 appearances and became the first Taiwanese player to earn a spot
in the MLB mid-season All-Star Game.</P>
      <P>He also secured the Dodgers record for lowest ERA of 1.20 based on a minimum of
at least 50 innings pitched. He struck out 73 while yielding only 29 hits and 18
walks in 60 innings pitched.</P>
      <P>It was his best season since first making the Dodgers roster in 2005. Aside from
his record-setting ERA, his WHIP (walks and hits per inning pitched)  was an
astounding 0.78. Anything below 1 is considered outstanding.</P>
      <P>Kuo has been nominated for the "Setup Man of the Year" award for 2010. He won
the honor for the first time in 2008.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Acer shares sharply higher on record operating profit in Q3</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shares of personal computer vendor Acer Inc. rose sharply in Thursday morning
trade as interest was triggered by the company's record high operating profit
for the third quarter of this year, dealers said.</P>
      <P>At 11: 21 a.m., Acer was up 2.36 percent at NT$82.40 (US$2.67) with 23.42
million shares changing hands, while the benchmark weighted index fell 0.15
percent to 8,112.05.</P>
      <P>Acer reported Wednesday it posted NT$5.28 billion in operating profit for the
July-September period, marking a quarterly record high, up 11 percent from a
year earlier.</P>
      <P>The company said the third quarter's operating margin also hit a record high at
3.16 percent. It was the first time that Acer's operating margin rose above 3
percent as it had stepped up effective measures to control marketing expenses.</P>
      <P>In the third quarter, Acer's net profit totaled NT$4.29 billion, up from NT$3.47
billion a year earlier, the company said.</P>
      <P>"Acer was still doing a good job in Europe by taking advantage of its lead in
the particular market," MasterLink Securities analyst Tom Tang said.</P>
      <P>"It seemed that the competition of Apple's iPad did not impose much impact on
Acer's PC sales, " Tang said. "Investors felt relieved to some extent about the
company's latest earnings report."</P>
      <P>In the first nine months of this year, Acer posted NT$11.2 billion in net
profit, up from NT$7.84 billion recorded a year ago, according to the company.</P>
      <P>However, with competition in the global PC market getting fiercer than ever,
Tang said he expects Acer's operating margin in the third quarter would fall,
while the company did not disclose the figure.</P>
      <P>In the third quarter of last year, Acer's operating margin stood at about 10
percent.</P>
      <P>Boosted by the positive earnings news, the company's stock has overcome the
strong technical resistance at around NT$81.00, while the breakthrough was also
because it had consolidated for some time to digest pressure, according to Tang.</P>
      <P>"But Acer is moving closer to the new technical barriers at about NT$85.00.
There is limited room for upside and investors had better trade the stock
cautiously," Tang said.</P>
      <P>He said the market is waiting for the guidance the company will give in its
investor conference scheduled for Oct. 29 to paint a clearer picture about the
outlook for the fourth quarter.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and China are currently negotiating an investment pact that is likely to
be signed at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan, the goal of signing the agreement should be to obtain greater
protection for China-based Taiwanese businesses than that provided under China's
existing investment protection law. Issues that need to be addressed urgently
include compensation for land acquisition, strengthening the protection of
investors' physical safety, setting up an arbitration mechanism between
investors and the government, and expanding the protection to cover investments
in the contract, franchise and intellectual property rights sectors.</P>
      <P>For China, its main objective is probably pushing for further liberalization of
existing restrictions on Chinese investment in Taiwan. Although Taiwan is
obviously reluctant to link the issue with the investment protection pact, it
needs to prepare properly to deal with the situation.</P>
      <P>At present, there is not a law in Taiwan that governs the govenrment's
obligations  to  implement  investment  protection agreements. It is equally
urgent for the country to set up a related system. (Editorial abstract -- Oct.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's central government has mobilized 31,610 soldiers nationwide to be on
alert as Typhoon Megi moves near the island on its way to China, the Central
Emergency Operation Center (CEOC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) has earlier issued a sea warning and projected
Megi will be the closest to Taiwan in the next 48 hours.</P>
      <P>As of 11: 30 a.m., Megi was located 430 kilometers southwest of Eluanbi, the
southernmost tip of Taiwan, moving north-northwest at a speed of 10 km per hour,
according to the latest report.</P>
      <P>The storm packed maximum sustained winds of 173 kph with gusts of up to 209 kph,
the report said.</P>
      <P>The central government has been taking precautions especially in northeastern
and southern Taiwan, having 10,744 and 8,343 troops on alert, respectively,
according to the emergency operation center.</P>
      <P>The center forecast that in the next 48 hours, accumulated rainfall caused by
Megi can reach 250-500 millimeters in the Taipei area, 400-600 millimeters in
the nearby Yilan area, 300-500 millimeters in southern Taiwan's Hualien area,
and 200-400 millimeters in eastern Taiwan's Taitung area.</P>
      <P>Mountainous area of northeastern Taiwan, however, could experience heavier rain
ranging from 600-1,000 millimeters, said the center.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Council of Agriculture has also issued warnings about a high
possibility of creeks overflowing and landslides occurring in Tatung township of
northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County.</P>
      <P>Ferry service and other maritime traffic between Pingtung county's Donggang
township and Liuqiu island has been suspended after 8 a.m. Thursday as high
waves hit the Hengchun Peninsula at Taiwan's southern tip.</P>
      <P>The CWB also maintained its warning against torrential rain for northern,
northeastern and eastern Taiwan after these regions experienced heavy rain in
the past few days under the influence of Megi's outer rim and seasonal winds
from the northeast.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Megi left at least 19 people dead in the Philippines earlier in the
week, according to foreign wire service reports. It has weakened as it moves
closer to the southern coast of China and is expected to make landfall near
China's Shantou city, Guangdong province on Oct. 23.</P>
      <P>Megi was the strongest typhoon in recent years to hit the Philippines, where it
is estimated to have caused more than US$100 million in damages to
infrastructure, agriculture, fisheries and schools, foreign wirse service
reports said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed little changed Thursday amid cautious sentiment
before bellwether electronics makers report their third-quarter earnings later
this month, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index gained 6.61 points or 0.08 percent to 8,131.23, after moving
between 8,109.79 and 8,171.49, on turnover of NT$120.48 billion (US$3.91
billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.13 percent and moved in a narrow range throughout trading
as pressure focused on select high-tech firms on outlook concerns, while buying
in old-economy stocks prevented the broader market from suffering losses,
dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,894 stocks closed up, 1,950 fell and 336 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The textile sector scored the highest gain, up 3.48 percent. Paper and pulp
stocks rose 1.69 percent, cement firms added 1.1 percent, plastics and chemical
stocks gained 0.97 percent, foodstuffs closed up 0.25 percent, and the
construction sector rose 0.18 percent.</P>
      <P>Losers included the machinery and electronics sector, down 0.22 percent, and the
financial sector, which lost 0.31 percent.</P>
      <P>"Unless investors gather more information about the high-tech sector's
fundamentals, they remain reluctant to add electronics holdings," Grand Cathay
Securities analyst Mars Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the market is watching  closely  how electronics heavyweights, such as
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) and flat panel maker AU Optronics,
would report their third-quarter earnings and give guidance for the fourth
quarter.</P>
      <P>After a technical rebound staged on Wednesday, the local bourse had fallen into
consolidation ahead of stiff technical resistance at around the 8,200 point, Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>"Without a strong electronics sector, it is unlikely that the index will jump
over the hurdle," he said.</P>
      <P>Among large-cap high-tech firms, TSMC, the world's largest contract chip maker,
closed unchanged at NT$61.00, while AU Optronics fell 2.68 percent to NT$29.10.</P>
      <P>In the textile sector, Far Eastern New Century rose 3.75 percent to NT$47.00 and
Shinkong Synthetic Fiber added 6.98 percent to NT$16.10 amid optimism toward
their business ties with China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's interests in bird species and the diversity of related research were
impressive, Lambertini said at the Taipei Representative Office in the U.K.</P>
      <P>He expressed gratitude for Taiwan's long-term support of the organization, and

      <P>A new system of LED street lamps has gone into operation on Taiwan's outlying
island of Kinmen as part of the county's low carbon energy-saving efforts.</P>
      <P>Sixty-nine automated LED lamps were installed on a section of the island's
Huandao East Road, replacing the previous sodium and mercury street lamps, after
the county government was awarded a grant by the Ministry of Economic Affairs'
Bureau of Energy to finance the plan, county government officials said as the
lights were switched on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It is a pilot program for the use of LED technology, which will be expanded
island-wide by 2014 in a project that is estimated to cost NT$365 million
(US$11.87 million).</P>
      <P>According to the county government, the system is linked to the Central Weather
Bureau, making it able to adjust to changes in the length of daylight hours. It
can also collect and analyze data to report when lamps are broken or
malfunctioning, thereby improving efficiency and saving energy.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department  of Health  (DOH) categorically denied media reports Thursday
that it had approved the import of laser equipment to correct presbyopia and
that clinical trials were expected to begin in Taiwan by December.</P>
      <P>Shih Chung-liang, director of the DOH's Bureau of Medical Affairs, said he had
not signed any document approving the import of laser vision-correction machines
for the treatment of presbyopia.</P>
      <P>If no such equipment was being imported, how could clinical trials begin in
December, Shih asked.</P>
      <P>Similarly, Pei-weng Tu, a senior specialist with the DOH's Food and Drug
Administration, said that no individual or company had filed an application
permit for laser vision- correction equipment for treatment of the condition.</P>
      <P>Moreover, no existing laser vision-correction equipment in use in Taiwan had
added a function for treatment of presbyopia, Tu said.</P>
      <P>Their comments came in response to a foreign wire-service report Wednesday that
laser surgery, presently used for treatment of short- sightedness, was being
tested as a cure for presbyopia, a long- sightedness that develops with age.  If
successful,  it could dramatically reduce the need for reading glasses.</P>
      <P>Findings of the latest research, from three laboratories in Europe and the
United States, would be presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology's
annual conference this week, the report stated.</P>
      <P>There is, however, one type of laser vision-correction equipment that can be
used to treat presbyopia if its computerized operational program is modified,
said a Taipei-based ophthalmologist who declined to give his name.</P>
      <P>He said that many medical centers around Taiwan have planned to purchase
presbyopia-treatment laser equipment.</P>
      <P>"Given Taiwan's increasingly graying society, the number of patients who would
pay to have their presbyopia treated far exceeds the number paying for laser
correction of short-sightedness, " the ophthalmologist said.</P>

      <P>A central epidemic command center was established Thursday in a bid to curb an
outbreak of dengue fever in southern regions of Taiwan after more than 600
indigenous cases were reported since August, the Department of Health (DOH) said
that day.</P>
      <P>According to the two commanders-in-chief -- DOH Minister Yaung Chih-liang and
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) Minister Stephen Shu-hung Shen --
the preliminary goals of the center are to encourage the public to get rid of
containers of standing water in which the dengue-carrying mosquitoes breed and
to eradicate other possible breeding sites.</P>
      <P>According to the number of households and residents in a community, an estimate
of the number of containers in the community can be calculated, said Shih Wen-
yi, deputy director-general of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).</P>
      <P>Shih added that it is important to stop the spread of dengue fever before the
seasonal drop in temperature, or else the disease will be more difficult to
combat.</P>
      <P>To enhance cooperation between the central and local governments, two southern
command centers were set up simultaneously in Kaohsiung and Tainan in a ceremony
attended by Shih and Lai Chien-jung, an official from the EPA's southern
division. Shih had traveled south the previous day to get a better understanding

    <TEXT>
      <P>French brokerage BNP Paribas said Thursday that it was maintaining a "buy"
recommendation on Acer Inc. after the personal computer vendor reported higher-
than-expected operating profit for the third quarter of this year.</P>
      <P>The brokerage reiterated a target price of NT$92.00 (US$2.98) for Acer.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, Acer announced it posted NT$5.28 billion in operating profit for
the July-September period, marking a quarterly record high and up 11 percent
from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>The company said its net profit during the same period totaled NT$4.29 billion,
up from NT$3.47 billion a year earlier, on sales of NT$167.2 billion.</P>
      <P>In a research note, BNP Paribas said it expects Acer's sales for the fourth
quarter to grow 5 percent from the third quarter, with shipments of notebooks
expected to grow at a similar magnitude.</P>
      <P>The brokerage also said that Acer's cooperation with the Founder Group, a
Chinese counterpart, which has become effective in mid-October, will contribute
about NT$500 million, or 3 percent of Acer's sales, in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, the ties with Founder could generate NT$600-NT$700 million in
sales, representing a contribution of 3 percent to 3.5 percent of Acer's total
sales contribution every quarter.</P>
      <P>The deal allows Acer to take advantage of Founder's comprehensive distribution
network to sell Acer products in tier 4-6 Chinese cities -- which have
populations of less than 20,000 -- and rural areas, while targeting corporate
and government clients.</P>
      <P>Founder is also working  with Acer to design and develop Founder-branded
products, including notebooks, netbooks and mobile Internet devices such as
e-readers.</P>
      <P>BNP Paribas said it expects that "Acer's operating margin will continue to grow
but is unsure whether it will be able to reach 3.5 percent by the year-end."</P>
      <P>In the third quarter, Acer's operating margin stood at 3.16 percent, hitting a
quarterly record high on successful efforts to control marketing costs,
according to the company.</P>
      <P>The brokerage said it "remains positive" about Acer's market share gain, in
particular in China, as well as the prospects for its tablet computer business.</P>
      <P>Acer closed up 3.11 percent at NT$83.00 on the Taiwan Stock Exchange Thursday.</P>

      <P>The government's efforts to relax the eligibility requirements for public
assistance, including raising the poverty line, highlight its resolve to help
disadvantaged families, Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Jiang was reporting to the Legislative Yuan's Social Welfare, Environment and
Health Committee, which had convened to review proposed amendments to the Public
Assistance Act.</P>
      <P>At present, public assistance is mainly available to low-income households,
defined as those whose total income divided by the number of individual members
is lower than the minimum cost of living, or poverty line, which varies from
region to region in the country.</P>
      <P>The minimum cost of living is currently calculated as 60 percent of the annual
consumption expenditure per capita for the latest year.</P>
      <P>According to a proposal put forward by the Ministry of the Interior, the formula
would be changed to 60 percent of median monthly disposable income per capita.</P>
      <P>Jiang explained that the new formula would ensure that assistance was available
to more disadvantaged families.</P>
      <P>In addition, the bill expanded coverage of assistance to include lower-middle-
income households whose total income divided by the number of individual members
was less than 1.5 times the minimum cost of living, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>This group of families would receive government subsidies for National Health
Insurance premiums and tuition fees, he said.</P>
      <P>The bill also relaxed other criteria for determining eligibility for public
assistance, such as who should be considered as members of a single household.</P>

      <P>" (Taiwan) should develop its golf and train more young players so that they can
compete around the world. Now, we have some very good ones such as Yani Tseng, "

just one stroke at the British Open in 1971.</P>
      <P>Tseng, 21, won the Ricoh Women's British Open in August.</P>
      <P>Born into a poor family, Lu began working at a golf course after elementary
school, which sparked his interest in the game. Bamboo sticks and little guavas
used to be his substitutes for real clubs and balls, said Lu, one of Taiwan's
earliest globally recognized professional golfers.</P>
      <P>After years of working as a caddie at a course near Taipei, Lu learned how to
play, and took three "Caddie Cup" victories in a row.</P>
      <P>Lu, who was happy to meet some old friends at the summit, is considered Taiwan's
best ambassador of golf through his exchanges with players from other countries

      <P>A cross-Taiwan Strait video game piracy ring, the largest of its kind in
history, was broken recently, the Intellectual Property Rights Police Team
(IPRPT) reported Thursday.</P>
      <P>Officers of the IPRPT under the National Police Agency raided a warehouse in
Sanchong City, Taipei County Sept. 27, arresting four suspects and thousands of
pirated copies of video game discs.</P>
      <P>The games, totaling 140,000 discs for PS2, Wii and X-Box, had a total street
value of some NT$260 million (US$8.39 million), the IPR police said.</P>
      <P>"Nearly all of the pirated disc inventory in Taiwan was busted in that
operation," said an IPRPT official.</P>
      <P>"There must be a shortage on the market now, " he said.</P>
      <P>According to the IPRPT, the four suspects, surnamed Chou, Wang, Wu and Liu, had
shuttled between Taipei and China's Guangzhou, where the factory forging the
discs is located, took delivery of shipments at the airport, or played the part
of customers by placing orders with stores for games, which the ring itself
would then supply, to make transaction records appear legitimate.</P>
      <P>It took the IPR police nearly seven months to trace the ring after game
developers or game owners tipped them off about the counterfeits.</P>
      <P>However, the police said that the only way to root out piracy once and for all
is to eradicate the source -- the factories in China.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's absentee-voting system, set for introduction in 2012, will exclude
citizens living overseas, Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said Thursday.</P>
      <P>For such people to become eligible for absentee votes, the Constitution would
need amending, Jiang explained, since it currently requires overseas citizens to
return to Taiwan to cast their votes in elections.</P>
      <P>Certain technical problems would also need to be overcome with regard to postal
or online voting, he added.</P>
      <P>Under Ministry of the Interior proposals, absentee voting will be implemented
for the first time in Taiwan during the 2012 presidential election, allowing
people not resident in their hometowns to apply to vote at a more convenient
polling station.</P>
      <P>To reduce the chance of vote-rigging, the ministry decided not to adopt postal
or online voting.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Largan Precision Co. Ltd., the world's largest cell phone camera lens maker,
said Thursday that it expects sales in the fourth quarter of this year to
continue to grow on rising global demand for smartphones.</P>
      <P>Largan Chairman Chen Shih-ching said the company will see its sales hit a
monthly high in December for this year, with the China market expected to
contribute a solid increase in revenue.</P>
      <P>The company announced during an investor conference that its sales totaled
NT$3.48 billion (US$113 million) in the third quarter, up 24.19 percent from the
second quarter and up 42.11 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>During the same period, its net profit reached NT$1.24 billion with earnings
per share at NT$9.5,  which was within market expectations.</P>
      <P>The company's gross margin stood at 47.11 percent in the July-September period,
slightly down from 47.21 percent from the second quarter.</P>
      <P>However, Chen said that despite the expected sales growth in the fourth quarter,
the gross margin is expected to continue to fall due to higher purchasing costs
in voice coil motors (VCMs) , one of the components of cell phone cameras, and
the impact of a rising New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>According to the company, its gross margin is expected to drop 1 percentage
point-1.5 percentage points whenever the U.S. dollar falls NT$1 against the
local currency.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of September, the greenback has fallen 3.84 percent, or
NT$1.233, against the New Taiwan dollar.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said, 5-8 megapixel lenses accounted for more than 50 percent of
the company's total sales in the third quarter, adding that the ratio is
expected to rise in the fourth quarter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Export orders, overseas production hit new highs</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/21/10  19:48:59
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese manufacturers received a total of US$35.98 billion in export orders in
September, a single-month high, but the ratio of overseas production also hit a
record 50.93 percent during the month, according to statistics released by the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chi-shih,  director-general  of the MOEA's Statistics Department, said the
high overseas production ratio has led to a scenario in which the growing export
orders are contributing little to improvements in joblessness and wages at home.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>September's export orders marked a year-on-year increase of 16.68 percent, or
US$5.14 billion in value, according to MOEA statistics.</P>
      <P>Huang optimistically forecast that accumulated export orders for this year could
reach US$410 billion, exceeding the average annual level of US$350 billion
posted before the 2008-2009 global financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, market analysts said the growth in export orders will mainly
benefit only business owners or shareholders because the overseas production
ratio has continued to rise and has already hit an all-time high of 50.93
percent.</P>
      <P>Increasingly prevalent overseas production will also hinder growth in domestic
job opportunities and wage hikes, the analysts said.</P>
      <P>In September, information and communication technology products accounted for
the lion's share of export orders received in the month, totaling US$9.4 billion
and representing a 22.17 percent hike from the year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Export orders from the United States, Europe and the Association of Southeast
Asia Nations all set new single-month records in September, amounting to US$7.71
billion, US$6.97 billion and US$3.44 billion, respectively.</P>
      <P>Orders from Japan also reached US$4.24 billion in September, the second-highest
amount in history. (Oct. 21, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Huang attributed September's remarkable growth in export orders mainly to a
relatively smaller rise in the value of the New Taiwan dollar during the first
nine months of the year.</P>
      <P>In the January-September period, the currency appreciated 3.5 percent against
the U.S. greenback, compared to a 12.7 percent rise in the value of the Japanese
yen and a 13.4 percent appreciation of the euro.</P>
      <P>As a result, orders from Japan and the euro-zone have spiked significantly
during the period.</P>
      <P>However, with economic recovery slowing down in the United States and the euro-
zone, Huang said, export orders for local manufacturers might show a decline in
October. (Oct. 21, 2010).</P>

      <P>Taiwan and the European Union shared experiences of design protection at a
seminar in Taipei, the organizers said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Legal frameworks and design patents were the main themes covered at the event,
held jointly by Taiwan's Intellectual Property Office (IPO), the European
Economic and Trade Office (EETO), and the Taiwan Design Center (TDC).</P>
      <P>"Design is the outward appearance of a product. But such a design has its value
to the product," said Guy Ledoux, head of the EETO, the European Commission's
permanent presence in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the EU, he noted, design protection was regulated both at EU level and
national level, meaning that designs had equal right to protection in all member
states.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese design firms would do well to strengthen their understanding of such
legal systems and patent rights, said TDC Chief Executive Tony Chang.</P>
      <P>"The better a design is, the more it should be protected," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's expanding role in global design is evidenced by the increase in local
designs winning recognition at the four major annual international design
awards, which had increased from 16 in 2003 to 260 this year, Chang added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>President should demand AP report correction: scholar</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou is right to demand that The Associate Press (AP) correct
a report claiming that during a recent interview, he hinted at a possible timing
for sensitive political talks with Beijing or tied such talks to his bid for re-
election in 2012, according to a local political scientist.</P>
      <P>Yang Yung-ming, a political science professor at National Taiwan University,
wrote in an article carried on the op-ed page of the United Daily News Thursday
that it is understandable that Ma has insisted on a correction of its report on
the interview conducted at the Presidential Office earlier in the week.</P>
      <P>"As cross-Taiwan  Strait political  talks involve  numerous complicated issues
and contain political tricks or traps, they should be tackled with great caution
and require meticulous preparations. Setting any timetable for such a task would
be inappropriate and dangerous, and no sensible Taiwanese political leader
should ever do such a thing," Yang wrote.</P>
      <P>After poring over the lengthy transcription of the interview recording, Yang
wrote, it seems that the AP interviewer already had preconceived notions and
tried hard to derive meaning from Ma's words that he could fit to his own views.</P>
      <P>In the interview, Yang continued, the reporter repeatedly grilled Ma on whether
he will move on to political talks with Beijing, should he be re-elected to a
second term, once all economic issues have been dealt with.</P>
      <P>Such an interviewing  style  is rarely  adopted  by major international news
media, according to Yang.</P>
      <P>"Most controversial was that the interviewer did not correctly report Ma's
remarks and instead distorted them to fit his own opinions," he went on.</P>
      <P>"Since the AP report said in its lead that Ma gave no timetable for when a
political dialogue with China would start, it is self-contradictory that the
report said later that Ma `suggested' that political talks could start as early
as his second four-year term if he wins re-election in 2012."</P>
      <P>The controversy has also shown how seriously AP distorted Ma's remarks, Yang
wrote. The agency originally wrote that Ma had said in the interview that he is
"ready" for a political dialogue with China, but changed the wording to read
that Ma "is open to" such talks following Ma's protest.</P>
      <P>In his article, Yang also questioned the wisdom of a suggestion that Ma should
give interviews only in Chinese instead of English to avoid this kind of
confusion.</P>
      <P>"Such an idea is not appropriate because translation could lead to even more
controversy, given the delicate and contentious nature of cross-strait issues,"
he wrote.</P>

      <P>Private entities will need to have at least NT$700 million (US$22 million) in
capital if they want to construct and operate  new airports  in Taiwan,  the
Civil  Aeronautics Administration (CAA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The required capital will differ in accordance with the annual passenger
capacities at the new airports, the CAA said as it passed a draft plan under the
Civil Aviation Act.</P>
      <P>For passenger throughput of over 10 million people per year, the minimum capital
will be NT$46 billion, while for under 750,000 people, the minimum capital will
be NT$700 million.</P>
      <P>The application process will be subject to close scrutiny, since the project is
a matter of public interest, said CAA Director-General Yin Chen-pong.</P>
      <P>According to the plan, interested private enterprises will need to have been in
operation for at least five years and to have a minimum annual operating revenue
of NT$60 million.</P>
      <P>In addition, more than half of the company's stocks will have to be  owned  by
corporations  or individuals  holding  Taiwanese citizenship, while no more than
25 percent of the shares should be owned by any single foreign individual.</P>
      <P>The CAA in 2007 amended the Civil Aviation Act, allowing private entities to
apply to construct and operate new airports. However, it lacked details such as
the required capital amounts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan well-positioned to benefit from low-carbon economy: BTCO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 21 (CNA)
10/21/10  20:38:48

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is in good position to benefit from the transition to a low-carbon
economy because of its highly educated population,  technological  expertise
and  leadership  in  the Asia-Pacific region, a visiting British official and
the top British diplomat in Taiwan said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The United Kingdom is keen to share its experience with Taiwan since both sides
are expected to benefit from collaboration in the climate-change issue and in
the green-energy sector, said David Campbell, director of the British Trade and
Cultural Office in Taiwan (BTCO) , the de-facto embassy in the absence of
official diplomatic ties, at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>In terms of Taiwan's desire to participate in the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) , Campbell said the European Union has
always supported Taiwan's meaningful participation in international
organizations, but that it will not be solely the U.K.'s decision.</P>
      <P>The important question, however, is not just about participation in the UNFCCC,
Campbell said. If Taiwan-- which accounts for about 1 percent of global
emissions of climate-change gases -- carefully formulates and implements its
energy policy, it will be able to transform into a low-carbon economy with
reduced carbon emissions, and this would benefit the nation's employment, he
continued.</P>
      <P>The green-energy sector is one of few sectors able to maintain positive growth
and create new jobs during the economic downturn, Campbell said.</P>
      <P>Though the U.K. is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, it was not until the
country decided to tackle the climate-change issue head-on with thorough
reviews, dialogues, policy-making and legislation that things started to change,
he said.</P>
      <P>By 2012, U.K. emissions will be down 23.5 percent from their 1990 level, which
will be a greater decrease than committed to in its Kyoto pledge, said Thomas
Phipps, policy officer of the Climate Change and Energy Group under the U.K.'s
Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</P>
      <P>Phipps said he has seen positive signs and developments during his stay in
Taiwan, where he met with Frances Liang, deputy minister of economic affairs,
and Stephen Shen, minister of the Environmental Protection Administration. He
also visited the Taiwan Power Co., the state-owned power-supply company.</P>
      <P>"I feel like they wanted to know more about how to turn energy-intensive sectors
into a part of low-carbon economy, " Phipps said of his hosts, adding that he
also saw positive signs in the legislation and passage of Taiwan's Greenhouse
Gas Reduction Act, because parts of the act are similar to the U.K.'s
regulations.</P>
      <P>It took the U.K. a decade to make significant progress in cutting carbon
emissions, Phipps noted, but added that Taiwan could take much less time to
achieve  the same result by sharing the U.K.'s experience.</P>

      <P>The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) issued a land warning for Typhoon Megi Thursday
after putting out a sea warning earlier in the day, and said the typhoon poses a
strong threat to southern Taiwan and the outlying islands.</P>
      <P>The bureau issued the warning at 5: 30 p.m. as Megi continued its northward
track toward the Taiwan Strait at 10 kph, packing maximum sustained winds of 173
kph with gusts of up to 209 kph.</P>
      <P>As of 5 p.m., Megi was centered 380 km west-southwest of Eluanbi, the
southernmost tip of Taiwan. The bureau forecast that Megi would be located 220
km southwest of Taiwan's offshore Penghu County in 24 hours.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, the areas most likely to be affected include southern
Taiwan's Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Tainan areas, as well as the outlying islands
of Penghu and Kinmen.</P>
      <P>The CWB also warned residents in southwestern Taiwan to prepare for possible sea
water intrusion, as the typhoon is coinciding with seasonal high tides.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, the death toll from Megi had risen to
27 in the Philippines. The typhoon is expected to make landfall Oct. 23 near
Shantou City in China's Guangdong Province.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, at least 160,000 people were evacuated in southern

      <P>Fishery issues would be included in upcoming cross-strait talks as part of
government efforts to protect Taiwan fishermen's rights and safety in the face
of illegal and rampant intrusions by China's steel-hulled ships, Chen Wu-hsiung,
minister of the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Relevant matters will be discussed at the upcoming seventh round of
negotiations between the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and its
Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), " Chen told the Legislative Yuan's Economics and Finance Committee.</P>
      <P>Chen said he believed the situation could be brought increasingly under control
as the Coast Guard Administration (CGA) had been working hard to that end.</P>
      <P>"So far this year, the CGA has dispersed over 7,600 Chinese steel-hulled vessels
that unlawfully entered Taiwan's waters, " he continued.</P>
      <P>Lawmakers from both ruling and opposition parties were gravely concerned about
the issue and demanded the government come up with more effective  measures to
safeguard Taiwanese  fishing boats operating in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Lee Ching-hua, fishermen from Taipei
County's Jinshan and Wanli townships had complained about their poor catches of
crabs this year due to rampant harassment by Chinese ships.</P>
      <P>"Crab prices have surged by 30 percent on the local market due to the tight
supply," he said.</P>
      <P>"China's steel-hulled boats are running amok in the Taiwan Strait,  destroying
Taiwan fishermen's crab-catching  cages and poaching all resources, " Lee said,
asking how the government had allowed the situation to deteriorate to this
point.</P>
      <P>CGA Minister Wang Ginn-wang admitted that illegal intrusions by these vessels
were taking place and promised to raise the scale of measures taken to expel
them from Taiwan's waters.</P>
      <P>"Since September the CGA has sent more vessels to protect Taiwanese fishing
boats operating in that area," he said, noting that "Chinese ships illegally
trespassing on Taiwan's waters will be apprehended and dealt with in compliance
with the law."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's night markets, part of the country's unique culture in which food takes
center stage, can also be environmentally friendly, the organizers of an
ecological expo said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Night markets are on the "must visit" list for foreign tourists, particularly
those from China.</P>
      <P>A "low-carbon" night market on the sidelines of the ECO Taiwan Expo 2010 that
opened in Taipei that day can provide the public with an opportunity to learn
how to lead a low-carbon lifestyle in daily life, said Sisy Chen, a renowned TV
talk show host and an adviser to the expo.</P>
      <P>While showcasing local signature foods and products from various cities and
counties,  the low-carbon  night market pushes the energy-saving and emission-
cutting causes, said Wang Hsing-kai, chief organizer of the night market.</P>
      <P>At the night market, which brings together 61 companies, the pork is sourced
from a pig farm that raises its stock in high, dry pens that use much less water
and electricity than traditional hog farms, with lower discharge of methane,
according to Wang.</P>
      <P>The food stand operators at the night market use groceries sourced from the
Taipei area only to cut transport costs and time, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he noted, only biodegradable food containers and tableware are used,
while consumers are also encouraged to bring their own chopsticks and spoons.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening of the ECO Taiwan Expo 2010, Chen Cheng-hsiung, chairman
of the Taiwan Printed Circuit Association, the major sponsor of the expo, said
the fair, featuring seven theme halls in seven areas, is designed to rekindle
people's awareness of the degradation of the environment and to build up a habit
of leading a low carbon lifestyle.</P>
      <P>Another attraction at the expo is the offer of free rides in the Luxgen electric
vehicle developed by a spin-off of Taiwanese veteran automaker Yulon Motor. The
cars are touted by the company as "the world's first intelligent electric
vehicles."</P>
      <P>More than 200 companies, government agencies and institutions are taking part in
the ECO Taiwan Expo, which is being held for the first time Oct. 21-23 at the
Nankang Exhibition Center.</P>
      <P>The expo features a new-generation smart grid that can help monitor how much
electricity is being used in the home. The smart grid, if combined with the
Internet and other systems, can help identify old home appliances that consume a
significant amount of power and need to be replaced, the expo organizer said.</P>

      <P>A total of 24 travel groups comprising 542 tourists were stranded following
landslides on Taiwan's eastern Suhua Highway between the townships of Suao and
Dongao late Thursday, according to tourism bureau officials.</P>
      <P>The tourism bureau confirmed that 231 of the tourists, in 12 groups, are from
China, with another group of 19 Chinese tourists unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>A series  of landslides  occurred  shortly  after  midday, interrupting the
journey of the groups.</P>
      <P>The Directorate General of Highways (DGH) said it had deployed manpower, heavy
machinery and tools to clear the way for rescue efforts. Military personnel
stationed in the area have been mobilized to provide assistance.</P>
      <P>DGH Chief Secretary-General Mile N. Chen said the bureau was hopeful that the
road could be cleared by Friday morning.</P>
      <P>It is likely to take longer to repair some other damage, however. A section of
the roadway, over 400 meters long, sank about 20 meters between the 115th and
the 116th kilometers of the scenic coastal highway, according to the DGH.</P>
      <P>Several of the tourists complained about what they described as snail-paced
rescue efforts.</P>
      <P>One tour leader who declined to give her name told reporters that her group of
34 travelers from China's Yunnan Province had been trapped since noon and were
hungry and tired.</P>
      <P>"I called the Yilan county government and related authorities until 2 p.m. but
they said they could do nothing because of the bad weather, " she said. The best
help they could offer was to "find a convenience store," she added.</P>
      <P>The landslides were triggered by heavy rain, which has battered much of eastern
Taiwan for the past few days, a result of the combined effects of Typhoon Megi's
outer rim and seasonal winds from the northeast.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said Thursday that it has no plans to
mothball its French-made Mirage fighter jets at present.</P>
      <P>The ministry was responding to a lawmaker's suggestion after he pointed out the
problems and high maintenance costs related to the plane.</P>
      <P>Legislator  Lin Yu-fang  of the ruling Kuomintang  told a legislative committee
earlier this week that during maintenance operations in May 2009, the engine
rotors of the some of the fighters were found to have cracks, resulting in
reduced flying hours.</P>
      <P>In May this year, a Mirage fighter jet belonging to the French Air Force crashed
in southwestern France, possibly due to the same engine fault, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Wang Cheng-hsiao, chief of staff of the air force, said Thursday that after
strenuous efforts, the flight readiness of the aircraft has been improved to 72
percent.</P>
      <P>"In the interests of military investment, there is no plan to mothball the
Mirage fighters," he said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan purchased 60 Mirage-2000s fighter jets from France in 1992, the last
batch of which was delivered in 2001. Fifty-six of the planes remain in service,
with four having been lost in crashes.</P>

      <P>The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has confirmed the youngest case of dengue
hemorrhagic fever so far this year along with two other new cases in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>CDC Deputy Director-General Lin Ting announced Thursday that a 4-year-old girl

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 80 percent of senior citizens aged over 60 who responded to a recent
survey agreed that exercise can help reduce stress and ease depression,
according to the poll results released Thursday.</P>
      <P>The John Tung Foundation, which has been dedicated to reducing depression among
the public since 2000, said regular exercise is the most effective and cheapest
way to fight depression.</P>
      <P>The foundation conducted the survey between Sept. 1 and Oct. 14, collecting
10,309 valid replies regarding the relationship between mental health and
exercise, and another 5,639 samples on the respondents' mental health.</P>
      <P>While 83.7 percent of the grey-haired citizens show the strong support of the
importance of exercise, more than 70 percent of which said they do up to
30-minute exercise three times per week, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Some 68.6 percent of the respondents said exercise helps fight depression, but
26.3 percent said they have not done any sport for more than three months,
compared to 50 percent who said they often do exercise to relieve stress.</P>
      <P>The survey found around that 21.2 percent of the respondents were emotionally
stable, while some 22.2 percent were relatively unstable, said Vivian Yeh,
director of the foundation's metal health division.</P>
      <P>The foundation found that 44.9 percent of the respondents were at breaking
point, with 11.8 percent requiring professional help.</P>
      <P>Among them, women suffer higher levels of depression than their male
counterparts, the survey found.</P>
      <P>Yeh noted that almost 80 percent of the workers in the service industry were
under high levels of pressure and more than 30 percent of the jobless and
students suffered from mental problems.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>An artificial reef off Taiwan's east coast has yielded a harvest of more than
230 metric tons so far this year, with value of the catch expected to grow
further, the Fisheries Research Institute under the Council of Agriculture (COA)
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The catch, worth more than NT$20 million (US$650,000) in the first nine months
of the year, was the result of a new reef floating 20-60 meters underwater off
Taitung's Hsinkang Pier, the institute announced.</P>
      <P>Offshore artificial reefs function similarly to ocean driftwood in attracting
fish, the COA website explained.</P>
      <P>The catch was particularly good in February and March, averaging more than 180
kilograms per ship per day and with top catches exceeding 400 kg, the institute
reported. Even during the low season of June, the average haul of the 30 vessels
was around 60 kg.</P>
      <P>Use of the reefs also shortens the distances boats need to travel, it also
noted, saving about 15 percent on fuel costs.</P>
      <P>There are now six such facilities along the east coast, helping to increase the
gross value of the east-coast fishing industry, the institute  responsible  for
developing  Taiwan's fishing-related technologies and research said.</P>

components,  it lacks  downstream manufacturers to provide brand-name finished
products for the global consumer market. This deficiency has been a fatal defect
in Taiwan's race against South Korea for global market share.</P>
      <P>China's new five-year plan could be a godsend for Taiwan to mend the gap. The
government should now integrate design and marketing manpower in the upper- and
mid-stream industries to develop high-end consumer products.</P>
      <P>In addition, it should cultivate an environment capable of attracting well-
managed China-based Taiwanese downstream companies to relocate to Taiwan now
that many of them are being troubled by rising wages in China.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said recently that the signing of the cross-strait
economic cooperation  framework  agreement  offers Taiwanese companies good
opportunities to market brand-name products in China. His administration should
act to make these opportunities into reality. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 22,

      <P>Heavy rain was expected to continue in many areas of Taiwan Friday as Typhoon
Megi churned its way up the island's southwestern coast, the Central Weather
Bureau (CWB) said that day.</P>
      <P>Landslides triggered by the intense and prolonged rainfall have been reported in
eastern regions.</P>
      <P>In Yilan County, 402 motorists and passengers were stranded between the 115 km
and 116 km marks on the section between Suao and Dongao townships of the Suhua
Highway, according to the Central Emergency Operation Center.</P>
      <P>The travelers, all of whom were reported safe, were aboard 32 vehicles,
including 12 tour buses, the center said.</P>
      <P>Another  group of 19 Chinese tourists,  however,  remained unaccounted for, it
added.</P>
      <P>Data released by the CWB shows that from Thursday until 10 a.m. Friday, rainfall
totalling 1,093 mm had been recorded in Suao.</P>
      <P>Due to the combined effect of Typhoon Megi's outer rim and seasonal wind,
torrential rain or extremely torrential rain, defined as 24-hour rainfall
exceeding 200 mm and 350 mm, respectively, were expected in the Yilan, Taipei
and Hualien areas Friday, forecasters said.</P>
      <P>Other areas that also likely to experience heavy rainfall included Keelung,
Taitung, Pingtung, Kaohsiung and Tainan, they said.</P>
      <P>As of 10 a.m., Megi was centered 300 km south-southwest of Penghu in the Taiwan
Strait,  moving north at 9 kph toward China's southwestern coast.</P>
      <P>The storm, packing maximum sustained wind of 162 kph and gusts of 198 kph, had

(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China unexpectedly announced a quarter-point increase in its deposit and lending
rates this week, inviting various speculation about the reasons behind the move.</P>
      <P>The main concern here is what kind of chain reaction will follow after the hikes
and in particular, whether China will continue to raise its interest rates.</P>
      <P>If Beijing does so, it will attract an influx of hot money that will push up the
value of the Chinese yuan.</P>
      <P>Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has previously warned that the country's export
sector could collapse if the yuan appreciates by 20 percent to 40 percent
against the U.S. dollar. And this situation should worry Taiwan the most because
many Taiwanese products are manufactured in China and exported from there to
other markets.</P>
      <P>A warning sign already emerged in the third quarter of this year when the value
of export orders from China dropped by 2.66 percent from the previous quarter
despite a 2.73 percent increase in the overall value. Taiwan must keep close
watch of the movement of the Chinese currency and react to it rapidly.

      <P>Shares of Ablerex Electronics Co. Ltd., a Taiwanese photovoltaic inverter
supplier, stumbled in Friday morning trading on the over-the-counter  (OTC)
market after financial authorities announced a day earlier that they will probe
its recent price volatility for signs of possible manipulation, dealers said.</P>
      <P>As of 11: 52 a.m., Ablerex had fallen 4.11 percent to NT$268.00 (US$8.71) with
877,000 shares changing hands, while the OTC index had risen 0.58 percent to
138.12 points.</P>
      <P>The recent violent fluctuations in the company's share prices after the stock
was listed on the OTC market Sept. 9 has attracted the close attention of the
Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) , the dealers said.</P>
      <P>The stock's listing price was set at NT$185 Sept. 9 and rose sharply in the
following trading sessions to hit a peak of NT$565.00 Sept. 14.</P>
      <P>However, after the peak, the stock took a dive and hit a low of NT$258.00 Oct.
19 before rebounding.</P>
      <P>Taiwan International Securities analyst Michael Chiang said after the news of
the FSC's probe surfaced that the selling of the stock came as no surprise.</P>
      <P>"Investors are afraid they will suffer more if they hold on to the stock, "
Chiang said. "It is wise for them to keep their distance from the stock at the
moment."</P>
      <P>Chiang said the FSC suspects institutional  investors have manipulated Ablerex's
share price at the cost of retail investors.</P>
      <P>"The investigation is necessary for the authorities to maintain market order and
protect investors," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang said investors should be alert when buying into high-tech stocks like
Ablerex, as optimism over their earnings outlook paves the way for their
underwriters to exaggerate company prospects to move share prices.</P>

      <P>Two tour buses were buried when landslides hit the coastal Suhua Highway in
northeastern Taiwan's Yilan County late Thursday, Interior Minister Jiang Yi-
huah said Friday.</P>
      <P>Two other buses, reportedly hit by falling rocks, remained unaccounted for,
Jiang said at a news conference held at the Central Emergency Operation Center
(CEOC).</P>
      <P>Quoting initial reports from rescuers, Jiang, who concurrently serves as CEOC
commander, said one of the buried buses was located at the 113.5 km mark of the
highway and the other was located at the 116 km mark.</P>
      <P>Rescuers were still checking two buses that witnesses said were hit by falling
rocks, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>A total of 32 automobiles carrying 402 people remained stranded Friday following
the landslides, Jiang said. Twelve of the stranded vehicles were tour buses, he
added.</P>
      <P>The landslides also caused a 500-meter long section of the roadbed to sink about
20 meters between the highway's 115 km and 116 km marks, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>The landslides were triggered by heavy rain that has battered much of eastern
Taiwan for the past few days, a result of the combined effects of Typhoon Megi's
outer rim and seasonal winds from the northeast.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau, Megi was continuing its northward track
toward the Taiwan Strait and its strength was weakening as its speed had dropped
to 9 kph.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture had as of press time issued 96 warnings about a high
possibility of creeks bursting their banks and landslides occurring in Taipei
City, Taipei County and Yilan County.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, accumulated precipitation in Yilan County's Suao Township had reached
1,064 mm as of 9 a.m. Friday, breaking the previous record of 808.5 mm recorded
in Dawu Township, southern Taiwan, during Typhoon Morakot in August 2009.</P>
      <P>Due to the heavy rain, 50 houses in Suao were destroyed by landslides, the CEOC

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said  Friday  that  it has  approved
applications  filed  by Hewlett-Packard and Interuniversity Microelectronics
Centre (IMEC) to set up research and development centers in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the two R&amp;D centers is under a MOEA incentive program
to encourage foreign high-tech companies to set up research footholds in the
country, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>According to the incentive program, which has been in place since 2002, a total
of 32 foreign companies, including Microsoft and IBM, have established 46
R&amp;D centers in Taiwan with financial aid from the MOEA.</P>
      <P>The MOEA said that after the approval, the two R&amp;D centers are expected to
start operations in three months.</P>
      <P>However, the ministry declined to comment on the size of the subsidies it will
provide to the two firms, saying that further details need to be ironed out
first.</P>
      <P>HP is one of the world's largest PC suppliers, while IMEC is a Belgium-based
nanoelectronics research institute.</P>
      <P>The ministry said the new HP R&amp;D center is aimed at integrating the
company's existing resources in Taiwan and expanding  its operations to cover
supply chain and quality management, in a bid to turn the center into a global
policymaking hub for the firm.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the IMEC R&amp;D center is expected to become the company's first

      <P>The Taipei 101 building is sure to win its platinum-degree Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design (LEED) certification -- the highest level -- by next
June, making it the world's tallest green building, its top official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taipei 101, also known as the Taipei Financial Center, "was the world's highest
building; now we hope to make it the world's tallest green building with the
highest LEED platinum certification, " said Taipei 101 Chairman Lin Hong-ming.</P>
      <P>In the past year, the board has been dedicated to improving the soft-  and
hardware facilities  of the building  to green it comprehensively, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The results show that compared with the previous year, Taipei 101 reduced its
carbon dioxide emissions by 10,000 tons, saved 3.3 million kilowatt hours of
electricity and used 30 percent less water this year.</P>
      <P>Overall, the building has achieved 7 percent energy-saving this year, Lin said,
noting that Taipei 101 earned a score of 86 points given by the building's
foreign consultants hired to give a green evaluation, which means it has reached
the LEED platinum degree that requires at least 80 points on a 100-point
measurement scale.</P>
      <P>Judging from the score, the building's board of directors "is confident the
building will achieve the LEED certification, " Lee said.</P>
      <P>Taipei 101 ranked officially as the world's tallest building from 2004 until the
opening of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai earlier this year.</P>
      <P>LEED  is  an  internationally  recognized  green  building certification system,
providing third-party verification that a building or community is designed and
built using strategies aimed at improving performance across all the parameters
that matter most: energy saving, water efficiency, CO2 emissions reduction,
improved indoor environmental quality and stewardship of resources and
sensitivity of their impacts.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Friday that the Executive Yuan will respect a
legislative resolution for a visit by legislators to the disputed Tiaoyutai
Islands next month that could add a new twist to an already-tense controversy
over the islets.</P>
      <P>The internal administration committee of the Legislative Yuan passed a
resolution Thursday to launch an inspection visit Nov. 4 to the Tiaoyutais,
which lie about 100 nautical miles off Taiwan's northeastern tip in the East
China Sea. The islands are controlled by Japan and also claimed by China and
Taiwan. They are known as the Diaoyutais in China and as the Senkaku Islands in
Japan.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question in a legislative session the previous day, Wu said the
Executive Yuan will respect the decision. However, he added, given the
complexity of the issue, the visit should be confined to waters within the
"temporary enforcement line," as suggested by Legislative Speaker Wang Jin-pyng.</P>
      <P>As the claimed exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Taiwan and Japan overlap near
the islands, Taiwan established the temporary enforcement line for the EEZ in
2003 in order to provide safe fishing grounds for Taiwanese fishermen and gain
an area of maritime jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The planned visit comes amidst a diplomatic row between China and Japan sparked
by Japan's arrest of a Chinese fishing boat skipper after his trawler collided
with two Japanese coast guard vessels in the area Sept. 7.</P>
      <P>Wu reiterated that Taiwan claims full sovereignty over the islands, but has no
intention of becoming embroiled in the issue, which could affect its overall
relations with Japan and the United States.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan does not recognize  Japan's  administrative jurisdiction over the
islands and that the government considers them to be under the administrative
jurisdiction of Toucheng Township in Yilan County, although he conceded that in
fact, the islands are indeed controlled by Japan.</P>
      <P>He was responding to a local media report that Foreign Minister Timothy C.T.
Yang said in a legislative session of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee
Oct. 14 that Japan has administrative jurisdiction of the Tiaoyutais, which was
handed over by the U.S. to Japan in 1972.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) responded to the report in a press
release Thursday, saying that the ministry filed a protest after the U.S.
handed the administrative jurisdiction of the archipelago to Japan and that its
position has remained consistent over the years.</P>

      <P>The National Freeway Bureau (NFB) had already dispatched rescue teams and

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan striving to become world's Hakka cultural hub: president</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Friday that Taiwan, with 25 percent of its
population of Hakka descent, has been striving to become the world's Hakka
cultural center.</P>
      <P>Speaking in the Hakka dialect to address the opening of a world conference of
city leaders of Hakka descent, Ma told the conference that he himself has Hakka
blood and that he is pleased to see that policies mapped out in his Hakka
cultural development platform have been implemented one after another over the
past two years.</P>
      <P>Those policies that have been realized include the passage of a Hakka Basic Law,
which allows the administration to use national resources in an ambitious plan
to turn Taiwan into a global Hakka culture research and interaction center, Ma
said.</P>
      <P>There has been a 20-percent increase in the annual budget for Hakka affairs and
trailblazing progress has also been made in efforts to conserve Hakka culture,
including zoning certain cities and townships into key Hakka culture development
districts, creating a "Hakka affairs and administration" category in the
national tests for prospective civil servants, and developing a system that
certifies the qualification of Hakka-dialect teachers, he added.</P>
      <P>According to a 2008 Council for Hakka Affairs survey, there are nearly 5.79
million Hakkas in Taiwan if a broad definition of the term is used, or about 25
percent of the country's population.</P>
      <P>Hakka, a Cantonese word which translates literally as "guest families, "
comprise a unique ethnic group of Han Chinese who fled famine and wars in
central China in centuries past and eventually settled in southern and eastern
China, predominantly in the provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi and Fujian.</P>
      <P>There are an estimated 80 million Hakkas spread out around Southeast Asia, East
Africa, Europe and the Americas, although the number of Hakka speakers is
considerably lower. Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra is one of the
most notable, while the late Mauritius Prime Minister Sir Moilin Jean Ah-Chuen
(1909-1991) , another eminent Hakka, has his picture printed on his nation's
currency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Over half of office workers bearish about investment: poll</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of Taiwan's office workers were pessimistic about Taiwan's
investment climate despite the recovering economy, a local poll showed Friday.</P>
      <P>Asked if they were optimistic about the investment climate in the short term, 59
percent of white-collar workers surveyed by the Taipei-based 1111 Job Bank
responded negatively.</P>
      <P>Similarly, 52 percent of respondents said they did not have improved willingness
to invest in the near term.</P>
      <P>Given that Taiwan's economy had posted a second double-digit quarterly growth in
a row this year -- 13.71 percent in the first quarter and 12.53 percent in the
second quarter ending June 30 -- Henry Ho, the online employment agent's public
relations director, blamed the pessimism on a lack of wage increases.</P>
      <P>"Although it is generally believed that the business climate has improved a lot,
many local wage earners have not enjoyed a pay raise and are not that optimistic
as a result," he told reporters.</P>
      <P>Ho said that 39 percent of office workers polled said they had not received a
pay raise in at least three years. Of the 47 percent who had seen their wages
grow over the same period, three-fifths had received pay raises of less than 5
percent, he added.</P>
      <P>The poll also showed that 31 percent of people surveyed said their annual wage
level had not yet returned to the 2008 level when the global financial crisis
hit, with another 44 percent saying they now earn as much as they did in 2008</P>
      <P>If other sources of income were included, however, 56 percent of respondents
said their annual income was yet to return to its pre-crisis level. Twenty-nine
percent of workers polled admitted to additional sources of income.</P>
      <P>The poll indicated  that 89 percent  of respondents  were dissatisfied with
their current annual income.</P>
      <P>Regarding the lack of wage increases, Peter Wu, director of human resources at
realtor Evertrust Rehouse Group, told reporters that the recent increase in
company profits did not necessarily lead to employees' pay raises as companies
also had to take costs into consideration.</P>
      <P>Using his own company as an example, Wu said that Evertrust focused on
employees' welfare instead by investing more in training, company tours and
annual bonuses.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou asked rescuers Friday to find a way to deliver food,
water and warm clothing to a group of motorists and tourists stranded on the
Suhua Highway in eastern Taiwan by landslides triggered by Typhoon Megi.</P>
      <P>"The supplies should be delivered to the victims as soon as possible, either by
airlift or by road,"  Ma said during a visit to the Central Emergency Operation
Center (CEOC).</P>
      <P>He also ordered the military to consider if additional forces should be deployed
to speed up the rescue operation.</P>
      <P>According to information obtained by the CEOC, 402 stranded travelers were found
between the 115 km and 116 km marks on the section of highway between Yilan's
Suao and Dongao townships that was hit by landslides Thursday amid intense and
prolonged rainfall caused by the typhoon, coupled with a seasonal weather front.</P>
      <P>The victims, all of whom were reported safe, were traveling in 32 vehicles,
including 12 tour buses.</P>
      <P>As of Friday afternoon, the National Airbone Service Corps (NASC) had rescued 33
of them and had airlifted them to three hospitals in Yilan and Hualien counties.</P>
      <P>At 2: 45 p.m., a tour bus that had been damaged by falling rocks was found 100
meters down a ravine at the 112.8 km mark of the highway. No people were inside,
rescuers said.</P>
      <P>The NASC had tried to launch several airlift missions from Hualien to try to
deliver food and water to the stranded travelers since Friday morning, but all
the missions were aborted due to poor visibility over Hualien.</P>
      <P>Two S70 helicopters dispatched by the military from Taipei, carrying dried food
and mineral water, managed to reach the 114 km mark of the highway at around
noon. A CH47 helicopter with a larger load capacity also made a flight that
afternoon to help evacuate the stranded travelers, the National Defense Ministry
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ground forces were sent to the 112 km, 114 km and 116 km marks of the
highway to deliver bread and dry food to the victims via line throwers. Insulin
was also sent to two diabetics among the stranded people, according to the
ministry.</P>

    <DATELINE>10/22/10  17:54:21
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Torrential rains brought by Typhoon Megi rattled northeastern Taiwan Thursday,
triggering serious rockslides on the coastal Suhua Highway that stranded more
than 400 travelers, including Chinese tourists.</P>
      <P>According to newspaper reports, a Chinese tour leader and a Taiwanese driver
were killed when falling rocks hit a Hong Tai Tour Co. bus near Dongao in Yilan
County Thursday.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the storm disaster:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Twenty-three Chinese tour groups consisting of 274 tourists were stranded on the
Suhua Highway overnight as landslides and rockslides blocked traffic.</P>
      <P>The Yilan County Fire Department received reports late Thursday that three
vehicles fell off cliffs along the seriously damaged roadway, but the department
had yet to confirm the reports.</P>
      <P>Minister of Transportation  and Communications  Mao Chi-kuo traveled to the
county's Suao Township to take command of disaster relief operations as about 30
vehicles with 96 people were trapped in the nearby Nanfangao area.</P>
      <P>A Chinese tour leader who was leading a tour group of 16 people from Guizhou and
Hubei provinces said he and his group were scared when mudslides hit their tour
bus.</P>
      <P>"We broke windows to get out just before mudflows buried our bus," said the tour
leader identified only by his family name Fan.</P>
      <P>Heavy downpours began battering southern Yilan County at 10 a.m. Thursday. Flash
floods soon submerged Suao's downtown area, with its main streets turned into
rivers.</P>
      <P>Scared residents had to rush to the third-or-higher floors of residential
buildings to wait for assistance.</P>
      <P>The county government did not announce the closure of public offices and schools
until 2 p.m. Thursday. By then,  several elementary schools had already been
swamped by floodwaters, forcing students and teachers to stay on the premises
until late at night when rescuers finally helped evacuate them. (Oct. 22, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Three Yilan townships -- Suao, Nanao and Yuanshan -- were the hardest-hit
regions. Suao's downtown district became a "ghost town" after all residents were
evacuated amid torrential downpours.</P>
      <P>Yilan County Magistrate Lin Tsung-hsien said the deluge was stunning and rarely
seen in a century.</P>
      <P>More than 1,000 passengers were stranded at Yilan County's Yunglo station for
five hours Thursday after the Taiwan Railway's North-Link Line suspended service
due to flooding. The passengers were not sent back to Hualien County in eastern
Taiwan until late in the day.</P>
      <P>Due to the convergence of Typhoon Megi's periphery and seasonal winds, Suao
received 939 millimeters in rainfall between midnight Wednesday and midnight
Thursday, the most ever in Taiwan for a single day.</P>
      <P>The previous record was recorded on Aug. 8, 2009 at the Dawu weather station in
Taitung County, when Typhoon Morakot devastated southern and southeastern
Taiwan. (Oct. 22, 2010).</P>

      <P>An English translation of novelettes by Lai He, the "father of Taiwanese new
literature," was published Friday in an attempt to introduce early Taiwanese
literary works to a wider international audience, announced the Council for
Hakka Affairs (CHA).</P>
      <P>"Lai He Fiction" contains 21 short stories penned by Lai, a renowned author of
Hakka ancestry who, because of his sympathy for the poor during the Japanese
colonial period, was also nicknamed the "Matsu of Changhua" in reference to the
compassionate Taoist deity.</P>
      <P>His works also offered valuable insights into society at that time, said CHA
Minister Huang Yu-chen.</P>
      <P>"Lai He was an important figure in the development of Taiwan literature because
his work dug into the lives of Taiwanese commoners and his persistency in
writing reminded us of the Hakka spirit," said Huang.</P>
      <P>"I often heard people say that Lai's work wasn't easy to read. The language
shifts repeatedly between Mandarin and Hoklo Taiwanese, and a good knowledge of
the socio-historical background is required of readers," admitted Lai Yueh-yen,
the author's eldest grandson and founder of the Lai He Museum.</P>
      <P>Readers of this English version are fortunate, therefore, that its translator is
Joe Hung, veteran journalist, social commentator and educator, who has just such
a deep knowledge of Taiwan's social history.</P>
      <P>"We are pleased to say that Central News Agency (CNA) Chairman Joe Hung, who is
well versed in English, Chinese and Japanese, did a wonderful job in presenting
this Taiwanese classic to English readers, " Huang said, noting that this was
the first English publication of stories by Hakka authors sponsored by the CHA.</P>
      <P>Prior to its publication by the CNA, the work appeared in series in Hung's old
newspaper, the China Post, five days per week for six months.</P>
      <P>"It was well received by readers," said the Post's director and publisher, Jack
Huang. "We used to get calls from our readers asking why the stories are not
printed on weekends."</P>
      <P>This was a big step forward for Hakka authors whose writings deserve
international attention, said Huang Yu-chen, explaining that Hakka literature
might even be recognized for the Noble Prize in Literature if translated into
English.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The heavy rains brought by Typhoon Megi had caused NT$11.3 million in losses in
the agricultural sectors of Taiwan's three eastern counties as of 8 a.m. Friday,
the Council of Agriculture (COA) said.</P>
      <P>Losses totaled NT$9 million in Hualien County, NT$1.58 million in Taitung County
and NT$700,000 in Yilan County, which experienced the heaviest rainfall of any
county in Taiwan on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Torrential rains caused by the convergence of the periphery of the typhoon and
seasonal winds from the northeast led to the flooding of 76 hectares of farmland
in the counties, which damaged 47 percent of the crops worth an estimated
NT$3.96 million grown on that land.</P>
      <P>The persistent rainfall in northern and eastern Taiwan that began Tuesday
affected vegetable prices in Taipei's wholesale market Friday, with the average
price rising by 24.9 percent to NT$29.1 per kilogram, from NT$23.3 per kilogram
the previous day.</P>
      <P>The volume of vegetables sold at the market fell by 18.7 percent Friday, which
Agriculture and Food Agency Secretary-General Hsu Han-ching attributed to a
shortfall of supply from agricultural parts of Yilan County.</P>
      <P>"Cabbages produced in Yilan generally could not be shipped to Taipei because
roads in the area were cut off by storm damage, " he said.</P>
      <P>The heavy rainfall also caused damage to 19 schools around Taiwan, mostly in
Yilan County, the Ministry of Education reported.</P>
      <P>As of Friday noon, affected schools in Yilan had reported NT$4.17 million in
damage, with some facilities still being evaluated, the ministry said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan depositary receipts (TDRs) of United Envirotech Ltd., a water-
treatment firm from Singapore, rose sharply higher on the first day of trading
on an upbeat mood toward its business in China, dealers said.</P>
      <P>United Envirotech closed up 6.71 percent at NT$16.70 (US$0.54) with 52,000
shares changing hands, while Taiwan's benchmark weighted index rose 0.45 percent
to 8,168.06.</P>
      <P>"Most of the company's sales are generated from China, " Grand Cathay Securities
analyst Mars Hsu said. "The wastewater-treatment market in China is growing
rapidly on rising demand for this particular business in a booming economy."</P>
      <P>Noting that the local high-tech sector was losing luster amid concerns over
earnings outlook, investors were targeting safe havens, like United Envirotech,
to park their money, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"The gains are expected to continue over the next few sessions as the interest
is expected not to fade very soon," he said.</P>
      <P>So far this year, China has accounted for 88.94 percent of the company's total

      <P>History Channel Asia will premiere its new series, Hidden Cities, later this
month with four episodes on cities in four Asian nations, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Starting Oct. 24, Hidden Cities will explore some of Asia's many secrets, from
forgotten palaces and old buildings with undiscovered histories, to underground
fortresses that shelter incredible relics and untold stories, announced the TV
channel through a Taipei public relations company on Friday.</P>
      <P>In the first four episodes, the network's first series produced in Asia, host
Anthony Morse travels to China's capital of Beijing; Malaysia's northwest states
of Penang, Ipoh and Kedah; Java in Indonesia; and various places around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For the Taiwan episode, Morse went to the mausoleum of presidents Chiang Kai-
shek and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, at Cihu (Lake Mercy) in Taoyuan County. He
also met with Weng Yuan, who served as a member of the staff at the late
presidents' residences.</P>
      <P>Weng told Morse that Chiang Kai-shek liked to stroll and sit beside the lake
around 5 p.m. each evening to contemplate and enjoy a quiet moment. Once
forbidden to outsiders, the lake has opened to the public in recent years.</P>
      <P>Morse and his camera crew next explored Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen, also
known as Quemoy, the anti-communist bastion where, more than five decades ago,
Taiwan troops fought the last battle against the Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA).</P>
      <P>The crew explored Kinmen's maze of underground tunnels dating from the Cold-War
standoff, savored the island's famous sorghum liquor, and learned how to make
kitchen knives out of PLA bombs dropped on Kinmen, which is located as close as
2 kilometers to the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Morse finally visited a beach village in Hualien on Taiwan's east coast that was
once off-limits to Taiwanese people as it was home to Japanese prisoners and
their dependants in the aftermath of World War II.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan episode is scheduled to be screened Nov. 14, according to the public
relations company. The 30-year-old Morse, born to an American father and Burmese
mother, will come to Taiwan Oct. 31 to promote the series, it said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.45 percent Friday in a narrow range as buying
rotated to select the stocks of large-cap old-economy firms on renewed optimism
toward their closer business ties with China, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 36.83 points to 8,168.06, after moving between 8,148.26
and 8,174.03 on turnover of NT$103.35 billion (US$3. 36 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.40 percent, and interest in bellwether petrochemical
stocks, in particular the firms under the conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group,
continued on hopes that their bottom lines would be boosted by China investments
amid increasing cross-strait exchanges, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,894 stocks closed up, 1,815 down, and 403 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The plastics and chemical sector witnessed the largest gains, up 0.91 percent.
Cement firms rose 0.72 percent,  machinery and electronics stocks added 0.57
percent, financial shares gained 0.16 percent, and construction stocks closed up
0.09 percent.</P>
      <P>Among those falling, the textile sector fell 1.4 percent, foodstuffs lost 0.65
percent, and paper and pulp stocks closed down 0.56 percent.</P>
      <P>"Ahead of the strong technical resistance at around 8,200 points, the market
remained in consolidation mode despite the gains,"  Arch Shih of TLG Asset
Management said.</P>
      <P>Shih said market sentiment remained cautious as investors have been waiting to
see what central bankers and financial ministers of the Group of 20 nations will
conclude on the global currency market in a meeting to be held in South Korea
Friday and Saturday.</P>
      <P>While large-cap petrochemical stocks, such as Formosa Plastics and Nan Ya
Plastics, posted gains, their strength was not sufficient to pull the broader
market out of the current range trade, Shih said.</P>
      <P>"The market  still lacks a mainstream  sector  to make a breakthrough, " Shih
added, referring to a lackluster electronics sector.</P>
      <P>Formosa Plastics rose 1.56 percent to NT$84.50, and Nan Ya Plastics gained 1.19
percent to NT$68.20.</P>
      <P>Largan Precision, the world's largest supplier of lenses for cellphone cameras,
rose 1.81 percent to NT$618.00, after the company said sales for the fourth
quarter would continue to grow on higher demand for smartphones.</P>

      <P>A rescue footpath was constructed to bypass the Suhua Highway between the 112
and 114 kilometer markers, thereby allowing travelers stranded on the northern
section to walk to a nearby aid station, Mile N. Chen, chief secretary-general
of the Directorate General of Highways (DGH) said Friday.</P>
      <P>As for the wounded, the weak and those remaining stranded on the southern
section of highway, a preferable option would be the use of helicopters, Chen
told a news conference.</P>
      <P>The DGH said it hoped to restore a 20-meter-long collapsed section of roadbed
around the 113km mark within a week, while clarifying that another collapsed
section around the 116km mark, initially reported to be 500 meters in length,
proved to be just 70 meters long. The rest of the section was found to be
blocked by rocks and mud.</P>
      <P>Ambulances and cars, along with bottled water and 200 meal servings, were ready
for the stranded travelers at the aid station, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>"We will first evacuate the stranded travelers to Suao Harbor Bureau and then
transport them to different destinations," he added. enitem/MH</P>

      <P>Taiwan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell for the 13th consecutive
month in September, helped by a drop in the number of people left jobless
because of downsizings or company shutdowns, the country's statistics agency
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The adjusted employment rate fell to 5.08 percent, down 0.03 percentage points
from August, said Liu Tian-shy, deputy director of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>The nominal jobless rate in September fell to 5.05 percent, down 0.12 percentage
points from August, and Liu said it could meet the government's stated goal of
falling below 5 percent by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The number of people left jobless because of company downsizings or closures
totaled 199,000 in September, 16,000 fewer than in August and the first time the
figure had fallen below 200,000 since October 2008, when the global economic
meltdown was just beginning.</P>
      <P>The number reached a peak at 355,000 in June 2009.</P>
      <P>The September decline in the overall jobless rate matches the trends of previous
years, Liu said, and he estimated that the number of unemployed would have to
fall by 4,000 for the jobless rate to fall below 5 percent by the end of 2010.</P>
      <P>Despite the improving unemployment figures, Taiwan's jobless rate is still
higher than that of the other Asian Tigers. Unemployment is at 3.7 percent in
South Korea, 2.2 percent in Singapore and 4.2 percent in Hong Kong.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Back home for the first time since the end of the Major League Baseball season,
Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Kuo Hong-chih attributed his record-setting season
to "pure luck" and said he hoped to help his team get back into the playoffs
next year.</P>
      <P>"I would like to return to Taiwan at a later date next year," Kuo said at a
press conference attended by some 100 reporters, alluding to his desire to have
the Dodgers remain active into the post-season in 2011.</P>
      <P>The Dodgers finished the season 80-82, fourth in the five-team National League
West Division, after having made the National League Championship Series the
previous two seasons.</P>
      <P>But the team's drop-off was not because of Kuo. The 29-year-old left-hander had
his best year since first making the Dodgers roster in 2005, finishing with a
3-2 record and 12 saves in 56 appearances and becoming the first Taiwanese
player to earn a spot in the All-Star Game.</P>
      <P>His ERA of 1.20 was also the lowest in franchise history for pitchers with at
least 50 innings pitched, and he was nominated for the "Setup Man of the Year"
award.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions posed by fans in an online Internet chat room, which was
opened at the same time as the press conference, Kuo politely attributed his
success to "pure luck" and said he was happy as long as he was able to play the
game after nearly having his career ended by four elbow operations.</P>
      <P>Kuo said his most memorable performance of the year was a two-inning outing in a
3-1 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on July 4, when he struck out all six
batters he faced.</P>
      <P>Reflecting on his experience in the All-Star Game, Kuo said he was nervous
because he didn't know what to do and where to go.</P>
      <P>"I felt like I became a fan again and was busy taking photos with those big-name
players, " he said.</P>
      <P>The 29-year-old gave credit to first baseman James Loney and pitchers Chad
Billingsley and Jonathon Broxton for their friendship, which helped him get
through the long season. He added that fan support was also a big help.</P>
      <P>"I thought of giving up, honestly. But I'm not a person who gives up easily, and
I always tell myself that I have to keep fighting because I represent my country
of Taiwan in the MLB to some extent, " Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The left-hander, who started the 2010 season as a setup man but was installed as
a closer in mid-August in place of the struggling Braxton, said he would not
mind shifting between the two roles next year, even though "being a closer
brings you so much pressure because you're supposed to finish it off."</P>
      <P>Kuo said he hopes to continue playing in the United States for another 5-10
years, but "the most important thing for me, first and foremost, is to help my
team win."</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih apologized Friday for the poor upkeep of the Suhua Highway
and said construction of the Suhua Freeway could began next year providing the
project passes the environmental impact assessment by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Built in 1932 during the period of Japanese rule, the highway was now in a
shoddy condition,  the premier  acknowledged  at an interpellation session at
the Legislative Yuan.  This made it susceptible to collapse, frequent rock
slides and blockage by fallen debris, particularly during inclement weather, he
said.</P>
      <P>"I must offer my sincere apology to the people stranded on the highway for the
inadequate maintenance of the Suhua Highway, " said Wu.</P>
      <P>The main highway in eastern Taiwan was struck by landslides Thursday, causing
casulties and hundreds of travlers to be stranded or trapped.</P>
      <P>As of late Friday afternoon, a 21-person Chinese group touring Taiwan with the
Harula Travel Co. and last known to be traveling on the highway remained
unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>In a separate incident, a Chinese tour leader and a Taiwanese driver with the
Hong Tai Travel Company were also still missing.</P>
      <P>Parts of their tour bus had been located along the highway, said the Interior
Minister Jiang Yi-hua, who speculated the pair might have fallen out of the bus
as it tumbled. The 19 Chinese tourists in the group were safe.</P>
      <P>Around 400 people had been stranded on the popular scenic route, and by 7: 00
p.m. Friday, 330 had been transported by vehicle or helicopter to shelters, the
Tourism Bureau announced, quoting the latest figures from the Central Emergency
Operation Center. Of those rescued, 233 are tourists from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The military dispatched 90 rescuers to the location as the torrential rainstorm
brought by Typhoon Megi continued to pound the area.</P>
      <P>Harula Travel Co. said that families of the missing Chinese tourists had been
contacted, and a group representing the families will arrive at Taiwan tomorrow.</P>
      <P>A new Suhua Freeway project has been fiercely opposed by environmental groups,
who argue that the construction will jeopardize local ecosystems. They suggest
the government should instead invest in a train route, which would relieve
traffic as well as producing 90 percent less carbon emissions than cars.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's government is sending a delegation to the United States on Sunday that

      <P>Thursday's deadly disruptions to traffic on the Suhua Highway caused by
torrential rains have rekindled interest in improving the accident-prone
roadway, but environmentalists said Friday that priority should be given to
expanding eastern Taiwan's railway line.</P>
      <P>"There are many ways to get home, " said Tsai Chung-yueh, the spokesman for an
alliance opposing the construction of a freeway along the scenic coast between
Yilan and Hualien counties out of concern for the environment.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that while the heavy rain completely blocked traffic on the Suhua
Highway and left 23 people unaccounted for on Thursday and Friday, it only
caused the railway connecting Taipei and Hualien to shut down for half a day on
Thursday before resuming service.</P>
      <P>He said that was because the construction of a railway has a smaller impact on
the surrounding terrain than a roadway, and he advocated prioritizing plans to
expand the railway system rather than pumping more money into improving the
Suhua Highway.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, lawmakers urged the government to launch as soon as possible
a planned project to upgrade the mountain section of the windy highway, which is
highly vulnerable to rockslides and landslides during stormy weather.</P>
      <P>"The government is obliged to build a road that allows Hualien residents to
travel home safely, " said Legislator Wang Ting-son of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications originally planned to build a
new freeway between Suao and Hualien that would have bypassed the old highway,
but it was nixed after drawing strong opposition from environmental activists.</P>
      <P>The agency then proposed its plan to upgrade the existing road, reinforcing it
where possible and bypassing some of the most dangerous sections with tunnels or
other new roads.</P>
      <P>The proposal is currently undergoing an environmental impact assessment.</P>

      <P>The Directorate General of Highways (DGH) on Friday blamed the suddenness of the
heavy downpour for landslides that stranded hundreds of travlers on a major
highway in eastern Taiwan, some of whom are still unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>DGH Chief Secretary-General Mile N. Chen admitted that there is room for
improvement when asked by reporters why the authority didn't close the Suhua
Highway as the area was battered by torrential rain Thursday.</P>
      <P>A recently-installed geographic information system (GIS) couldn't have warned
motorists in advance because it was unable to determine the extreme nature of
the rainfall in time to issue an alert.</P>
      <P>It usually takes us two to three hours to collect the data but the heavy rain
really came all of sudden,Chen said, adding that the DGH's rescue capacity has
been overwhelmed by extreme weather when similar incidents happened in recent
years.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau, the hourly accumulated precipitation in
Suao skyrocketed to 181.5 mm between 1 to 2 p.m. Thursday, around the time when
a series of landslides took place along the highway between the townships of
Suao and Dongao.</P>
      <P>The precipitation marked the third highest record for the nation, the CWB said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the DGH might consider setting up several barricades  along  the
highway  in the future  under  similar circumstances so they could deploy
manpower to close off sections of the road.</P>
      <P>Given the length of the highway, which is 118 km, Chen said that management of
any mandatory closure would be highly challenging.</P>
      <P>There have been around 200 blockings on the Suhua Highway due to bad weather
since 2002, according to DGH data.</P>

      <P>Those among the 70 people rescued who needed medical attention were airlifted to

      <P>Efforts to get the remaining 330 people to safety was continuing through Friday

      <P>The number of job openings available in Taiwan have grown on a year-on-year
basis for 11 consecutive months, a local online employment agency said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based 1111 Job Bank declined to offer specific job figures, however,
citing business confidentiality.</P>
      <P>The agency said in a statement that the number of job openings available  during
the past seven months,  have posted average year-on-year monthly growth of 30
percent.</P>
      <P>The number of jobs available grew especially sharply in a few specific
industries, rising 80.28 year-on-year in the old economy manufacturing sector,
77.65 percent in the restaurant, hairdressing and beauty care sector, and 64.35
percent in the construction and real estate sector, the job bank said.</P>
      <P>The statement came hours after Taiwan's statistics  agency reported that the
country's adjusted unemployment rate fell for the 13th consecutive month to 5.08
percent in September, helped by a drop in the number of people left jobless
because of downsizings or company shutdowns.</P>
      <P>Despite the prolonged decline in the jobless rate, however, it has remained
stubbornly above 5 percent, even with the many job openings that have become
available in 2010.</P>
      <P>Henry Ho, the agency's public relations director, said the disparity showed that
the majority of jobs available in Taiwan are created by only a limited number of

      <P>Seven people were killed by a mudslide and another 23 traveling on a coastal
highway remained unaccounted for as of Friday night after northeastern Taiwan
was battered by heavy rains brought by Typhoon Megi.</P>
      <P>The Central Emergency Operation Center said seven corpses were recovered from a
house in Suao that was buried by a mudslide.</P>
      <P>The missing people were on the Suhua Highway connecting Yilan and Hualien
counties when traffic on the roadway was disrupted by torrential rain and
landslides Thursday.</P>
      <P>Those listed as missing included a 19-person tour group from southern China's
Guangdong Province, which was last known to be traveling aboard a tour bus on
the highway during Thursday's blinding rainstorm.</P>
      <P>The group's Taiwanese tour guide and its Taiwanese bus driver also have been
listed as missing.</P>
      <P>The Chinese leader of a tour group from Beijing and its Taiwanese bus driver
were also unaccounted for after their bus was buried by a landslide on the
highway.</P>
      <P>The buried bus was located by rescue workers, but neither of the two were found
inside.</P>
      <P>The rockslides and mudslides along the highway triggered by the torrential rains
brought by Typhoon Megi also stranded around 430 travelers overnight Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Defense Ministry mobilized hundreds of soldiers and SWAT team members to
remove rocks and build an emergency road to evacuate those stranded. Helicopters
also helped airlifted scores of travelers to safety during the day.</P>
      <P>By Friday evening, most of those not airlifted to safety walked approximately
1.2 kilometers to the entry of the emergency road and were driven to Yilan City.</P>
      <P>Fifty-three others decided, however, not to walk the distance, electing instead
to spend another night at a safe location on the highway accompanied by SWAT
teams and be airlifted away the following day.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih apologized Friday for the poor upkeep of the highway built in
1932 during Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a legislative session, Wu also said that a project to improve the
more vulnerable sections of the highway Yilan County and neighboring Hualien
County in eastern Taiwan could begin next year providing the project passes an

      <P>Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Highways admitted Friday that there was
room for improvement when asked why the agency did not close off the accident-
prone highway before the area was hit by torrential rains.</P>
      <P>It also forecast that the highway would not be fully repaired until Nov. 20.</P>
      <P>Due to the convergence of stormy weather on Typhoon Megi's periphery and
seasonal winds from the northeast, Yilan County has received a staggering amount
of rainfall in the past few days.</P>
      <P>The county's Suao area received 939 millimeters in rainfall between midnight
Wednesday and midnight Thursday, the most ever in Taiwan for a single day, the
Central Weather Bureau said Friday.</P>
      <P>The previous record was recorded on Aug. 8, 2009 at the Dawu weather station in
Taitung County, when Typhoon Morakot devastated southern and southeastern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Many parts of the county were submerged in flash floodwaters Thursday.</P>
      <P>As of 3 p.m. Friday, Typhoon Megi-related agricultural losses were estimated at
NT$45.86 million in four counties around Taiwan, according to the Council of

gift for his family and shared them along with his own water to help the group
members ward off hunger and thirst.</P>
      <P>His generosity was received with heartfelt thanks by the Chinese tourists even
though each of them got only two pieces of biscuit and a little bit of water,
said Zhu.</P>
      <P>According to Zhu, they weren't able to sleep and spent the night keeping up each
other's spirits waiting for rescue.</P>
      <P>They were finally lifted to safety by helicopter at 3.30 pm Friday.</P>
      <P>The group's plan to visit the National Palace Museum in Taipei has been
rescheduled to Saturday morning, after which they will return to China.</P>
      <P>They are just one of a number of groups of Chinese nationals who needed rescuing
from a section of the Suhua Highway destroyed by landslides after heavy
rainfalls from Typhoon Megi.</P>

      <P>An English translation of novelettes by Lai He, the "father of Taiwanese new
literature," was published Friday in an attempt to introduce early Taiwanese
literary works to a wider international audience, announced the Council for
Hakka Affairs (CHA).</P>
      <P>"Lai He Fiction" contains 21 short stories penned by Lai, a renowned author of
Hakka ancestry who, because of his sympathy for the poor during the Japanese
colonial period, was also nicknamed the "Matsu of Changhua" in reference to the
compassionate Taoist deity.</P>
      <P>His works also offered valuable insights into society at that time, said CHA
Minister Huang Yu-chen.</P>
      <P>"Lai He was an important figure in the development of Taiwan literature because
his work dug into the lives of Taiwanese commoners and his persistency in
writing reminded us of the Hakka spirit," said Huang.</P>
      <P>"I often heard people say that Lai's work wasn't easy to read. The language
shifts repeatedly between Mandarin and Hoklo Taiwanese, and a good knowledge of
the socio-historical background is required of readers," admitted Lai Yueh-yen,
the author's eldest grandson and founder of the Lai He Museum.</P>
      <P>Readers of this English version are fortunate, therefore, that its translator is
Joe Hung, veteran journalist, social commentator and educator, who has just such
a deep knowledge of Taiwan's social history.</P>
      <P>"We are pleased to say that Central News Agency (CNA) Chairman Joe Hung, who is
well versed in English, Chinese and Japanese, did a wonderful job in presenting
this Taiwanese classic to English readers, " Huang said, noting that this was
the first English publication of stories by Hakka authors sponsored by the CHA.</P>
      <P>Prior to its publication by the CNA, the work appeared in series in Hung's old
newspaper, the China Post, five days per week for six months.</P>
      <P>"It was well received by readers," said the Post's director and publisher, Jack
Huang. "We used to get calls from our readers asking why the stories are not
printed on weekends."</P>
      <P>This was a big step forward for Hakka authors whose writings deserve
international attention, said Huang Yu-chen, explaining that Hakka literature
might even be recognized for the Noble Prize in Literature if translated into
English.</P>

      <P>The heavy rains brought by Typhoon Megi had caused NT$11.3 million in losses in
the agricultural sectors of Taiwan's three eastern counties as of 8 a.m. Friday,
the Council of Agriculture (COA) said.</P>
      <P>Losses totaled NT$9 million in Hualien County, NT$1.58 million in Taitung County
and NT$700,000 in Yilan County, which experienced the heaviest rainfall of any
county in Taiwan on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Torrential rains caused by the convergence of the periphery of the typhoon and
seasonal winds from the northeast led to the flooding of 76 hectares of farmland
in the counties, which damaged 47 percent of the crops worth an estimated
NT$3.96 million grown on that land.</P>
      <P>The persistent rainfall in northern and eastern Taiwan that began Tuesday
affected vegetable prices in Taipei's wholesale market Friday, with the average
price rising by 24.9 percent to NT$29.1 per kilogram, from NT$23.3 per kilogram
the previous day.</P>
      <P>The volume of vegetables sold at the market fell by 18.7 percent Friday, which
Agriculture and Food Agency Secretary-General Hsu Han-ching attributed to a
shortfall of supply from agricultural parts of Yilan County.</P>
      <P>"Cabbages produced in Yilan generally could not be shipped to Taipei because
roads in the area were cut off by storm damage, " he said.</P>
      <P>The heavy rainfall also caused damage to 19 schools around Taiwan, mostly in
Yilan County, the Ministry of Education reported.</P>
      <P>As of Friday noon, affected schools in Yilan had reported NT$4.17 million in
damage, with some facilities still being evaluated, the ministry said.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan depositary receipts (TDRs) of United Envirotech Ltd., a water-
treatment firm from Singapore, rose sharply higher on the first day of trading
on an upbeat mood toward its business in China, dealers said.</P>
      <P>United Envirotech closed up 6.71 percent at NT$16.70 (US$0.54) with 52,000
shares changing hands, while Taiwan's benchmark weighted index rose 0.45 percent
to 8,168.06.</P>
      <P>"Most of the company's sales are generated from China, " Grand Cathay Securities
analyst Mars Hsu said. "The wastewater-treatment market in China is growing
rapidly on rising demand for this particular business in a booming economy."</P>
      <P>Noting that the local high-tech sector was losing luster amid concerns over
earnings outlook, investors were targeting safe havens, like United Envirotech,
to park their money, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"The gains are expected to continue over the next few sessions as the interest
is expected not to fade very soon," he said.</P>
      <P>So far this year, China has accounted for 88.94 percent of the company's total
revenues, up from 80.03 percent in 2008, according to the company.</P>
      <P>Before the listing, the company's 32 million TDRs were about 44 times
oversubscribed in the underwriting stage, indicating investor enthusiasm toward
the stock.</P>
      <P>United Envirotech's major customers in China include China Petroleum &amp;
Chemical Corp. (Sinopec) , China National Offshore Oil Corp., China National
Petroleum Corp. and various city governments.</P>
      <P>During the April 2008-March 2009 period, United Envirotech posted S$14.85

    <TEXT>
      <P>History Channel Asia will premiere its new series, Hidden Cities, later this
month with four episodes on cities in four Asian nations, including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Starting Oct. 24, Hidden Cities will explore some of Asia's many secrets, from
forgotten palaces and old buildings with undiscovered histories, to underground
fortresses that shelter incredible relics and untold stories, announced the TV
channel through a Taipei public relations company on Friday.</P>
      <P>In the first four episodes, the network's first series produced in Asia, host
Anthony Morse travels to China's capital of Beijing; Malaysia's northwest states
of Penang, Ipoh and Kedah; Java in Indonesia; and various places around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For the Taiwan episode, Morse went to the mausoleum of presidents Chiang Kai-
shek and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, at Cihu (Lake Mercy) in Taoyuan County. He
also met with Weng Yuan, who served as a member of the staff at the late
presidents' residences.</P>
      <P>Weng told Morse that Chiang Kai-shek liked to stroll and sit beside the lake
around 5 p.m. each evening to contemplate and enjoy a quiet moment. Once
forbidden to outsiders, the lake has opened to the public in recent years.</P>
      <P>Morse and his camera crew next explored Taiwan's outlying island of Kinmen, also
known as Quemoy, the anti-communist bastion where, more than five decades ago,
Taiwan troops fought the last battle against the Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA).</P>
      <P>The crew explored Kinmen's maze of underground tunnels dating from the Cold-War
standoff, savored the island's famous sorghum liquor, and learned how to make
kitchen knives out of PLA bombs dropped on Kinmen, which is located as close as
2 kilometers to the Chinese mainland.</P>
      <P>Morse finally visited a beach village in Hualien on Taiwan's east coast that was
once off-limits to Taiwanese people as it was home to Japanese prisoners and
their dependants in the aftermath of World War II.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan episode is scheduled to be screened Nov. 14, according to the public
relations company. The 30-year-old Morse, born to an American father and Burmese
mother, will come to Taiwan Oct. 31 to promote the series, it said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.45 percent Friday in a narrow range as buying
rotated to select the stocks of large-cap old-economy firms on renewed optimism
toward their closer business ties with China, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 36.83 points to 8,168.06, after moving between 8,148.26
and 8,174.03 on turnover of NT$103.35 billion (US$3. 36 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.40 percent, and interest in bellwether petrochemical
stocks, in particular the firms under the conglomerate Formosa Plastics Group,
continued on hopes that their bottom lines would be boosted by China investments
amid increasing cross-strait exchanges, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,894 stocks closed up, 1,815 down, and 403 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The plastics and chemical sector witnessed the largest gains, up 0.91 percent.
Cement firms rose 0.72 percent,  machinery and electronics stocks added 0.57
percent, financial shares gained 0.16 percent, and construction stocks closed up
0.09 percent.</P>
      <P>Among those falling, the textile sector fell 1.4 percent, foodstuffs lost 0.65
percent, and paper and pulp stocks closed down 0.56 percent.</P>
      <P>"Ahead of the strong technical resistance at around 8,200 points, the market
remained in consolidation mode despite the gains,"  Arch Shih of TLG Asset
Management said.</P>
      <P>Shih said market sentiment remained cautious as investors have been waiting to
see what central bankers and financial ministers of the Group of 20 nations will
conclude on the global currency market in a meeting to be held in South Korea
Friday and Saturday.</P>
      <P>While large-cap petrochemical stocks, such as Formosa Plastics and Nan Ya
Plastics, posted gains, their strength was not sufficient to pull the broader
market out of the current range trade, Shih said.</P>
      <P>"The market  still lacks a mainstream  sector  to make a breakthrough, " Shih
added, referring to a lackluster electronics sector.</P>
      <P>Formosa Plastics rose 1.56 percent to NT$84.50, and Nan Ya Plastics gained 1.19
percent to NT$68.20.</P>
      <P>Largan Precision, the world's largest supplier of lenses for cellphone cameras,
rose 1.81 percent to NT$618.00, after the company said sales for the fourth
quarter would continue to grow on higher demand for smartphones.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell for the 13th consecutive
month in September, helped by a drop in the number of people left jobless
because of downsizings or company shutdowns, the country's statistics agency
said Friday.</P>
      <P>The adjusted employment rate fell to 5.08 percent, down 0.03 percentage points
from August, said Liu Tian-shy, deputy director of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics.</P>
      <P>The nominal jobless rate in September fell to 5.05 percent, down 0.12 percentage
points from August, and Liu said it could meet the government's stated goal of
falling below 5 percent by the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The number of people left jobless because of company downsizings or closures
totaled 199,000 in September, 16,000 fewer than in August and the first time the
figure had fallen below 200,000 since October 2008, when the global economic
meltdown was just beginning.</P>
      <P>The number reached a peak at 355,000 in June 2009.</P>
      <P>The September decline in the overall jobless rate matches the trends of previous

fall by 4,000 for the jobless rate to fall below 5 percent by the end of 2010.</P>
      <P>Despite the improving unemployment figures, Taiwan's jobless rate is still

      <P>Back home for the first time since the end of the Major League Baseball season,
Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Kuo Hong-chih attributed his record-setting season
to "pure luck" and said he hoped to help his team get back into the playoffs
next year.</P>
      <P>"I would like to return to Taiwan at a later date next year," Kuo said at a
press conference attended by some 100 reporters, alluding to his desire to have
the Dodgers remain active into the post-season in 2011.</P>
      <P>The Dodgers finished the season 80-82, fourth in the five-team National League
West Division, after having made the National League Championship Series the
previous two seasons.</P>
      <P>But the team's drop-off was not because of Kuo. The 29-year-old left-hander had
his best year since first making the Dodgers roster in 2005, finishing with a
3-2 record and 12 saves in 56 appearances and becoming the first Taiwanese
player to earn a spot in the All-Star Game.</P>
      <P>His ERA of 1.20 was also the lowest in franchise history for pitchers with at
least 50 innings pitched, and he was nominated for the "Setup Man of the Year"
award.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions posed by fans in an online Internet chat room, which was
opened at the same time as the press conference, Kuo politely attributed his
success to "pure luck" and said he was happy as long as he was able to play the
game after nearly having his career ended by four elbow operations.</P>
      <P>Kuo said his most memorable performance of the year was a two-inning outing in a
3-1 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks on July 4, when he struck out all six
batters he faced.</P>
      <P>Reflecting on his experience in the All-Star Game, Kuo said he was nervous
because he didn't know what to do and where to go.</P>
      <P>"I felt like I became a fan again and was busy taking photos with those big-name
players, " he said.</P>
      <P>The 29-year-old gave credit to first baseman James Loney and pitchers Chad
Billingsley and Jonathon Broxton for their friendship, which helped him get
through the long season. He added that fan support was also a big help.</P>
      <P>"I thought of giving up, honestly. But I'm not a person who gives up easily, and
I always tell myself that I have to keep fighting because I represent my country
of Taiwan in the MLB to some extent, " Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The left-hander, who started the 2010 season as a setup man but was installed as
a closer in mid-August in place of the struggling Braxton, said he would not
mind shifting between the two roles next year, even though "being a closer
brings you so much pressure because you're supposed to finish it off."</P>
      <P>Kuo said he hopes to continue playing in the United States for another 5-10
years, but "the most important thing for me, first and foremost, is to help my
team win."</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih apologized Friday for the poor upkeep of the Suhua Highway
and said construction of the Suhua Freeway could began next year providing the
project passes the environmental impact assessment by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Built in 1932 during the period of Japanese rule, the highway was now in a
shoddy condition,  the premier  acknowledged  at an interpellation session at
the Legislative Yuan.  This made it susceptible to collapse, frequent rock
slides and blockage by fallen debris, particularly during inclement weather, he
said.</P>
      <P>"I must offer my sincere apology to the people stranded on the highway for the
inadequate maintenance of the Suhua Highway, " said Wu.</P>
      <P>The main highway in eastern Taiwan was struck by landslides Thursday, causing
casulties and hundreds of travlers to be stranded or trapped.</P>
      <P>As of late Friday afternoon, a 21-person Chinese group touring Taiwan with the
Harula Travel Co. and last known to be traveling on the highway remained
unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>In a separate incident, a Chinese tour leader and a Taiwanese driver with the
Hong Tai Travel Company were also still missing.</P>
      <P>Parts of their tour bus had been located along the highway, said the Interior
Minister Jiang Yi-hua, who speculated the pair might have fallen out of the bus
as it tumbled. The 19 Chinese tourists in the group were safe.</P>
      <P>Around 400 people had been stranded on the popular scenic route, and by 7: 00
p.m. Friday, 330 had been transported by vehicle or helicopter to shelters, the
Tourism Bureau announced, quoting the latest figures from the Central Emergency
Operation Center. Of those rescued, 233 are tourists from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The military dispatched 90 rescuers to the location as the torrential rainstorm
brought by Typhoon Megi continued to pound the area.</P>
      <P>Harula Travel Co. said that families of the missing Chinese tourists had been
contacted, and a group representing the families will arrive at Taiwan tomorrow.</P>
      <P>A new Suhua Freeway project has been fiercely opposed by environmental groups,
who argue that the construction will jeopardize local ecosystems. They suggest
the government should instead invest in a train route, which would relieve
traffic as well as producing 90 percent less carbon emissions than cars.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's government is sending a delegation to the United States on Sunday that
it hopes will secure investment commitments from a number of American companies.</P>
      <P>The delegation, headed by Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin Sheng-chung,
expects to sign letters of intent with representatives from a dozen U.S.
companies in the fields of green energy, cloud computing, semiconductors,
optoelectronics and biotechnology.</P>
      <P>During the eight-day trip, the delegation will meet with Noveda Technologies
Inc., Air Products and Chemicals Inc., Veeco Instruments Inc., Celgene Corp.,
A10 Networks Inc., Lam Research Corp. and others in Silicon Valley, San Diego,
New York and elsewhere in the U.S.</P>
      <P>"We will sign letters of intent with a number of the companies we will visit,"
Lin said at a press briefing Friday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs expected some of these companies to introduce
their technologies to Taiwan or set up research and development centers on the

      <P>Thursday's deadly disruptions to traffic on the Suhua Highway caused by
torrential rains have rekindled interest in improving the accident-prone
roadway, but environmentalists said Friday that priority should be given to
expanding eastern Taiwan's railway line.</P>
      <P>"There are many ways to get home, " said Tsai Chung-yueh, the spokesman for an
alliance opposing the construction of a freeway along the scenic coast between
Yilan and Hualien counties out of concern for the environment.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that while the heavy rain completely blocked traffic on the Suhua
Highway and left 23 people unaccounted for on Thursday and Friday, it only
caused the railway connecting Taipei and Hualien to shut down for half a day on
Thursday before resuming service.</P>
      <P>He said that was because the construction of a railway has a smaller impact on
the surrounding terrain than a roadway, and he advocated prioritizing plans to
expand the railway system rather than pumping more money into improving the
Suhua Highway.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, lawmakers urged the government to launch as soon as possible
a planned project to upgrade the mountain section of the windy highway, which is
highly vulnerable to rockslides and landslides during stormy weather.</P>
      <P>"The government is obliged to build a road that allows Hualien residents to
travel home safely, " said Legislator Wang Ting-son of the ruling Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications originally planned to build a
new freeway between Suao and Hualien that would have bypassed the old highway,
but it was nixed after drawing strong opposition from environmental activists.</P>
      <P>The agency then proposed its plan to upgrade the existing road, reinforcing it
where possible and bypassing some of the most dangerous sections with tunnels or
other new roads.</P>
      <P>The proposal is currently undergoing an environmental impact assessment.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Directorate General of Highways (DGH) on Friday blamed the suddenness of the
heavy downpour for landslides that stranded hundreds of travlers on a major
highway in eastern Taiwan, some of whom are still unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>DGH Chief Secretary-General Mile N. Chen admitted that there is room for
improvement when asked by reporters why the authority didn't close the Suhua
Highway as the area was battered by torrential rain Thursday.</P>
      <P>A recently-installed geographic information system (GIS) couldn't have warned
motorists in advance because it was unable to determine the extreme nature of
the rainfall in time to issue an alert.</P>
      <P>It usually takes us two to three hours to collect the data but the heavy rain
really came all of sudden,Chen said, adding that the DGH's rescue capacity has
been overwhelmed by extreme weather when similar incidents happened in recent
years.</P>
      <P>According to the Central Weather Bureau, the hourly accumulated precipitation in
Suao skyrocketed to 181.5 mm between 1 to 2 p.m. Thursday, around the time when
a series of landslides took place along the highway between the townships of
Suao and Dongao.</P>
      <P>The precipitation marked the third highest record for the nation, the CWB said.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the DGH might consider setting up several barricades  along  the
highway  in the future  under  similar circumstances so they could deploy
manpower to close off sections of the road.</P>
      <P>Given the length of the highway, which is 118 km, Chen said that management of
any mandatory closure would be highly challenging.</P>
      <P>There have been around 200 blockings on the Suhua Highway due to bad weather
since 2002, according to DGH data.</P>

      <P>Seventy of the 400 people stranded on the Suhua Highway in eastern Taiwan by
storm-triggered landslides were airlifted to safety by 5:30 p.m. Friday, with
the rest expected to be evacuated by midnight, the Central Emergency Operation

      <P>Those among the 70 people rescued who needed medical attention were airlifted to
Tzu-Chi Buddhist General Hospital in Hualien City, according to the center.</P>
      <P>Efforts to get the remaining 330 people to safety was continuing through Friday
night, and the center hoped that the operation would be completed by midnight.</P>
      <P>Aside from the 400 stranded individuals, another 23 thought to be on the highway
when traffic was disrupted by landslides, were considered missing, with few

Dongan Townships.</P>
      <P>That section was blocked Thursday by landslides triggered by prolonged
torrential downpours from Typhoon Megi and another weather system from the

      <P>Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said at a press conference held at the center
that an emergency road giving greater access to rescue vehicles had been opened
at the 112.8 km marker by 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>Escorted by SWAT team members, whose number had increased from 30 to 90 as of

      <P>The number of job openings available in Taiwan have grown on a year-on-year
basis for 11 consecutive months, a local online employment agency said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based 1111 Job Bank declined to offer specific job figures, however,
citing business confidentiality.</P>
      <P>The agency said in a statement that the number of job openings available  during
the past seven months,  have posted average year-on-year monthly growth of 30
percent.</P>
      <P>The number of jobs available grew especially sharply in a few specific
industries, rising 80.28 year-on-year in the old economy manufacturing sector,
77.65 percent in the restaurant, hairdressing and beauty care sector, and 64.35
percent in the construction and real estate sector, the job bank said.</P>
      <P>The statement came hours after Taiwan's statistics  agency reported that the
country's adjusted unemployment rate fell for the 13th consecutive month to 5.08
percent in September, helped by a drop in the number of people left jobless
because of downsizings or company shutdowns.</P>
      <P>Despite the prolonged decline in the jobless rate, however, it has remained
stubbornly above 5 percent, even with the many job openings that have become
available in 2010.</P>
      <P>Henry Ho, the agency's public relations director, said the disparity showed that
the majority of jobs available in Taiwan are created by only a limited number of
sectors, making it hard to match job openings to job seekers.</P>

      <P>Wang Tung-ming, a 97-year-old amateur Peking Opera singer and Tien Gow (Heaven

      <P>But after having the tumor removed surgically in April 2009, she has led a happy
and healthy life, she said on Friday.</P>
      <P>At a press conference marking the opening of a photography exhibition on breast
cancer at Taipei Cinema Park, Taiwan's oldest breast cancer patient ever to
survive surgery said she opted for the operation after she was diagnosed with
cancer in her left breast in March 2009.</P>
      <P>Though she said she was not afraid to die, the possible torment of having to
suffer through terminal stage cancer convinced her to deal with the disease
surgically.</P>
      <P>Chang Chin-chien, a professor in the Department of Surgery at National Taiwan

      <P>Seven people were killed by a mudslide and another 23 traveling on a coastal
highway remained unaccounted for as of Friday night after northeastern Taiwan
was battered by heavy rains brought by Typhoon Megi.</P>
      <P>The Central Emergency Operation Center said seven corpses were recovered from a
house in Suao that was buried by a mudslide.</P>
      <P>The missing people were on the Suhua Highway connecting Yilan and Hualien
counties when traffic on the roadway was disrupted by torrential rain and
landslides Thursday.</P>
      <P>Those listed as missing included a 19-person tour group from southern China's
Guangdong Province, which was last known to be traveling aboard a tour bus on
the highway during Thursday's blinding rainstorm.</P>
      <P>The group's Taiwanese tour guide and its Taiwanese bus driver also have been
listed as missing.</P>
      <P>The Chinese leader of a tour group from Beijing and its Taiwanese bus driver
were also unaccounted for after their bus was buried by a landslide on the
highway.</P>
      <P>The buried bus was located by rescue workers, but neither of the two were found
inside.</P>
      <P>The rockslides and mudslides along the highway triggered by the torrential rains
brought by Typhoon Megi also stranded around 430 travelers overnight Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Defense Ministry mobilized hundreds of soldiers and SWAT team members to
remove rocks and build an emergency road to evacuate those stranded. Helicopters
also helped airlifted scores of travelers to safety during the day.</P>
      <P>By Friday evening, most of those not airlifted to safety walked approximately
1.2 kilometers to the entry of the emergency road and were driven to Yilan City.</P>
      <P>Fifty-three others decided, however, not to walk the distance, electing instead
to spend another night at a safe location on the highway accompanied by SWAT
teams and be airlifted away the following day.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih apologized Friday for the poor upkeep of the highway built in
1932 during Japanese colonial rule.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a legislative session, Wu also said that a project to improve the
more vulnerable sections of the highway Yilan County and neighboring Hualien
County in eastern Taiwan could begin next year providing the project passes an
environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Highways admitted Friday that there was
room for improvement when asked why the agency did not close off the accident-
prone highway before the area was hit by torrential rains.</P>
      <P>It also forecast that the highway would not be fully repaired until Nov. 20.</P>
      <P>Due to the convergence of stormy weather on Typhoon Megi's periphery and
seasonal winds from the northeast, Yilan County has received a staggering amount
of rainfall in the past few days.</P>
      <P>The county's Suao area received 939 millimeters in rainfall between midnight
Wednesday and midnight Thursday, the most ever in Taiwan for a single day, the
Central Weather Bureau said Friday.</P>
      <P>The previous record was recorded on Aug. 8, 2009 at the Dawu weather station in
Taitung County, when Typhoon Morakot devastated southern and southeastern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Many parts of the county were submerged in flash floodwaters Thursday.</P>
      <P>As of 3 p.m. Friday, Typhoon Megi-related agricultural losses were estimated at
NT$45.86 million in four counties around Taiwan, according to the Council of
Agriculture. (By Wang Shu-fen, Chen Shun-hsien, Liu Chia-tai, Jenny Hsu, Hsin-

      <P>Heavy rains could do little to dampen the spirit of Taiwan's television elites
as the star-studded Golden Bell Awards proceeded without a hitch Friday night.</P>
      <P>In two of the most anticipated awards, pop star Rainie Yang won Best Actress in
a Dramatic Series for her portrayal of a tomboy in "Hi, My Sweetheart" while
first-time nominee 15-year-old Wu Cheng-di nabbed the Best Actor award, leaving
many fans of pop artist Show Luo and heartthrob James Wen disappointed.</P>
      <P>Adventure aficionado and the face of "Fun Taiwan, " Janet Hsieh, failed to win
the award for Best Travel Show Host, beaten out by Xiao Ma, a former comedian
turned travel show host.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese opera star Lin Mei-chao won Best Actress in a Mini series and Tang
Chuang went home with Best Actor in the same category for his role in "Seafaring
Men," which also won Best Mini Series.</P>
      <P>Prior to the ceremony, the red carpet was graced by a throng of household names
despite the heavy rain. They included child star Little Bin, veteran comedian
Zhu Ge-liang, actress Tien Hsin, and the cast of "Super Party, " a popular
political satire show.</P>
      <P>It was the second time this year that heavy rain had arrived uninvited during a
major award ceremony in Taiwan, though the Golden Bells did a better job of
keeping its stars dry.</P>
      <P>Back in May during the Golden Melody Awards, several stars, including the multi-
talented Hong Kong diva Karen Mok, were drenched from head to toe in their
expensive gowns when the organizers failed to provide nothing more than
umbrellas for them.</P>
      <P>During the awards ceremony, now in its 45th year, former talent show contestant
and now international star Lin Yu-chun won roaring applause from the audience
with his performance of a medley, including his famous rendition of Whitney
Houston's "I Will Always Love You."</P>
      <P>Some of the most heated battles for prizes included the Best Variety Show, in
which two highly popular singing contest shows "Million Stars" and "Super Idol"
went head to head for the honor.</P>
      <P>But in a major upset, the award eventually went to "Million Dollar Primary
School, " a quiz show patterned after the U.S. program "Are you Smarter than a
Fifth Grader?"</P>
      <P>This year, the bell tolled loudly for Zhu Ge-liang and Rene Hu, the "beauty and
the beast" duo whose near-perfect chemistry won them the honor of Best Variety
Show hosts.</P>
      <P>The award marked a major milestone for Zhu after he had disappeared from the
small screen for over a decade because he was on the run from his creditors.</P>
      <P>This year, a total of 132 nominations competed for the Golden Bell in 32
categories. Each winner will receive a cash award of NT$100,000, the Government
Information Office said.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has awarded 48 public and private
institutions for employing a sufficient number of mentally and physically
challenged workers.</P>
      <P>This is the eighth year the Golden Wingspan Award has been given to encourage
the hiring of this group of disadvantaged people, said CLA Minister Wang Ju-hsun
at the award presentation ceremony Friday.</P>
      <P>The award recipients in the public sector range from police departments to local
libraries. They share a commonality -- their hiring of disabled people amount to
at least 3 percent of every 34 employees hired by them, said Su Chao-ju, deputy
chief of Disabled Persons Employment and Training at the CLA's Bureau of
Employment and Vocational Training.</P>
      <P>However, Su said that the new employment system is more relaxed for private
businesses, which are required to have only 1.5 disabled workers per 100
employees.</P>
      <P>The employment policy was adopted in July 2008. In less than a year,  12,000
mentally and physically  challenged  people have successfully entered the job
market, said Su.</P>
      <P>The laborers are able to fulfill many kinds of work tasks, Su added.</P>
      <P>Aside from the policy, the rewarded institutions were reviewed in terms of
creating a barrier-free environment, providing adequate counseling service, and

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 23 (CNA)
10/23/10  14:11:48</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Associated Press responded Saturday to protests by the government of Taiwan
over alleged distortions of President Ma Ying-jeou's comments in an exclusive
interview, saying that the controversy involved "mainly matters of emphasis".</P>
      <P>Based on an interview with the president, the AP reported on Tuesday, among
other things, that Ma "suggested that those political talks (with China) could
start as early as a second four-year term if he wins re-election in 2012". The
president and other officials said this was not what Ma had said.</P>
      <P>"We understand that this is a very sensitive and important issue for the
government and people of Taiwan. We believe that a fair reading of the interview
transcript and the article shows that the AP conveyed the essential facts about
Ma's views. However, we understand the issues that have led to the complaint, "
said John Daniszewski, the AP's Senior Managing Editor.</P>
      <P>"President Ma's position is that any opening for talks on political issues with
China should move in step with the public and parliament in Taiwan, that he has
no timetable, and that resolving all outstanding economic issues are his
priority, "Daniszewski was quoted as saying in an AP dispatch from Taipei.</P>
      <P>In response, Johnny Chi-Chen Chiang,  minister of Taiwan's Government
Information Office, said that "by having the president's remarks clarified,
people get to know where the issues lie and can better understand Taiwan's
position on cross-strait policies".</P>
      <P>The AP article came after Chiang sent a letter to Daniszewski on Wednesday
demanding that the agency clarify the matter by issuing a correction of its
report.</P>
      <P>Instead of an apology, the article said that "the government of Taiwan has
objected to an AP dispatch based on an interview Tuesday with President Ma Ying-
jeou, saying that certain paraphrases used in the article distorted the
president's message and contained errors of emphasis and fact".</P>
      <P>"The disputed passages concerned  the degree to which the president is open to a
political dialogue with Beijing,  the likelihood of such talks in the near
future, and specifically whether he suggested a dialogue on political issues
could take place as soon as his second term of office, if he is re-elected in
2012," it said.</P>
      <P>"The objections cited by Chiang and other government officials were mainly
matters of emphasis," Daniszewski was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The article compared the main points contained in the earlier report with what
Taiwan officials said should have been the important message.</P>
      <P>The earlier article prompted Ma to hold a hastily arranged press conference on
Tuesday night, at which he said that economic issues should take precedence over
political issues in terms of Taiwan's relationship with mainland China and that
there was no timetable for political talks.</P>
      <P>During the interview, he did not make any connection between a possible second
term and discussions with the Chinese on political issues, said the president.</P>
      <P>Despite his clarification  and similar statements by other officials, some
commentators insisted that the AP report showed Ma's intention to start
political negotiations with Beijing if he wins re-election.</P>
      <P>The issue is controversial because there are concerns among certain segments of
Taiwanese society that after the two sides signed a landmark free-trade
agreement in June, Ma's administration will face pressure from Beijing to begin
a political dialogue, which they believe would ultimately include discussions
about Beijing's goal of eventually unifying with Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou ordered rescuers Saturday to step up the search for
possible survivors in the landslide disaster triggered by Typhoon Megi on the
Suhua Highway in eastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We won't give up any hope of finding survivors, " Ma said during a visit to a
disaster response center in Yilan County, which was hardest  hit by the  heavy
rainfall  brought  by the storm.</P>
      <P>Transportation Minister Mao Chih-kuo said the foremost important task now is to
find the missing individuals and to clear up the roads.</P>
      <P>In addition to 11 people confirmed killed in the typhoon, Taiwan's authorities
and rescue teams are searching for 26 missing people.</P>
      <P>Among the missing, a 21-person tour group that included 19 Chinese tourists from
China's Guangdong Province, their tour guide and bus driver were still
unaccounted for as of Saturday morning. They were believed to have been
traveling on the Suhua Highway -- a major highway on Taiwan's eastern side,
connecting Yilan and Hualien counties, when heavy rain and rockslides caused a
section of the highway to collapse.</P>
      <P>A Taiwanese bus driver and a Chinese tour group leader from another tour bus,
belonging to Hong Tai Travel Co., were also missing. Pieces of the tour bus has
been located buried beneath heaps of debris. It is believed that the tour guide
and driver might have rolled out of the vehicle as it tumbled into the valley.
The tourists in the group managed to get off the bus in time.</P>
      <P>A group of five representatives is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan from China this
afternoon on behalf of the families of the missing Chinese tourists. The
National Immigration Agency will assist in expediting their entry by
streamlining the visa process.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yilan County firefighting officials have also reported that a couple
in a small truck and a driver from a small passenger vehicle were also missing.
Earlier,  rescue teams successfully evacuated 435 people in the non-stop, two-
day rescue effort on Suhua Highway, the Central Emergency Operation Center
(CEOC) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>As the rain brought on by Typhoon Megi has subsided, visibility has improved,
enabling the SWAT team to dispatch six helicopters on Saturday morning to
airlift the remaining 54 people left stranded at the 114 kilometer section of
the highway.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Megi -- the strongest Pacific rainstorm wreaked havoc across the country
by dumping more than 1,200 mm of continuous rainfall, mostly in the northeastern
parts of Taiwan in over 48 hours. The typhoon has already killed 36 people in
the Philippines and is making her way to southern China.</P>
      <P>Of the more than 400 people who were stranded, 274 were Chinese tourists. As of
7: 45 a.m. Saturday, 272 of the 274 Chinese tourists and their tour guides and
drivers have been rescued, according to the Tourism Bureau.</P>
      <P>In terms of the 11 people confirmed dead, nine of them were buried when a house
located next to Bai Yun temple in the coastal town Suao in Yilan County,
collapsed during the heavy rainstorm. Their corpses have been dug out. A small-
sized excavator has been mobilized to aid the rescue team in its search effort.</P>
      <P>Two other bodies were found elsewhere in the township -- one inside a
residential home and another near a naval port.</P>

      <P>The agricultural damage brought on by Typhoon Megi was NT$48.36 million (US$1.56
million) as of Saturday morning, said the Council of Agriculture (COA) Saturday
in its latest updates.</P>
      <P>The COA said that due to the convergence of Typhoon Megi's periphery and
seasonal winds, since Oct. 17, a total of 146 hectares of farmland in Taipei,
Yilan, Hualien, and Taitung have been destroyed by rainwater.</P>
      <P>The monetary loss for crop goods was at least NT$23.85 million. Most of the

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Road traffic to east enters dark age</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/23/10  15:38:57
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Suhua Highway, a vital road to Taiwan's "backyard garden" Hualien on the
scenic eastern coast, was broken off by deadly rockslides Friday after it was
pounded by record-breaking downpours from Typhoon Megi.</P>
      <P>The central government was blasted by furious Hualien residents, who have been
yearning for a "safe road home" for many years but kept being disappointed. For
the poor upkeep of the highway built in 1932 during the Japanese colonial rule,
Premier Wu Den-yih apologized.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the latest misfortune of
the scenic winding coastal road connecting two eastern Taiwan counties -- Yilan
and Hualien:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>After Typhoon Megi battered the Suhua Highway Thursday, eastern Taiwan has begun
the longest "road-locked month" in its history. Directorate General of Highways
(DGH) said the section between Suao and Dongao of the road was hit by several
serious rockslides. "The highway cannot be fixed until Nov. 20 at the earliest,
" it noted.</P>
      <P>Hualien county chief Fu Kun-chi asked President Ma Ying-jeou to at once begin
the long-anticipated construction project aimed at improving the accident-prone
roadway.</P>
      <P>Fu denounced that such a fragile but vital road "is not only a problem that
concerns 23 million Taiwan people's traffic and life, it has harmed the
country's national dignity, " referring to the death of some 100 people every
year on the cliff-edge highway to Hualien County which he described as a
showcase of Taiwan's tourism.</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>"If construction improvements won't begin before the end of the year, the
Hualien County government will do it by itself," Fu said.</P>
      <P>Responding to the call, Premier Wu underlined at the Legislative Yuan Friday
that it is the government's firm policy to fix roadways, promising that as soon
as the highway improvement project passes environmental  impact  assessments,
the government  will begin construction.</P>
      <P>However, Green Party convener Pan Han-sheng criticized Fu for being too
emotional. Judging from the road breaks caused by "indirect attacks" of a
typhoon, the fact proves that the surrounding terrain on the highway is very
vulnerable, he said.</P>
      <P>As the global climate changes, any construction work on the Suhua Highway in the
future is expected to face tough challenges due to the extremely arduous climate
condition, Pan said. He suggested the government should prioritize plans to
expand the existing railway system to the east.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>DGH Secretary-General Chen Mao-nan stressed that the Suhua Highway is not so
fragile as many people have described. It was damaged so badly only because the
rainfall was too heavy in a short time, he said.</P>
      <P>In the future, traffic on the road will be suspended whenever the agency detects
unusual amounts of rainfall, Chen noted.</P>
      <P>In the Ministry of Transportation and Communications-initiated improvement
project, the Suao-Tongau section, which suffered the most severe damage during
the Megi-triggered rockslides, will be the first to be improved, with plans to
build a 3.5 kilometer-long tunnel and a 3.5 kilometer-long bridge to bypass the
dangerous highway.</P>
      <P>The construction, however, cannot be completed before 2018 if it starts next
year even if there are no glitches. This means travelers must wait for at least
eight years to have a safe road to Hualien. (Oct. 23, 2010).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Typhoon Megi, which means "catfish" in the Korean language, brought massive
rainfall to Yilan County in northeastern Taiwan over the past two days, leading
to serious flooding around the county and severe landslides on the Suhua
Highway, which connects the county with Hualien in the east of the country.</P>
      <P>The disaster can be attributed to damage of Yilan's natural flood prevention
capacity in recent years, due to a vast area of farmland that has been used to
build luxury houses.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by academic groups reveal that over the past five years, an
average of 300 luxury homes are built on farmland in the county every year. It
is estimated that 400 hectares of flood prevention areas have been lost as a
result.</P>
      <P>Forecasts on Typhoon Megi issued by the Central Weather Bureau have also been
criticized as inaccurate because they failed to predict the heavy rainfall in
Yilan. In addition, the current practice in which typhoon warnings focus mainly
on the intensity of wind rather than rain does not match the reality that
drastic rainfall is far more of a problem.</P>
      <P>Megi, the fierce catfish, has taught us another painful lesson.</P>

pursuing economic growth.</P>
      <P>To honor its promise, the government must make sure every citizen pays the taxes

      <P>Taiwan's tax system, which is tilted excessively in favor of the wealthy, is
responsible for the widening wealth gap in this country. In 2009, the income of
the richest 20 percent of families in Taiwan was 8.22 times that of the poorest
20 percent, the widest gap since records began.</P>
      <P>At present, individual income tax accounts for 30 percent of the government's

people who generate their wealth from stock dividends, business profits or

      <P>An accident involving a China Airlines (CAL) flight destined for the Indonesian
island of Bali Sept. 20, 2008 that injured 24 passengers and cabin crew was
caused by pilot error, according to an investigative report released Friday by
the Aviation Safety Council (ASC).</P>
      <P>The report on the two-year investigation said the two pilots of flight CI-687
were found responsible for flying the Boeing 747-400 plane into powerful
turbulence over the South China Sea after misreading the plane's radar.</P>
      <P>The cabin chief and one passenger sustained serious injuries in the incident,
and three other cabin crew and 19 passengers were slightly injured.</P>
      <P>The ASC also concluded in the report that the Civil Aeronautics Administration
should reinforce its checks on the cabin operations of all local airlines after
finding that the CAL's cabin crew guide lacks clearly-defined standard rules for
handling turbulence.</P>
      <P>The ASC is an independent government agency established to investigate and
prevent re-occurrence of civilian air incidents and accidents.</P>

      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Deputy Chairman Liu Teh-hsun on Saturday visited
three Chinese tourists who sustained  minor  injuries  when  they  were  trapped
on the typhoon-battered Suhua Highway the previous day.</P>
      <P>Liu expressed the government's concern for their welfare and said it is doing
everything it can to locate other tourists who remained unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>He said the government will closely monitor the progress of the injured tourists
and promised that it will provide all necessary support to ensure their full
recovery.</P>
      <P>The tourists were hospitalized at Luodong's Poh-ai Hospital in Yilan County, the
area worst-affected by the typhoon.</P>
      <P>As of press time, 272 stranded Chinese tourists had been safely evacuated from
the landslide-hit highway, while the fate of another 21 Chinese nationals still
remained unknown. Rescue teams, military personnel and excavation equipment were
working hard at the scene to get everyone accounted for.</P>
      <P>Responding to criticism that the government was putting the safety of the
Chinese tourists ahead of Taiwanese or other foreign tourists, the Tourism
Bureau said the accusation was unfounded.</P>
      <P>An official denied that there was any preferential treatment during the rescue
process and explained that the reason the bureau only included the Chinese
tourists on its tally of people rescued was "because they are the only tourists
that are required to report their exact whereabouts while in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taiwanese travelers and tourists from countries other than China
are not required to report their itineraries to the bureau and pointed out that
there was therefore no way of knowing how many non-Chinese were involved in the
incident.</P>

      <P>China Steel Corp., Taiwan's biggest steelmaker, will show how it has contributed
to reducing carbon emissions and recycling waste material at a green technology
show slated to open Oct. 25.</P>
      <P>"Car makers are trying to make their cars lighter to save energy. Therefore,
China Steel has created high-intensity steel for vehicles," Andrew Sung, vice
president of the company's Production Division, told CNA Saturday.</P>
      <P>This type of strong steel can be made thinner, which can help reduce the weight
of a vehicle by 10 percent. The weight loss will lead to a 6 percent to 8
percent decrease in gasoline consumption, he said during the run-up to the
Taiwan International Green Industry Show (TiGiS) scheduled to take place Oct.
25-28.</P>
      <P>In addition, the company has developed high-quality electrical steel that can
enhance motor efficiency. Each metric ton of such steel is able to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions by 1.51 metric tons, Sung said.</P>
      <P>China Steel, in which the government has a stake, also supplies its surplus
steam to 11 neighboring factories at a relatively low cost, which greatly
reduces these factories' use of their boilers.</P>
      <P>"We supplied a total of 2 million metric tons of steam to these companies last
year, which can be translated into 440,000 metric tons in carbon cuts per year,"
he said.</P>
      <P>The company also produces 13,500 metric tons of pure water made from waste water
on a daily basis.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the steelmaker has been working to turn its other by-products of the
iron-smelting process -- slag and coal tar -- into valuable assets.</P>
      <P>Sung said that using slag to make cement can reduce carbon emissions by 1.4
metric tons, while coal tar can be processed for use in lithium batteries used
to power electric vehicles.</P>
      <P>"The transformation has hugely increased the value of our coal tar, as it is now
60 times more expensive than before," he said.</P>
      <P>China Steel will display these technologies at the TiGiS, which will have a
total of 180 companies occupying some 320 booths.</P>

      <P>An outstanding performance lifted Taiwan to an 11-5 win over South Korea in the
opening game of the 17th Intercontinental Cup baseball tournament in central
Taiwan's Taichung City Saturday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which also hosted the tournament the last time it was played in 2006,

round-robin groups. The best three teams in each group will enter the second
round.</P>
      <P>Outfielder Lin Che-hsuan hit a single at his first bat, sparking a two-run
attack for Taiwan and building up an early lead.</P>
      <P>Taiwan then went big in the 5th inning as Chen Chun-hsiu slammed a three-run
homer to pull up to 7-1.</P>
      <P>However, South Korea made a comeback in the 7th inning, pulling the team back to
5-7.</P>
      <P>Taiwan then answered with five back-to-back hits in the 8th inning, extending
its lead to 11-5, which it maintained to the end of the game.</P>
      <P>The game marked Taiwan's 10th win against South Korea in the tournament,
including six in a row since 1991.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs dismissed an allegation  Saturday  that  its
decision  not to hold  an administrative hearing on a controversial plan to
build the country's eighth naphtha cracker on coastal wetlands in central Taiwan
was illegal.</P>
      <P>The private investment  project initiated  by the Kuokuang Petrochemical
Technology Co. (KPTC) does not require approval from the Ministry of Economic
Affairs' Industrial Development Bureau, the bureau's director-general, Woody
Duh, told CNA in a telephone interview.</P>
      <P>"Since no approval is required, there is no need for the ministry to hold an
administrative hearing," he said.</P>
      <P>His remarks came one day after a local professor demanded that the ministry hold
an administrative hearing on the investment project in line with the
Administrative Procedure Act.</P>
      <P>More than 1,200 local university professors and academics have expressed
opposition to the project and on Aug. 3 released a joint petition stating their
objections.</P>
      <P>The academics vowed to stage a demonstration next month if the ministry fails to
organize an administrative hearing on the issue.</P>
      <P>The ministry said that it organized a public hearing on the environmental impact

be located.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration is now conducting an

      <P>KPTC, a joint venture by the state-owned oil refinery CPC Corp., Taiwan and

County's coastal wetlands near the estuary of the Jhuoshui River.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists are strongly opposed to the project on the grounds that it
will hurt the area's ecosystem, which includes migratory birds, fiddler crabs,
mudskippers, mud shrimps and the almost-extinct Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry, the project is expected to generate revenue of NT$460

      <P>A two-day festival to celebrate the upcoming launch of direct flights between
Taipei's Songshan Airport and Tokyo's Haneda Airport began in Taipei Saturday,
drawing the attention of large crowds of people.</P>
      <P>The Songshan-Haneda flights, scheduled to begin Oct. 31, are expected to boost
the number of people traveling between the two countries each year from the
current 2 million people to 3 million, according to the Japan Interchange
Association (JIA) , the organizer of the fair.</P>
      <P>The event, held in Taipei's Xinyi shopping district, featured an exhibition of
the traditional Japanese tea ceremony, a Japanese taiko drum performance and a
rock concert, as well as a lucky draw and various promotions by travel agencies
and air companies to generate interest in the new flight services.</P>
      <P>"The launch of Songshan-Haneda flights will help promote the 2010-2011 Taiwan-

      <P>Imai was referring to a campaign designed to promote cultural and artistic

      <P>All four carriers that will provide Songshan-Haneda flights -- China Airlines

      <P>According to the carriers, they will each offer two flights from Songshan to
Haneda per day, with fares of around NT$14,000 (US$454) for round-trip tickets,
with stays of up to 30 days.</P>
      <P>Songshan Airport, which used to be the country's main gateway, served direct

      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese movie stars missed a glitzy  Oscar-style  event at the
opening  of the 23rd Tokyo International Film Festival Saturday due to a dispute
over Taiwan's name.</P>
      <P>Shortly before celebrities began to walk a green carpet to mark the start of the
festival, the head of the Chinese delegation, Jiang Ping, told organizers that
the Taiwanese delegation must not attend under the name "Taiwan" but should use
the designation of "Taiwan, China" or "Chinese  Taipei"  --  the title Taiwan
uses when participating in the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Jiang said that if his demand was not met, the Chinese delegation would boycott
the green carpet walk and other festival-related events.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation, headed by Chen Chih-kuan, director of the Government
Information Office's Department of Motion Pictures Affairs, however, refused to
accede to the Chinese demand.</P>
      <P>Chen said the delegation applied to attend this year's event under the name of
Taiwan as it has in past years. "We have no reason to make a concession this
time around," he added.</P>
      <P>"We will respect the arrangements made by the organizers under the prerequisite
that our national dignity is not undermined, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>With both sides sticking to their guns, the green carpet walk finished without
them and none of the stars from either side took part in the glittering "green
carpet walk."</P>
      <P>Noted actors and actresses from both sides said they were surprised and
frustrated by the dispute.</P>
      <P>After an 18-year hiatus, the film festival will feature a special Taiwan section
in which six Taiwanese box-office hits, including Monga, Juliets, the Fourth
Painting, Let the Wind Carry Me, Zoom Hunting and Taipei Exchanges -- will be

      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese movie stars missed a glitzy  Oscar-style  event at the
opening  of the 23rd Tokyo International Film Festival Saturday due to a dispute
over Taiwan's name.</P>
      <P>Shortly before celebrities began to walk a green carpet to mark the start of the
festival, the head of the Chinese delegation, Jiang Ping, told organizers that
the Taiwanese delegation must not attend under the name "Taiwan" but should use
the designation of "Taiwan, China" or "Chinese  Taipei"  --  the title Taiwan
uses when participating in the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Jiang said that if his demand was not met, the Chinese delegation would boycott
the green carpet walk and other festival-related events.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation, headed by Chen Chih-kuan, director of the Government
Information Office's Department of Motion Pictures Affairs, however, refused to
accede to the Chinese demand.</P>
      <P>Chen said the delegation applied to attend this year's event under the name of
Taiwan as it has in past years. "We have no reason to make a concession this
time around," he added.</P>
      <P>"We will respect the arrangements made by the organizers under the prerequisite
that our national dignity is not undermined, " Chen said.</P>
      <P>With both sides sticking to their guns, the green carpet walk finished without
them and none of the stars from either side took part in the glittering "green
carpet walk."</P>
      <P>Noted actors and actresses from both sides said they were surprised and
frustrated by the dispute.</P>
      <P>After an 18-year hiatus, the film festival will feature a special Taiwan section
in which six Taiwanese box-office hits, including Monga, Juliets, the Fourth
Painting, Let the Wind Carry Me, Zoom Hunting and Taipei Exchanges -- will be
screened.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese tennis player Lu Yen-hsun advanced to the final of the Samsung
Securities Cup in Seoul, South Korea Saturday after defeating Florent Serra of
France 6-3, 6-4 in a semi-final match.</P>
      <P>World No. 39 Lu credited his good performance to tips from his German coach

      <P>The 27-year-old will face world No. 66, South Africa's Kevin Anderson, in

    <HEADLINE>Economic Daily News: Tertiary education competitiveness</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/24/10  14:53:23
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In April this year, Beijing announced that Taiwan's top-scoring high school
graduates can enter China's top universities without having to sit entrance
examinations.</P>
      <P>Some of these top scorers have chosen to enter Peking University or Tsinghua
University in Beijing. This has been interpreted by some opinion leaders as a
loss of competitiveness in Taiwan's tertiary education system.</P>
      <P>The core of the problem, however, is not how many Taiwanese students head to
China for college education. The problem is how many Chinese people choose to
come to Taiwan for their college education.</P>
      <P>A closed economic entity is unable to grow sustainably and a closed education
system is even worse -- it cannot possibly nurture talent of internationally
competitive caliber.</P>
      <P>Just as a closed-door economic policy is not conducive to raising Taiwan's
industrial competitiveness, a closed-door education policy will eventually dent
the country's soft power.</P>
      <P>Over the past decade, Taiwan -- which shares a common language and culture with
China and is located close by -- has missed the crucial opportunity of making
itself a China study stronghold, and very few Taiwanese teachers or students
cross the Taiwan Strait for research or study.</P>
      <P>Prior to 2008, Taiwan's tertiary education system had failed to adopt policies
that respond to the needs of Taiwanese society, particularly the business and
industrial sectors.</P>
      <P>Luckily, the Ministry of Education has opted for further relaxing restrictions
since President Ma Ying-jeou began pushing for the opening-up of cross-strait
education exchanges.</P>
      <P>The opening, however, has not been efficient enough so far. Clear educational
exchange strategies and implementation measures should be mapped out. (Editorial

      <P>A forum on solar power that will take place in Taipei Oct. 26-27, the biggest
ever held in Asia, is expected to bolster the development of Taiwan's green
energy industry, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>The 2010 Taipei Summit and PV Taiwan Forum, which has the aim of helping improve
solar energy cooperation between Taiwan and various other Asian countries, will
be attended by more than 90 officials from the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam,
Malaysia, Singapore, Germany and Taiwan, the Bureau of Foreign Trade said in a
recent statement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is now the second-largest solar cell producer after China and has
increased its solar cell production by 20 percent over the last five years,
indicating that Asia has become the center of solar cell production, according
to the PV Status Report 2010 released by the European Union in September.</P>
      <P>The heads of such local solar cell makers as Motech Industries Inc., Gintech
Energy Corp. and Topcell Solar International Co., will deliver speeches on the

      <P>Seven sections of the winding cliff-edge Suhua Highway to Taiwan's "backyard
garden" -- Hualien, on the scenic eastern coast -- were cut off after the region
was pounded by record-breaking downpours from Typhoon Megi Friday.</P>
      <P>At least 500 meters of the coastal highway crumbled into the Pacific Ocean, with
more than 400 motorists and tourists left stranded, 23 of whom were still
unaccounted for as of Sunday.</P>
      <P>Traffic along the highway has been disrupted by landslides 210 times over the
past seven years and in 2007 alone, the highway was closed 90 times, indicating
the degree of its vulnerability.</P>
      <P>Over the past several days, the latest misfortune, the worst landslides in the
highway's nearly 80-year history, has sparked heated debate among politicians,
environmental activists and the central and local governments, as well as local
residents, on the poor upkeep of the highway, how should it be fixed or whether
a new road should be built.</P>
      <P>Some argue that the highway should be abandoned once and for all, since there is
a railway system, which is much safer.</P>
      <P>But highways  and railways  are not mutually  replaceable, particularly since
trains cannot provide door-to-door service as can road vehicles.</P>
      <P>It is an incontrovertible truth that residents living in the two eastern
counties of Yilan and Hualien need a "safe road home, " which makes it necessary
to prioritize a long-anticipated construction project aimed at improving the
accident-prone road as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Because of global climate change, any construction work on the Suhua Highway is
expected to face even tougher challenges in the future due to the extremely
arduous conditions there.</P>
      <P>Another highway should be built exclusively for tourists, and this road should
be managed more strictly and closed whenever unusual amounts of rainfall are
detected. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 24, 20100</P>

    <DATELINE>10/24/10  16:54:43
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese movie stars failed to walk the green carpet at the 23rd
Tokyo International Film Festival Saturday due to a dispute over Taiwan's name.</P>
      <P>Shortly before the walk to mark the start of the festival, the head of the
Chinese delegation, Jiang Ping, told organizers that the Taiwanese delegation
must not attend under the name "Taiwan" but should use the designation of
"Taiwan, China" or "Chinese Taipei" -- the title Taiwan uses when participating
in the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation, headed by Chen Chih-kuan, director of the Government
Information Office's Department of Motion Pictures Affairs, flatly refused to
accede to the Chinese demand.</P>
      <P>The row resulted in both delegations missing the glitzy event.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, after an 18-year hiatus, is represented at the film festival this year
with a special section in which six Taiwanese box-office hits -- "Monga, "
"Juliets, " "The Fourth Painting, " "Let the Wind Carry Me, " "Zoom Hunting" and
"Taipei Exchanges" -- are to be screened.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the name row:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials said the government will insist on upholding Taiwan's
sovereignty and will not rule out the possibility of bowing out of the festival
in the worst-case scenario. On the other hand, it will seek to resolve cross-
Taiwan Strait hurdles to solicit greater space for Taiwan in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations have become warmer since the signing of a major trade
pact in June. But at a sensitive time, when relations between China and Japan
are tense over the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, over which Taiwan also claims
sovereignty, the government is watching closely to see what China's next move
will be.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Johnny Chiang said Saturday that
the GIO stands behind the Taiwanese delegation. He added that it will not budge,
as sovereignty is involved in the matter.</P>
      <P>Although the delegation missed the walk, it attended a banquet hosted by the
organizers later.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also encountered  China's  interference  in its participation in the
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, showing that Beijing's  squeezing  has
extended  from intergovernmental organizations to non-governmental
organizations, officials said, adding that "bilateral hurdles still exist."
(Oct. 24, 2010) China Times:</P>
      <P>Taiwanese delegation leader Chen Chih-kuan said his Chinese counterpart Jiang
Ping made the name-change demand before the opening of the film festival, but
Chen said that he "could not accept it because the issues of sovereignty and
dignity are involved."</P>
      <P>He said he has attended many international film festivals in the past, but has
never encountered such an unreasonable demand.</P>
      <P>The organizers were also frustrated, thinking that the arts and politics are
separate and that one should not interfere with the other, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>"The films we make are aimed at the Mandarin-speaking market, as well as the
Asian, European and American markets, and not just the Chinese market," Chen
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, many Taiwanese lauded Chen on the Internet and panned China for its
childish gambit, with some pointing out that it is a film festival, which has
nothing to do with the Olympics. (Oct. 24, 2010) Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>China's oppression of Taiwan is omnipresent, even in the arts.</P>
      <P>Jiang not only demanded that the Taiwanese delegation walk the green carpet with
the Chinese delegation at the same time, but also challenged Chen in a high-
handed tone, asking: "Are you still trying to sell your films to China? Are you
not Chinese?"</P>
      <P>The organizers were frustrated by China's move, saying that such a problem has
never occurred before. They asked the two sides to "coordinate between
themselves."</P>
      <P>Each year, China sends big stars to attend the event, but this year, stars such
as Zhang Ziyi declined to attend, presumably due to bilateral tension over the
disputed Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>Beijing was also probably miffed because of the screening of the Taiwanese films
and the large Taiwanese delegation. (Oct. 24, 2010)</P>

      <P>The body of one Taiwanese woman had been found and identified as of Sunday,
while 25 others remained unaccounted for in the Suhua Highway disaster,
according to the Yilan District Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>The woman was identified by her family as 54-year-old Liu Yun-jun, a special
education teacher who was lauded by her colleagues as a compassionate and
selfless individual. Her body was found near the 112.8 km mark of the highway at
around 9 am, three days after Typhoon Megi thrashed northeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The death toll as of that day stood at 13, with 25, including a 21-person
Chinese tour group from Guangdong Province and Tien Yuan, a Chinese tour leader
working for the Hong Tai Travel Co., still reported missing.Military personnel
and rescue teams had been working for nearly three days non-stop to comb the
area for the missing. The government said the operation will not stop until all
measures have been taken.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, a delegation from China representing the missing tour group
arrived in Taiwan to help with the search effort.</P>
      <P>"All I want is to find my daughter as soon as possible, hopefully today," said
Tien's mother. Tien's husband reportedly went inside the disaster zone to help
locate his missing wife, but to no avail.</P>
      <P>The searchers had found some broken vehicle parts suspected to belong to the bus
used by the Hong Tai group and some reports said personal belongings such shoes
and shirts had also been found.</P>
      <P>The heavy rain brought by Typhoon Megi also fiercely battered nearby residential
areas in the county. Thousands of homes in Suao Township lost power and hundreds
of hectares of crops were destroyed.</P>
      <P>The Yilan County government has put out a call for help asking the public to
donate goods such as diapers for children and adults, disposable underwear,
oatmeal and personal hygiene kits.</P>
      <P>Several non-government  organizations  such as the Buddhist Compassionate Relief
Tzu Chi Foundation and World Vision Taiwan have dispatched volunteers to help
with the massive clean-up work.</P>

      <P>Taiwan took advantage of a slow start by the Czech Republic to clinch a 6-0
victory Sunday, its second win in the Intercontinental Cup baseball tournament
being held in Taichung City, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Czech Republic team, also known as AVG Draci Brno and a 16-time champion in

giving up 11 hits and six runs through the first four innings.</P>
      <P>It was held scoreless by Taiwan's starting pitcher Pan Wei-lun, who threw four
strikes in three innings, and the team struggled to make its first hit until
Zyma Petr knocked out a single in the sixth inning.</P>
      <P>Continuing its hot batting streak, Taiwan opened the game with four hits and
took advantage of a Czech passing error, setting the lead easily at 2-0 after
the first inning.</P>
      <P>In the following three innings, Taiwan scored four more runs with seven hits,
the highlight of which was a two-run double by Chen Yung-chi.</P>
      <P>Czech then strengthened its defense with the appearance of the team's reliever,

      <P>A series of health education activities were held Sunday for children with
diabetes to address the importance of self-monitoring of blood sugar levels and
maintaining a healthy lifestyle, the organizers said that day.</P>
      <P>Fifty families with type 1 diabetic children were invited by the Taiwan
Association for Diabetic Children (TADC) to learn more about diabetes management
through interactive dramas, games, exercises and lectures, said TADC Director-
General Lo Fu-sung.</P>
      <P>"There are 400 to 500 new cases of juvenile diabetes, or type 1 diabetes,
detected in Taiwan each year, " said Lo, who is also a pediatric doctor at Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou. "Regular checking  of blood sugar levels is
vital for preventing  the development of diabetic complications," he said.</P>
      <P>TADC Secretary-General Wu Chih-ching noted that child patients are different
from adults in that children usually do not understand the severity of the
problem and fail to get medical treatment.</P>
      <P>Speaking from her own experience, Wu said that her son, diagnosed with diabetes
at the age of 6, used to run around the house four to five times a day whenever
it was time to prick his finger for a drop of blood. "I had to warn him: If you
want to live, you have to do this," she said.</P>
      <P>One female patient who has struggled with diabetes since the age of 10, said
that "little kids are afraid of needles but they have parents to look after
them. When older, teenagers skip blood monitoring because they don't want to be
labeled as freaks by their classmates."</P>
      <P>The patient, surnamed Lai, developed retinal deterioration and kidney illness at
the age of 24 because of her carelessness in monitoring her blood sugar levels
and maintaining a healthy lifestyle over the years.</P>
      <P>"We hope that all children, with or without diabetes, can learn more about the
disease, because there is a chance they could meet a diabetic friend at some
point in their lives, " said Wu, who also complained that there is not enough
information available about diabetes.</P>

      <P>Family members of 19 Chinese tourists from China's Guangdong Province who
remained unaccounted for Sunday are expected to arrive in Taiwan Tuesday and
Wednesday, according to a travel agency source.</P>
      <P>The Guangdong tourist group, hosted by Taipei-based Harula Tour, was supposed to
have left for home Friday, according to Wu Chao-ping, a Harula Tour manager.</P>
      <P>The tour bus carrying the 19 tourists was believed to have been traveling north
on the Suhua Highway -- a scenic cliff-edge highway on Taiwan's eastern coast
that connects Yilan and Hualien counties -- when heavy rain and rockslides
caused several sections of the highway to collapse.</P>
      <P>Five officials from China Travel Service's Gongbei branch, which organized the
tourist group, flew into Taiwan Saturday in the aftermath of the disaster
triggered by Typhoon Megi.</P>
      <P>Seven city officials from Guangdong's Zhuhai City were also scheduled to arrive
in Taiwan by nightfall Sunday to provide assistance. Of the 19 missing Chinese
tourists, eight are officials working with the Gongbei Land Taxation Bureau in
Zhuhai, according to the Taiwan Association of Travel Agents.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile that day,  three high-ranking officials from the Beijing-based Cross
Strait Tourism Association (CSTA), departed from Beijing for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Tourism Bureau said it will assist the families by streamlining the
visa-issuing process for them.</P>
      <P>In related news, a Taiwanese bus driver and a Chinese tour group leader from
another tour bus, belonging to the Taipei-based Hong Tai Travel Co., were also
missing. Pieces of the tour bus were located buried beneath heaps of debris and
it was believed the tour guide and driver might have been thrown from the
vehicle when it tumbled into a ravine. The tourists in the group managed to get
off the bus in time.</P>
      <P>Three family members of the missing Chinese tour group leader, identified as
Tian Yuan, also arrived in Taiwan Saturday.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Megi wreaked havoc across Taiwan Oct. 21-22, dumping more than 1,200 mm
of continuous rainfall in 48 hours, mostly on northeastern parts of the island.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Sunday that it will
convene a second committee meeting on a road improvement plan for the Suhua
Highway and expressed hope that the process will be expedited in order that work
can begin on the landslide-stricken highway as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Suhua Highway was constructed in the 1930s and serves as the main road
connection for the eastern counties of Yilan and Hualien. The 180-km winding
route touted for its beautiful natural scenery is one of the most popular
destinations for foreign tourists.</P>
      <P>However, the road is often subject to landslides, especially during periods of
heavy rain. A government plan to build a Suhua Freeway has met with strong
opposition from environmental groups, which argue that such a major
infrastructure project will cause long-lasting eco-hazards to the local
landscape. According to these groups, improving the rail system would be a more
efficient and environmentally friendly solution.</P>
      <P>Green groups have also suggested that the government limit use of the road by
heavy vehicles.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the press, EPA Minister Stephen Shen, who traveled to Yilan County
to lead a massive clean-up operation following severe flooding in Suao Township,
said the second environmental impact assessment committee meeting will be held
Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>According to the law, all members of the review committee must be notified at
least seven days ahead of such a meeting, but Shen said that due to the urgent
need to improve the highway, an exception will be made in this case.</P>
      <P>The EPA released a statement expressing sympathy for the victims who were killed
or injured on the highway and promised to help construct a safer road.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday, 13 people had been confirmed dead and 25 people, including a
21-person Chinese tour group and a Chinese tour leader were still missing.
Search and rescue workers were continuing to comb the area for survivors and
bodies. That afternoon, seven divers from the Marine Corps were also deployed to
help with the search.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hualien hotel operators expressed grave concern Sunday about the outlook for
tourism in the region after the major road traffic route in eastern Taiwan,
connecting YiIan and Hualien, was closed due to several landslides.</P>
      <P>Torrential rain brought by Typhoon Megi battered northeastern Taiwan Oct. 21-22,
triggering serious landslides on the coastal Suhua Highway that stranded more
than 400 travelers, including Chinese tourists. Most of them had been rescued as
of Sunday, but 25 were still missing.</P>
      <P>The occupancy rates of hotels in Hualien are normally maintained at over 80
percent, but the rates have plunged since the storm.</P>
      <P>The manager of a hotel in downtown Hualien City, identified only by his surname
Hu, said that he originally had a full occupancy rate for Saturday, but the rate
fell to only half after the road closed.</P>
      <P>Hu said the impact on business class guests was not too bad, but added that the
impact on bookings by domestic tourists and groups, as well as Chinese tourists,
was serious, and that "the follow-up negative effect is building."</P>
      <P>A manager of another Hualien hotel, which mainly caters to Chinese tourist
groups, said the hotel's occupancy rate also dropped immediately after the
incident.</P>
      <P>"The willingness of people to travel to Hualien has indeed been seriously
impacted, " said the manager, identified by his surname Tseng.</P>
      <P>But what really worries the operators is not the short-term effects of the
typhoon.</P>
      <P>"The really serious problem is the confidence of tourists about the safety of
traveling to Hualien," Hu said.</P>
      <P>The Suhua Highway has begun the longest "road-locked month" in its history, the
Directorate General of Highways (DGH) said, as the section between Suao and
Dongao "cannot be fixed until Nov. 20 at the earliest."</P>

      <P>A distinction between politics and movies should be made and respected,
Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Johnny Chiang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>He made the remark one day after a Taiwanese delegation at the 23rd Tokyo
International Film Festival (TIFF) was unable to walk the green carpet at the
event's glittering opening ceremony due to vehement opposition by the Chinese
delegation over the delegation's use of the name "Taiwan" rather than "Chinese
Taipei" -- the name Taiwan is forced to use in the Olympics.</P>
      <P>Chiang urged the Chinese delegation to stop using politics as an excuse to
sabotage Taiwan's right to participate in international film events.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih also slammed the Chinese as "arrogant," saying the Chinese
delegation's leader, Jiang Ping, made a serious mistake by sticking to the
antiquated rhetoric that there is only one China. This sentiment, he said, is
contrary to the peaceful cross-Taiwan relations of recent years.</P>
      <P>GIO Department of Motion Picture Affairs Director and delegation head Chen Chih-
kuan  said Taiwan applied and was accepted to participate in the film event
using the name "Taiwan" and will not deviate.</P>
      <P>"No concessions will be made this time around," he insisted.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation includes singer/actress Vivian Hsu, who enjoys a high
degree of popularity in Japan, as well as up-and-coming actors Mark Chao and
Ethan Ruan, whose blockbuster movie "Monga" will be one of six Taiwanese films
featured in the festival. The absence of the Taiwanese delegation  left many
waiting fans in utter disappointment, according to reports from Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The TIFF will run through Oct. 30. The movie "Social Network, " about the
founder of Facebook, ushered in the annual event, while Ben Affleck's latest
work "The Town" will be the closing film. Some of the big names attending the
festival this year are French actress Catherine Deneuve, award-winner
screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and the world's most lovable ogre, Shrek.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih expressed hope Sunday that an improvement project of the
Suhua Highway in eastern Taiwan can pass an environmental impact assessment so
that construction can start at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The improvements  will  result  in bypasses  for the most accident-prone
sections of the twisty Suhua Highway, which connects Yilan and Hualien counties.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) had  submitted
the  project  to the Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA) for review
and the EPA, after an initial review by specialists Oct. 18, asked the MOTC to
make certain revisions.</P>
      <P>"The Cabinet will not interfere with the environmental impact assessments and
will respect the EPA's professionalism to ensure safety," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He also said the assessment should be conducted "in a fair manner" so that
tender bidding and construction can begin by the year's end.</P>
      <P>He said the improvement project will take into consideration environmental
protection, will reduce the danger on the highway, and will cut the travel time
by 48 minutes.</P>
      <P>The premier said the most immediate task is to repair the highway, seven
sections of which were cut off after it was battered by record-breaking
downpours from Typhoon Megi, which had left 13 dead and 25 missing as of Sunday.</P>
      <P>"This is because the improvement project will not be completed until 2016 at the
latest, so between now and then, the highway must still serve its mission as a
major artery," he added.</P>
      <P>He said that after the highway is repaired, the government will install soil
movement monitoring systems on the adjacent slopes.</P>
      <P>"In the event of downpours and soil movement, a ban on traffic will be enforced
immediately to avoid accidents," he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Name row mars opening of Tokyo film festival</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwanese and Chinese movie stars failed to walk the green carpet at the 23rd
Tokyo International Film Festival Saturday due to a dispute over Taiwan's name.</P>
      <P>Shortly before the walk to mark the start of the festival, the head of the
Chinese delegation, Jiang Ping, told organizers that the Taiwanese delegation
must not attend under the name "Taiwan" but should use the designation of
"Taiwan, China" or "Chinese Taipei" -- the title Taiwan uses when participating
in the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation, headed by Chen Chih-kuan, director of the Government
Information Office's Department of Motion Pictures Affairs, flatly refused to
accede to the Chinese demand.</P>
      <P>The row resulted in both delegations missing the glitzy event.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, after an 18-year hiatus, is represented at the film festival this year
with a special section in which six Taiwanese box-office hits -- "Monga, "
"Juliets, " "The Fourth Painting, " "Let the Wind Carry Me, " "Zoom Hunting" and
"Taipei Exchanges" -- are to be screened.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the name row:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Taiwanese officials said the government will insist on upholding Taiwan's
sovereignty and will not rule out the possibility of bowing out of the festival
in the worst-case scenario. On the other hand, it will seek to resolve cross-
Taiwan Strait hurdles to solicit greater space for Taiwan in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Cross-strait relations have become warmer since the signing of a major trade
pact in June. But at a sensitive time, when relations between China and Japan
are tense over the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands, over which Taiwan also claims
sovereignty, the government is watching closely to see what China's next move
will be.</P>
      <P>Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Johnny Chiang said Saturday that
the GIO stands behind the Taiwanese delegation. He added that it will not budge,
as sovereignty is involved in the matter.</P>
      <P>Although the delegation missed the walk, it attended a banquet hosted by the
organizers later.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has also encountered  China's  interference  in its participation in the
Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, showing that Beijing's  squeezing  has
extended  from intergovernmental organizations to non-governmental
organizations, officials said, adding that "bilateral hurdles still exist."
(Oct. 24, 2010) China Times:</P>
      <P>Taiwanese delegation leader Chen Chih-kuan said his Chinese counterpart Jiang
Ping made the name-change demand before the opening of the film festival, but
Chen said that he "could not accept it because the issues of sovereignty and
dignity are involved."</P>
      <P>He said he has attended many international film festivals in the past, but has
never encountered such an unreasonable demand.</P>
      <P>The organizers were also frustrated, thinking that the arts and politics are
separate and that one should not interfere with the other, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>"The films we make are aimed at the Mandarin-speaking market, as well as the
Asian, European and American markets, and not just the Chinese market," Chen
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, many Taiwanese lauded Chen on the Internet and panned China for its
childish gambit, with some pointing out that it is a film festival, which has
nothing to do with the Olympics. (Oct. 24, 2010) Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>China's oppression of Taiwan is omnipresent, even in the arts.</P>
      <P>Jiang not only demanded that the Taiwanese delegation walk the green carpet with
the Chinese delegation at the same time, but also challenged Chen in a high-
handed tone, asking: "Are you still trying to sell your films to China? Are you
not Chinese?"</P>
      <P>The organizers were frustrated by China's move, saying that such a problem has
never occurred before. They asked the two sides to "coordinate between
themselves."</P>
      <P>Each year, China sends big stars to attend the event, but this year, stars such
as Zhang Ziyi declined to attend, presumably due to bilateral tension over the
disputed Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>Beijing was also probably miffed because of the screening of the Taiwanese films
and the large Taiwanese delegation. (Oct. 24, 2010)</P>

      <P>The body of one Taiwanese woman had been found and identified as of Sunday,
while 25 others remained unaccounted for in the Suhua Highway disaster,
according to the Yilan District Prosecutors Office.</P>
      <P>The woman was identified by her family as 54-year-old Liu Yun-jun, a special
education teacher who was lauded by her colleagues as a compassionate and
selfless individual. Her body was found near the 112.8 km mark of the highway at
around 9 am, three days after Typhoon Megi thrashed northeastern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The death toll as of that day stood at 13, with 25, including a 21-person
Chinese tour group from Guangdong Province and Tien Yuan, a Chinese tour leader
working for the Hong Tai Travel Co., still reported missing.Military personnel
and rescue teams had been working for nearly three days non-stop to comb the
area for the missing. The government said the operation will not stop until all
measures have been taken.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, a delegation from China representing the missing tour group
arrived in Taiwan to help with the search effort.</P>
      <P>"All I want is to find my daughter as soon as possible, hopefully today," said
Tien's mother. Tien's husband reportedly went inside the disaster zone to help
locate his missing wife, but to no avail.</P>
      <P>The searchers had found some broken vehicle parts suspected to belong to the bus
used by the Hong Tai group and some reports said personal belongings such shoes
and shirts had also been found.</P>
      <P>The heavy rain brought by Typhoon Megi also fiercely battered nearby residential
areas in the county. Thousands of homes in Suao Township lost power and hundreds
of hectares of crops were destroyed.</P>
      <P>The Yilan County government has put out a call for help asking the public to
donate goods such as diapers for children and adults, disposable underwear,
oatmeal and personal hygiene kits.</P>
      <P>Several non-government  organizations  such as the Buddhist Compassionate Relief

      <P>Taiwan took advantage of a slow start by the Czech Republic to clinch a 6-0
victory Sunday, its second win in the Intercontinental Cup baseball tournament
being held in Taichung City, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Czech Republic team, also known as AVG Draci Brno and a 16-time champion in
that country's professional baseball league since 1995, seemed to be off-form,
giving up 11 hits and six runs through the first four innings.</P>
      <P>It was held scoreless by Taiwan's starting pitcher Pan Wei-lun, who threw four
strikes in three innings, and the team struggled to make its first hit until
Zyma Petr knocked out a single in the sixth inning.</P>
      <P>Continuing its hot batting streak, Taiwan opened the game with four hits and
took advantage of a Czech passing error, setting the lead easily at 2-0 after
the first inning.</P>
      <P>In the following three innings, Taiwan scored four more runs with seven hits,
the highlight of which was a two-run double by Chen Yung-chi.</P>
      <P>Czech then strengthened its defense with the appearance of the team's reliever,
Rehacek Jan, and finally stopped bleeding, but it was too late to bring the game
back.</P>

      <P>A series of health education activities were held Sunday for children with
diabetes to address the importance of self-monitoring of blood sugar levels and
maintaining a healthy lifestyle, the organizers said that day.</P>
      <P>Fifty families with type 1 diabetic children were invited by the Taiwan
Association for Diabetic Children (TADC) to learn more about diabetes management
through interactive dramas, games, exercises and lectures, said TADC Director-
General Lo Fu-sung.</P>
      <P>"There are 400 to 500 new cases of juvenile diabetes, or type 1 diabetes,
detected in Taiwan each year, " said Lo, who is also a pediatric doctor at Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou. "Regular checking  of blood sugar levels is
vital for preventing  the development of diabetic complications," he said.</P>
      <P>TADC Secretary-General Wu Chih-ching noted that child patients are different
from adults in that children usually do not understand the severity of the
problem and fail to get medical treatment.</P>
      <P>Speaking from her own experience, Wu said that her son, diagnosed with diabetes
at the age of 6, used to run around the house four to five times a day whenever
it was time to prick his finger for a drop of blood. "I had to warn him: If you
want to live, you have to do this," she said.</P>
      <P>One female patient who has struggled with diabetes since the age of 10, said
that "little kids are afraid of needles but they have parents to look after
them. When older, teenagers skip blood monitoring because they don't want to be
labeled as freaks by their classmates."</P>
      <P>The patient, surnamed Lai, developed retinal deterioration and kidney illness at
the age of 24 because of her carelessness in monitoring her blood sugar levels
and maintaining a healthy lifestyle over the years.</P>
      <P>"We hope that all children, with or without diabetes, can learn more about the
disease, because there is a chance they could meet a diabetic friend at some
point in their lives, " said Wu, who also complained that there is not enough
information available about diabetes.</P>

      <P>Family members of 19 Chinese tourists from China's Guangdong Province who
remained unaccounted for Sunday are expected to arrive in Taiwan Tuesday and
Wednesday, according to a travel agency source.</P>
      <P>The Guangdong tourist group, hosted by Taipei-based Harula Tour, was supposed to
have left for home Friday, according to Wu Chao-ping, a Harula Tour manager.</P>
      <P>The tour bus carrying the 19 tourists was believed to have been traveling north

      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) said Sunday that it will
convene a second committee meeting on a road improvement plan for the Suhua
Highway and expressed hope that the process will be expedited in order that work
can begin on the landslide-stricken highway as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Suhua Highway was constructed in the 1930s and serves as the main road
connection for the eastern counties of Yilan and Hualien. The 180-km winding
route touted for its beautiful natural scenery is one of the most popular
destinations for foreign tourists.</P>
      <P>However, the road is often subject to landslides, especially during periods of
heavy rain. A government plan to build a Suhua Freeway has met with strong
opposition from environmental groups, which argue that such a major
infrastructure project will cause long-lasting eco-hazards to the local
landscape. According to these groups, improving the rail system would be a more
efficient and environmentally friendly solution.</P>
      <P>Green groups have also suggested that the government limit use of the road by
heavy vehicles.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the press, EPA Minister Stephen Shen, who traveled to Yilan County
to lead a massive clean-up operation following severe flooding in Suao Township,
said the second environmental impact assessment committee meeting will be held
Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>According to the law, all members of the review committee must be notified at
least seven days ahead of such a meeting, but Shen said that due to the urgent
need to improve the highway, an exception will be made in this case.</P>
      <P>The EPA released a statement expressing sympathy for the victims who were killed
or injured on the highway and promised to help construct a safer road.</P>
      <P>As of Sunday, 13 people had been confirmed dead and 25 people, including a
21-person Chinese tour group and a Chinese tour leader were still missing.
Search and rescue workers were continuing to comb the area for survivors and
bodies. That afternoon, seven divers from the Marine Corps were also deployed to
help with the search.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Hualien hoteliers worried about tourism after highway disaster</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Hualien hotel operators expressed grave concern Sunday about the outlook for
tourism in the region after the major road traffic route in eastern Taiwan,
connecting YiIan and Hualien, was closed due to several landslides.</P>
      <P>Torrential rain brought by Typhoon Megi battered northeastern Taiwan Oct. 21-22,
triggering serious landslides on the coastal Suhua Highway that stranded more
than 400 travelers, including Chinese tourists. Most of them had been rescued as
of Sunday, but 25 were still missing.</P>
      <P>The occupancy rates of hotels in Hualien are normally maintained at over 80
percent, but the rates have plunged since the storm.</P>
      <P>The manager of a hotel in downtown Hualien City, identified only by his surname
Hu, said that he originally had a full occupancy rate for Saturday, but the rate
fell to only half after the road closed.</P>
      <P>Hu said the impact on business class guests was not too bad, but added that the
impact on bookings by domestic tourists and groups, as well as Chinese tourists,
was serious, and that "the follow-up negative effect is building."</P>
      <P>A manager of another Hualien hotel, which mainly caters to Chinese tourist
groups, said the hotel's occupancy rate also dropped immediately after the
incident.</P>
      <P>"The willingness of people to travel to Hualien has indeed been seriously
impacted, " said the manager, identified by his surname Tseng.</P>
      <P>But what really worries the operators is not the short-term effects of the
typhoon.</P>
      <P>"The really serious problem is the confidence of tourists about the safety of
traveling to Hualien," Hu said.</P>
      <P>The Suhua Highway has begun the longest "road-locked month" in its history, the
Directorate General of Highways (DGH) said, as the section between Suao and
Dongao "cannot be fixed until Nov. 20 at the earliest."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A distinction between politics and movies should be made and respected,
Government Information Office (GIO) Minister Johnny Chiang said Sunday.</P>
      <P>He made the remark one day after a Taiwanese delegation at the 23rd Tokyo
International Film Festival (TIFF) was unable to walk the green carpet at the
event's glittering opening ceremony due to vehement opposition by the Chinese
delegation over the delegation's use of the name "Taiwan" rather than "Chinese
Taipei" -- the name Taiwan is forced to use in the Olympics.</P>
      <P>Chiang urged the Chinese delegation to stop using politics as an excuse to
sabotage Taiwan's right to participate in international film events.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih also slammed the Chinese as "arrogant," saying the Chinese
delegation's leader, Jiang Ping, made a serious mistake by sticking to the
antiquated rhetoric that there is only one China. This sentiment, he said, is
contrary to the peaceful cross-Taiwan relations of recent years.</P>
      <P>GIO Department of Motion Picture Affairs Director and delegation head Chen Chih-
kuan  said Taiwan applied and was accepted to participate in the film event
using the name "Taiwan" and will not deviate.</P>
      <P>"No concessions will be made this time around," he insisted.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese delegation includes singer/actress Vivian Hsu, who enjoys a high
degree of popularity in Japan, as well as up-and-coming actors Mark Chao and
Ethan Ruan, whose blockbuster movie "Monga" will be one of six Taiwanese films
featured in the festival. The absence of the Taiwanese delegation  left many
waiting fans in utter disappointment, according to reports from Tokyo.</P>
      <P>The TIFF will run through Oct. 30. The movie "Social Network, " about the
founder of Facebook, ushered in the annual event, while Ben Affleck's latest
work "The Town" will be the closing film. Some of the big names attending the
festival this year are French actress Catherine Deneuve, award-winner
screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and the world's most lovable ogre, Shrek.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih expressed hope Sunday that an improvement project of the
Suhua Highway in eastern Taiwan can pass an environmental impact assessment so
that construction can start at the end of this year.</P>
      <P>The improvements  will  result  in bypasses  for the most accident-prone
sections of the twisty Suhua Highway, which connects Yilan and Hualien counties.</P>
      <P>He said the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) had  submitted
the  project  to the Environmental  Protection Administration (EPA) for review
and the EPA, after an initial review by specialists Oct. 18, asked the MOTC to
make certain revisions.</P>
      <P>"The Cabinet will not interfere with the environmental impact assessments and
will respect the EPA's professionalism to ensure safety," Wu said.</P>
      <P>He also said the assessment should be conducted "in a fair manner" so that
tender bidding and construction can begin by the year's end.</P>
      <P>He said the improvement project will take into consideration environmental
protection, will reduce the danger on the highway, and will cut the travel time
by 48 minutes.</P>
      <P>The premier said the most immediate task is to repair the highway, seven
sections of which were cut off after it was battered by record-breaking
downpours from Typhoon Megi, which had left 13 dead and 25 missing as of Sunday.</P>
      <P>"This is because the improvement project will not be completed until 2016 at the
latest, so between now and then, the highway must still serve its mission as a
major artery," he added.</P>
      <P>He said that after the highway is repaired, the government will install soil
movement monitoring systems on the adjacent slopes.</P>
      <P>"In the event of downpours and soil movement, a ban on traffic will be enforced
immediately to avoid accidents," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The row over Taiwan's name at the 23rd Tokyo International Film Festival last
weekend highlights the real hindrance to a potential meeting between the top
leaders of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>China's reluctance to recognize the existence of the Republic of China (ROC) as
a sovereign state prompted its official to block Taiwanese film workers from
joining a star-studded green carpet walk in Tokyo under the name of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This same mentality is also the real cause preventing a meeting between ROC
President Ma Ying-jeou and his Chinese counterpart, Hu Jintao.</P>
      <P>It is an issue that must be addressed if the two sides want to break new ground
in their bilateral engagements following the signing of the landmark Economic
Cooperation Framework Agreement in June.</P>
      <P>Creative thinking will be needed for the two sides to jointly craft a solution
to this thorny issue.</P>
      <P>Since Beijing has defined the current cross-strait status quo as a hangover from
the Chinese Civil War, the two sides should work out a "pragmatic  and parallel
identity framework"  based on this definition to pave the way for Ma and Hu to
meet in their official capacities.</P>
      <P>Presidents of East Germany and West Germany called each other "president" when
they met, and such a move did not prevent their "countries" from reunifying
eventually. North Korean President Kim Jong-il similarly addressed the South
Korean leader Kim Dae-jung as president when they met in 2000.</P>
      <P>At a time when Beijing is undergoing a leadership transition and wide-ranging
social restructuring, Hu should seriously consider how to develop an "identity
framework" for the presidents of the ROC and the People Republic of China to
meet in parity. That would be the best legacy he can leave his successor. Such a
framework could also make a Ma-Hu meeting a reality. (Editorial abstract -- Oct.

      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang declined Monday to confirm a deal
between German carmaker Volkswagen and Taiwan-based Yulon Motor Co. Ltd.</P>
      <P>"To my knowledge, the two sides have met, but I cannot disclose anything more,"
Shih told reporters.</P>
      <P>Volkswagen has listed Taiwan as its priority location in looking for an overseas
production base, Shih said, but the final decision is up to the two companies.</P>
      <P>The comments came after the Chinese-language Economic Daily News reported the
same day that Volkswagen and Yulon, Taiwan's largest auto maker, are expected to
strike a deal in which the local company would assemble cars for the German
firm.</P>
      <P>The report cited sources from Swire Motors, an agent for Volkswagen in the
Taiwan market, as saying that Yulon is expected to produce two Volkswagen
models, including the Golf, in an initial phase.</P>
      <P>The two sides are discussing details such as assembly costs and production
volume, and were likely to reach a deal by the end of November, the report said.</P>
      <P>Volkswagen plans to use the Taiwanese production base to target both the Chinese
and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) markets, it stated.</P>
      <P>Yulon was not immediately available for comment on the report.</P>
      <P>Shih said as any investment deal between private companies was companies'
confidential  business information,  the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
could not speak for them unless given their permission.</P>
      <P>"The MOEA welcomes foreign investments in Taiwan, " the minister said. "Foreign
investments are 'a good thing' for the island's economy and the ministry will do
its best to provide assistance to facilitate the investments,  such as finding
land for factory construction."</P>
      <P>In addition to the possible deal with Yulon, Volkswagen is looking for potential
partners in Taiwan to produce auto components for the German company, the
Economic Daily News said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Presidential Office issued a strongly worded statement late Sunday urging
China to take remedial measures after a row over Taiwan's name at the 23rd Tokyo
International Film Festival.</P>
      <P>The Chinese delegation's insistence on forcing the Taiwanese delegation to
attend the festival under the name "Taiwan, China" or "Chinese Taipei" has hurt
Taiwanese people's feelings and will hobble peaceful development of cross-strait
relations, the statement said.</P>
      <P>"Chinese authorities should not disregard or treat lightly this episode and
should immediately take remedial measures and stop suppressing Taiwan or
squeezing its international space, " the statement added.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from the local media coverage of the issue:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Presidential Office spokesman Lo Chih-chiang said Sunday that the Tokyo film
festival is an international cultural activity sponsored by a non-governmental
organization that does not carry any political significance.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's film community has attended the annual event under the
name of "Taiwan" for many years, Lo said the Chinese delegation should not have
asked for a change to this time-honored practice.</P>
      <P>He cautioned that hard-won improvements in cross-strait relations in the past
two years through cultivation of goodwill and mutual trust could be sabotaged by
a single unfriendly move or gesture.</P>
      <P>For the sake of maintaining regional peace and prosperity, Lo said, the two
sides should shelve their political disputes, continue peaceful engagement and
create win-win scenarios under the principles of mutual respect and goodwill.
(Oct. 25, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih slammed the Chinese delegation Sunday as "arrogant," saying
the Chinese delegation's leader, Jiang Ping, made a serious mistake by sticking
to the antiquated rhetoric that there is only one China.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait relations have come a long way. Jiang's rhetoric was in contrast
to the peaceful cross-strait relations of recent years, " Wu said. "We hope
China's Taiwan Affairs Office will appropriately deal with the issue."</P>
      <P>The Beijing-based Taiwan Affairs Office said Sunday it is collecting information
about the row. The office is expected to make a response at its weekly news
conference scheduled for Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chinese sources versed in Taiwan affairs said the latest dispute over Taiwan's
name mainly resulted from Jiang's poor knowledge of the latest  developments  in
China's  policy  and strategy  toward cross-strait relations. (Oct. 25, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The Chinese delegation's demand that the Taiwanese delegation change its
designation while attending the star-studded "green carpet" walk indicated that
China would never ease its suppression of Taiwan's sovereign status despite
improvements in cross-strait ties in the past two years under President Ma Ying-
jeou's  "China leaning-policy, " opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said Sunday.</P>

      <P>An official from China's quasi-official Cross-Strait Tourism Association (CSTA)
visited the Suhua Highway on Taiwan's northeastern coast Monday to learn about
progress in efforts to find the Chinese tourists missing since deadly rock
slides last week.</P>
      <P>CSTA Deputy Secretary-General Li Yaying viewed the site at the 112.8-kilometer
mark of the winding highway at which a tour bus carrying 19 Chinese tourists
reportedly fell down a cliff during torrential rain last Thursday.</P>
      <P>Li said that family members of the missing tourists would arrive in Taiwan later
the same day at the earliest.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Fang Guishan, director of the CSTA's Taipei office, said the office
has set up a task force to handle the aftermath of the incident. The unit would
be under his direct command, he added.</P>
      <P>Emergency search and road repair operations continued on the remote highway
Monday. Military personnel looked for survivors or bodies from the air, on land
and in the ocean.</P>
      <P>At around 11: 30 a.m., a section of human thigh was discovered on the slope
below the 112.8 mark, Yilan County Fire Bureau officials said.</P>
      <P>The coastal highway suffered another rock slide, this time at the 106km mark,
earlier the same day. Technicians from the Directorate General of Highway (DGH)
fixed the problem within 15 minutes, according to the DGH.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the schedule for reopening the highway, a key link to eastern
Taiwan's Hualien County and a popular tourist route, has been brought forward by
five days to Nov. 15,  Transportation and Communications  Minister  Mao Chi-kuo
announced.  Reconstruction personnel were asked to speed up their efforts, he
said.</P>
      <P>Heavy rains brought by Typhoon Megi left 13 people died and 25 others missing,
according to official statistics. (By Justin Su, Lee Ming-chung, Chou Yung-

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan, India to cooperate in bike trade: county chief</HEADLINE>

      <P>Central Taiwan's Changhua County has reached a preliminary agreement with Madhya
Pradesh to export bicycle components to the Indian state, the county chief said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The deal was made after talks between Changhua County Magistrate Cho Po-yuan and
Shivraj Singh Chouhan, chief minister of Madhya Pradesh in central India. The
state will buy Taiwanese components and then assemble, market and sell the
finished bikes in India, Cho said.</P>
      <P>As Changhua is a bike-production hub in Taiwan, the Indian business sector has
expressed great interest in working with the county, said Cho, who is leading a
delegation to strengthen business ties between Taiwan and the South Asian
country.</P>
      <P>Another member of the group, Kuo Yung-pin of bike-control-system provider Chia
Cherne Ind. Co., promised to coordinate with other bike-component  manufacturers
back in Taiwan  about production cooperation with India.</P>
      <P>The export of components for assembly will be the first step for Taiwan's bike
industry to penetrate the Indian market, Kuo said. If such a production pattern
works well, he added, Taiwan component makers will consider building and
operating production facilities in India.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's bicycle sector had little information about the Indian market before
this visit, Kuo explained, and his company has been surprised by India's
willingness to cooperate with Taiwanese bike and component makers.</P>
      <P>With a population of 1.18 billion people -- the world's second largest -- India
is such a huge market that garnering just a single- digit-percent market share
will generate significant sales, Kuo observed.</P>
      <P>"We are very confident in taking a share here," he said.</P>
      <P>Cho's delegation arrived in India on Oct. 21 to promote Changhua County products
in India.</P>
      <P>The county chief participated in the Global Investors Summit held in Khajuraho,
Madhya Pradesh, over the weekend.</P>
      <P>The visit is aimed at boosting Changhua's international visibility, and also at
giving the county a better understanding of the world, he noted.</P>

      <P>Agricultural damage relating to Typhoon Megi totaled around NT$67.74 million by
Monday morning, according to the latest tally by the Council of Agriculture,
with most damage occurring in the country's northeast.</P>
      <P>A total of 583 hectares of farmland in Taipei, Yilan, Hualien and Taitung
counties were destroyed by the powerful rain storm, the COA said. Crops such as
green onions, leeks and rice were heavily battered, causing a sharp surge in
prices.</P>
      <P>The fishery sector reported NT$12.21 million in losses, while damage to
livestock was calculated at NT$10.09 million.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, due to damage to and closure of the Suhua Highway, many
distributors and farmers are forced to take a longer route to deliver goods to
Taipei.</P>
      <P>The COA is currently mulling over a short-term subsidy plan to help farmers in
Hualien and Taitung counties offset the cost of fuel until the roads are
completely cleared for travel, its Chief Secretary Tai Yu-yen said. A meeting
with agricultural officials and representatives of the business sector from the
three eastern counties will be held Tuesday to discuss the measure.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications will also provide Taipei-bound
train services to transport vegetables and fruits for local vendors, Tai added.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese search teams and military personnel on Monday found personal items and
passports belonging to the missing Chinese tourists whose last known whereabouts
were on the landslide-hit Suhua Highway during torrential rainstorms brought by
Typhoon Megi last week.</P>
      <P>No new bodies have been found so far today, but an arm and a piece of what is
believed a human thigh have been located near the 112.8-kilometer mark of the
highway.</P>
      <P>The latest figures from the Central Emergency Operation Center (CEOC) indicate
13 confirmed deaths and 25 people still unaccounted for. A 20-person Chinese
tourist group brought by Taipei-based Harula Travel Agency from Zhuhai City,
Guangdong Province, along with their Taiwanese bus driver, has still not been
found. Another Taiwanese driver and Chinese tour leader Tian Yuan working for
Hong Tai Travel Co, as well as a Taiwanese couple are also missing.</P>
      <P>Both the Taiwanese and Chinese authorities are closely monitoring the latest
developments of the rescue effort, now in its fourth day.</P>
      <P>Many family members of the missing Chinese tourists have arrived in Taiwan in
the hope of finding their loved ones. Representatives of Guangdong tourism
department have also come to keep an eye on developments. Local cable channels
aired a press conference held in China on Sunday at which grieving family

      <P>A spokesperson for the family members listed three demands: They must see the
bodies of their loved ones, dead or alive; all personal belongings must be
brought back to Zhuhai; and if necessary, a big ritual must be held in Taiwan to
pay respect to the victims.</P>
      <P>Fan Guishan, director of the Taipei-based Cross-Strait Tourism Association, said
a special task force has been set up to offer assistance and consolation to the

      <P>The passports of Tian and all 20 Chinese from the Harula bus have been found, as
have some personal belongings such as luggages, jackets, notebooks and
souvenirs. Tires, horns and other parts of the Hong Tai tour bus have also been
found.</P>
      <P>In addition to meticulously combing the area on foot and with vehicles, the
military has dispatched helicopters and rescue boats to search the area in all
directions.</P>
      <P>The Suhua Highway is 118 kilometers in length, and the section between the 112-

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Monday on Taiwan's  65th Retrocession  Day that
Taiwan's  return to the Kuomintang-led Republic of China from its Japanese
colonial rulers in 1945 was "procedurally clear" and had a documented legal
basis.</P>
      <P>The handover -- recognized as Taiwan's Retrocession Day on Oct. 25 each year --
was clearly documented in the 1943 Cairo Declaration, the 1945 Potsdam
Declaration, and the 1945 Japanese Instrument of Surrender, Ma said at the
opening of an exhibition of historical photos and documents to mark the
occasion.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan's return to the Republic of China was procedurally extremely clear.
Every document and every move had legal and political significance," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The three documents constituted the most important foundation of Taiwan's
retrocession, he said, describing them as "binding."</P>
      <P>Ma's argument attempted to counter those who believe Taiwan's status has never
been finalized.</P>
      <P>They contend that the San Francisco  Peace Treaty,  which officially ended World
War II when it took effect in April 1952, did not explicitly cede Taiwan to any
party, leaving its sovereignty status uncertain.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the president spoke of his overwhelming emotion recalling Taiwan's
fate and spells of misfortune since the beginning of the 20th century.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can forgive Japan's mistake of invasion, but we in Taiwan should never
forget the history," Ma said.</P>
      <P>He urged Taiwanese citizens to forget the hatred wrought by war and turn the
sentiment into "a strength of peace."</P>
      <P>Ma called for further improvement in Taiwan-Japan relations, such as through the
imminent opening of air links between the city airports of Taipei and Tokyo, and
said he hoped people on both sides could live together in peace and prosperity.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed 1.7 percent higher and breached the 8,300-point level
for the first time since Jan. 18 on Monday, benefiting from a rebound in the
high-tech sector amid optimism over demand from China, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 138.92 points to 8,306.98, after moving between 8,199.49
and 8,307.59, on turnover of NT$127.10 billion (US$4.12 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.44 percent, and the momentum accelerated as investors
expected that growing demand for electronics products in China would offset
slowing sales in the United States and Europe, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The buying also spilled over to the old economy sector and financial stocks as
the market found itself awash in liquidity, they said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,696 stocks closed up and 1,361 finished down, with 306 stocks
remaining unchanged. All eight major sectors ended higher.</P>
      <P>The plastics and chemical sector scored the biggest gains, rising 2.07 percent.
Paper and pulp shares added 1.78 percent, machinery and electronics stocks rose
1.75 percent, financial shares added 1.49 percent and construction stocks closed
up 0.85 percent.</P>
      <P>Foodstuff issues rose 0.41 percent, cement stocks gained 0.34 percent, and the
textile sector closed up 0.23 percent.</P>
      <P>"The buying was strong after recent consolidation had digested much of technical
pressure ahead of the 8,300 point mark, " Taiwan International Securities
analyst Michael Chiang said.</P>
      <P>"It was basically a liquidity driven market," he said.</P>
      <P>Chiang said market sentiment improved after the local media reported Monday
morning that China's prolonged Oct. 1 National Day holiday had ignited a buying
spree, significantly lowering the inventories of high-tech products there.</P>
      <P>"The inventory adjustments are expected to increase product shipments in the
fourth quarter, " Chiang said. "That's why investors turned upbeat."</P>
      <P>Chiang said the buying focused on large cap high-tech stocks.</P>
      <P>PC vendor Acer gained 4.94 percent to NT$87.10 and rival AsusTek rose 6.72
percent to NT$246.00.</P>
      <P>Among old economy stocks, Formosa Plastics added 2.84 percent to NT$86.90 and
Shinkong Synthetic  Fiber gained 3.46 percent to NT$16.45.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Travel Agent Association on Monday urged all tour groups to only use
buses installed with the global positioning system (GPS) , as search and rescue
teams continued to search for a group of missing Chinese tourists who were on a
bus not equipped with such a system.</P>
      <P>The bus is feared to have fallen off the Suhua Highway when parts of the major
scenic coastal route collapsed from rockslides and heavy rain brought by Typhoon
Megi last week. The bus was carrying 19 tourists as well as their tour guide and
bus driver when they were last heard from on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's authorities do not know exactly where the bus is. They believe it could

still missing. The tourists are from Guangdong Provinces Zhuhai City, with the
bus operated by Harula Travel Agent. A bus driver and Chinese tour leader who
worked for Hong Tai Tour Co. are also missing along with their bus. The
passengers of that bus got out in time. Also missing is a Taiwanese couple.</P>

      <P>Merrill Lynch said Monday it has raised its target price to NT$100 (US$3.24)
from NT$84 for Formosa Plastics on expectations that rising petrochemical
product prices will boost the company's bottom line.</P>
      <P>In a research note, Merrill Lynch said the market consensus on Formosa Plastics'

since the global petrochemical sector is in a cyclical upturn.</P>

      <P>"The EPS revision stems from a new margin forecast for its various premium-grade

      <P>The Bank of China, one of the first Chinese banks that have been permitted to
set up a representative office in Taiwan, held a low-profile inaugural ceremony
for its office in Taipei on Monday, amid concerns about its impact on Taiwan's
upcoming local elections.</P>
      <P>Local media reports cited speculation that the bank's low-profile opening was
the result of a request from Taiwan's  financial regulator, the Financial
Supervisory Commission.</P>
      <P>The opening is coming just weeks before the Nov. 27 election of mayors,
councilors and ward chiefs in Taipei City and four soon-to-be established
special municipalities in Taiwan. Some segments of Taiwan's population are
concerned about the government and ruling party opening too much or too fast to
Chinese investments.</P>
      <P>FSC Chairman Chen Yu-chang, however, has denied such speculations at the
legislature.</P>
      <P>A source familiar with the bank's opening told reporters that bank officials had
originally planned a high-profile opening, but that the plans were later
scrapped.</P>
      <P>Bank of China Chairman Xiao Gang, who visited Taiwan for the first time this
week, declined to speak to the media following a noon banquet in celebration of
the bank's office opening.</P>
      <P>Under existing regulations, Chinese banks are required to operate a
representative office in Taiwan for no less than a year before they can seek
approval to upgrade the office into a bank branch, which can get into profit-
making operations.</P>
      <P>Representative offices of foreign banks in Taiwan are not allowed to conduct
profit-making activities and can only liaise with local banks and customers and
collect information on the local financial market.</P>
      <P>Xiao reportedly will visit several financial institutions in Taiwan during his
10-day stay here. The private banquet was attended by the chairmen or general
managers of local banking organizations, including First Financial Holding Co.,
Mega Financial Holding Co. and the Taiwan Cooperative Bank.</P>
      <P>Susan Chang, who is the head of the Taipei-based Bankers Association of the
Republic of China and chairwoman of Taiwan Financial Holding Co., told reporters
before attending the event that the association will "provide all the necessary
help" to the Chinese lender's office.</P>
      <P>Last month, the FSC approved the applications of the Bank of China and China's
Bank of Communications to establish an office in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The FSC is now reviewing a similar application from the China Merchants Bank.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Magazine digest -- Green tourism in, PET bottles out in Taitung</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/25/10  20:26:38
(CommonWealth 457)(Translated by Kay Liu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Providing free water stations along its highways to encourage bicycle riders to
bring their own water bottles is one of the strategies Taitung County has
adopted to promote itself as a green tourism destination and a cycling paradise.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of October, stations providing potable water have been set
up every 10 kilometers on Taitung County's two main north-south roadways --
provincial highways No. 9 and No. 11.</P>
      <P>The idea is just one of many recommended by hotelier Stanley C. Yen to boost
tourism in the relatively remote county.</P>
      <P>Yen, the group president of Landis Hotels &amp; Resorts, set up the Alliance
Cultural Foundation to promote the cultural revitalization of aboriginal areas
along Taiwan's east coast by serving as a bridge between the public and private
sectors and integrating  their resources.</P>
      <P>No longer involved in the day-to-day operations of his company, Yen spends at
least half his time in Taitung County searching for potential tourist spots and
looking for problems to be solved.</P>
      <P>He has previously organized direct charter flights between eastern Taiwan and
Hong Kong and invited media, bloggers, writers and tour operators to visit
Taitung to bring in more tourists from the former British territory.</P>
      <P>Many of those being lured to the southeastern county are into cycling, said Wang
Chi-shun, head of a local service station for travelers set up by Giant
Manufacturing Co., one of the world's biggest bicycle makers.</P>
      <P>He said business has increased by 10-20 percent this year, mostly from
foreigners, but he acknowledged that even Giant's outlet was not enough.</P>
      <P>"The lack of a spot to get food, beverages, or supplies is a big problem, " said
Wang, who added that a rider could have trouble finding a convenience store or
restaurant for stretches of 30-40 kilometers in the sparsely populated county.</P>
      <P>Yen's foundation thus partnered with global brand 3M's Taiwan subsidiary to find
a solution.</P>
      <P>"Plastic bottles are major sources of pollution, but how do we keep them out of
the place? We discussed ideas with the foundation and decided to set up water
stations, " said George Chao, general manager of 3M Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The stations hope to create an incentive for travelers to bring their empty
water containers and fill them up with water provided by the stations rather
than buying new bottles of drinking water.</P>
      <P>An increasing number of tourists are also visiting Taitung during the winter for
another outdoor activity that takes advantage of the cool seasonal winds from
the northeast that used to keep tourists away.</P>
      <P>Surfers travel to Taitung every year for the big waves caused by the winds, with
some enthusiasts considering it to be the best surfing spot in East Asia, Yen
said.</P>
      <P>"Mao Chi-kuo was surprised at how many tourists from Japan and western countries
there were despite the heavy winds, " Yen said, recalling the reaction of the
minister of Transportation  and Communications during their trip to the area
last year.</P>
      <P>"Yen has helped Taitung a lot in the past two years, " said Taitung County
Magistrate Justin Huang, who praised Yen for bringing in the right ideas and
influential people such as first lady Chow Mei-ching.</P>
      <P>With cycling and surfing, tourism in Taitung is becoming more diversified.
Meanwhile, the county is experimenting with a new model of low-carbon tourism
that aspires to protect one of the few regions in the country not yet polluted
by industrialization.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Gov't mum on state compensation for Chinese victims</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  25 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah declined  to comment  Monday on whether,
based on the State Compensation Law, compensation would be made to the families
of Chinese tourists who lost their lives in Taiwan because of landslides
triggered by Typhoon Megi.</P>
      <P>Whether Chinese families of the victims could file for state compensation for
the loss of their loved ones is a matter for the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) , Jiang told a Legislative Yuan committee convened to
discuss the recent disaster on the Suhua Highway.</P>
      <P>His ministry will give a consolation payment of NT$1 million (US$32,573) to the
family of each victim of Megi Typhoon, in line with the precedent set after
Typhoon Morakot wreaked havoc on Taiwan in August 2009. Chinese citizens are not
entitled to this sum, however, as they are not ROC citizens, he said.</P>
      <P>Families of the Chinese tourists who lost their lives in the aftermath of
Typhoon Megi might receive an insurance payment up to around NT$5 million, he
suggested.</P>
      <P>MOTC Deputy Minister Yeh Kuang-shih said there had been many accidents on the
Suhua Highway in the past, but there were no cases involving state compensation.</P>
      <P>Chao Chien-min, vice chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, said that
government agencies have been focusing on rescue and road clear-up  and they
would meet later to discuss the issue of compensation.</P>
      <P>Typhoon Megi thrashed Taiwan Oct. 21-22, dumping more than 1,200 millimeters  of
continuous  rainfall  in 48 hours,  mostly on northeastern parts of the island.</P>
      <P>As of Monday noon, official statistics showed the storm left 13 people dead in
Taiwan and 25 others missing, including 20 Chinese citizens.</P>
      <P>The 20 missing Chinese citizens included Tian Yuan, a tour group leader from
Beijing and, on a separate bus, 19 tourists from Guangdong Province.</P>
      <P>The wreckage of Tian's tour bus was found in a ravine into which on Friday it
had plunged over a cliff-edge on the Suhua Highway, the road connecting Suao in
Yilan with Hualien to its south. Most of the passengers survived, but Tian and
the Taiwanese driver remained unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>Military personnel continued looking for survivors or bodies of the missing
Chinese tourists from the air, on land and in the ocean Monday.</P>
      <P>The tour bus carrying the 19 tourists was believed to have been traveling north
on the Suhua Highway Friday when heavy rain and rock slides caused several
sections of the highway to collapse.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China low key amid Taiwan protest over film festival row</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese official in charge of Taiwan affairs was low key Monday when asked
about a row over Taiwan's name at the 23rd Tokyo International Film Festival.</P>
      <P>Sun Yafu, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State
Council, said he only learned about the matter that morning, and he did not have
a complete picture of it.</P>
      <P>The row involved China's delegation at the festival insisting on Saturday that
the Taiwanese delegation attend the festival under the name "Taiwan, China" or
"Chinese Taipei" instead of the name it has always used at the festival and
wanted to use this time -- "Taiwan." As a result, neither the Chinese film stars
or Taiwanese film stars walked down the "green carpet" at the festival.</P>
      <P>On Premier Wu Den-yih's  criticism  that China's  act was "overbearing," Sun
said he had no comment.</P>
      <P>"I have no comprehensive understanding of the dispute, so I can't comment on the
matter substantively, not to mention comment on Wu's views," Sun added.</P>
      <P>But Sun expressed the hope that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should avoid
"unnecessary internal friction, " and that a reasonable arrangement can be made
through coordination.</P>
      <P>He said that after long exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
bilateral relations have undergone dramatic changes, especially after the
inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou in May 2008.</P>
      <P>"The mainland of course would want Taiwan to take part in international
organizations and activities as well as international meetings," Sun said.</P>
      <P>"Both sides could make reasonable arrangements through bilateral coordination so
long as they are made under the premise of not creating two Chinas or one China
one Taiwan," Sun added.</P>
      <P>Sun made the remarks on the sidelines of a seminar to mark the end of Japanese
colonial rule in Taiwan at the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Presidential Office issued a strongly-worded statement late Sunday over
the Chinese delegation's insistence about the name.</P>
      <P>The office said the incident has hurt Taiwanese people's feelings and will
hobble peaceful development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The office asked for immediate remedial measures from China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>County council in recess to protest highway improvement delay</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 25 (CNA)
10/25/10  20:47:29

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hualien County Council decided Monday to go into recess indefinitely in
protest of the central government's long delay in improving the road leading to
the eastern county, which is known for its beautiful natural vistas and tourist
attractions.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) -dominated council launched its protest after deadly
mudslides on the 78-year-old Suhua Highway -- the county's major road link to
Yilan County and Taipei to the north -- left one dead and 25 others missing last
week.</P>
      <P>Council members observed a moment of silence for the victims of the roadway
tragedy, including 19 tourists and a tour leader from China, before passing the
resolution by a vote.</P>
      <P>Council Speaker Yang Wen-chih said Hualien residents and tourists to eastern
Taiwan have long had to risk their lives by traveling on the dangerous windy
highway perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>"Although the central government has proposed a plan to improve the Suhua
Highway, it has so far remained on the drawing board. We need to take strong
action to express our outrage over this procrastination," Yang said.</P>
      <P>If the central government continued to drag its feet, Yang said, the council
would extend its recess in protest.</P>
      <P>Independent councilor Wang Yen-mei said, however, that she did not think the
recess would generate a positive result because the KMT-controlled central
government did not care about Hualien's development.</P>
      <P>Huang Hui-pao, a councilor residing in Hsiulin Township in the northern tip of
the county, said he traveled frequently between Hualien City and his hometown
via the Suhua Highway.</P>
      <P>"Since the landslides last Thursday, the Suhua Highway has nearly been deserted,
" Huang lamented. "With the road cut off, tourists won't come and residents
won't be willing to use the highway."</P>
      <P>To ease Hualien  residents'  apprehension  over the road's conditions,
Transportation and Communications Minister Mao Chi-kuo said Monday that the
damaged section of the Suhua Highway between the 104-kilometer and 116-kilometer
markers will be able to accommodate one-way traffic by Nov. 15.</P>
      <P>Mao, who traveled to the highway's 112.8 km marker to check on progress in
fixing the road, said the Suao-Dongao section suffered the most severe damage
during last week's storm.</P>
      <P>"Engineering personnel are working day and night to clear up mud and rocks in
order to have traffic resume on the coastal highway as early as possible," Mao
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the minister reaffirmed the government's commitment to offer eastern
Taiwan residents a "safe road home" by launching a massive improvement project
for the Suhua Highway.</P>
      <P>"Although we have a north-link railway linking Hualien to Taipei, we still need
to have a safe highway in place to meet the region's traffic demand. And the
safety of the Suhua Highway will be greatly upgraded once the improvement
project is completed," Mao said.</P>
      <P>Some environmentalists have opposed the highway upgrade project, but Mao said
the issue was not about "whether or not" the highway should be improved but
about how to improve it and how the improvement project should be carried out.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry's plan, the highway's Suao-Dongao section will be the
first to be improved, with plans to build a 3.5 kilometer-long tunnel and a 3.5
kilometer-long bridge to bypass the existing roadway.</P>
      <P>The project will also consist of improving the 20 km Nanao-Hoping section and
the 8.5 km Hochung-Tachingshui section, which will require the construction of
many other tunnels and new bridges.</P>
      <P>The construction cannot be completed before 2018, however, even if it starts
next year and is not plagued by glitches, a wait of eight years.</P>

      <P>New Zealand singer Hayley Westenra, who is in Taiwan as part of her Asian Tour
2010, sang "Amazing Grace" at a press conference in Taipei Monday as a prayer
for victims of Typhoon Megi, which thrashed Taiwan last week, leaving 13 people
dead and 25 others unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>Westenra said that she heard about the disaster that Typhoon Megi had wrought in
Taiwan before she departed for Taipei Sunday from her hometown of Christchurch
City, New Zealand, where a 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit in early September.</P>
      <P>She said her heart goes out to the storm victims in Taiwan, and as a singer, she
would like to bring warmth and consolation to those who have suffered, through
her voice and songs.</P>
      <P>A soprano, songwriter and UNICEF Ambassador, Hayley won Taiwan audiences' hearts
last year when she sang "The Moon Represents My Heart" in mandarin with
Taiwanese pop singer Shin at the opening of the Kaohsiung World Games.</P>
      <P>This time, she will stage a concert in the southern port city of Kaohsiung on
Wednesday, singing mostly classical songs with a full orchestra to be played by
the Kaohsiung City Symphony Orchestra, and another concert in Taipei City, Nov.
1, at which she will sing the "Moon Represents My Heart" again with Taiwan's new
pop sensation Yang Tsung-wei.</P>
      <P>She will also stage a concert in Shanghai on Oct. 30 as part of her Asia tour.</P>
      <P>Her first internationally-released album, "Pure, " reached No. 1 on the U.K.
classical charts in 2003 and has sold more than two million copies worldwide.
"Pure" is the fastest-selling international debut classical album to date,

      <P>Taiwan's government is working to foster an environment that will encourage
private companies and local residents to develop green industries and combat
global warming and resource degradation, Environmental Protection Minister
Stephen Shu-hung Shen said Monday.</P>
      <P>The centerpiece of the government's plan, Shen said, was to promote the birth of
50 low-carbon communities around Taiwan in two years, six low-carbon cities
within five years and four low-carbon living regions with 10 years.</P>
      <P>To achieve the goals, the government will push companies and banks devoted to
ecological conservation to open their offices in "low carbon special zones, " in
which electric vehicles will serve as the main transport tool, Shen said at the
opening of the 2010 Taiwan Industrial Green Industry Show (TiGiS).</P>
      <P>In addition, the government also planned to promote green building, make the
agricultural sector more environmentally friendly, and turn incinerators  into
district biomass energy production centers, he said.</P>
      <P>The trade show, in its second year, was jointly organized by the semi-official
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) and the Expo Union Corp.</P>
      <P>The 2010 event, focused around energy, environmental protection and water
technology, has attracted the participation of 180 domestic and foreign
enterprises, with those from abroad originating primarily from the United
States, Canada, Germany, France and Japan.</P>
      <P>This year, a total of 321 booths were set up at the Taipei World Trade Center
for the show, 19 percent more than in 2009, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>Also at the opening ceremony, TAITRA President and CEO Chao Yung-chuan  said
Taiwan's  green technology  has gained global recognition, citing the 2010 World
Competitiveness Yearbook issued by the  Switzerland-based  International
Institute  for Management Development (IMD).</P>
      <P>The report ranked Taiwan sixth among 58 economies around the world in green
technology-generated competitiveness, higher than Singapore at 14th, South Korea
at 15th and Hong Kong at 31st.</P>
      <P>Within Asia, Taiwan was ranked second, trailing only Japan, Chao said.</P>
      <P>The trade show will run through Oct. 28.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Judiciary urged to probe release of murderer who kills again</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Judicial Yuan was urged Monday to investigate a problematic ruling lodged by
a high court judge in 2009 that allowed a man convicted of murdering two girls
to kill again after he was released from jail where he had served only six
years.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiu Yi of the ruling Kuomintang made the request at the
legislature's Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee. Judicial Yuan
Secretary-General Lin Ching-fang was present for lawmakers' questions.</P>
      <P>Chiu questioned the process that the judge, Tsai Kuang-chih, who is now in
custody after being arrested for allegedly being involved in a bribe-taking
scandal, reduced the sentence on the convicted, Chen Kun-ming, in the sixth
retrial at the High Court last May from life imprisonment to 12 years in jail.</P>
      <P>Chen's penalty was later further commuted to half of the term for him to stay
behind the bar thanks to the Reduction of Penalties Act.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chiu criticized that while Chen was also ordered to be placed at
the custody of the Beitou Armed Forces Hospital in suburban Taipei for two more
years after serving his term, Chen -- who was diagnosed as suffering from
insanity -- had been kept at the hospital for only four months after being
released from jail last year.</P>
      <P>Chen was arrested on Oct. 23 on charge of murder again after he was found to
have allegedly beaten a 27-year-old woman to death with a baseball bat at his
rented home in Banciao, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the victim's husband, only identified by his surname Tsai, and other
family members held a news conference at the Legislative Yuan accompanied by
legislator Chiu, in which they accused "the system of killing people."</P>
      <P>Tsai said he "could not understand why the law allows a murderer to be set free
in such a short time."</P>
      <P>Tsai is seeking state compensation for the family's loss of a wife and mother.
The couple's son is less than one year old.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Chen turned himself in, claiming he took the life of a pair of sisters,
aged 7 and 8. He was then convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in both
district and high courts. The courts adopted the results of a medical
examination by the Taipei Veterans General Hospital that said Chen was only
affected by mental disorder instead of the claimed insanity.</P>
      <P>The sentence was kept unchanged in the first three retrials at the High Court
but reduced to 16 years in jail in the fourth retrial , and further to 12 years
in fifth retrial by Judge Tsai Kuang-chih as he adopted the Beitou Hospital's
diagnosis that said Chen was insane.</P>

      <P>While rescue workers were busy searching for a group of Chinese tourists missing
in eastern Taiwan, another group of Chinese nationals were enjoying a leisurely
checkup in the serenity of a hospital in the country's capital.</P>
      <P>The group of 25 tourists, mostly middle-aged women in the beauty and cosmetics
business, completed a detailed health exam Monday morning at Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su
Memorial Hospital, said Alex Hung, president of Shin Kong Medical Club.</P>
      <P>The experience was so enjoyable, Hung said, that some members of the group
canceled the sightseeing part of their trip to squeeze in more health tests
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"In China, a hospital is a place for sick people, " said a woman who would only
identify herself by her surname Qian. She described the Taiwanese hospital as
being more like home, with the strong aroma of coffee replacing the usual smell
of disinfectant.</P>
      <P>This group of medical tourists from Nanjing arrived in Taiwan Friday, a day
after nearly 300 Chinese nationals were stranded on the scenic Suhua Highway on
the east coast because of landslides triggered by Typhoon Megi.</P>
      <P>Most of them have since been evacuated to safety, but 20 of them remained
unaccounted for as of Monday night.</P>
      <P>When asked whether the incident had any impact on her plan to come to Taiwan,
Qian replied that initially her family had had qualms about her journey, but
once a scheduled trip to the eastern part of Taiwan was scrapped, she jumped at
the opportunity.</P>
      <P>The Chinese visitors would not reveal how much they paid for the tour, but each
had to first pay a membership fee of NT$177,890 (US$5,834) to join the
Taiwanese-invested, Guangzhou-based Zion Health Control and Youth Rejuvenation
Center (ZION).</P>
      <P>ZION's stated purpose is to promote Taiwan's medical tourism to upscale
consumers in China, offering them medical services at the centers on the
mainland and bringing them to Taiwan for more thorough checkups once a year.</P>
      <P>According to ZION CEO Tomson Lin, at least two groups of Chinese travelers will
come to Taiwan every month for medical checkups beginning in December,  boosting
the country's medical tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Lin explained that for medical tourism to flourish in Taiwan, promoting low-risk
health checkups is a first step.</P>
      <P>"Not only does it build up consumers' confidence, it is also easily accepted by
most people," he said.</P>

      <P>Search and rescue efforts for 25 people still missing from the collapse of Suhua
Highway in eastern Taiwan due to landslides caused by Typhoon Megi last week,
continued unabated on land, at sea and from the air on Monday, the Central
Emergency Operation Center said.</P>
      <P>The 25 missing people include: a group of 19 Chinese tourists, their Taiwanese
tour guide and driver; a Taiwanese couple; and a Chinese tour leader and a
Taiwanese driver from another tour group. The missing are feared to have fallen
into the sea when their vehicles plunged down a steep mountainside when the
highway they were traveling on collapsed.</P>
      <P>On the ground, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) sent 35 personnel,
including special force soldiers and engineers, to the site at the 114.5 km mark
on the 118-km highway that connects Yilan and Hualien counties.  Search teams
used biometric  and metal detectors.</P>
      <P>Seventy-eight firefighters from Taipei and Taichung Cities, and Taoyuan County
also searched at the site of 112.8 km mark, while 77 firefighters from Taipei
and Taichung counties and the National Fire Agency searched at the 114.5 km
mark. Joining them were 212 firefighters from the fire department of Yilan
County.</P>
      <P>In the aerial rescue, the MND sent an Air Force S-70C helicopter to the 114.5 km
mark to assess the feasibility of transporting excavators there from the air,
while another helicopter was sent to the 110-116 km marks to conduct sea and
coastal searches.</P>
      <P>The MND also sent a 22-member team to the sea to assess the feasibility of
transporting the excavator by boat.</P>
      <P>The center said vehicle wreckage retrieved have been sent to the Yilan Sports
Park for cause analysis and body parts were sent to the Yilan County Funeral
Home for identification.</P>
      <P>The center also said that to help Yilan County, which was battered by torrential
rains brought by Typhoon Megi, the MND has sent 6,651 military personnel to help
with dredging, cleaning and disinfection works in the county.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-based AsusTek Computer Inc., the world's fifth-largest personal computer
vendor, denied Monday that Microsoft Corp. had asked it to pay royalties on its
Android smartphones, which the U.S. software giant said violated patents.</P>
      <P>"We cautiously clarify that there is no such a thing, " AsusTek said in a filing
Monday to Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. in response to a local media report.</P>
      <P>AsusTek said that it owned many patents itself and that it had always respected
the protection and use of patent rights.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language Commercial Times reported that Microsoft sent a high-level
legal officer to Taiwan to ask AsusTek and Acer Inc., the world's second largest
PC vendor, to pay royalties.</P>
      <P>In a filing to the stock exchange later in the day, Acer said it could not
comment on the market speculation.</P>
      <P>Microsoft has already received similar royalties from HTC Corp., the world's
largest maker of smartphones using Google's Android operating system, the report
said.</P>
      <P>Weeks ago, Microsoft filed a lawsuit against Motorola Inc. "for infringement of
nine Microsoft patents by Motorola's Android-based smartphones."</P>
      <P>The patents include synchronizing e-mail, calendars and contacts, scheduling
meetings, and notifying applications of changes in signal strength and battery

    <HEADLINE>After one year, Taiwanese brothers still detained in Tanzania: MOFA</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Monday night confirmed that two
Taiwanese brothers surnamed Hsu have been detained in Tanzania for over a year,
but the ministry said it has closely monitored the situation.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman James Chang said the older brother was the captain of an Oman-
registered fishing boat Tawariq 1.</P>
      <P>The older brother, along with a 30-plus member crew, was detained by Tanzania's
government on March 8, 2009 for fishing illegally and holding an expired fishing
license, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The captain's younger brother, who operated a boat based in Kenya, was also
detained when he went to Tanzania to try and rescue his older brother.</P>
      <P>Chang said the matter was brought to the MOFA's attention on Oct. 25, 2009, and
since then, the country's representative offices in South Africa and Oman have
been closely watching the situation and providing necessary help.</P>
      <P>Chang explained that the ship owner has hired lawyers to oversee the legal
process and that the Oman government was also involved in the matter since the
boat was registered in the Middle Eastern country.</P>
      <P>"We immediately contacted a group of Taiwanese citizens in Tanzania to visit the
two brothers as soon as we were notified of their plight. According to our
knowledge, the two brothers are in good health," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official was unable, however, to offer any approximate timetable for
the release of the two men.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese pop star Selina underwent surgery for burns to over half of her body
in a hospital outside Taipei Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>The star's father Jen Ming-ting said his daughter has been incredibly strong
throughout the five-hour debridement procedure despite the pain and confirmed
more than 50 percent of her body had been burned and 60 percent of the burns
were third degree.</P>
      <P>Her cheeks were also scalded, he said.</P>
      <P>It is the first surgical procedure the singer has undergone since suffering
burns in an accident during the filming of a new television series in Shanghai,
China.</P>
      <P>It would take up to three weeks before knowing if a skin graft would be
necessary, said Jen.</P>
      <P>In an emotional micro blog post, Selina's mother described her daughter as both
brave and strong, adding that she had passed on all the warmth and concern shown
for Selina by her friends since the accident.</P>
      <P>Full recovery could take up to a year, according to some estimates.</P>
      <P>Selina is the stage name of Chia-hsuan Jen, a member of the three-girl pop group

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese delegation was unwise to incite a row over Taiwan's name at the 23rd
Tokyo International Film Festival, a senior official in charge of China-related
affairs said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Through concerted efforts of both sides of the Taiwan Strait over the past
couple of years, cross-strait relations have finally been moving toward positive
interaction and a harmonious, peaceful atmosphere is gradually taking shape, "
said Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chao Chien-min.</P>
      <P>"This hard-won achievement, accomplished with the two sides respecting each
other and working concertedly, deserves to be treasured," Chao said in a keynote
speech delivered ahead of an award presentation ceremony for outstanding cross-
strait exchange promotion groups.</P>
      <P>He expressed regret that the Chinese delegation  told the festival's organizers
last weekend that the Taiwanese delegation should not attend under the name
"Taiwan" but should use the designation of "Taiwan, China" or "Chinese Taipei"
-- the title Taiwan uses when participating in the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Chao said China's demand was unacceptable because Taiwan has participated in the
Tokyo event in the name of Taiwan for many years.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, the event is a private cultural activity organized by a
nongovernmental organization. "It does not carry political  significance  and
has nothing  to do with national sovereignty," he added.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Chinese delegation's  interference  with Taiwan's
participation at the event had hurt the feelings of Taiwan's people, Chao said
Chinese authorities should not brush aside the episode lightly and should
seriously review its attitude toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih also said Monday that Jiang Ping, the leader of the Chinese
delegation, was arrogant and overbearing in demanding the Taiwanese delegation
change its designation  at the Tokyo festival.</P>
      <P>He urged Chinese authorities to maintain their goodwill toward Taiwan and take
remedial measures to prevent the incident from affecting cross-strait
rapprochement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More body parts from Suhua Highway accident victims found</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Yilan District Prosecutors Office said on Monday night that four sets of
body parts were found during the day around the landslide-ridden Suhua Highway
area but the identities of the victims had yet to be confirmed.</P>
      <P>The heavy rains brought by Typhoon Megi last Thursday triggered landslides along
the narrow highway overlooking the Pacific Ocean, burying cars and tourist buses
and disrupting traffic.</P>
      <P>One person has been identified as being killed in the disaster, while 25 others
remain missing.</P>
      <P>On the fourth day of the rescue operation Monday, search and rescue teams found
several broken limbs and body parts, which were immediately sent to the Yilan
County Morgue for DNA testing, the prosecutors office said.</P>
      <P>Chief Prosecutor Wu Hui-lan said one of the limbs found Monday morning was a
right leg, and a preliminary analysis on the toe suggested it belonged to a
female.</P>
      <P>The family members of a missing female Chinese tour leader named Tian Yuan have
provided DNA samples for the medical examiners, hoping for a possible match.</P>
      <P>Wu said the leg was found only 30 meters away from where a female body was
located in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>Another partial body with only the upper torso from the neck down was found
around the same location. Preliminary testing suggested it to be the body of a
male.</P>
      <P>Wu said a finger print identification test would be conducted as soon as
possible to confirm the identity of the body.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon, another set of body parts -- a right leg connected to a left
arm believed to belong to a woman -- was found roughly 8.5 nautical miles from a
harbor in Yilan County's Jhuangwei Township, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the search team found a purse that was later confirmed to be
Tian's. The purse contained her passport as well as the passports of the 20
Chinese tourists in her group, who were all able to flee their bus before it was
buried.</P>
      <P>Two of the 20 sustained minor injuries and were to be kept under medical
observation in Taiwan. The remaining 18 were scheduled to return to China
Tuesday, the Tourism Bureau said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese driver of the tour group also remained unaccounted for as of
Monday night.</P>
      <P>Tian's husband Kou Minghu, who flew to Taiwan immediately after he received the
news that his wife was missing, said he last heard from her Wednesday night when
she told him she was recovering well from a cold.</P>
      <P>Kou described his wife as hardworking, thoughtful, and dedicated to her job. The
director of the China-based Cross-Strait Tourism Association, Fan Guishan, also
complimented Tian, saying all of her tour members praised her service.</P>
      <P>Overall, Typhoon Megi has claimed 13 lives and left another 25 missing.</P>
      <P>Most of the missing come from a tour bus traveling on the Suhua Highway on
Thursday that has yet to be found. There were 19 Chinese nationals from
Guangdong Province's Zhuhai and their Taiwanese tour guide and bus driver on
board.</P>
      <P>A group of 36 family members of the missing tourists along with seven Zhuhai
City officials arrived in Taiwan Monday night and were to stay in a hotel in
Yilan County, where they were to be received by the Travel Agent Association of
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The family members requested to see the bodies, dead or alive, and asked that
all personal belongings found by the search team had to be brought back home to
China.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Chinese official in charge of Taiwan affairs was low key Monday when asked
about a row over Taiwan's name at the 23rd Tokyo International Film Festival.</P>
      <P>Sun Yafu, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State
Council, said he only learned about the matter that morning, and he did not have
a complete picture of it.</P>
      <P>The row involved China's delegation at the festival insisting on Saturday that
the Taiwanese delegation attend the festival under the name "Taiwan, China" or
"Chinese Taipei" instead of the name it has always used at the festival and
wanted to use this time -- "Taiwan." As a result, neither the Chinese film stars
or Taiwanese film stars walked down the "green carpet" at the festival.</P>
      <P>On Premier Wu Den-yih's  criticism  that China's  act was "overbearing," Sun
said he had no comment.</P>
      <P>"I have no comprehensive understanding of the dispute, so I can't comment on the
matter substantively, not to mention comment on Wu's views," Sun added.</P>
      <P>But Sun expressed the hope that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should avoid
"unnecessary internal friction, " and that a reasonable arrangement can be made
through coordination.</P>
      <P>He said that after long exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait,
bilateral relations have undergone dramatic changes, especially after the
inauguration of President Ma Ying-jeou in May 2008.</P>
      <P>"The mainland of course would want Taiwan to take part in international
organizations and activities as well as international meetings," Sun said.</P>
      <P>"Both sides could make reasonable arrangements through bilateral coordination so
long as they are made under the premise of not creating two Chinas or one China
one Taiwan," Sun added.</P>
      <P>Sun made the remarks on the sidelines of a seminar to mark the end of Japanese
colonial rule in Taiwan at the end of World War II.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Presidential Office issued a strongly-worded statement late Sunday over
the Chinese delegation's insistence about the name.</P>
      <P>The office said the incident has hurt Taiwanese people's feelings and will
hobble peaceful development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The office asked for immediate remedial measures from China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>County council in recess to protest highway improvement delay</HEADLINE>

      <P>The Hualien County Council decided Monday to go into recess indefinitely in
protest of the central government's long delay in improving the road leading to
the eastern county, which is known for its beautiful natural vistas and tourist
attractions.</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) -dominated council launched its protest after deadly
mudslides on the 78-year-old Suhua Highway -- the county's major road link to
Yilan County and Taipei to the north -- left one dead and 25 others missing last
week.</P>
      <P>Council members observed a moment of silence for the victims of the roadway
tragedy, including 19 tourists and a tour leader from China, before passing the
resolution by a vote.</P>
      <P>Council Speaker Yang Wen-chih said Hualien residents and tourists to eastern
Taiwan have long had to risk their lives by traveling on the dangerous windy
highway perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</P>
      <P>"Although the central government has proposed a plan to improve the Suhua
Highway, it has so far remained on the drawing board. We need to take strong
action to express our outrage over this procrastination," Yang said.</P>
      <P>If the central government continued to drag its feet, Yang said, the council
would extend its recess in protest.</P>
      <P>Independent councilor Wang Yen-mei said, however, that she did not think the
recess would generate a positive result because the KMT-controlled central
government did not care about Hualien's development.</P>
      <P>Huang Hui-pao, a councilor residing in Hsiulin Township in the northern tip of
the county, said he traveled frequently between Hualien City and his hometown
via the Suhua Highway.</P>
      <P>"Since the landslides last Thursday, the Suhua Highway has nearly been deserted,
" Huang lamented. "With the road cut off, tourists won't come and residents
won't be willing to use the highway."</P>
      <P>To ease Hualien  residents'  apprehension  over the road's conditions,
Transportation and Communications Minister Mao Chi-kuo said Monday that the
damaged section of the Suhua Highway between the 104-kilometer and 116-kilometer
markers will be able to accommodate one-way traffic by Nov. 15.</P>
      <P>Mao, who traveled to the highway's 112.8 km marker to check on progress in
fixing the road, said the Suao-Dongao section suffered the most severe damage
during last week's storm.</P>
      <P>"Engineering personnel are working day and night to clear up mud and rocks in
order to have traffic resume on the coastal highway as early as possible," Mao
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the minister reaffirmed the government's commitment to offer eastern
Taiwan residents a "safe road home" by launching a massive improvement project
for the Suhua Highway.</P>
      <P>"Although we have a north-link railway linking Hualien to Taipei, we still need
to have a safe highway in place to meet the region's traffic demand. And the
safety of the Suhua Highway will be greatly upgraded once the improvement
project is completed," Mao said.</P>
      <P>Some environmentalists have opposed the highway upgrade project, but Mao said
the issue was not about "whether or not" the highway should be improved but
about how to improve it and how the improvement project should be carried out.</P>
      <P>According to the ministry's plan, the highway's Suao-Dongao section will be the
first to be improved, with plans to build a 3.5 kilometer-long tunnel and a 3.5
kilometer-long bridge to bypass the existing roadway.</P>
      <P>The project will also consist of improving the 20 km Nanao-Hoping section and
the 8.5 km Hochung-Tachingshui section, which will require the construction of
many other tunnels and new bridges.</P>
      <P>The construction cannot be completed before 2018, however, even if it starts
next year and is not plagued by glitches, a wait of eight years.</P>

      <P>New Zealand singer Hayley Westenra, who is in Taiwan as part of her Asian Tour
2010, sang "Amazing Grace" at a press conference in Taipei Monday as a prayer
for victims of Typhoon Megi, which thrashed Taiwan last week, leaving 13 people
dead and 25 others unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>Westenra said that she heard about the disaster that Typhoon Megi had wrought in
Taiwan before she departed for Taipei Sunday from her hometown of Christchurch
City, New Zealand, where a 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit in early September.</P>
      <P>She said her heart goes out to the storm victims in Taiwan, and as a singer, she
would like to bring warmth and consolation to those who have suffered, through
her voice and songs.</P>
      <P>A soprano, songwriter and UNICEF Ambassador, Hayley won Taiwan audiences' hearts
last year when she sang "The Moon Represents My Heart" in mandarin with
Taiwanese pop singer Shin at the opening of the Kaohsiung World Games.</P>
      <P>This time, she will stage a concert in the southern port city of Kaohsiung on
Wednesday, singing mostly classical songs with a full orchestra to be played by
the Kaohsiung City Symphony Orchestra, and another concert in Taipei City, Nov.
1, at which she will sing the "Moon Represents My Heart" again with Taiwan's new
pop sensation Yang Tsung-wei.</P>
      <P>She will also stage a concert in Shanghai on Oct. 30 as part of her Asia tour.</P>
      <P>Her first internationally-released album, "Pure, " reached No. 1 on the U.K.

"Pure" is the fastest-selling international debut classical album to date,

      <P>Taiwan's government is working to foster an environment that will encourage
private companies and local residents to develop green industries and combat
global warming and resource degradation, Environmental Protection Minister
Stephen Shu-hung Shen said Monday.</P>
      <P>The centerpiece of the government's plan, Shen said, was to promote the birth of
50 low-carbon communities around Taiwan in two years, six low-carbon cities
within five years and four low-carbon living regions with 10 years.</P>
      <P>To achieve the goals, the government will push companies and banks devoted to
ecological conservation to open their offices in "low carbon special zones, " in
which electric vehicles will serve as the main transport tool, Shen said at the
opening of the 2010 Taiwan Industrial Green Industry Show (TiGiS).</P>
      <P>In addition, the government also planned to promote green building, make the
agricultural sector more environmentally friendly, and turn incinerators  into
district biomass energy production centers, he said.</P>
      <P>The trade show, in its second year, was jointly organized by the semi-official
Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA) and the Expo Union Corp.</P>
      <P>The 2010 event, focused around energy, environmental protection and water
technology, has attracted the participation of 180 domestic and foreign
enterprises, with those from abroad originating primarily from the United
States, Canada, Germany, France and Japan.</P>
      <P>This year, a total of 321 booths were set up at the Taipei World Trade Center
for the show, 19 percent more than in 2009, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>Also at the opening ceremony, TAITRA President and CEO Chao Yung-chuan  said
Taiwan's  green technology  has gained global recognition, citing the 2010 World
Competitiveness Yearbook issued by the  Switzerland-based  International
Institute  for Management Development (IMD).</P>
      <P>The report ranked Taiwan sixth among 58 economies around the world in green
technology-generated competitiveness, higher than Singapore at 14th, South Korea
at 15th and Hong Kong at 31st.</P>
      <P>Within Asia, Taiwan was ranked second, trailing only Japan, Chao said.</P>
      <P>The trade show will run through Oct. 28.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Judicial Yuan was urged Monday to investigate a problematic ruling lodged by
a high court judge in 2009 that allowed a man convicted of murdering two girls
to kill again after he was released from jail where he had served only six
years.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiu Yi of the ruling Kuomintang made the request at the
legislature's Judiciary and Organic Laws and Statutes Committee. Judicial Yuan
Secretary-General Lin Ching-fang was present for lawmakers' questions.</P>
      <P>Chiu questioned the process that the judge, Tsai Kuang-chih, who is now in
custody after being arrested for allegedly being involved in a bribe-taking
scandal, reduced the sentence on the convicted, Chen Kun-ming, in the sixth
retrial at the High Court last May from life imprisonment to 12 years in jail.</P>
      <P>Chen's penalty was later further commuted to half of the term for him to stay
behind the bar thanks to the Reduction of Penalties Act.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Chiu criticized that while Chen was also ordered to be placed at
the custody of the Beitou Armed Forces Hospital in suburban Taipei for two more
years after serving his term, Chen -- who was diagnosed as suffering from
insanity -- had been kept at the hospital for only four months after being
released from jail last year.</P>
      <P>Chen was arrested on Oct. 23 on charge of murder again after he was found to
have allegedly beaten a 27-year-old woman to death with a baseball bat at his
rented home in Banciao, Taipei County.</P>
      <P>On Monday, the victim's husband, only identified by his surname Tsai, and other
family members held a news conference at the Legislative Yuan accompanied by
legislator Chiu, in which they accused "the system of killing people."</P>
      <P>Tsai said he "could not understand why the law allows a murderer to be set free
in such a short time."</P>
      <P>Tsai is seeking state compensation for the family's loss of a wife and mother.
The couple's son is less than one year old.</P>
      <P>In 2003, Chen turned himself in, claiming he took the life of a pair of sisters,
aged 7 and 8. He was then convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in both
district and high courts. The courts adopted the results of a medical
examination by the Taipei Veterans General Hospital that said Chen was only
affected by mental disorder instead of the claimed insanity.</P>
      <P>The sentence was kept unchanged in the first three retrials at the High Court
but reduced to 16 years in jail in the fourth retrial , and further to 12 years
in fifth retrial by Judge Tsai Kuang-chih as he adopted the Beitou Hospital's
diagnosis that said Chen was insane.</P>

      <P>While rescue workers were busy searching for a group of Chinese tourists missing
in eastern Taiwan, another group of Chinese nationals were enjoying a leisurely
checkup in the serenity of a hospital in the country's capital.</P>
      <P>The group of 25 tourists, mostly middle-aged women in the beauty and cosmetics
business, completed a detailed health exam Monday morning at Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su
Memorial Hospital, said Alex Hung, president of Shin Kong Medical Club.</P>
      <P>The experience was so enjoyable, Hung said, that some members of the group
canceled the sightseeing part of their trip to squeeze in more health tests
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"In China, a hospital is a place for sick people, " said a woman who would only
identify herself by her surname Qian. She described the Taiwanese hospital as
being more like home, with the strong aroma of coffee replacing the usual smell
of disinfectant.</P>
      <P>This group of medical tourists from Nanjing arrived in Taiwan Friday, a day
after nearly 300 Chinese nationals were stranded on the scenic Suhua Highway on
the east coast because of landslides triggered by Typhoon Megi.</P>
      <P>Most of them have since been evacuated to safety, but 20 of them remained
unaccounted for as of Monday night.</P>
      <P>When asked whether the incident had any impact on her plan to come to Taiwan,
Qian replied that initially her family had had qualms about her journey, but
once a scheduled trip to the eastern part of Taiwan was scrapped, she jumped at
the opportunity.</P>
      <P>The Chinese visitors would not reveal how much they paid for the tour, but each
had to first pay a membership fee of NT$177,890 (US$5,834) to join the
Taiwanese-invested, Guangzhou-based Zion Health Control and Youth Rejuvenation
Center (ZION).</P>
      <P>ZION's stated purpose is to promote Taiwan's medical tourism to upscale
consumers in China, offering them medical services at the centers on the
mainland and bringing them to Taiwan for more thorough checkups once a year.</P>
      <P>According to ZION CEO Tomson Lin, at least two groups of Chinese travelers will
come to Taiwan every month for medical checkups beginning in December,  boosting
the country's medical tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Lin explained that for medical tourism to flourish in Taiwan, promoting low-risk
health checkups is a first step.</P>
      <P>"Not only does it build up consumers' confidence, it is also easily accepted by
most people," he said.</P>

      <P>On the ground, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) sent 35 personnel,
including special force soldiers and engineers, to the site at the 114.5 km mark
on the 118-km highway that connects Yilan and Hualien counties.  Search teams
used biometric  and metal detectors.</P>
      <P>Seventy-eight firefighters from Taipei and Taichung Cities, and Taoyuan County
also searched at the site of 112.8 km mark, while 77 firefighters from Taipei
and Taichung counties and the National Fire Agency searched at the 114.5 km
mark. Joining them were 212 firefighters from the fire department of Yilan
County.</P>
      <P>In the aerial rescue, the MND sent an Air Force S-70C helicopter to the 114.5 km
mark to assess the feasibility of transporting excavators there from the air,
while another helicopter was sent to the 110-116 km marks to conduct sea and
coastal searches.</P>
      <P>The MND also sent a 22-member team to the sea to assess the feasibility of
transporting the excavator by boat.</P>
      <P>The center said vehicle wreckage retrieved have been sent to the Yilan Sports
Park for cause analysis and body parts were sent to the Yilan County Funeral
Home for identification.</P>
      <P>The center also said that to help Yilan County, which was battered by torrential
rains brought by Typhoon Megi, the MND has sent 6,651 military personnel to help
with dredging, cleaning and disinfection works in the county.</P>

      <P>Taiwan-based AsusTek Computer Inc., the world's fifth-largest personal computer
vendor, denied Monday that Microsoft Corp. had asked it to pay royalties on its
Android smartphones, which the U.S. software giant said violated patents.</P>
      <P>"We cautiously clarify that there is no such a thing, " AsusTek said in a filing
Monday to Taiwan Stock Exchange Corp. in response to a local media report.</P>
      <P>AsusTek said that it owned many patents itself and that it had always respected
the protection and use of patent rights.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-language Commercial Times reported that Microsoft sent a high-level
legal officer to Taiwan to ask AsusTek and Acer Inc., the world's second largest
PC vendor, to pay royalties.</P>
      <P>In a filing to the stock exchange later in the day, Acer said it could not
comment on the market speculation.</P>
      <P>Microsoft has already received similar royalties from HTC Corp., the world's
largest maker of smartphones using Google's Android operating system, the report
said.</P>
      <P>Weeks ago, Microsoft filed a lawsuit against Motorola Inc. "for infringement of
nine Microsoft patents by Motorola's Android-based smartphones."</P>
      <P>The patents include synchronizing e-mail, calendars and contacts, scheduling

power, the company said in a recent statement.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on Monday night confirmed that two
Taiwanese brothers surnamed Hsu have been detained in Tanzania for over a year,
but the ministry said it has closely monitored the situation.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman James Chang said the older brother was the captain of an Oman-
registered fishing boat Tawariq 1.</P>
      <P>The older brother, along with a 30-plus member crew, was detained by Tanzania's
government on March 8, 2009 for fishing illegally and holding an expired fishing
license, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The captain's younger brother, who operated a boat based in Kenya, was also
detained when he went to Tanzania to try and rescue his older brother.</P>
      <P>Chang said the matter was brought to the MOFA's attention on Oct. 25, 2009, and
since then, the country's representative offices in South Africa and Oman have
been closely watching the situation and providing necessary help.</P>
      <P>Chang explained that the ship owner has hired lawyers to oversee the legal
process and that the Oman government was also involved in the matter since the
boat was registered in the Middle Eastern country.</P>
      <P>"We immediately contacted a group of Taiwanese citizens in Tanzania to visit the
two brothers as soon as we were notified of their plight. According to our
knowledge, the two brothers are in good health," Chang said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA official was unable, however, to offer any approximate timetable for
the release of the two men.</P>

      <P>Taiwanese pop star Selina underwent surgery for burns to over half of her body
in a hospital outside Taipei Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>The star's father Jen Ming-ting said his daughter has been incredibly strong
throughout the five-hour debridement procedure despite the pain and confirmed
more than 50 percent of her body had been burned and 60 percent of the burns
were third degree.</P>
      <P>Her cheeks were also scalded, he said.</P>
      <P>It is the first surgical procedure the singer has undergone since suffering
burns in an accident during the filming of a new television series in Shanghai,
China.</P>
      <P>It would take up to three weeks before knowing if a skin graft would be
necessary, said Jen.</P>
      <P>In an emotional micro blog post, Selina's mother described her daughter as both
brave and strong, adding that she had passed on all the warmth and concern shown
for Selina by her friends since the accident.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese delegation was unwise to incite a row over Taiwan's name at the 23rd
Tokyo International Film Festival, a senior official in charge of China-related
affairs said Monday.</P>
      <P>"Through concerted efforts of both sides of the Taiwan Strait over the past
couple of years, cross-strait relations have finally been moving toward positive
interaction and a harmonious, peaceful atmosphere is gradually taking shape, "
said Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman Chao Chien-min.</P>
      <P>"This hard-won achievement, accomplished with the two sides respecting each
other and working concertedly, deserves to be treasured," Chao said in a keynote
speech delivered ahead of an award presentation ceremony for outstanding cross-
strait exchange promotion groups.</P>
      <P>He expressed regret that the Chinese delegation  told the festival's organizers
last weekend that the Taiwanese delegation should not attend under the name
"Taiwan" but should use the designation of "Taiwan, China" or "Chinese Taipei"
-- the title Taiwan uses when participating in the Olympic Games.</P>
      <P>Chao said China's demand was unacceptable because Taiwan has participated in the
Tokyo event in the name of Taiwan for many years.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, the event is a private cultural activity organized by a
nongovernmental organization. "It does not carry political  significance  and
has nothing  to do with national sovereignty," he added.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the Chinese delegation's  interference  with Taiwan's
participation at the event had hurt the feelings of Taiwan's people, Chao said
Chinese authorities should not brush aside the episode lightly and should
seriously review its attitude toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih also said Monday that Jiang Ping, the leader of the Chinese
delegation, was arrogant and overbearing in demanding the Taiwanese delegation
change its designation  at the Tokyo festival.</P>
      <P>He urged Chinese authorities to maintain their goodwill toward Taiwan and take
remedial measures to prevent the incident from affecting cross-strait
rapprochement.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Yilan District Prosecutors Office said on Monday night that four sets of
body parts were found during the day around the landslide-ridden Suhua Highway
area but the identities of the victims had yet to be confirmed.</P>
      <P>The heavy rains brought by Typhoon Megi last Thursday triggered landslides along
the narrow highway overlooking the Pacific Ocean, burying cars and tourist buses
and disrupting traffic.</P>
      <P>One person has been identified as being killed in the disaster, while 25 others
remain missing.</P>
      <P>On the fourth day of the rescue operation Monday, search and rescue teams found
several broken limbs and body parts, which were immediately sent to the Yilan
County Morgue for DNA testing, the prosecutors office said.</P>
      <P>Chief Prosecutor Wu Hui-lan said one of the limbs found Monday morning was a
right leg, and a preliminary analysis on the toe suggested it belonged to a
female.</P>
      <P>The family members of a missing female Chinese tour leader named Tian Yuan have
provided DNA samples for the medical examiners, hoping for a possible match.</P>
      <P>Wu said the leg was found only 30 meters away from where a female body was
located in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>Another partial body with only the upper torso from the neck down was found
around the same location. Preliminary testing suggested it to be the body of a
male.</P>
      <P>Wu said a finger print identification test would be conducted as soon as
possible to confirm the identity of the body.</P>
      <P>In the afternoon, another set of body parts -- a right leg connected to a left
arm believed to belong to a woman -- was found roughly 8.5 nautical miles from a
harbor in Yilan County's Jhuangwei Township, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, the search team found a purse that was later confirmed to be
Tian's. The purse contained her passport as well as the passports of the 20
Chinese tourists in her group, who were all able to flee their bus before it was
buried.</P>
      <P>Two of the 20 sustained minor injuries and were to be kept under medical
observation in Taiwan. The remaining 18 were scheduled to return to China
Tuesday, the Tourism Bureau said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese driver of the tour group also remained unaccounted for as of
Monday night.</P>
      <P>Tian's husband Kou Minghu, who flew to Taiwan immediately after he received the
news that his wife was missing, said he last heard from her Wednesday night when
she told him she was recovering well from a cold.</P>
      <P>Kou described his wife as hardworking, thoughtful, and dedicated to her job. The
director of the China-based Cross-Strait Tourism Association, Fan Guishan, also
complimented Tian, saying all of her tour members praised her service.</P>
      <P>Overall, Typhoon Megi has claimed 13 lives and left another 25 missing.</P>
      <P>Most of the missing come from a tour bus traveling on the Suhua Highway on
Thursday that has yet to be found. There were 19 Chinese nationals from
Guangdong Province's Zhuhai and their Taiwanese tour guide and bus driver on
board.</P>
      <P>A group of 36 family members of the missing tourists along with seven Zhuhai
City officials arrived in Taiwan Monday night and were to stay in a hotel in
Yilan County, where they were to be received by the Travel Agent Association of
the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>The family members requested to see the bodies, dead or alive, and asked that
all personal belongings found by the search team had to be brought back home to
China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Organizers apologize over China's hostility at Tokyo film fest</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The organizing committee of the 23rd Tokyo International Film Festival on Monday
offered an apology to the Taiwanese delegation, which was unable to walk the
"green carpet" on the opening day due to a protest raised by the Chinese
delegation over Taiwan's name.</P>
      <P>Festival office chief Nobushige Toshima told the Central News Agency in a
telephone interview that the Taiwanese delegation was among the distinguished
guests invited by the festival organization while the Chinese were not.</P>
      <P>On the opening night of the festival on Saturday, as throngs of international
stars and film makers were gracing the green carpet, the Taiwanese and Chinese
groups were feuding over the name that would be used to introduce Taiwan's
delegation.</P>
      <P>The Chinese side headed by director Jiang Ping demanded that Taiwan's group use
the word "China" as part of its name, a request deemed unreasonable and rejected
by the Taiwanese delegation led by Chen Chih-kuan, director of the Department of
Motion Pictures Affairs under the Government Information Office.</P>
      <P>The argument lasted over 90 minutes, causing both delegations to miss their
grand entrances.</P>
      <P>Speaking to the CNA, Toshima said the committee was shocked and dumbfounded when
it received the news regarding the feud. But when asked why the organizers did
not step in to mediate the dispute, he admitted the committee did not take good
care of the Taiwanese delegation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been a regular participant at the festival and has always attended
under the name "Taiwan, " he said, and he promised that the committee would not
deviate from that as long as Taiwan continues to be part of the event in the
future.</P>
      <P>During the argument, Jiang threatened the committee with an ultimatum that if
the name issue was not resolved in China's favor within 10 minutes, the Chinese
delegation would withdraw from the festival and contemplate never attending
again.</P>
      <P>According to an individual familiar with the film festival, Jiang's behavior
left the committee feeling "used" as his own self-promoting tool. Although the
Chinese delegation was at fault, the committee had its hands tied, the source
said.</P>
      <P>He also pointed out that Jiang participated in the film festival last year but
did not make the same request. If Jiang had made the demand one week ahead of
the event, the organizer would have had time to come up with a solution, but
what Jiang did caught everyone by surprise.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, the news of the row has sparked a heated response from the government
as well as the public. Premier Wu Den-yih described the behavior by the Chinese
delegation as "ruthless, " while legislators have proposed to list Jiang as
persona non grata.</P>

      <P>The head of Taiwan's delegation to the 23rd Tokyo International Film Festival
said Monday that he was sorry Taiwanese stars missed walking down the green
carpet at the opening of the event but stressed that the country's dignity had
to be upheld.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-kuan, director of the Government Information Office's Department of
Motion Pictures Affairs, was referring to the demand by Jiang Ping, head of
China's delegation, who insisted that Taiwan attend under the name of "Taiwan,
China" or "Chinese Taipei, " a demand Taiwan flatly rejected.</P>
      <P>The spat resulted  in both China and Taiwan missing  the opportunity to walk
down the "green carpet" Saturday. Vivian Hsu, one of the actresses in Taiwan's
delegation, reportedly cried out of deep frustration.</P>
      <P>Speaking upon his return to Taiwan, Chen said other issues should not have been
brought into a cultural event, and he expressed his sorrow for the frustration
felt by Taiwanese stars.</P>
      <P>"But national dignity is paramount, and should be considered," he said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  a party whip of the ruling Kuomintang in the Legislative Yean said
Monday that he has proposed Jiang be listed as persona non grata in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Legislator George Hsieh also said he will appeal for signatures in Facebook to
tell China that this is not an act that Taiwan will tolerate.</P>
      <P>In related news, an official of the Executive Yuan said Monday that this is a
"Jiang Ping incident" and that he should be listed as persona no grata.</P>
      <P>The official, who asked for anonymity, said that if Beijing was pulling the
strings behind Jiang, then his move was aimed at getting Taiwan to withdraw from
the festival. But in the end, it was Jiang who left the festival early.</P>
      <P>In addition, the organizers of the festival called on Chen Sunday to say that
all remaining activities would be held as usual and not be affected by politics,
the official said.</P>
      <P>This did not conform to the past pattern of China pressuring Taiwan, he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan extended its winning streak to three in round-robin play of the
Intercontinental Cup in Taichung Monday when it coasted past Hong Kong 10-0.</P>
      <P>It was the first time Taiwan and Hong Kong had competed against each other in an
international baseball tournament, and the two teams will face each other again
next month at the Asian Games held in Guangzhou, China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's starting pitcher Lin Chen-hua pitched all seven innings of the game,
called early because of the 10-run rule, striking out nine while yielding only
two hits.</P>
      <P>"I appreciated the chance to start the game. I always give everything I have,
whether the opponent is powerful or not," Lin said in a post-game interview.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong team, making its debut in the tournament with nine under-18
players on its 20-man roster, has had few chances to compete with other
countries since its first baseball association was founded in 1993.</P>
      <P>The young team managed to surprise the host fans by getting the first hit of the
game, while Taiwan was kept scoreless in the bottom of the first as its batters
were caught off balance by Hong Kong starter Leung Yu-hung's slow breaking ball.</P>
      <P>Kao Kuo-ching's grounder in the second inning brought home the first run for
Taiwan, and the host added two runs in the fifth inning on Chen Chun-hsiu's RBI
triple and Lo Kuo-hui's RBI-double.</P>
      <P>Taiwan put the game completely out of reach in the sixth when it jumped out to
an 8-0 lead.</P>
      <P>In another game of the same group, favorite Cuba defeated South Korea 3-0. The
10-time champion of the tournament will face Taiwan on Tuesday in a game that
will likely determine the group's winner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan's per capita private wealth third highest in Asia: Allianz</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan's financial assets per capita exceeded 50,000 euros in 2009, the third
highest among Asian countries and the 18th highest among 50 countries from
around the world, according to the 2010 Allianz Global Wealth Report.</P>
      <P>With financial assets per capita of 51,332 euros, Taiwan was classified by the
report as one of 21 high wealth countries out of the 50 surveyed, said the
report released Monday.</P>
      <P>Japan, ranked fifth in the world at 88,659 euros, and Singapore, ranked 10th in
the world at 66,831 euros, were the only Asian countries among nine surveyed to
have higher financial assets per capita than Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report on private household  wealth,  compiled by the Frankfurt, Germany-
based Allianz Group, also found that Taiwan's per capita financial assets grew
by an average of 5.6 percent between 2001 and 2007, lower than the growth
enjoyed by Asia's emerging economies, such as China and India.</P>
      <P>In 2008, however, when the financial assets of private households around Asia as
a whole contracted by more than 4 percent, or around 800 million euros, Taiwan
also suffered negative growth.</P>
      <P>Though experiencing a 5.1 percent rebound year-on-year in 2009, Taiwan's
financial assets per capita still had not fully recovered from the global
financial crisis, remaining slightly below the 2007 level, the report said.</P>
      <P>Of the other Asian companies surveyed, only Japan had also not rebounded to pre-
financial crisis per capita wealth levels, but much of the rest of the world,
and especially industrialized countries, faced similar predicaments.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the global wealth of private households in 2009 (82.24
trillion euros) was still 4 percent lower than the 85.59 trillion reached before
the crisis.</P>
      <P>Globally, there were about 565 million people classified as part of the middle
wealth class (with assets between 5,300 euros and 31,600 euros), considerably
higher than the 300 million classified as such in 2000.</P>
      <P>Of these 210 million, or 38 percent of the world's total, lived in Asia, with 9
million in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Of the 493 million people with high wealth, 110 million (23 percent) were in
Asia, but a high percentage of this group (79 percent) was concentrated in
Japan.</P>
      <P>Other Asian countries studied in the survey were South Korea (24,821 euros),
Malaysia (9,631 euros), China (2,521 euros), Thailand (1,754 euros), India (544
euros) and Indonesia (532 euros).</P>

    <HEADLINE>United Daily News: Beijing's manipulation or personal incident?</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/26/10  12:15:57
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At the 23rd Tokyo International Film Festival, the Chinese delegation's leader,
Jiang Ping, demanded that Taiwan attend the event under the name "Taiwan, China"
or "Chinese Taipei." We hope that this incident stemmed from Jiang's personal
rudeness and ignorance and did not represent Beijing's official stance.
Otherwise, it would irrevocably damage cross-Taiwan Strait relations.</P>
      <P>First, Jiang's demand ran counter to Beijing's current policy toward  Taiwan,
which emphasizes  "peaceful  development"  and "diplomatic truce." Second, his
claim that "Taiwan is part of China" was inconsistent with Beijing's latest
statement that "both the mainland and Taiwan are part of China."</P>
      <P>We do not believe this incident was the result of Beijing's manipulation of the
Taiwan issue.  Nevertheless,  the incident highlights the necessity for Beijing
to adopt a more open-minded and innovative policy to ensure an equal footing for
Taiwan and the mainland.</P>
      <P>If Beijing does not do so, cross-strait ties could get hurt very often without
cause or reason,  and a struggle  could erupt sporadically between doves and
hawks in China. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 26, 2010)</P>

    <HEADLINE>Volkswagen: No agreement reached on investment in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>German automobile maker Volkswagen said it had not yet reached any concrete
agreement on investing in Taiwan, but indicated that the island remained in
consideration as a possible location for an overseas production site.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese media reported on Monday that Volkswagen and Yulon Motor Co., Taiwan's
largest auto maker, were expected to strike a deal under which Yulon would
assemble cars for the German company, but a company spokesman in Germany said
the reports were premature.</P>
      <P>The spokesman acknowledged that because the Asian market has played an important
role in the company's long term expansion strategy, "Volkswagen is looking for
opportunities for expansion in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) and Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"But Volkswagen has not reached any concrete agreement on investing in Taiwan, "
the spokesman said, declining to disclose further details about Volkswagen's
expansion plan.</P>
      <P>Media reports said Yulon was expected to produce two Volkswagen models,
including the Golf, in an initial production phase, with the two companies
currently engaged in negotiations on details, including assembly costs and
production volume.</P>
      <P>The two sides were expected to reach a deal by the end of November, according to
the reports.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Minister of Economic Affairs Shih Yen-shiang previously told reporters
he was aware that Yulon and Volkswagen had met but declined to disclose any
further information.</P>
      <P>Shih indicated, however, that the government welcomed foreign investment in
Taiwan and would try its best to provide assistance to foreign investors, such
as finding land for factory construction.</P>
      <P>The local media also said Volkswagen is looking for potential partners in Taiwan
to produce auto components.</P>
      <P>Volkswagen, headquartered in Wolfsburg, Germany, is Europe's largest car maker
in Europe. Its brands include Audi, Porsche, Seat, Lamborghini and Scania.</P>
      <P>The German firm was one of the first foreign investors in China, and its annual
sales volume there has reached 2 million units.</P>
      <P>Through its aggressive efforts to expand in Asia, Volkswagen hopes to replace
Toyota as the world's largest car producer by 2018.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih promised on Tuesday that the government would begin holding
tenders for work on a project to improve the safety of the Suhua Highway
immediately after the plan passed an environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>The project, he said, could be completed by the end of 2016 or earlier if the
environmental impact assessment were conducted and passed in a strict and just
manner, and the construction proceeded without any obstacles.</P>
      <P>The premier also vowed to spend a significant sum to maintain the vital roadway
linking Yilan and Hualien counties in eastern Taiwan before the completion of
the upgrade project.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang  (KMT)  Legislator  Wang Ting-sheng,  who questioned Wu on the
issue at a legislative hearing Tuesday, also asked the Taiwan Railways
Administration to increase service on eastern Taiwan rail lines while work on
the road improvement was underway.</P>
      <P>According to the premier, the Cabinet asked the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) in late September to conduct an environmental impact
assessment of the improvement project, and the first meeting of the EPA's panel
of experts was held on Oct. 18.</P>
      <P>The issue gained urgency after the accident-prone highway was hit by a series of
landslides during heavy rains brought by Typhoon Megi last week, leaving one
person dead and 25 others missing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Taiwan third in Asia in per capita wealth</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/26/10  13:44:51
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan ranked third in Asia behind only Japan and Singapore with per capita
financial assets of 51,330 euros (NT$2.126 million or US$70,406) at the end of
2009, according to a report released Monday by the Germany-based Allianz Group.</P>
      <P>The group's Global Wealth Report reviewed household financial assets in 50
countries around the world at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked 18th in the Allianz global rating, while Japan finished fifth and
Singapore 10th. All three were listed as high wealth countries in the report.</P>
      <P>According to the report, more than 9 million people, or 40 percent of Taiwan's
population, were classified as middle wealth class people, defined as those with
financial assets ranging between 5,300 euros and 31,600 euros.</P>
      <P>Also Monday, the British newspaper Daily Mail unveiled the Legatum Institute's
latest Global Prosperity Index that ranked Taiwan 22nd globally in terms of its
ability to foster nine drivers of prosperity. The rating was two notches up from
its 2009 ranking.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the reports: United
Daily News:</P>
      <P>The Allianz Group released on Monday the latest edition of its "Global Wealth
Report, " which was based on the financial assets held by private households in
50 countries around the world at the end of 2009.</P>
      <P>The report said that although global financial markets calmed down last year,
losses in wealth caused by the 2008 credit crunch had yet to be overcome.</P>
      <P>According to the report, global financial assets have grown at an average clip
of 3.7 percent a year since 2001, but any gains were largely offset by an
average global inflation rate of 3.4 percent over the same period.</P>
      <P>Even more discouraging was that global financial assets at the end of 2009 were
still some 4 percent lower than the level reached before the crisis, the report
said.</P>
      <P>Michael Heise, the group's chief economist, said most countries and individual
investors have not yet fully overcome their wealth losses during the global
financial crisis. Some emerging markets, particularly those in Asia, were able
to buck the trend, however.</P>
      <P>Led by China, India and Indonesia, emerging Asian countries have maintained
average annual growth of more than 10 percent in per capita financial assets,
the report said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Taiwan managed to register 5.6 percent growth in per capita
financial assets for much of the previous decade, higher than the global average
but eclipsed by China's and India's double digit growth.</P>
      <P>According to the Allianz report, Taiwan's per capita household financial assets,
including bank deposits, securities, hedge funds and insurance policies,
exceeded 50,000 euros at the end of 2009, ranking 18th in the Allianz global
rating.</P>
      <P>The world's 10 richest countries in the Allianz survey were Switzerland, the
United States, Denmark, the Netherlands, Japan, Belgium, Britain, Australia,
Ireland and Singapore. (Oct. 26, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>According to the Daily Mail report, Taiwan ranked 22nd in the 2010 Global
Prosperity Index compiled by the Legatum Institute, a global  investment
organization,  moving up from 24th in the institute's 2009 survey.</P>
      <P>Among Asian countries, Taiwan trailed Singapore (17th) , Japan (18th) and Hong
Kong (20th).</P>
      <P>The Prosperity Index gauges nine major indicators that drive economic growth and
contribute to quality of life -- economic fundamentals,   entrepreneurish  and
innovation,  democratic institutions, education, health, safety and security,
governance, personal freedom and social capital.</P>
      <P>The countries and areas studied encompassed over 90 percent of the world's
population.</P>
      <P>The top five countries were Norway, Denmark, Finland, Australia and New Zealand.

    <HEADLINE>HTC sued for patent infringement by Gemalto</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Gemalto NV, a Netherlands-based provider of digital security services, said
Monday it had filed a lawsuit in a district court in the United States against
Taiwan's smartphone maker HTC Corp. for patent infringement.</P>
      <P>Gemalto is also suing U.S.-based Google Inc. and Motorola Inc., as well as
Samsung Electronics of South Korea, claiming all four had infringed its patents
by using its technologies in Google's Android operating system, a statement
issued by the company stated.</P>
      <P>The patented technologies were developed at Gemalto's research and development
base in Texas in the 1990s, claimed the lawsuit, filed in the Eastern District
of Texas.</P>
      <P>Gemalto said the patents were fundamental to running software developed in a
programming language such as Java on a resource- constrained device.</P>
      <P>"Gemalto  is recognized  as a pioneer  and ground-breaking contributor to the
JavaCard -- one of the devices for which the patented technologies were
conceived, " the company said in the statement.</P>
      <P>"This lawsuit is necessary  to protect our investment  in innovation,  " Gemalto
said. "The technologies we develop and associated intellectual property rights
are essential to Gemalto's future."</P>
      <P>HTC was not immediately available for comment on the litigation.</P>
      <P>According to Gartner, an information technology research firm, Android ranked as
the U.S. number one and world number three most popular smartphone operating
system after overtaking Apple's iPhone OS.</P>

    <DATELINE>10/26/10  14:24:15
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In Taiwan, great discrepancies exist between statistics on cross-Taiwan Strait
trade compiled by different government agencies.</P>
      <P>For example, Taiwan's exports to China in 2009 totaled US$54.25 billion
according to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and US$62.09 billion according to the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>While the MOF bases its statistics on customs declaration forms filed by
exporters, the MOEA and MAC try to include indirect exports via Hong Kong. Both
numbers are inaccurate. The MOF tends to underestimate the volume of China-bound
exports, and the MOEA uses a strange formula to estimate export volume.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait trade and economic ties beginning to normalize following  the
signing of the economic  cooperation  framework agreement, the government should
try to guide exporters to truthfully report the ultimate destinations of their
shipments so that clear distinctions can be made between China-bound and Hong
Kong-bound exports.</P>
      <P>This will ensure that the country's statistics reflect the true state of cross-
strait trade and allow the government to make better policy judgments.

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.43 percent Tuesday on follow-through buying
after the index stood above the 8,300-point mark for the first time in more than
nine months a day earlier, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 36.25 points to 8,343.23, after moving between 8,319.01
and 8,353.86, on turnover of NT$119.49 billion (US$3.93 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.36 percent as investors took their cues from a six-month
high recorded on Wall Street overnight, and the buying continued, largely
focusing on old economy stocks amid optimism toward their earning outlooks, the
dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,176 stocks closed up and 1,728 were down with 399 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector posted the highest gains, up 1.94 percent. Plastics
and chemical stocks added 1.77 percent, textile shares rose 1.3 percent, cement
shares gained 0.72 percent and foodstuffs closed up 0.48 percent.</P>
      <P>The financial sector rose 0.3 percent, the construction sector gained 0.22
percent and the machinery and electronics sector closed up 0.15 percent.</P>
      <P>"With foreign funds continuing to flow into the local market, ample liquidity
has served as a driving force to the gains, " Concord Securities analyst Allen
Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said investors, leaving the bellwether electronics sector behind for now,
resumed intensive buying in traditional industrial firms during the trading
session.</P>
      <P>"The domestic demand-oriented old economy sector is unlikely to be affected by a
rising New Taiwan dollar, while the currency appreciation is expected to hurt
high-tech exports," Lin said.</P>
      <P>However, after strong showings in the recent few sessions, the market is moving
closer to the nearest technical resistance at around 8,400 points, Lin said.</P>
      <P>"Unless turnover expands to NT$140 billion or more, the market is expected to
consolidate for some time before overcoming the technical difficulties," he
said.</P>
      <P>Formosa Plastics rose 3.57 percent to NT$90.00 after Merrill Lynch raised its
target price on the stock to NT$100 from NT$84.00 on rising product prices.</P>
      <P>Among the other old economy stocks, Taiwan Pulp and Paper gained 5.53 percent to
close at NT$20.05, while textile firm Far Eastern New Century added 2.85 percent

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has been trying to raise its international profile with the goal of
becoming a full member of the world community even though its relations with
mainland China have improved over the past year, the British Broadcasting
Corporation has reported.</P>
      <P>The efforts to stake out a more distinct international image are "part of a
strategy promoted by President Ma Ying-jeou, who says Taipei must increase its
so-called 'soft power' if it is to stand on the international stage," said the
BBC on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The strategy "includes  developing  globally famous brands, boosting Taiwan's
presence not only in the high-tech sector but also in arts, food and fashion,
and marketing great things about Taiwan," it said in a dispatch from Taipei.</P>
      <P>As part of the efforts to help the outside world to know Taiwan better, the
country's major news agency has increased its coverage in English.</P>
      <P>"The state-funded wire service, the Central News Agency, has been revamped, "
said the BBC. "It now offers its stories written in English about Taiwan on
Google and - for the first time - English video news about the island."</P>
      <P>The efforts to raise Taiwan's profile have been spearheaded by President Ma and
his wife Chow Mei-ching, who has been sent "on more official visits overseas
than most (other) Taiwanese first ladies", said the report.</P>
      <P>Chow has visited the United States, Canada, Germany, Italy and Haiti, where she
promoted Taiwan's performance troupes, read stories to children, and hugged
disaster victims.</P>
      <P>Later this year, Taiwan will open Taiwan Academies to promote Taiwanese culture
and the learning of the Chinese language abroad, partly in response to the
hundreds of Confucius Institutes China established overseas in recent years.</P>
      <P>"Like European countries, which are not militarily strong, this sort of thing
raises their image, " the report quoted Kou Chien-wen, a political science

in Taipei, as saying.</P>
      <P>Analysts believe these efforts are partly aimed at distinguishing Taiwan from
China and at ensuring the world does not forget the cause of the democratic and
self-ruled island - to be recognized as acountry and included in international
decision-making bodies.</P>
      <P>It is not only the government which wants to improve Taiwan's international
standing, the people of Taiwan "also have a strong desire for Taiwan to be
recognized", said the BBC article.</P>
      <P>The effects of Taiwan's efforts to boost its profile may be too early to tell,
the report added, saying that for many Taiwanese people, success will depend on
whether Taiwan is included in international organizations.</P>
      <P>"Ultimately, many Taiwanese people want Taiwan to be given what they see as its
rightful status and long overdue inclusion in global affairs, " it said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Premier takes heat for not closing Suhua Highway during typhoon</HEADLINE>

      <P>Decisions to close roads should be made based on objective standards, said
Premier Wu Den-yih Tuesday in explaining why the government did not close the
Suhua Highway on Oct. 21, when heavy rains triggered lethal landslides on the
roadway.</P>
      <P>At a legislative hearing Tuesday morning, the premier was immediately asked
about the government's approach last Thursday when rains from Typhoon Megi
triggered landslides on the road that left one person dead and 25 others missing
and feared dead.</P>
      <P>"The Suhua Highway often suffers landslides.  Why did the government only start
managing the road after Typhoon Megi and a weather system from the northeast
resulted in deaths? " asked Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Liu Chien-
kuo.</P>
      <P>The premier replied that when the tour buses that suffered accidents during the
storm departed from Sincheng Township in Hualien County between 9:30-10:30 a.m.
on Oct. 21, there was only light rain.</P>
      <P>Data from the Central Weather Bureau (CWB), he said, showed that less than five
millimeters of rain had fallen per hour at the Sincheng weather station from
8-10 a.m. that day, meaning there was no need to keep vehicles off the road.</P>
      <P>Rainfall of 50 mm per hour is the current standard for closing roads, according
to the Directorate General of Highways.</P>
      <P>The premier said the Cabinet has discussed in the past setting up landslide
monitors along the highway to provide information that could help authorities
decide on road closures.</P>
      <P>Other objective indicators that could be used, he said, include hourly rainfall
and maximum wind speed data provided by the Central Weather Bureau.</P>
      <P>Wu said, however, that some Hualien residents, who rely on the Suhua Highway to
head north to Yilan County and Taipei, had objected to the idea, complaining
that the major transportation artery should not be closed arbitrarily.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, environmental groups held a press conference at the Legislative Yuan
to urge the government to push urgently to expand railway services in the area
and develop sea transportation along the country's eastern coast, which had more
predictable time frames than the Suhua Highway project.</P>
      <P>They said they did not object to the highway renovation project, which will
reinforce some existing road sections and bypass others with tunnels and
bridges, but they insisted that the new roads be safe and sustainable and not
approved in haste.</P>

      <P>As two epidemic-command centers were established Oct. 21 to combat dengue fever
in southern Taiwan, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) also drew attention to
a new case in Taipei County and put the north on alert against the disease.</P>
      <P>A 72-year-old male from Wugu Township this week became the third confirmed case
of indigenous dengue fever in Taipei this year. Acknowledging that this number
was yet small, CDC Deputy Director- General Ting Lin said that many more as-yet-
unidentified cases might come to light.</P>
      <P>The elderly patient had not visited the south nor been abroad, but he had lived
close to two patients found to be infected with dengue fever after returning
from a trip to Cambodia in late August.</P>
      <P>"We have reasons to believe that this is the result of a cluster infection, and
suspect that the elderly patient is not the only indigenous dengue patient
living in Wugu, " said Lin, explaining that other people might experience only
minor symptoms and not seek treatment.</P>
      <P>Department of Health (DOH) officials immediately disinfected the patient's
surroundings, mobilized volunteers to clean up possible mosquito-breeding sites,
and set up a dengue-screening station locally to provide free blood tests.</P>
      <P>Lin said that dengue cases hit a record high this week, with 156 cases
nationwide, 139 of them in the southern cities of Kaohsiung and Tainan.
Nevertheless, he warned residents in the north not to lower their guard toward
possible infection.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday that his Cabinet has outlined three programs for
a social housing policy and that under one of the plans, the process of selling
the surface rights for state-owned property has begun.</P>
      <P>Wu made the revelation at a legislative hearing, but did not provide further
details on which state-owned  property he was referring to.</P>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou recently answered a call from a civic organization
promoting social housing with a promise that the government will increase the
percentage of rented public housing in Taiwan to resolve the problem that more
and more people are unable to afford a home amid rising housing prices.</P>
      <P>According to the non-profit Social Housing Promotion Union, the percentage of
so-called "rented public housing" in the country is as low as 0.08 percent,
compared with 6.06 percent in Japan and 29 percent in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>As part of the government's social housing policy, Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin
announced earlier in the day that the capital city will build 4,808 more units
of public housing within the next four years.</P>
      <P>With the already existing 5,986 units, the volume of such housing operated by
the city government will have increased to 10,794 units by 2014, Hau said.</P>
      <P>In the longer term, the city government will continue expanding the scale of
public housing to a total of 20,329 units, he added.</P>
      <P>On a different occasion that same day, Hau further explained his policies on
building social housing and housing for young people who cannot afford to buy a
home in the expansive city of Taipei, saying that they are based on models used
in Singapore and the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>Currently, the percentage of social housing -- housing that is let at low rents
and on a secure basis to people in housing need -- stands at 0.64 percent in
Taipei City, Hau said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih said Tuesday that a cross-Taiwan Strait row over the name
Taiwan is using at the 23rd Tokyo International Film Festival was an individual
incident.</P>
      <P>The row was incited Oct. 23 by Jiang Ping, leader of China's delegation  to the
festival,  who insisted that the Taiwanese delegation should attend the event
under the name of either "Taipei, China" or "Chinese Taipei," instead of the
name it has always used at the festival and wanted to use this time -- "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Jiang's request was flatly rejected by Chen Chih-kuan, leader of the Taiwanese
delegation and director of the Motion Picture Affairs Department Under the
Government Information Office.</P>
      <P>As a result, neither the Chinese nor the Taiwanese film stars walked down the
festival's green carpet at the opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>The name row triggered waves of outcry from Taiwan's public, media and
lawmakers, decrying it as just part of China's efforts to squeeze Taiwan's
international space despite the warming cross-strait relations since President
Ma Ying-jeou took office in May 2008.</P>
      <P>"It should be of course counted as a separate and individual case, since the
ruthless remarks were made only by Jiang and have not been repeated by any of
China's official spokesmen so far, " Wu said while answering questions raised by
Legislator Kao Chih-peng of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party during a
legislative session.</P>
      <P>"It would not be defined as an individual case if those kinds of overbearing
remarks were made by any of China's spokesmen, " Wu added.</P>
      <P>On Kao's challenge as to why the Cabinet had not demanded an apology from
Beijing, Wu said the Presidential Office had already expressed that China should
revise any of its remarks or acts that would hurt the feelings of Taiwan's
people and be detrimental to the development of cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Wu said earlier that same day at the legislature that a response expected the
following day by the Taiwan Affairs Office under China's State Council would be
a major indicator to determine whether the name row incident was indeed an
individual case.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai Shyh-bao of the ruling Kuomintang said at the session that he
suspected the name row was a show purposely put on by the Chinese authorities
and Jiang, who is a famous movie director and a high-ranking official in China's
propaganda department.</P>
      <P>He said the row can only be deemed an individual case if Jiang is dismissed upon
his return to Beijing. "This would not be the case if Jiang were to be
promoted," he said.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry spokesman James Chang also described the row as an individual
incident that will not negatively affect cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>He refused to say whether Jiang will be listed as persona non grata in Taiwan,
as was suggested by some lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Beijing had so far said little about the incident.</P>
      <P>Spokesman Ma Zhaoxu of China's Foreign Ministry told CNA that day that his
ministry "is aware of the name row incident."</P>
      <P>He repeated remarks made by Sun Yafu, deputy director of the Taiwan Affairs
Office a day earlier that as far as Taiwan's participation in the international
community is concerned, "both sides should  make reasonable  arrangements
through  bilateral coordination so long as they are made under the premise of
not creating two Chinas or one China, one Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Almost two-thirds of Taiwanese companies plan to expand their presence in China
to cash in on growing local demand, but many said they do not necessarily prefer
Taiwanese white-collar workers for management positions, a local poll showed
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>About 62 percent of local companies surveyed by 104 Job Bank, an online
employment agency, saw China as a market rather than just a factory for their
products or services, and 64.2 percent planned to increase their investments in
China.</P>
      <P>With only 14.5 percent of respondents regarding China solely as a production
base, this showed a marked transition from a period in which Taiwanese
electronics manufacturing companies invested heavily in setting up factories in
China.</P>
      <P>The transition also follows a recent promise by the Chinese government to boost
local demand through its new five-year plan on national development from 2011.</P>
      <P>While planning to expand their presence in China, 64.4 percent of the local
companies polled also planned to boost their manpower there, in the fields of
management (36.7 percent) , sales (27.3 percent) and marketing (25.5 percent).</P>
      <P>While he believes that Taiwanese white-collar workers have an advantage over
Chinese competitors for management jobs, Max Fang, the agency's public relations
manager, acknowledged that 86 percent of companies said they do not necessarily
prefer Taiwanese job seekers.</P>
      <P>Half of the 86 percent do not consider nationality to be a concern as long as
the company's goals can be achieved, Fang said at a press briefing in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Many China-based Taiwanese companies had previously reserved senior jobs for
Taiwanese nationals due to a lack of trust in Chinese people and in their
professionalism, he added, citing high turnover rate as another problem.</P>
      <P>Kathy Chung, the director of Taiwan's largest coffee-shop chain, 85J Bakery
Cafe, told the press briefing that her company's operations in China had
promoted many Chinese employees to executive positions or hired Chinese
executives from China-based international companies.</P>

      <P>Microsoft Corp. announced Tuesday its first TV service in Taiwan, as the world's
largest software company sought to break into the local TV market in cooperation
with a cable operator.</P>
      <P>The on-demand service, which at present is only available to subscribers of
cable operator "Vee Time" in central Taiwan's Taichung City and Taichung County,
allows users to watch or access TV programs on various Internet-connected
devices, including televisions with set-top boxes,  computers and smartphones
running the Windows operating system.</P>
      <P>"Cable subscribers have felt it inconvenient that they cannot organize favorite
programs or pay by the number of channels they use. We have solved these
problems by using Microsoft's media platform Mediaroom, " Vee Time Chairman
Richard Lai said at a press briefing.</P>
      <P>"Mediaroom  provides  an easy  and friendly  interface  to subscribers, and it
helps cut down operators' costs of running such a service," Lai told reporters.</P>
      <P>The Internet-based service was expected to help increase the company's number of
subscribers from 780,000 this year to 1.5 million by 2011, he said. Furthermore,
he predicted the average revenue per user would rise from NT$550 (US$18) to
NT$800.</P>
      <P>Asked if Vee Time will collaborate with other Taiwanese operators to introduce
this kind of TV service to China, Lai said that Taiwan has a favorable chance in
the media market.</P>
      <P>"Taiwanese operators have advantages in service and content provision. We should
make use of these advantages and introduce our services to the digital
convergence market in China," Lai added.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the sidelines of the press conference, Microsoft Taiwan Corp.
General Manager Davis Tsai confirmed that the first tablet computer launched by
a Taiwanese manufacturer on Microsoft's new Windows 7 operating system will be
unveiled in November, but he declined to reveal the name of the maker.</P>

      <P>Minister  of Transportation  and Communications  Mao Chi-kuo said Tuesday that
he hopes Taipei International Airport can become a "small but beautiful" airport
once its reconstruction is completed in September 2011.</P>
      <P>Mao said the airport, which reflects the personality of the city, will provide
tremendous advantages for business travelers as it is located in downtown
Taipei.</P>
      <P>As part of the reconstruction process, the airport's arrival services for
international flights will be relocated from Terminal 2 to Terminal 1, ahead of
the launch of direct flights between Taipei and Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Oct.
31.</P>
      <P>The relocation, the first-stage of a three-phase reconstruction plan that
started  in March,  will facilitate  the entry  of international  travelers,
according  to the Civil  Aeronautics Administration (CAA).</P>
      <P>Terminal 1 currently  serves domestic flights and provides departure services
for international flights, while Terminal 2 provides arrival services for
international flights.</P>
      <P>In the main lobby of Terminal 1, where international and domestic arriving
passengers are expected to mix from Oct. 31, facilities such as self-check-in
kiosks, huge screens for flight information display systems (FIDS) , and four-
language (Chinese, Japanese, English and Korean) indexes will assist the
travelers, the CAA said.</P>
      <P>A new 60-meter-long baggage conveyor will be ready to deliver the first bags
just seven minutes after an airplane lands, and all luggage within 30 minutes.</P>
      <P>The airport will also provide 500 new trolleys that are easier to control and
will improve the efficiency of baggage handling, the CAA said.</P>
      <P>The entire reconstruction of Taipei International Airport will be completed by
Sept. 2011, when international and domestic flight services will be separately
handled in Terminal 1 and Terminal 2.</P>
      <P>"Inevitably for now there might be some inconvenience and confusion, " Mao said
when he introduced the remodeled terminal 1 to the media. "We are confident,
though, that we will hand in a satisfactory report card once the entire
reconstruction is completed next September, " he said.</P>
      <P>Before the reconstruction moves into the second phase, Terminal 1 is expected to
handle 1.8 million travelers  per year,  with international flights increasing
from 70 to 126 each week.</P>

      <P>Childhood tooth decay is an important indicator for adult oral disease, a
dentist said Tuesday at a National Oral Health Week activity to promote dental
health care to all age groups.</P>
      <P>Bad dental habits from childhood will affect dental health later in life, said
Chiu Yao-chang, a committee member of the Taiwan Dental Association, at the
National Taiwan Science Education Center in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Cavities mostly begin to appear before kids start going to school and after 10th
grade, Chiu noted.</P>
      <P>He explained  that from elementary  school  to 9th grade, school children learn
to brush their teeth after meals and are given fluoridated water, which helps
prevent tooth decay. However, most children then slacken off on oral hygiene,
leading to adult oral disease.</P>
      <P>He also warned that oral problems can be transferred across generations when
adults kiss or feed their infants, passing on the bacteria in their mouths to
their children.</P>
      <P>A study published by the Bureau of Health Promotion in 2004 found some 70
percent of Taiwan's pre-schoolers had an average of 5.5 cavities.</P>

      <P>The hotly debated Suhua Highway improvement project could finally be given a
green light sometime between November and December, Premier Wu Den-yih said
Tuesday, four days after a fatal landslide on the 80-plus year old highway that
connects Hualien and Yilan counties.</P>
      <P>Speaking during a legislative interpellation session, the premier said that
although  a final consensus  has not been reached, environmental experts and
environmental activists have agreed that improvements  must be made to ensure
the road's safety.  The environmental impact assessment of the project is
expected to win approval from a review committee sometime in the next two
months, he said.</P>
      <P>Wu said that if the project goes according to a schedule submitted by the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) , the bidding process for
contractors can begin by year-end, with the project due for completion by 2016.</P>
      <P>Torrential rain brought by Typhoon Megi Oct. 21-22 caused five sections of the
highway to collapse and the road is not expected to be cleared for normal two-
way traffic until Nov 15.</P>
      <P>Wu promised that more safety measures will be implemented on the highway, such
as installation of a surveillance system, fortification work on adjacent land
and construction of a tunnel to bypass the most unstable section. The capacity
of the road will also be monitored to make sure traffic volume does not exceed
set limits.</P>
      <P>The surveillance equipment, he went on,  will provide the authorities with
better information on when to cut down or limit the number of vehicles entering
the highway.</P>
      <P>The opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), however, said the
government's plan to give the go-ahead on the improvement project will not cure
the root of the problem and that the government should instead come up with a
comprehensive plan to foster the overall development of eastern Taiwan</P>
      <P>DPP spokesman Lin Yu-chang said the recent incident accentuated the importance
of a well-rounded environmental impact assessment. If construction work on the
highway begins without careful analysis, more natural-disaster induced disasters
are bound to happen, he warned.</P>
      <P>The latest typhoon-related agricultural damage reported by the Council of
Agriculture (COA) is estimated at NT$95.54 million (US$3.12 million).</P>
      <P>Due to the Suhua landslides, many farmers and vegetable retailers on the east
cost have been forced to take a longer route to deliver their goods to Taipei.
The COA announced that day a NT$50 million temporary subsidy program to help
offset these additional transport costs until the road has been cleared.</P>
      <P>The total death count from the typhoon as of late Tuesday stood at 14
fatalities, including nine people who died when a Buddhist temple in which they
were sheltering in Suao Township was buried by a mudslide. A total of 24 people
were still unaccounted for, among them 20 Chinese nationals.</P>
      <P>The family members of the Taiwanese victims are expected to receive NT$1 million
from the government as a token of consolation.</P>
      <P>Wu said the MOTC is still considering whether families of the Chinese victims
are entitled to Taiwan's national compensation program.</P>
      <P>Previous actions taken by the Chinese government for Taiwanese tourists hurt or
killed while traveling in China will also be used as reference, Wu added.</P>
      <P>Wu said all Taiwan-bound Chinese tourists are required to purchase travel
insurance which will pay up to NT$5.1 million in the event of their death.</P>

      <P>Taiwan moved up four places in this years Corruption Perception Index (CPI) ,
ranking 33rd among 178 countries in the annual survey,  Transparency
International Taiwan (TIT) announced on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan ranked sixth in the Asia-Pacific region, trailing New Zealand, Singapore,
Australia, Hong Kong and Japan, according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Presidential Office Spokesman Lo Chih-chiang welcomed the result but said there
is still much room for improvement.</P>
      <P>"Clean governance is a core value of President Ma Ying-jeou's administration.
The improved  ranking  shows  the government's anti-corruption initiative has
proven effective," he said.</P>
      <P>Lo said in the past two and half years President Ma and government officials at
all levels have pushed vigorously for a clean government, citing the passage of
various anti-corruption laws in order to stop the "red envelope" practice that
has long existed in Chinese culture.</P>
      <P>The spokesman pointed out that in 2000 Taiwan's ranking shot up to 28th but
quickly moved down after the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) headed by former
President Chen Shui-bian became the ruling party. Chen is currently detained on
charges of money laundering and corruption.</P>
      <P>Echoing Lo's comments, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) pledged to to take further
steps to improve conditions in the future.</P>
      <P>The Germany-based  Transparency  International  is a global coalition to monitor
anti-corruption efforts by governments around the world. The organization
defines corruption as the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. The 2010
CPI draws on information gathered from business opinion surveys carried out by
independent and reputable institutions.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's ranking fluctuated between 25th and 35th place from 1995-2007. In 2008,
Taiwan dropped to 39th and moved back to 37th the following year.</P>

    <DATELINE>10/27/10  10:03:42
(By Y.F. Low)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In the wake of serious landslides caused by Typhoon Megi last week, calls have
been mounting for an early start of an upgrade project for Suhua Highway.</P>
      <P>The project must be launched as soon as possible to provide residents in eastern
Taiwan "a safe road to travel home." In doing so, the government needs also to
reduce the road's impact on the environment and the area's ecological system.</P>
      <P>According to a Directorate General of Highways plan, tunnels will be built as
alternative routes for landslide and erosion-prone sections of the coastal
highway. It is hoped that the project will pass an environmental impact
assessment by the end of this year, after which tenders for construction work on
the highway upgrades can be opened.</P>
      <P>The upgrade project will not provide a total solution to the existing problem,
however, because the affected sections of the highway will remain in service
even after new roads are built.</P>
      <P>An early-warning system must be set up on the highway to prevent accidents and
casualties. We must also examine Taiwan's ability to resist disaster amid
drastic climate change. (Editorial abstract -- Oct. 27, 2010)</P>

coastal town of Danshui early Wednesday as Typhoon Chaba moved northward to
strengthen the effect of seasonal winds from the north, the Central Weather
Bureau reported.</P>

2 a.m. Wednesday and was moving northward toward Japan at 10 kilometers per
hour, the bureau said.</P>

convergence of its periphery and seasonal winds will indirectly affect Taiwan's
weather in the coming two days, the bureau said.</P>
      <P>Coastal regions throughout Taiwan may see strong winds comparable to those
brought by a tropical storm, meteorologists said.</P>
      <P>Strong seasonal winds may also bring heavy rains to northern coasts and mountain
regions in northern Taiwan and the northeastern county of Yilan, they added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Giant Manufacturing Co. Ltd., one of the world's largest bicycle makers, posted
double digit earnings growth for the first three quarters of 2010 in part
because of lingering concerns over global warming, an analyst said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Giant on Tuesday announced net earnings of NT$2.34 billion (US$76.46 million)
for the first nine months of the year, up 29.6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were NT$6.6.</P>
      <P>During the same period, Giant had sales of NT$33.38 billion, up 12.3 percent
from the same period in 2009.</P>
      <P>"Buying environment friendly products, like bicycles, has become a trend in the
global market, " MasterLink Securities analyst Tom Tang said. "Giant is one of
the beneficiaries of such a trend."</P>
      <P>Tang said the EPS of NT$6.6 was relatively high for the old economy sector.</P>
      <P>"It is very possible for the company to generate an EPS of NT$8 for 2010," he
said.</P>
      <P>According to Giant, while sales in the domestic market appeared to have slowed
after a strong showing in 2009, its sales in overseas markets, including the
United States, Europe, China, Japan, Australia and Canada, continued to grow.</P>
      <P>A new subsidiary in South Korea that began operations last year also generated
better than expected gains in earnings.</P>
      <P>"Giant has become one of the favorites of foreign institutional investors.
Foreign investors are very willing to hold the stock, " the analyst said.</P>
      <P>Foreign institutional investors now own about 50 percent of Giant's shares in
circulation, a ratio few old economy stocks could match, Tang said.</P>
      <P>As the stock's valuation now appeared high, however, after recent intensive
buying from foreign investors, it was approaching its nearest technical
resistance at around NT$126.00, Tang said.</P>
      <P>He suggested that investors buy the stock cautiously and remain aware of a
possible technical pullback in the near future.</P>
      <P>At 11: 46 a.m., Giant was up 0.4 percent at NT$120.00, off an early high of
NT$123.00, with 647,000 shares changing hands. The benchmark weighted index was
down 0.41 percent at 8,309.15.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>China's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) on Wednesday blamed a "lack of
communication" for the row over the name of Taiwan's  delegation  on the opening
night  of the Tokyo International Film Festival last Saturday.</P>
      <P>It also urged the two sides to avoid "internal fighting" in public in the future
to jointly safeguard the overall interests of all Chinese people.</P>
      <P>"The situation probably took place due to a lack of communication between both
sides. This is something we do not wish to see, " said TAO spokesman Yang Yi
when asked about the altercation at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>He added that he believed the matter would not affect the future collaboration
or exchanges between filmmakers on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"Both sides should avoid internal fighting in public situations in the future in
order to jointly safeguard the overall interests of all Chinese people," Yang
said.</P>
      <P>During the news conference, Yang did not directly reprimand Jiang Ping, the
director of China's delegation who instigated the incident when he demanded that
Taiwan's group must include "China" in its official name at the film festival.</P>
      <P>Jiang's  demand was immediately  refused  by the Taiwanese delegation, which
asserted that Taiwan had always participated in the festival as "Taiwan" and
that there was no reason to deviate from the usual practice.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-kuan, director of the Department of Motion Picture Affairs under the
Government Information Office who headed the Taiwanese delegation, told Jiang
not to mix arts with politics.</P>
      <P>The incident lasted over 90 minutes and cost both delegations the chance to walk
the "green carpet."</P>
      <P>It also ignited anger among Taiwan's people and public officials. Premier Wu
Den-yih described Jiang's behavior as "ruthless" and said it undermined the
recently warming ties between Taiwan and China, even if an isolated case.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese lawmakers proposed to list Jiang as "persona non grata."</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu told the Central News
Agency that his ministry was aware of the incident and urged better coordination
over Taiwan's participation  in the international community.</P>
      <P>"Both sides should make reasonable arrangements through bilateral coordination
so long as they are made under the premise of not creating two Chinas or one
China, one Taiwan," Ma said, repeating a comment made by TAO Deputy-Director Sun
Yafu earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>The festival's organizing committee offered an apology to Taiwan over their lack
of action in handling the matter. The festival office's head, Nobushige Toshima,
promised that Taiwan will always be welcomed to attend the festival using the
name "Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun teamed with Germany's Rainer Schuettler to upset the top
seeds in the first round of the St. Petersburg Open men's doubles on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lu and Schuettler knocked off Frantisek Cermak of the Czech Republic and Michal
Mertinak of Slovakia 7-6 (5) , 6-3 to set up a quarterfinal encounter against
the Russian duo of Michail Elgin and Teymuraz Gabashvili.</P>
      <P>Playing against a team that grabbed five ATP-level men's titles in 2009 and
another in Malaysia this year, Lu and Schuettler were not particularly sharp in
the first set, losing their service games twice.</P>
      <P>But they managed to break their opponents twice as well, setting up a tense
tiebreaker that went to 5-5 before the Taiwan-Germany team snatched the final
two points to close out the set.</P>
      <P>The second set turned in the pivotal eighth game, when Lu and Schuettler broke
the top seeds' serve for the only time in the set on the second break point of
the game.</P>
      <P>That gave them a 5-3 lead, and they served out the final game to clinch the
victory.</P>
      <P>The winning duo had not played doubles together since the 2009 Australia Open
early last year. Their best result was winning the Chennai Open doubles in 2005,
Lu's first ATP-level doubles title in his career.</P>
      <P>Lu, seeded fourth in the men's singles at St. Petersburg, was scheduled to play
his first round match there against Italian Potito Starace Wednesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>The 27-year-old, now ranked 34th in the world, is coming off a title win in a
second-tier ATP Challenger event in South Korea this past weekend.</P>

      <P>Neo Solar Power Corp. (NSP), a Taiwan-based solar cell maker, announced Tuesday
that it has signed an agreement to purchase solar wafers from China's GCL-Poly
Energy Holdings Ltd. in a bid to secure a steady production material supply.</P>
      <P>In a statement, NSP said that GCL, the largest polysilicon supplier  in China,
will start to provide  a total  of 350 megawatts-worth of solar wafers to the
Taiwanese company from the fourth quarter of 2010 to the end of 2013.</P>
      <P>The Taiwanese company said the purchasing agreement is aimed at lowering
manufacturing costs and maintaining wafer quality and timely delivery.</P>
      <P>NSP said that the two companies have already established a long-term partnership
and that the agreement is expected to strengthen the strategic relations between
the two sides.</P>
      <P>"This long-term cooperation sustains both companies on production capacity and
business operations, leading to significant expansion of global presence and a
win-win situation, " the company said in the statement.</P>
      <P>NSP Chairman Quincy Lin said that given the sourcing availability of wafers and
orders, his company is expected to continue to post solid gains in sales and
earnings after a strong showing in the first three quarters of this year.</P>
      <P>In the nine months to September, NSP posted NT$13.37 billion (US$436 million )in
sales, up 92 percent from a year earlier, while its net profit totaled NT$1.96

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With the mayoral elections for five special municipalities only one month away,
campaign activities have heated up.</P>
      <P>Violent clashes between campaign workers and supporters of Taiwan's two major
political camps were reported in Taichung City and Tainan City on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  the results of an opinion  poll published  in Wednesday's United
Daily News showed that if Taipei City voters were to go to the polls tomorrow,
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) challenger Su Tseng-chang
would beat incumbent Mayor Hau Lung-bin by a narrow 51 percent to 49 percent
margin.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the electoral campaign.</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Clashes erupted Tuesday when Taichung City police tried to prevent a convoy of
campaign vehicles of DPP mayoral candidate Su Jia-chyuan from entering the city
hall complex in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A group of DPP city councilors first shouted from atop the vehicles that they
wanted to enter City Hall to protest what they called the city government's
failure to maintain "administrative neutrality."</P>
      <P>The group accused the city of repeatedly rejecting applications from Su's
campaign office to hold rallies in city parks or at elementary schools.</P>
      <P>After getting down from their vehicles, they attempted to force their way into
City Hall but were blocked by rows of police. In chaotic clashes, three DPP
councilors said they sustained leg injuries after being pushed by police
officers to the ground.</P>
      <P>The violent protest ended only after the city government agreed to allow the
councilors to enter City Hall on the condition that they took off their campaign
vests.</P>
      <P>The city councilors rushed to the mayor's office on the second floor but failed
to meet Taichung Mayor Jason Hu, who according to his aides, was out on public
business.</P>
      <P>Huang Ching-hsiao, director of the city government's Department of Construction,
denied that the city government blocked the Su campaign's Oct. 5 application to
hold a rally at the city's Gancheng Park.</P>
      <P>"The application was approved Oct. 19, " Huang said, asserting that the
screening procedures took 14 days to complete.</P>
      <P>The Nov. 27 mayoral election in the central Taichung municipality to be formed
by merging Taichung City and Taichung County later this year has Su challenging
Hu's bid for re-election. The ruling Kuomintang has traditionally been stronger
than the DPP in both Taichung City and Taichung County.</P>
      <P>Responding to Su's complaint that the city government illegally rejected his
application to hold a rally at Kuangfu Elementary School, the Central Election
Commission said Tuesday it does not have the authority to get involved in such
disputes because existing election law does not contain relevant provisions.
(Oct. 27, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Clashes also erupted between the rival camps in the southern city of Tainan
Tuesday when KMT candidate Kuo Tien-tsai's campaign aides visited the campaign
office of DPP rival Lai Ching-te to push for a Kuo-Lai debate on their policies.</P>
      <P>Chang Pi-chin, a spokeswoman for the Kuo campaign, stumbled after being pushed
by Lai's supporters but was not injured. The conflict ended after police arrived
at the scene.</P>
      <P>Lai described Chang's visit as grandstanding to raise Kuo's profile, because,
according to Lai, the KMT was the party that prevented debates from being held
between KMT and DPP hopefuls in the five special municipality elections on Nov.
27. Tainan is seen a DPP stronghold. (Oct. 27, 2010).</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Respondents to an election-related public opinion poll can be grouped  into
"vocal" and "silent"  voters in terms of their willingness to express their
voting preferences in public.</P>
      <P>According to the results of a telephone poll conducted by this paper between
Oct. 23 and Oct. 24, incumbent Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin led his DPP
challenger Su Tseng-chang by a large margin, 48 percent to 37 percent.</P>
      <P>Compared with the results of a similar survey conducted a month ago, Hau's and
Su's support ratings rose 7 percent and 4 percent, respectively, and the ratio
of those unwilling to reveal their voting preferences narrowed from 26 percent
to 14 percent.</P>
      <P>An in-depth analysis of the latest survey findings showed, however,  that if the
population characteristics and political attitudes of those who declined to
answer the poll were taken into consideration, Su's support rate should reach 51
percent, higher than Hau's 49 percent.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it is still premature to come to any conclusion about the race's
outcome because the gap fell within the poll's 3 percent margin of error, and
voting is still a month away, during which many variables could affect the final
results. (Oct. 27, 2010).</P>

      <P>Beijing urged Taiwan Wednesday to continue searching for a group of Chinese
tourists who were reported missing in eastern Taiwan when Typhoon Megi struck
last week.</P>
      <P>Yang Yi, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said in a news conference held
in Beijing that of the 269 Chinese nationals who were traveling on the Suhua
Highway when landslides caused a section of the highway to collapse, 247 had
already returned to China and two were receiving medical treatment in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The remaining 20 other Chinese travelers remained unaccounted for as of press
time.</P>
      <P>The confirmed death toll in the landslide accident stood at two as of Wednesday,
with four other Taiwanese also unaccounted for.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, Interior Minister Jiang Yi-huah said that over the past week, the
military has deployed more than 200 soldiers every day for the search and rescue
operation, with work currently underway at the 112.8-km, 114.5-km and 116-km
marks of the highway.</P>
      <P>He said excavators airlifted to the site two days earlier were being used at the
112.8-km mark.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, manual excavation began Wednesday at the 114.5-km mark, where metal
detectors discovered responses under the rubble at nine different sites, Jiang
said. Rescuers were considering using a boat to deliver excavators to that
location because the area is unsafe for helicopter landing.</P>
      <P>At the 116-km mark, metal detectors were also to be used to check for possible
traces of buried vehicles, according to the minister.</P>

      <P>Many enterprises in California's Silicon Valley have signed letters of intent to
increase their investments in Taiwan,  Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin
Sheng-chung said during a visit to the U.S. high-tech hub Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Sheng-chung, traveling at the head of a business promotion delegation, said
he had visited several companies in the valley, including the A10 Network, which
specializes in cloud computing, Henlius Biopharmaceuticals, Cisco and Lam
Research since arriving in California two days earlier on a trip aimed at
drawing investors to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Many enterprises have expressed interest in opening research and development
centers in Taiwan, Lin said. He attributed the expected new investment to
Taiwan's signing of an economic cooperation framework agreement with China in
June, which he said has turned Taiwan into a bridge that enables international
businesses to easily enter the vast Chinese market.</P>
      <P>He also touted the Taiwan government's efforts to improve the investment
environment, including cutting the business income tax to 17 percent and
expanding government subsidies for the manufacturing industry to the services
sector.</P>
      <P>Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) Vice President Liu Jong-min, a
member of the delegation, said that most American enterprises have strong
capability in software design and know how to integrate different systems and
create new products.</P>
      <P>Taiwanese enterprises lack those characteristics and therefore, the ITRI will
increase its developments in the field of system integration to help Taiwanese
businesses improve their innovation abilities, Liu said.</P>
      <P>According the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the delegation was tasked prior to
departure on its week-long visit with promoting Taiwan's "six major emerging
industries" -- tourism, biotech, green energy, health care, agriculture and
cultural innovation -- as well as the "four intelligent sectors" that focus on
the development of cloud computing, electric vehicles, green architecture and
the commercialization of patented inventions.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.62 percent Wednesday as investors pocketed the
significant gains posted in the previous two trading sessions, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 52.19 points to 8,291.04, after moving between 8,285.73
and 8,372.52, on turnover of NT$110.17 billion (US$3.59 billion).</P>
      <P>The weighted index opened up 0.32 percent but began to lose steam as investors
witnessed  declining regional markets,  including Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and
Seoul, and cut their holdings, with selling focusing on old economy stocks, the
dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,678 stocks closed down and 1,194 were up with 330 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The paper and pulp sector suffered the heaviest losses, down 2.23 precent.
Cement stocks dropped 1.51 percent, foodstuffs lost 1.24 percent, textile firms
fell 1.15 percent and financial shares shed 0.92 percent.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector closed down 0.66 percent and the
construction sector fell 0.04 percent, while plastics and chemicals closed
unchanged.</P>
      <P>"The downslide was simply a technical correction after a recent strong showing,"
Hua Nan Securities analyst Henry Miao said.</P>
      <P>In the first two days of the week, the local bourse rose 2.14 percent.</P>
      <P>Miao said technical resistance ahead of 8,400 points remained heavy so that the
market needed some time to consolidate before having another takeoff.</P>
      <P>He said investors seized the opportunity  to adjust their portfolios, in
particular the old economy sector, using the regional market declines as an
excuse.</P>
      <P>"I am not particularly worried about the mild pullback, " Miao said. "Ample
liquidity is expected to continue to lend support to the market and prevent
heavy losses."</P>
      <P>Miao said he expects inflows of foreign funds will continue as the U.S. might
further loosen the monetary policy to stimulate its economy.</P>
      <P>He said non high-tech firms are likely to regain their momentum soon amid
optimism toward the earnings outlook in the sector.</P>
      <P>In the old economy sector, Chung Hwa Pulp lost 2.83 percent to close at NT$17.15

      <P>United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , the world's second-largest contract chip
maker, reported Wednesday a 65.4 percent increase in net profit for the third
quarter of this year from the previous quarter, on strong global demand.</P>
      <P>During the July-September period, UMC's net profit totaled NT$8.72 billion
(US$284 million) , a new high in almost three years, compared with NT$5.27
billion recorded in the previous quarter, while operating profit rose 32.2
percent to NT$7.19 billion, UMC said.</P>
      <P>The company posted an earnings per share of NT$0.70 for the same quarter, up
from NT$0.42 in the second quarter, it added.</P>
      <P>UMC said its intensive efforts to boost production capacity and improve its
product mix continued to help the company deliver positive results for the
quarter.</P>
      <P>The company's gross profit margin for the past three months stood at 32.6
percent, a record high in nearly six years.</P>
      <P>In an investor conference, UMC Chief Executive Officer Sun Shih-wei said that
products on the 65-nanometer production process or below accounted for 30
percent of total third quarter sales, which boosted the gross margin.</P>
      <P>Sun said he expects the portion of the 65-nanometer production process or below
to rise to 35 percent in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>The European market accounted for 13 percent of UMC's total sales in the third
quarter, up from 11 percent in the second quarter, while Asia Pacific made up 40
percent of the total sales, down from the previous quarter's 42 percent,
according to the company.</P>
      <P>The North American markets represented 46 percent of UMC's total sales in the
July-September period, unchanged from a quarter earlier, the company said.</P>
      <P>Sun said that in the past quarter, UMC's overall capacity utilization rate
exceeded 99 percent and that the utilization in the fourth quarter is expected
to range between 90 percent and 95 percent.</P>
      <P>Sun went on to say, however, that high-end production capacity is expected to be
fully utilized in the coming quarter and that product mix optimization will push
the blended average selling price up by about 5 percent.</P>
      <P>He added that shipments in the fourth quarter are likely to fall about 5 percent
on weakening demand for computer and related products.</P>
      <P>Sun said the fluctuation of the New Taiwan dollar against the U. S. dollar is
also expected to affect UMC's sales, but he added that he remains "cautiously
optimistic about the foundry market in the fourth quarter."</P>
      <P>Furthermore,  Sun said,  global  production  value  of the semiconductor sector
in 2011 is expected to grow 5 percent-10 percent, while output of the global
foundry business is expected to rise 10 percent-15 percent year-on-year.</P>

      <P>As for when the search might be called off, Zhang said she would discuss this
with relevant Taiwanese agencies at a later time.</P>

Exchange Foundation, ARATS' Taiwan counterpart, Wednesday afternoon.</P>
      <P>In related news, 36 relatives of the 19 missing tourists visited the cliff edge
at the east coast highway's 112.8-kilometer marker Wednesday, in a bid to get as
close as possible to the spot where the ill-fated bus went missing.</P>
      <P>The family members requested to see the victims, dead or alive, and asked that
all personal belongings found by the search team would be taken back to China.</P>
      <P>If needed, the family members will be accorded "one-on-one" assistance,  said
Yao Ta-kuang,  chairman of the Travel Agent Association of the Republic of
China, Taiwan (TAAT).</P>
      <P>Traveling with the relatives were 13 officials and workers from Zhuhai City in
Guangdong Province. Eight of the 19 missing tourists are officials of the
Gongbei Land Taxation Bureau in Zhuhai, according to TAAT.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Travelers praise Taipei airport's renovated terminal</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taipei International Airport's newly renovated Terminal 1,  which opened
Wednesday to international arrivals, received good marks from some of the first
travelers who arrived there from an overseas destination.</P>
      <P>Though the terminal still has work left to be done, some of the passengers on a
flight arriving from Shanghai gave it an 85 on a scale of 100, praising the
speed with which they got their bags and the improved displays around the
facility.</P>
      <P>"My wife and I feel lucky to be able to use the terminal's new arrival
facilities. The lighting was really good, and there were people who helped me
get my luggage, " said Chung Shu-jen, who returned home after visiting the
Shanghai Expo.</P>
      <P>The old airport, known locally as Songhsan Airport, is currently undergoing a
three-phase renovation. The first phase was concluded with the partial
renovation of Terminal 1, which originally handled domestic flights and
international departures but will now handle all flights.</P>
      <P>Some of its jetways were also upgraded, enabling the airport to handle bigger
double-aisle aircraft such as the Airbus 330.</P>
      <P>Phase 2 will consist of renovating part of Terminal 2, building connecting
skybridges between the two terminals, and modernizing some jetways and expanding
waiting areas in Terminal 1.</P>
      <P>Phase 3 will involve the completion of Terminal 2 and the addition of duty-free
stores and check-in counters in Terminal 1.</P>
      <P>When the project is completed in September 2011, international and domestic
flight services will be separately handled in Terminal 1 and Terminal 2.</P>
      <P>Fang Hai-chin, who travels frequently between Taiwan and China, compared the
newly renovated terminal favorably with Terminal 2.</P>
      <P>He said the signs directing travelers around the airport were clear, the new
baggage trolleys were much easier to control, and luggage could be claimed after
only a two-minute wait.</P>
      <P>Fang believed, however, that the airport still lagged behind other comparable
international airports, and he suggested that officials travel to other airports
in the region to get ideas on how to improve service.</P>
      <P>Once the renovation project is complete, Terminal 1 will be expected to handle
1.8 million travelers per year, as the number of international flights increases
from 70 to 126 per week, according to the airport.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Consumer confidence index grows five months in row</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer confidence index (CCI) grew for five consecutive months to
reach 80.19 points in October, the highest level since February 2004, according
to the results of a CCI survey released Wednesday by National Central University
(NCU).</P>
      <P>The October index rose 0.05 points from the previous month, which researchers
attributed to growing consumer confidence in the job market, said Hsu Chi-
chiang, director of the NCU's Research Center for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The researchers found that since Taiwan's economy began to rebound in the second
quarter of last year, it has continued to grow since then, with corresponding
growth in the employment market, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that four out of the six major indicators that reflect
consumer confidence for the next half-year moved up in October compared with the
previous month, with the index for consumer expectations for employment
opportunities in the coming six months recording the largest growth of 1.9
points to reach 87.2 points.</P>
      <P>The index for future household economic conditions rose O.35 points to 73.9
points and the index for future economic growth increased 0.15 points to 82.15
points,  while that for stock investment prospects moved up 0.1 points to 96.3
points.</P>
      <P>The index for commodity prices in the coming half-year dropped 1.8 points from
the previous month to 52.2 points, marking the second consecutive decline on a
month-to-month basis, the results show.</P>
      <P>Hsu attributed the fall to expectations of rising commodity prices due to
Typhoon Megi and raw material price increases on the international market.</P>
      <P>The other drop was recorded in the index for purchases of durable goods, which
moved down 0.4 points to 89.4 points. Hsu said he found that central bank
measures to rein in rising housing prices led consumers to believe that the next
six months will not be a good time to purchase real estate.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted Oct. 19-22 among 2,368 randomly selected adults aged
over 20 around Taiwan. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage
points.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp. said Wednesday that it witnessed a sharp
decline in net profit for the third quarter from the previous quarter due to
lower-than-expected product prices and high inventories.</P>
      <P>In the July-September period, AUO posted NT$227 million (US$7.4 million) in net
profit, down 98 percent from NT$11.25 billion recorded a quarter earlier.</P>
      <P>AUO's operating profit in the third quarter reached NT$232 million, a drop of
98.2 percent from NT$13.22 billion posted in the second quarter, while sales
during the same period were down 3.3 percent at NT$124.40 billion.</P>
      <P>The company's earnings per share in the third quarter fell to NT$0.01 from
NT$1.24 generated in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>The third quarter's gross margin stood at 5 percent, also down from 15.8 percent
recorded in the second quarter, while its operating margin fell to 0.2 percent
from 10.3 percent.</P>
      <P>The company said shipments of large panels, which refers to those of 10 inches
or above, totaled 28.7 million units in the third quarter, down 3.2 percent from
the second quarter, while shipments of small and medium-sized panels rose 0.3
percent to 55.6 million units.</P>
      <P>Panels used in TVs accounted for 56 percent of the total sales, making the
largest portion of its products sold during the period, up from the 51 percent
recorded in the second quarter, the company said.</P>
      <P>AUO said it had adjusted capacity utilization rates to improve the number of
inventory turnover days from 43 days at the end of the second quarter to 40 days
at the end of the third quarter and would continue to do so, along with boosting
the volume of value-added products and enhancing research and development.</P>
      <P>TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih said the third quarter's earnings data
confirmed the market's concerns over the gloomy outlook for the global flat
panel business in the third quarter, but said the numbers for AUO were better
than expected.</P>

      <P>The recent damage to the Suhua Highway could discourage some marathon runners
from participating in this year's Taroko Gorge Marathon, the organizers said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The highway on the eastern coast, the only major road to the location, remained
closed that day after heavy rain brought by Typhoon Megi Oct. 21-22 triggered
landslides that affected several sections of the road.</P>
      <P>In previous years, as many as 2,000 of the participants would arrive by coach to
compete in the annual race at the scenic spot. Because the road is expected to
remain closed until Nov. 15 at the earliest, however, some of the runners will
probably not come to the Nov. 6 race, according to the Taroko National Park
Headquarters.</P>
      <P>The park has arranged for extra trains to run to Hualien from Taipei and for
shuttle buses to get the runners from the Hualien Railway Station to make the 7
a.m. start of the marathon.</P>
      <P>The event is limited to 10,000 people, more than 7,000 of whom sign up for
either a full marathon of some 41.1 km or a half one. The rest of the runners
take part in a 5-km fun run.</P>
      <P>Taroko Gorge in eastern Taiwan's Hualien Country is one of the country's best-
known tourist attractions.</P>

      <P>Most of the night markets that have recently been crowned with a "most special"
title are nevertheless unsatisfactory in terms of their basic services,
especially toilet facilities, according to the results of a survey released
Wednesday by the Consumers' Foundation.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted earlier in the month among the 10 winners of a
specialty competition held recently by the Tourism Bureau -- Shilin Night
Market, Huaxi Street Night Market and Ningxia Night Market in Taipei City,
Keelung's Miaokou Night Market, Kaohsiung City's Liuhe Night Market, the
Chunghua Street Night Market in Kaohsiung County's Fengshan, Taichung's Fengchia
Night Market, Yilan's Luodong Night Market, Chiayi's Wenhua Street Night Market,
and Tainan's Huayuan Night Market.</P>
      <P>The foundation used three criteria to evaluate their basic services: space
layout, garbage can availability and public toilets.</P>
      <P>The results show that Luodong Night Market, which was selected the "most
friendly" in the competition, has poor space layout and unclear toilet
directions for visitors.</P>
      <P>Wenhua Road Night Market and the Chunghua Street Night Market, which were
presented with "special mention" awards, do not provide garbage cans for
visitors.</P>
      <P>Among the 10 night markets, Chunghua Street Night Market is the only one that
has no public toilets. Eight out of the remaining nine received below average
ratings for their toilet directions.</P>
      <P>Six of the night markets, meanwhile, have no emergency help buttons in their
toilets.</P>
      <P>Overall, three night markets were given failing scores, with Chunghua Street
Night Market given just 19 points on a 100-point scale, Wenhua Street Night
Market receiving 54 points and Huayuan Night Market earning 57 points.</P>

      <P>Taipei City government Secretary-General Yang Hsi-an was interrogated Wednesday
for the first time since being accused by Taipei prosecutors of involvement in
granting inflated material prices to contractors on the city's Xinsheng Overpass
improvement project.</P>
      <P>Yang was later released on NT$600,000 (US$19,483) bail and barred from leaving
the country.</P>
      <P>Huang Hsi-hsun, former director of the city government's New Construction Office
(NCO) and Chen Chih-sheng, a former NCO division chief, were detained by
prosecutors after suspected evidence of their roles in the alleged scandal were
found by investigators who searched their offices and residences in September.</P>
      <P>Among the evidence was a note asking Huang and Chen to argue to investigators
that the overpriced project "was simply caused by their negligence" and had
nothing to do with corruption.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors  suspected the note to be from the detainees' superiors, including
Yang.</P>
      <P>After examining  the testimonies  of witnesses and related documents,
prosecutors found that Yang had several times contacted contractors of the
project in secret to finalize the price tags.</P>
      <P>Prosecutors searched Yang's residence and office Oct. 5, and seized 12 computers
and a flash memory disc, leading to Yang being questioned Oct. 20 as a witness,
during which he protested his innocence, saying he did nothing wrong when he
served as convener of the bidding task force for the Xinsheng project.</P>
      <P>City officials invited bidders Nov. 6, 2007 for the elevated highway work, but
were unable to find a contractor capable of carrying out the project at the
price fixed by the city government.</P>
      <P>The city government finally farmed out the project April 23, 2008, after raising
the price it would be willing to pay to NT$1.86 billion in the wake of six
unsuccessful bids. Prosecutors suspected that contractors on the project
overcharged the city government in 120 procurement cases.</P>
      <P>Yang said after being released that he was surprised by the prosecutor's move to
list him as a defendant. He added that he received no instructions from Taipei
Mayor Hau Lung-bin regarding the Xinsheng project's bidding process.</P>
      <P>Questioned by the media, Hau said he would respect any decision by the judicial
system and that Yang will be removed from his post to facilitate the
investigation process.</P>
      <P>"I will step down immediately if I am found to have been involved in any
irregularities related to city engineering projects, " Hau vowed.</P>
      <P>Hau, who is running for a second mayoral term as the candidate of the ruling
Kuomintang, has been beset by allegations that he is also involved in the
Xinsheng Overpass scandal, with the latest poll results showing him to be 2
percentage points behind his opponent, former Premier Su Tseng-  chang of the
opposition  Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>The poll results, released by the United Daily News that same day, one month
before the elections take place, show that Hau would have the support of 48
percent of the respondents, compared to Su's 37 percent, if the elections were
to take place the following day.</P>
      <P>However,  based on its cross-analysis of the results, the newspaper estimated
that most of those who declined to reveal their voting choice will eventually
cast their ballots for Su, giving him a razor-thin lead over the incumbent
mayor.</P>

      <P>Hsinchu City Mayor Hsu Ming-tsai and city council speaker Hsieh Wen-chin
finalized plans about opening the pavilion on Oct. 10 next year during a meeting
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Rebuilding work will finish on Sept. 30 and after a nine-day trial, it will be
officially unveiled to the public, said Hsieh.</P>
      <P>The news came after Hsu briefed Hsieh on details of the city government's
successful bid to purchase and bring the pavilion back to Taiwan from Shanghai
at a City Council meeting.</P>
      <P>Director of Hsinchu's  department  of transportation  Cheng Chih-chiang said the
future tourist attraction will be on the route of a free shuttle-bus service in
the east district of the city. The service will begin on a trial basis on Dec.
1.</P>
      <P>According to Cheng, Taiwan Railways Administration and the Railway
Reconstruction Bureau have formed a special commitee to look at the possibility
of constructing a Mass Rapid Transit(MRT) station for the pavilion on the Neiwan
train line. The group will hold a meeting on Nov. 1.</P>
      <P>Construction on the Neiwan train line--which is being turned into an MRT line--
is still underway but is also set to open Double Ten Day next year, said Cheng.

      <P>The Taipei International Travel Fair, set to kick off next month, will feature

      <P>Organizers said the fair is the biggest of its kind in Asia and that visitors
can expect discount bargains ranging from hotel stays to air tickets, all the
way to theme park admission tickets, at the event to be held at Exhibition Hall
1 of the Taiwan World Trade Center Nov. 5-8.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Visitors Association Chairman C.S. Chou said the scale of this year's
event makes it the biggest in history, with exhibitors going all-out to give
visitors the travel bug by offering unique tourism packages at rock-bottom
prices.</P>
      <P>In addition to the usual participants such as the U.S., Japan, South Korea,
Europe and Latin America, Saipan and Jordan will make their debuts at this

      <P>"Taiwan has much to offer to our foreign friends, from beautiful natural
landscape to delicious food.  Our hospitality is also well-known. Many foreign
tourists who have come here say they were warmly received everywhere they went

tourists because of the similarities in culture and the close geographic
proximity, " he said.</P>

      <P>AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) , Taiwan's second-largest LCD panel maker, urged a U.S.
court Wednesday to give greater travel freedom to some of its top executives who
are currently barred from leaving the United States, where they face price-
fixing charges.</P>
      <P>"We hope the U.S. court will grant more travel freedom to the executives based
on humane considerations, " AUO acting Chief Executive Max Cheng said at a
company investors' conference in Taipei.</P>
      <P>"The executives' parents are old and they are in Taiwan. It is one of the
company's biggest hopes that the executives will be given greater freedom," he
said.</P>
      <P>Cheng made the remarks after he was named an acting chief executive in an Oct. 8
management reshuffle. CEO Chen Lai-juh continues to lead the company's solar
energy business, AUO added.</P>
      <P>About three months ago, a U.S. court ordered Chen Lai-juh, Vice Chairman Chen
Hsuan-bin and former Executive Vice President Hsiung Hui to remain in California

Dec. 1, 2006.</P>
      <P>Other Taiwanese companies, including Chunghwa Picture Tubes and Chimei Innolux
Corp., have chosen to plead guilty and accept punishments, including prison
terms for top executives in some cases, after facing similar charges by the U.S.</P>

      <P>To mobilize public interest in a Department of Health (DOH) campaign to regulate
terms used in food advertising, a health-promotion organization displayed a wide
range of products claiming "whole-grain" status at a Taipei press conference
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Of 113 products labeled "whole grain"or "whole wheat" tested in a study
undertaken by the John Tung Foundation, only 15 contained at least 51 percent of
whole grain by weight, a new standard set by the Taiwan Food and Drug
Administration (TFDA) Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Manufacturers of whole-grain products must abide by the guideline by as early as
the end of next year or be in violation of the Food Hygiene Act and face fines
of between NT$40,000 (US$1,300) to NT$200,000, said Tsai Shu-jen, director of
TFDA's food safety division.</P>
      <P>During the one-year grace period in which manufacturers are encouraged but not
forced to follow the guideline, Tsai said the TFDA's priority will be to talk to
relevant companies. It will also work closely with the John Tung Foundation to
enhance public awareness of whole-grain products.</P>
      <P>Consumers will be better protected once the TFDA's threshold is applied to
advertising of whole-grain foods, said Chang Kuo-rong, chairman of the Taipei
Bakery Association.</P>
      <P>Reminding the public not use texture and appearance as the sole indicators of
whole-grain products, Chang pointed out that whole- grain bread does not
necessarily taste rough, since flour used in bread-making undergoes varying
milling processes. Some consumers also mistake dark breads decorated with bran
and nuts for whole-grain products, he added.</P>

Luzhou and Sanchong cities in Taipei County, on the west side of Danshui River.</P>
      <P>The 12.5-kilometer Luzhou Line is expected to lift the system's current average
daily total of 1.41 million passenger-trips to around 1.58 million, according to
the Department of Rapid Transit Systems (DORTS).</P>
      <P>DORTS also projected that the annual total would surpass 500 million passenger-
trips by the end of this year, as the MRT system better connects Taipei City and
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>As an example, DORTS said passengers will be able to travel from Luzhou Station
to Taipei Main Station via a combination of the Luzhou and Danshui lines in just
22 minutes. (By Hsin-Yin Lee)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In addition to raising public awareness of environmental crises facing Taiwan, a
number of environmental controversies that surfaced this year have also
illustrated the variety of new tactics being adopted by the nation's social
activists.</P>
      <P>Events receiving extensive media coverage and sparking strong public reaction
included an author's plea for preservation of wetlands in Taipei's Nangang
District, a protest by farmers in Dapu Township against the forced expropriation
of their land by the Miaoli County Government, more than 1,000 researchers
signing a petition against a proposed construction of a petrochemical complex,
and the court ruling against expansion of the Central Science Park.</P>
      <P>Reaction was strong enough to catch government officials and commercial
enterprises off guard, and perhaps suggests a shift in values: that many people
no longer accept the idea of putting the economy ahead of the environment.</P>
      <P>It also reveals how environmentalists' tactics have evolved. In the past -- such
as in campaigns against construction of nuclear power plants prior to 2000 --
protest groups relied on mobilizing large crowds.</P>
      <P>After election of the Democratic Progressive Party administration in 2000, these
groups worked closely with the government, but soon discovered that politicians'
promises are unreliable and government decision-making processes are
conservative.</P>
      <P>They have since sought to operate "outside the system" and have adopted new
approaches. One has been the use of legal mechanisms. This had been rare
previously, partly because there were not many legal professionals participating
in such social movements, and partly because Taiwan lacks the tradition of group
litigation.</P>
      <P>The court's assessment of environmental impact and its judgment in the case
concerning expansion of the Central Science Park shows that the judicial system
has become more independent and that judges are now more willing to confront
mistakes made in government decisions.</P>
      <P>Another new approach can be seen in the tactic of using a charitable trust to
buy and protect the wetland threatened by the Kuokuang Petrochemical Technology
Co. project in central Taiwan's Changhua County.</P>
      <P>While local politicians and businesses standing to benefit from the project
gathered  buses of supporters  to protest against environmental groups, by the
end of August more than 50,000 people had signed up to donate money to set up
just such a trust.</P>
      <P>Environmental  activists  have  also  made use of "citizen journalism" and non-
mainstream media, particularly the Internet, to set news agendas and gain the
attention of the traditional media.</P>
      <P>Photographs and videos of helpless Dapu farmers watching as excavators destroyed
their expropriated rice paddies in June were disseminated online, successfully
attracting widespread interest in the Miaoli case.</P>
      <P>Without assembling crowds or relying on traditional political power,
environmental groups are using these new strategies to maintain a dialogue with
wider society. This can be an inspiration for social activists seeking political
changes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China urged to respect Taiwan's right to attend world activities</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct.  27 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>China should respect Taiwan's right to attend international activities in order
to safeguard the hard-won detente achieved in the past two years, Government
Information Office Minister Johnny Chiang said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"Our participation in international activities is a reality and our legitimate
right. China should face up to this fact of life and deal with it with
goodwill," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Noting that it is not easy for the two sides to achieve peace and stability
across the Taiwan Strait,  Chiang said China should substantiate the principle
of "facing up to reality and shelving disputes" with concrete actions to foster
mutual trust.</P>
      <P>His remarks came after China's Taiwan Affairs Office (TAO) blamed earlier in the
day a "lack of communication" for a row over the name of the Taiwanese
delegation on the opening night of the Tokyo International Film Festival last
weekend.</P>
      <P>"The incident probably arose from a lack of communication between the two sides.
This is something we do not wish to see, and we believe the matter will not
affect future cross-strait collaboration or exchanges in filmmaking, " said TAO
spokesman Yang Yi when asked about the altercation at a regular press briefing.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he is pleased to learn that China will uphold its promise to open
its market wider from Thursday to Taiwan-produced films according to the
bilateral Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement signed in June.</P>
      <P>"This indicates that the Tokyo name row will not affect bilateral film exchanges
or engagements between filmmakers on the two sides, " Chiang said. "In the
future, we hope both sides can take part in international film festivals
together in line with the principles of mutual trust, parity and cooperation."</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih also hailed Yang's remarks as reflecting China's recognition
of the importance of upholding cross-strait detente.</P>
      <P>"Cross-strait relations are now moving on the track of peace and stability
through concerted efforts of the two sides, and no one should be allowed to
derail such a development, " Wu said while meeting  with a group  of overseas
ethnic  Chinese  business professionals who are attending a study program in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>After decades of hostility and separation across the strait, Wu said that there
might be a few people like Jiang Ping who instigate rifts from time to time, but
that such accidental incidents will not prevent cross-strait relations from
moving toward peace.</P>
      <P>Jiang was the head of China's delegation at the Tokyo festival who ignited the
spat when he demanded that Taiwan's group must include "China" in its official
name at the film festival.</P>
      <P>His demand was immediately refused by the Taiwanese delegation, which asserted
that Taiwan had always participated in the festival as "Taiwan, " and that there
was no reason to deviate from the usual practice.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-kuan, director of the Department of Motion Picture Affairs under the
Government Information Office, who headed the Taiwanese delegation, told Jiang
not to mix arts with politics.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy looked less rosy in September than the previous month as the
stock price index fell, but the economy has been growing steadily as a whole,
the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The monitoring indicator for the overall economy fell one point in September to
37 points and turned a red light to yellow-red, indicating a moderate economy,
according to the CEPD.</P>
      <P>Of all the monitoring indicator's nine components, the stock price index
decreased by one point, resulting in the loss of overall score.</P>
      <P>The composite leading index, which gauges economic performance over three to six
months, measured 117.6, a fall of 0.4 percent since August.</P>
      <P>The year-on-year six-month rate of change stood at 1.8 percent, a fall of 2.3
percentage point from August and the 10th consecutive monthly fall.</P>
      <P>"The leading indicator has continued to fall, yet the decline has been
narrowing," said the CEPD said in a press release.</P>
      <P>The planning agency uses a five-color system to gauge the country's economic
performance for any given month.</P>
      <P>Blue implies a sluggish economy,  yellow-blue represents a slowdown, green
indicates a stable economy, yellow-red means the economy is mildly overheated,
and red signifies overheating.</P>
      <P>The index of coincident indicators, which reflect economic activity in the
period measured, rose 0.6 percent to 124.4 in September.</P>
      <P>Despite the small drop, the CEPD said it remained cautiously optimistic about
the economy's prospects because strong growth in emerging economies will help
maintain export momentum and government investment promotion drives are expected
to spur private investment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy grew 13.7 percent year-on-year in the first quarter and 12.5
percent in the second quarter, the Department of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics reported on Aug. 19. It revised its forecast for full-year growth
upwards to 8.24 percent. (By Yi-chun Chen and C.Y. Lin)</P>

      <P>Nicaraguan baseball team coach apologized Wednesday after one of his players,
Gustavo Horacio Lopez, was accused of sexually assaulting a Taiwanese woman on
Tuesday. Lopez was taken to the Taichung District Prosecutors Office for further
interrogation after being questioned by police.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a press conference, team coach Edgard Matamoros apologized to the
Taiwanese people and government, and expressed the desire to continue to compete
in the tournament. The Nicaragua team is in Taiwan to participate in the 17th
Intercontinental Cup baseball tournament.</P>
      <P>The team was still looking into the accusation leveled against the player, he
said, but theyfully believe in the Taiwanese justice system and will accept any
verdict handed down by the court.</P>
      <P>Lopez met the woman when he went out to buy beer Tuesday, before the pair headed
back to his hotel together, Matamoros and the Taichung City Police Bureau
confirmed.</P>
      <P>Taichung police said the victim called a friend for help from the hotel room. By
the time the friend arrived at the hotel, the woman had disappeared. She was
subsequently found by police and taken to hospital for examination.</P>
      <P>As of press time, Lopez was still being detained by Taichung District
Prosecutors Office.  Bail has been set at NT$200,000 (US$6,500), which the team
says it does not have, so the player will remain in custody overnight.</P>
      <P>Nicaraguan Ambassador William Tapia might travel to Taichung on Thursday, his
office announced. For the time being, the Nicaragua team will continue to play
in the tournament.</P>

      <P>Availing of stronger northeasterly winds, a total of 347 black-faced spoonbills
had arrived in the wetlands of Tainan County in southern Taiwan by Wednesday,
reported a wildlife conservation group.</P>
      <P>The first of the endangered species to arrive this year was observed in the
southern county on Sept. 26, around one week later than usual because of Typhoon
Fanapi, said Chiu Jen-wu, chairman of the Wildlife Conversation Institute of
Tainan County.</P>
      <P>The rare birds migrate each autumn from northern China and the border area
between North Korea and South Korea, with some choosing to spend the winter on
wetlands near Tainan's Tzengwen River estuary.</P>
      <P>By Oct. 16 the number of spoonbills had increased to just 68, because the
northeasterly monsoon winds were too weak, explained Chiu. With the winds now
stronger, the population could number up to 500 by the end of October and reach
its peak during November, he predicted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Intel Corp., the world's largest chip maker, is expected to forge more
partnerships in Taiwan when its chief executive arrives in Taipei for a short
visit Thursday.</P>
      <P>Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini is expected to announce collaborative
projects with the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) and the National Science
Council (NSC) at a press conference in Taipei, but the company was hesitant to
go into details in advance.</P>
      <P>Local media have reported that the U.S. company will sign a memorandum of
understanding (MOU) with the MOEA regarding research and development (R&amp;D)
into cloud computing, which allows data storage online and other Internet-based
services.</P>
      <P>It will mark the first new collaboration between the two since they signed a
deal in 2008 to promote the development of the WiMAX broadband wireless
technology in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Intel is also expected to use the Thursday press conference to announce R&amp;D
cooperation with the NSC, but the area of research is as yet unknown.</P>
      <P>Further industry speculation suggested the U.S. corporation is likely to sign a
separate MOU with Chunghwa Telecom Co., Taiwan's largest telecommunications
firm, for the development of smart TVs that are equipped with Internet-surfing
and other online functions.</P>
      <P>J.T. Wang, chairman of the world's second largest PC vendor, Acer Inc., told
reporters Oct. 19 that he would discuss business with Otellini during his stay
in the country.</P>
      <P>Similarly, Richard Lee, chief executive of Inventec Corp., a leading Taiwanese
contract notebook computer maker, confirmed to CNA Oct. 24 that his company
would have contact with Intel during Otellini's visit, but declined to provide
further details.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan to defer arms acquisition from U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Oct. 27 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will defer the acquisition of some weapons systems from the United States
due to the government's financial  constraints,  Legislator  Lin Yu-fang of the
ruling Kuomintang quoted the Ministry of National Defense (MND) as saying
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The MND has preliminarily determined to talk to the U.S. about postponing the
production schedule of the six Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC-3) anti-missile
batteries from 2014 to 2017 and of 60 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters from 2016 to
2019, according to a statement issued by Lin.</P>
      <P>The deferral is necessary due to production schedules at the U.S. end, as well
as out of consideration of the Taiwan government's financial constraints
combined with the fact that it is unlikely the annual defense budget will be
raised significantly in the near future, Lin added.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Defense Minister Kao Hua-chu said at a legislative committee
meeting that Taiwan is now entering the peak period for making payments for
military investment. He added that, if it was acceptable to the legislature, the
MND wanted to redistribute to other uses those sums budgeted for the U.S.
weapons systems that Taiwan cannot acquire according to the original schedule.</P>
      <P>Lin said that according to the MND's plans,  the defense accumulated budget
stands at NT$330.7 billion (US$10.7 billion) for the period 2011 to 2014, or
NT$82.7 billion per year.</P>
      <P>Procurement of the U.S. arms systems would take about 61 percent of the budget,
or NT$50.3 billion a year, he noted. This would affect the budget for purchasing
domestically developed weapons and related facilities over the same period, he
continued.</P>
      <P>"Cut the budget for those items we are not getting in the following  several
years,  such as the F-16C/D fighters  and submarines," he suggested.</P>
      <P>The US$6.4 billion package of arms that Washington announced in late January
that it wants to sell to Taiwan includes 60 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters, two
Osprey Class mine-hunting ships, 12 ATM-84L and RTM-84L Harpoon Block II
Telemetry missiles, 114 PAC-3 missiles and communications equipment.</P>

      <P>Shipments of Taiwan's large TFT-LCD panels posted a quarter-on-quarter decline
of 7.9 percent in Q3 of this year, a market research firm said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A decline for TFT-LCD panels of 10 inches and over has rarely been seen in the
third quarter of any year, when demand for the products is traditionally high,
Tony Huang, a senior analyst with Digitimes Research, said in a statement.</P>
      <P>"Weaker demand forced display clients to slash orders, and Taiwanese display
manufacturers also reduced production capacity to minimize losses on IT
(information technology) panels," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang noted that the decrease was not limited to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The world has also seen an unusual decline in shipments, with monitor panels
falling 13.5 percent quarter-on-quarter and notebook computer panels dropping
12.3 percent in the same period, he added.</P>
      <P>In terms of the annual growth rate, shipments of large TFT-LCD panels in the
quarter grew only 3.2 percent from the same period last year, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>"This represents a huge difference, as the annual growth rate for each quarter
has surpassed 22 percent since the third quarter of 2009," he added.</P>

      <P>After over 10 years in operation, the sixth naphtha cracker plant run by the
Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) in Yunlin County has not had a major negative
impact on local residents' lives, but nor has it made a significant contribution
to the local community, a seminar heard Wednesday.</P>
      <P>These findings from an investigation conducted by National Sun Yat-sen
University Professor Lee Cheng-di were reported on day one of a three-day
seminar being held by the Institute of Environment and Resource in Taipei under
the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>While the plant has helped boost some small retail businesses in nearby
communities, it has not helped to increase output of local fishery and
agricultural industries, he reported.</P>
      <P>Yunlin is an agricultural-based county in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More than 20 experts and scholars gathered to debate the overall contribution
and condition of the naphtha cracker in Yunlin's Mailiao Township, which has
encountered a series of problems in recent months, including two major fires in
July and two reports of foul odor leaking from the plant in September.</P>
      <P>"This is the first time such a large meeting to evaluate public safety has been
held," EPA Minister Stephan Shu-hung Shen said at the event.</P>
      <P>"The FPG's naphtha cracker plant is a huge project, and we are very concerned
whether its fifth-stage expansion would pose an adverse impact on the
environment, " Shen said.</P>
      <P>The FPG will also present a self-assessment report, Shen said, but the EPA has
yet to reach an agreement with the group regarding the assessment method to be
adopted by FPG.</P>
      <P>Conclusions drawn at the seminar will serve as a reference for the government to
decide the fate of the plant's expansion.</P>
      <P>A recent survey showed that nearly 80 percent of Yunlin residents are
dissatisfied with feedback measures proposed by FPG, while 32.4 percent of
respondents believe the plant has done little help to the local economy.</P>
      <P>As of the end of 2009, FPG had invested NT$628.3 billion (US$20.33  billion)  in
the naphtha  plant and its peripheral businesses, with the production value
totaling around NT$952.2 billion, according to Gu Young, a professor at the
National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, who also attended
Wednesday's seminar.</P>

      <P>AU Optronics Corp. (AUO) , Taiwan's second-largest LCD panel maker, urged the
Taiwan government on Wednesday to quickly approve its application to set up a
plant in China or it will fall further behind its South Korean rivals.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan was ahead of South Korea in the past in terms of the global LCD panel
market share, " AUO vice president Paul Peng said at the company's quarterly
investors' conference.</P>
      <P>"At present, however, Taiwan's global market share is 37 percent, while South
Korea's is 52 percent," he noted.</P>
      <P>If Taiwanese  flat-panel  companies  want  to boost  their competitiveness, they

      <P>After over 10 years in operation, the sixth naphtha cracker plant run by the
Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) in Yunlin County has not had a major negative
impact on local residents' lives, but nor has it made a significant contribution
to the local community, a seminar heard Wednesday.</P>
      <P>These findings from an investigation conducted by National Sun Yat-sen
University Professor Lee Cheng-di were reported on day one of a three-day
seminar being held by the Institute of Environment and Resource in Taipei under
the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>While the plant has helped boost some small retail businesses in nearby
communities, it has not helped to increase output of local fishery and
agricultural industries, he reported.</P>
      <P>Yunlin is an agricultural-based county in central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>More than 20 experts and scholars gathered to debate the overall contribution
and condition of the naphtha cracker in Yunlin's Mailiao Township, which has
encountered a series of problems in recent months, including two major fires in
July and two reports of foul odor leaking from the plant in September.</P>
      <P>"This is the first time such a large meeting to evaluate public safety has been
held," EPA Minister Stephan Shu-hung Shen said at the event.</P>
      <P>"The FPG's naphtha cracker plant is a huge project, and we are very concerned
whether its fifth-stage expansion would pose an adverse impact on the
environment, " Shen said.</P>
      <P>The FPG will also present a self-assessment report, Shen said, but the EPA has
yet to reach an agreement with the group regarding the assessment method to be
adopted by FPG.</P>
      <P>Conclusions drawn at the seminar will serve as a reference for the government to
decide the fate of the plant's expansion.</P>
      <P>A recent survey showed that nearly 80 percent of Yunlin residents are
dissatisfied with feedback measures proposed by FPG, while 32.4 percent of
respondents believe the plant has done little help to the local economy.</P>
      <P>As of the end of 2009, FPG had invested NT$628.3 billion (US$20.33  billion)  in
the naphtha  plant and its peripheral businesses, with the production value
totaling around NT$952.2 billion, according to Gu Young, a professor at the
National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, who also attended
Wednesday's seminar.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Workers at China's top 500 companies are expected to become the first to take
advantage of a recent proposal by the Ministry of Transportation  and
Communications to allow independent Chinese tourists, rather than just those in
organized groups, to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>With mutual trust a fragile commodity across the Taiwan Strait -- as highlighted
by this week's spat over Taiwan's name at the Tokyo International Film Festival
-- the opening up to Chinese tourists may help deepen trust and understanding
between the two sides at the grass-roots level, in addition to bringing
financial benefits.</P>
      <P>Those Chinese nationals opting to travel to Taiwan on their own will probably be
younger people who have greater autonomy, vitality, access to information and
financial wherewithal. Allowing these social elites to have direct contact with
Taiwanese people will enable them to experience Taiwan's liberal politics and
pluralistic culture, and will be helpful in promoting mutual understanding and
trust.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's political, social, cultural and judicial developments provide valuable
reference points for China's future reforms. We should have confidence in our
own systems and in our ability to influence China. (Editorial abstract -- Oct.

    <HEADLINE>AUO predicts capacity utilization of 85 percent for Q4</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Flat panel maker AU Optronics Corp. said Thursday the company expects its
production capacity utilization rate for the fourth quarter to reach about 85
percent, little changed from the third quarter.</P>
      <P>"While inventories in the U.S. and European markets remain high, inventories in
the China market have been lowered to some extent to boost demand," said Hsiao
Ya-wen, an AUO spokeswoman.</P>
      <P>"We therefore expect the capacity utilization rate for the fourth quarter will
be maintained at 85 percent, as seen in the third quarter," Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>AUO announced Wednesday it has posted a third-quarter net profit of NT$227
million (US$7.36 million) , down 98 percent from NT$11.25 billion recorded a
quarter earlier due to high inventories in the global market and lower-than-
expected product prices.</P>
      <P>The unfavorable market conditions had lowered the company's gross margin to 5
percent in the third quarter, down from 15.8 percent in the second quarter, the
Q3 report continued.</P>
      <P>In related news, Hsiao said the company's second 8.5th-generation plant, located
in the Central Taiwan Science Park, is scheduled to begin operations next year
after installation of equipment is completed by the end of this year.</P>
      <P>Production capacity of the new plant is yet to be finalized, she said, adding it
is up to market conditions.</P>
      <P>AUO's first 8.5th G plant, which manufactures large panels for TV use, is
equipped for a monthly capacity of 40,000 units.</P>
      <P>Such large TV panels accounted for 56 percent of AUO's total Q3 sales and
represented its top-selling sector, up from the 51 percent recorded in the
second quarter.</P>
      <P>Regarding the company's business-diversification  strategies, Hsiao said AUO
expects its investments in solar energy will return a profit in 2011 or 2012.</P>
      <P>AUO will invest NT$100 billion in capacity expenditure for 2010, she said,
adding that 10-15 percent of this total will be in its solar-energy business.</P>
      <P>AUO currently owns more than a 90-percent stake in Japan-based silicon wafer
maker M. Setek, giving it access to the upstream solar- energy business.</P>
      <P>In addition, the company jointly runs a solar cell plant in Malaysia with
U.S.-based SunPower Corp.</P>
      <P>AUO is one of many Taiwanese high-tech companies which have engaged in
diversifying businesses, in particular into renewable energy, in the hope that
these moves will alleviate any impact from a cyclical downturn in their core
businesses.</P>

      <P>Possibly as a result of global climate change, any typhoon might now cause
record levels of rainfall and lead to widespread disaster. The latest victim of
this is Yilan County, which was drenched during last week's Typhoon Megi.</P>
      <P>During his campaign for election as the county's magistrate, successful
candidate Lin Tsong-hsien criticized his predecessor Lu Kuo-hua for responding
too slowly to typhoons. Now Lin himself has performed no better, as shown by his
failure to announce school and office closures early. This resulted in many
children being stranded in flood water.</P>
      <P>The serious flooding caused by several recent typhoons should provide a lesson
for local government chiefs. It would be better to close schools and offices
early as a precaution, and it is not important if a typhoon's impact turns out
to be less serious than expected.</P>
      <P>Moreover, in the wake of the severe landslides triggered by Typhoon Megi on the
Suhua Highway, the government should set a rainfall-based standard for closing
landslide-prone highways to traffic during rainy weather.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- China opens market wider for 5 service sectors</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/28/10  14:15:56
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China announced Wednesday that Taiwan-based companies will be allowed to operate
businesses in five service sectors starting Thursday under an "early harvest"
program set out in the bilateral Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA)
signed in June.</P>
      <P>Most noteworthy among the new measures is that Taiwan-produced films screened in
China will now be exempt from the previous quota restrictions.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Taiwanese films must still pass Chinese censorship before being
shown.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of the announcement:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>According to China's Ministry of Commerce, Taiwanese companies can operate
accounting, computer, and conference services as well as scientific and
technological research and development services in China as part of the "early
harvest" program stipulated in the ECFA that took effect Sept. 12.</P>
      <P>In addition, in a liberalization measure related to audio/video services, the
Chinese ministry said Taiwan-produced movies will no longer be subjected to a
quota system.</P>
      <P>Hitherto, China capped the annual number of movie imports at 50, of which the
United States accounted for 20. Taiwan used to vie with other countries for
slots in the remaining 30-film quota.</P>
      <P>From Thursday, Taiwanese films no longer face such a restriction.</P>
      <P>Local political analysts said China's announcement of the new market-opening
measures was a goodwill gesture following a row over Taiwan's name at the Tokyo
International Film Festival last weekend.</P>
      <P>Chen Chih-kuan, director of the Government Information Office's (GIO) Department
of Motion Picture Affairs, said it remains to be seen whether China will
sincerely uphold its promise and refrain from using the content-censorship
process to find faults.</P>
      <P>A number of Taiwan-produced films, including "Au Revoir Taipei" and "Hear Me, "
are waiting for approval to enter the Chinese market, according to Chen. (Oct.
28, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>Based on the principle of reciprocity, Taiwan will similarly open its market to
Chinese service providers in five categories from Nov. 1. These are R&amp;D,
conference, computerized-booking and brokering services, and the distribution of
China-produced films.</P>
      <P>While China agrees to lift its quota system for Taiwanese films in accordance
with the ECFA provisions, Taiwan only agrees to allow a maximum of 10 China-
produced movies to be screened in Taiwan each year.</P>
      <P>According to ECFA, China will offer easier market access for Taiwanese service
providers in 11 business categories under the "early harvest" program, compared
to nine service sectors that Taiwan has promised to open. (Oct. 28, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council issued a statement  Wednesday expressing
disappointment  and regret over China's failure to apologize for the Chinese
delegation head's rude demand on the opening night of the Tokyo film festival.</P>
      <P>Jiang Ping, the head of China's delegation at the Tokyo festival ignited the
spat when he demanded that Taiwan's group must include "China" in its official
name at the film festival.</P>
      <P>His demand was immediately refused by the Taiwanese delegation, which asserted
that Taiwan had always participated in the festival as "Taiwan, " and that there
was no reason to deviate from the usual practice.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Yang Yi said at a regular
press briefing that the incident probably arose from a lack of communication
between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"This is something we do not wish to see, and we believe the matter will not
affect future cross-strait collaboration or exchanges in filmmaking, " Yang
said.</P>
      <P>The MAC said Yang's remarks were disappointing and did not meet Taiwanese
people's expectations.</P>
      <P>"We can hardly see China's determination to treasure the hard-won cross-strait
detente achieved in the past two years, " the MAC statement said. (Oct. 28,

      <P>Taiwan-based flat panel maker HannStar Display Corp. said Thursday that an
agreement reached between its former executive and the U.S. Department of
Justice (DOJ) will have no impact on the company's operations.</P>
      <P>The DOJ announced Wednesday that Wu Jui-hung, a former executive director for
HannStar's global marketing and sales division, agreed to plead guilty and serve
seven months in a U.S. jail for his role in a global conspiracy to fix the price

      <P>HannStar said that as Wu has left the company and is no longer its employee,

fixing the TFT-LCD panel prices from as early as Sept. 21, 2001, until on or
about Jan. 31, 2006.</P>
      <P>Wu was charged with meeting other participants in the conspiracy to set prices
of TFT-LCD panels at predetermined levels. They also exchanged information
relating to sales to monitor adherence to the agreed prices, the department
said.</P>
      <P>In addition to the jail term, Wu agreed to pay a US$20,000 criminal fine and to
assist the DOJ in its ongoing investigation.</P>
      <P>The agreement is subject to court approval, the DOJ said.</P>
      <P>As a result of this investigation, more than US$890 million in criminal fines
have been obtained to date, with 21 executives and eight companies in Japan,
South Korea and Taiwan having been charged with price fixing.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed up 0.75 percent Thursday led by large-cap electronics
firms after United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC), the world's second largest
contract chip maker, announced better-than-expected earnings for the third
quarter, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index rose 63.01 points to 8,354.05, after moving between 8,281.52
and 8,386.29, on turnover of NT$127.53 billion (US$4.14 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened up 0.29 percent on a technical rebound from the previous day.
Buying then accelerated, particularly in select high-tech heavyweights, as
investors hoped they would follow UMC and release satisfactory Q3 results.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,085 stocks closed up, 1,777 down, and 378 remained unchanged.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector scored the highest gain, up 1.3 percent.
Financial stocks gained 0.6 percent and foodstuffs added 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Among losers, textile companies fell 2.1 percent, the paper-and- pulp sector
lost 1.3 percent, plastics and chemicals dropped 0.4 percent, and cement stocks
fell 0.1 percent.</P>
      <P>Construction stocks closed unchanged.</P>
      <P>"UMC's third-quarter results were very encouraging, so investors are
increasingly expecting other bellwether electronics firms will come up with good
news," Taiwan International Securities analyst Michael Chiang said.</P>
      <P>In the third quarter, UMC posted NT$8.72 billion, a new high in almost three
years, up 65.4 percent from the previous quarter, while its operating profit
rose 32.2 percent to NT$7.19 billion.</P>
      <P>"Strong interest in the electronics sector helped the broader market offset the
impact from selling in the old-economy sector, in particular textile stocks,"
Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Chiang stated that turnover failed to expand to NT$160 billion or higher,
however, the level needed for the market to overcome technical hurdles ahead of
the key 8,400 point mark.</P>
      <P>"The market may consolidate over the next few sessions before jumping the
barrier," he said.</P>
      <P>Among large-cap stocks, UMC rose 4.71 percent to NT$14.45, and TSMC gained 1.13
percent to NT$62.70, while HTC added 4.73 percent to NT$708.00.</P>
      <P>In the old-economy sector, textile firm Far Eastern New Century fell 3.22
percent to NT$45.10, and Chung Hwa Pulp lost 2.62 percent to NT$16.70.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou reiterated Thursday his administration's  adherence to
the "1992 consensus"  as a foundation for the development of relations between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>According to Ma, the consensus refers to an understanding reached in 1992
between the two sides to respectively interpret the meaning of "one China."
This consensus  was mentioned  by a Chinese representative during a recent visit
to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This shows that both sides have a consistent understanding (of the content of
the consensus)," Ma said.</P>
      <P>The president was speaking to a U.S. delegation that was in Taiwan to attend an
international conference on China's military power.</P>
      <P>He said the cross-Taiwan Strait military balance has been tilting in favor of
China since 2005, a situation that has drawn widespread regional and global
concern.</P>
      <P>In light of this, Ma said, he has taken various steps to try to improve
relations with China and ease cross-strait tension since his inauguration two
years ago, because Taiwan is unlikely to engage in an arms race with China.</P>
      <P>It was against this background that he pledged to maintain the status quo across
the strait by following  a policy  of "no unification, no independence, no use
of force" and to develop relations with China on the basis of the "1992
consensus," Ma said.</P>
      <P>On a proposal to establish confidence-building measures between the two sides,
the president said the cross-strait  economic cooperation framework agreement
signed by the two sides in June is one of these steps. According to Ma, the
trade agreement would not have been possible without mutual cross-strait
confidence.</P>

      <P>Shares of smartphone maker HTC Corp. soared Thursday on institutional buying as
investors were anticipating that the huge China market will further boost the
company's bottom line, dealers said.</P>
      <P>After United Microelectronics Corp. (UMC) , the world's second- largest contract
chip maker, reported better-than-expected third quarter results the previous
day, more and more investors were expecting that HTC will release strong third
quarter earnings Friday, they said.</P>
      <P>HTC rose 4.73 percent to the day's high of NT$708.00 (US$22.98) Thursday,  with
6.80 million shares changing hands, while the benchmark weighted index closed up
0.75 percent at 8,354.05.</P>
      <P>"The China smartphone market is still in its infancy, " Grand Cathay Securities
analyst Mars Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"Investors, therefore, have high hopes that HTC will reap massive benefits from
the China market since the company launched its own brands there for the first
time in July, " said Hsu.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, HTC joined forces with China Telecom, one of the largest telecom
operators in China, to market an HTC-branded 3G model in China, a move that
enhanced market confidence in HTC's presence there, the dealers said.</P>
      <P>The market is watching closely to see what agreements HTC and China Telecom
might strike next week when China Telecom Chairman Wang Xiaochu meets in Taipei
with HTC Chairman Cher Wang, they said.</P>
      <P>"The buying in HTC today largely  came from institutional investors who are
betting that the company will release satisfactory third quarter results," Hsu
said.</P>
      <P>Market consensus predicts that HTC will post an earnings per share (EPS) of
NT$45 for 2010, up from NT$28.71 recorded in 2009, and that the 2011 EPS will
rise even further up to NT$65, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>"Based on HTC's profit prospects, the stock's current valuation remains low and
there is room for further gains, " Hsu said, giving a target price of NT$900.00.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih told residents of eastern Taiwan's Hualien County Thursday
not to make the arduous journey to Taipei in the current stormy weather, and
said he will instead travel to Hualien to meet them and address their
grievances.</P>
      <P>Wu said he would like to lead a delegation of officials to Hualien to meet
residents there who are planning to lodge a protest in Taipei Nov. 1 demanding
that the government accelerate the start of an upgrading project for the Suhua
Highway -- the cliff-edge highway connecting Suao in Yilan with Hualien to the
south that serves as the major route in and out of the area for the people and
their produce.</P>
      <P>He said the administration knows very well the aspirations of the Hualien
residents for an improved highway, and the purpose of their planned protest.</P>
      <P>The road improvement project,  although environmentally and geologically
challenging, is viable, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The administration has been planning the project for two years and has
communicated with environmental groups and local opinion leaders over the past
year, he said.</P>
      <P>"Construction can start as soon as the project has passed an environmental
impact assessment," the premier promised.</P>
      <P>Wu made the remarks after the Hualien county government began mobilizing
residents to travel to Taipei Nov. 1 to stage a sit-in demanding the start of
the road improvement project, which has been stalled for nearly a decade.</P>
      <P>Calls have been mounting for an early start of the improvement project in the
wake of serious landslides there caused by Typhoon Megi a week previously.</P>
      <P>Wu's remarks came after a tour bus carrying 19 Chinese tourists went missing on
the road Oct. 21 during torrential rain.</P>
      <P>Several other tour buses and automobiles, which were also traveling on the
highway at the time, were also affected by the typhoon,  which thrashed
northeastern  Taiwan Oct.  21-22 with record-high rainfall.</P>
      <P>Twenty-three people, including 19 Chinese nationals, remained unaccounted for as

      <P>Taiwanese people are big spenders on health food, with each adult spending an
average NT$1,031 (US$33.47) per month on such foodstuff, according to the
results of a survey published Thursday.</P>
      <P>Around 85 percent of the people in Taiwan would spend that amount of money to
buy organic, functional food or Chinese herbs to gain greater health or medical
benefits, in addition to purchasing basic nutritional food, the survey conducted
by the Taiwan Pharmaceutical Marketing and Management Association has found.</P>
      <P>The amount spent on health food is well above the average of NT$275 spent per
month by each individual on buying medicine, an indication that Taiwanese people
prefer to rely on consuming health food and supplements instead of on medicine
to boost their health, association officials said.</P>
      <P>However, two thirds of the respondents said they would go to see a doctor and
get prescribed medicine at clinics or hospitals covered in the National Health
Insurance program whenever they suffer from just a little discomfort.</P>
      <P>The reasons cited for such behavior included belief in doctors' and hospitals'
professionalism, safety, and effectiveness. People also prefer seeing a doctor
because the fees are covered by the insurance program.</P>
      <P>The number of visits made by the public to the appointed hospitals under the
health insurance program has steadily risen in recent years, with the average
insured person going to the hospital 15 times last year.</P>
      <P>Around NT$508 billion has been allocated for the program's expenses in 2011.</P>
      <P>The association carried out the random telephone survey from Sept. 13-24,
questioning 1,074 men and women aged between 20-65 across Taiwan about their
medical practices. It had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) will await the final result of an
environmental impact assessment before deciding whether to change the site of
the controversial Kuokuang Petrochemical Park, minister Shih Yen-shiang said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Shih noted that the site of the proposed park has been changed a number of
times, with the location last shifted from Yunlin County to Changhua County,
based on a proposal by the Changhua County government.</P>
      <P>Before that, the MOEA had also considered Pingtung and Kaohsiung counties as a
possible site, the minister said during a hearing held by the Legislative Yuan's
Economics Committee on the project.</P>
      <P>The project involves building the country's eighth naphtha cracker on a plot of
tidal land in Changhua's Dacheng area.</P>
      <P>Environmentalists have expressed strong opposition to the plan, arguing that the
facility would cause irreversible damage to local flora and fauna, endanger
marine life, and ultimately threaten the livelihoods of local farmers and
fishermen.</P>
      <P>Also at the legislative hearing, Tsai Chia-yang, president of the Taiwan
Environmental Protection Union's Changhua Division, called it a "mistake" to try
to build a petrochemical park at one of the country's most important
agricultural and fishing capitals.</P>
      <P>The designated site is also home to a major wetland of great conservation value,
Tsai pointed out.</P>
      <P>Addressing these concerns, Council of Agriculture Chairman Chen Wu-hsiung said
his council will demand that comprehensive assessments are made before
construction work begins to minimize its impact on the agricultural and fishing
sectors.</P>
      <P>On concerns that underground water might be extracted for use at the future
petrochemical park, which could lead to land subsidence, Shih said the park will
not do so because underground water is insufficient to meet the high demand for
water by the park.</P>
      <P>According to Shih,  if the project is scrapped,  Taiwan's self-sufficient  ratio
for ethylene --  a substance  used for manufacturing plastics and other
chemicals -- will decrease.</P>
      <P>This could lead to an exodus of Taiwan's petrochemical midstream and downstream
operations because it is difficult to import ethylene from other countries, he
said.</P>

      <P>A body part recovered from the waters off the coast of northeastern Taiwan on
Monday has been confirmed through DNA tests to belong to that of a female
Chinese tourist, the Yilan District Prosecutors Office said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"DNA tests conducted by the Ministry of Justice's Institute of Forensic Medicine
confirmed that the body part belonged to that of Gong Yen, a member of a Chinese
tour group, " said Lin Jhe-hui, a chief prosecutor at the Yilan County
prosecution office.</P>
      <P>Gong was a member of a 19-person tour group from China's Guangdong Province,
which was last known to be traveling on the Suhua Highway Oct. 2l when the major
scenic route perching on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean was hit by
rockslides amid heavy downpours brought by Typhoon Megi.</P>
      <P>Judging from the fact that Gong's body part was salvaged from waters 8 nautical
miles off Yilan County's Chuangwei Township, Lin said, the bodies of some of the
other members of the Guangdong tour group might have also fallen into the sea.</P>
      <P>Lin said Gong's relatives have been informed of the latest DNA test results.</P>
      <P>Last week's deadly rockslides on the accident-prone Suhua Highway linking
eastern Taiwan's Hualien county to Yilan County and Taipei had left three dead
and 23 others missing, of whom 19 were Chinese nationals.</P>
      <P>Besides Gong's, some body parts of the Taiwanese bus driver of the Guangdong
tour group, identified as Tsai Chih-ming, have also been recovered.</P>
      <P>Also found were the remains of Liu Yu-chun, a local special education teacher.
Liu's body was found on a slope off the highway and it is believed that her car
slid off the highway when rockslides struck. The 53-year-old teacher at a
Christian school for the mentally and physically disabled in Hualien was on her
way to her sister's home in northwestern Taiwan's Miaoli County.</P>
      <P>The search for the missing people continued for an eighth day on Thursday, with
the military mobilizing more backhoes and other equipment for the operations.</P>
      <P>Three Chinese officials, headed by Zhang Shenglin,  deputy secretary-general of

      <P>Lawmakers across the political spectrum demanded Thursday that the government
speed up the pace of its debt repayment.</P>
      <P>"It will take the government 75 years to pay off its huge accumulated debts,
even if austerity measures are taken and no more new debts are raised, "
Legislator Lay Shyh- bao of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) said, while panning the
government for making too little effort addressing the debt problem.</P>
      <P>Lai's view was echoed by his colleagues at a meeting of the Legislative Yuan's
Finance Committee,  including the KMT's Luo Shu-lei, Sun Da-chien, Lin Teh-fu
and Lu Hsiu-yen, and Kao Chih-peng of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, as well as Kang Shih-ju, an independent lawmaker.</P>
      <P>They passed a resolution to ask the government to raise the sum budgeted for
debt repayment to 7.5 percent of the annual tax revenue, representing an
increase of NT$30 billion (US$9.6 billion) to NT$100 billion, beginning 2012.</P>
      <P>According to Lai, the government's ratio of debt-repayment fund to its tax
revenue currently stands at only 5.38 percent, far lower than the 10.33 percent
for the period between 1992 and 2001.</P>
      <P>In response, Minister of Finance Lee Sush-der said the debts have been raised
for national construction projects and that it is common for industrialized
countries to have high per capita income, a high tax burden and a high national
debt.</P>
      <P>According  to  official  statistics,  Taiwan's  accumulated outstanding debts
totaled NT$4.06 trillion (about US$134 billion) as of the end of 2009, and are
expected climb to NT$4.96 trillion this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) , the world's largest contract
chip maker, said Thursday its third-quarter net profit hit a record high on the
back of strong global demand for consumer electronics and internet-related
products.</P>
      <P>In the July-September period, TSMC posted NT$46.94 billion (US$1.52 billion) in
net profit, up 16.5 percent from the second quarter and 53.6 percent from a year
earlier.</P>
      <P>During the same time, the company's sales also hit a record high at NT$112.25
billion which represented a quarter-on-quarter increase of 6.9 percent and a
year-on-year rise of 24.8 percent, it said.</P>
      <P>TSMC recorded an earnings per share of NT$1.81 in the third quarter, compared
with NT$1.55 in the second quarter and NT$1.18 a year earlier.</P>
      <P>Its gross margin in the third quarter rose to 50.0 percent from 49.5 percent in
the second quarter and 47.7 percent a year earlier, while its operating margin
fell to 38.4 percent in the third quarter from 38.6 percent in the second
quarter, but rose from 35.6 percent a year earlier.</P>
      <P>In the third quarter, products on the advanced 40 nanometer production process
accounted for about 17 percent of the company's total sales.</P>
      <P>In a quarterly investors conference, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang said he expects
the ratio of the 40 nm production process will rise to 20 percent in the fourth
quarter on rising demand for higher end products.</P>
      <P>Chang said he expects the more advanced 28 nm production process will generate
1-2 percent of the company's sales in the second half of next year.</P>
      <P>The chairman said the market demand for micro chips surpassed supply in the past
quarter and such favorable market conditions are expected to continue in the
fourth quarter, adding that TSMC is faced with piling orders, in particular the
orders for certain specialty products.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, TSMC said its sales for the fourth quarter are expected to range
between NT$107 billion and NT$109 billion, while its gross margin is expected to
stand at 48 percent-50 percent in the October-December period and the operating
margin is likely to reach 35.5 percent to NT$37.5 percent, the company said.</P>
      <P>Chang said he remains optimistic about the outlook of the global foundry
business, and expects production value of the industry to grow 14 percent in
2011, compared to 2010, higher than a 5 percent increase expected for the
overall semiconductor sector.</P>
      <P>The anticipated 14 percent growth in the global foundry business will be partly
the result of continued production outsourcing from fabless integrated circuit
designers, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang added that to meet demand from logic IC buyers, TSMC will continue to
expand its research and development capacity in 2011 with spending in R&amp;D
expected to exceed US$1.1 billion.</P>
      <P>He said TSMC's total capital expenditure for 2011 will top 2010's US$5.9
billion.</P>

      <P>An inter-agency national action plan will be launched to teach more Taiwanese
students and servicemen how to swim, a government official said in a press
conference Thursday.</P>
      <P>The ambitious 12-year plan, supervised by the Executive Yuan, hopes to teach at
least eight out of 10 Taiwanese students, soldiers, policemen and firemen how to
swim, which will dramatically reduce cases of drowning, said Tai Hsia-ling,
minister of the Sports Affairs Council (SAC).</P>
      <P>"In an island country like Taiwan, it is difficult to fathom why there are so
many drownings and why so few people know how to swim, " Tai said, adding that
President Ma Ying-jeou, an avid swimmer, is the driving force behind the scheme.</P>
      <P>Almost all major developed countries, such as Japan, France and the United
Kingdom, have public policies to promote swimming, she said.</P>
      <P>According to Tai, the ratio of swimming pools per 100,000 students between Japan
and Taiwan is an eye-popping 188 to 9.6. Citing a World Health Organization
study conducted in 2001, she added that the ratio of drownings per 100,000
children under the age of 14 in Japan and Taiwan is 0.6 to 1.8.</P>
      <P>Under the project, swimming pools will be built, personnel will be trained and
pool management will be improved from 2010-2022 so that local people will have
better access to swimming facilities.</P>
      <P>Joining the SAC will be the Ministry of National Defense, the National Police
Agency, the Coast Guard Administration, the National Fire Agency, the Ministry
of Education and 25 municipalities around the country.</P>
      <P>A supervisory committee under the Executive Yuan will set targets for different
groups. Among them, 80 percent of school children, 85 percent of military
servicemen and 80 percent of police officers will have to be able to swim for at
least 50 meters, while 90 percent of firemen and all Coast Guard Administration
staff will be required to pass a 200-meter test.</P>
      <P>With more people participating in swimming, Taiwan will be able to select
athletes to represent  the country in international competitions, said Thomas
Tsai, President of the Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee.</P>
      <P>Educators also hope the project will be able to help bridge the huge gap in the
balance of resources between the north and the south, where only around half of
the townships have swimming pools, said Cheng Mei-nu, an elementary school
principal in the southern county of Yunlin.</P>

      <P>Seventy- eight percent of the people polled are in favor of adopting an absentee
voting system, which Taiwan is considering introducing in the 2012 presidential
election, a survey released by the Ministry of the Interior showed Thursday.</P>
      <P>The telephone poll found 78 percent of the respondents supported allowing voters
to vote by absentee ballot, compared with 21.1 percent who were against the
idea.</P>
      <P>In addition, 73.5 percent of the respondents particularly backed one form of
absentee voting, which allows voters to cast their ballots at polling stations
outside their hometowns on election day.</P>
      <P>Another 24.8 percent of the people surveyed did not prefer this alternative,
according to the survey.</P>
      <P>Many people in Taiwan, especially young people, work away from their registered
places of residence -- usually their hometowns -- but under Taiwan's current
voting laws, they must return to their hometowns to vote.</P>
      <P>The results found younger and more educated respondents showed more support for
the system, with 85 percent of the respondents aged 20-29 being in favor of it.
Eighty-two percent of the respondents with a college or master's degree also
favored being able to vote by absentee ballot.</P>
      <P>Citizens living overseas, however, will not be able to vote by absentee ballot;
they are required to return to Taiwan to vote, the ministry announced earlier.</P>
      <P>Nearly 83 percent of the respondents agreed with this approach compared with
64.9 percent who said absentee voting should be applied to as many people as
possible.</P>
      <P>In terms of who should be included as priority voters under such a system, 77
percent of the respondents said people who work outside their hometowns,
followed  by voters who study outside their hometowns, policemen on duty,
servicemen in the military, and election staff.</P>
      <P>In addition, more than 71 percent of the respondents were in favor of putting
the system into effect in the presidential election in 2012, while 27.2 percent
were against the idea.</P>
      <P>The poll conducted between Oct. 14-16 collected 1,094 valid samples, with a
sampling error of plus or minus 2.96 percentage points.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Learning how to swim is a crucial aspect of Taiwanese soldiers' training, to
help them meet the requirements of serving the country, a Taiwanese military
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"There is no doubt that we would require our soldiers to know how to swim so
they are able to function better for the two most important aspects of the
Republic of China's (Taiwan) armed forces: combat and disaster relief, " said
Wang Shih-tu, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operation and Planning of the Ministry
of National Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>Speaking on the sidelines of a news conference about a national action plan to
promote swimming, Wang said that a military force with around 40 percent of its
soldiers who don't know how to swim "will not be able to do combat in Taiwan,
where there are plenty of rivers, ponds and fish farms."</P>
      <P>"Nor will they be able to execute disaster relief operations when most of the
time they have to wade into the water to rescue people in need and protect
themselves at the same time, " he said.</P>
      <P>The last thing the MND wants to see is the loss of soldiers during disaster
relief operations when the troopers are sent out to rescue people's lives, he
said. "Fortunately, we haven't lost any up to now," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The lieutenant general's remarks came hours after a legislator questioned the
MND's five-year budget of NT$5.4 billion to build and renovate swimming pools in
a legislative session on Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's military had started to implement extensive swimming training since
last May and the results have been fruitful, Wang said, adding that 62.4 percent
of its troops have now met the requirement of 50-meter tests, up from 47.7
percent last May.</P>
      <P>"We see it as a combat skill rather than only a recreational activity. And I'm
glad the commander-in-chief of the armed forces -- President Ma Ying-jeou -- has
recognized the importance of this crucial skill, "Wang said, referring to the
president's assertiveness in promoting swimming.</P>

      <P>Toxic air pollution caused by Taiwan's sixth naphtha cracker complex in Mailiao
Township, Yunlin County, has not just affected that county but has spread to the
two counties further south at even higher density, an academic said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The naphtha cracker complex was run by the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG).</P>
      <P>Ozone from volatile organic compounds discharged from factories in the FPG
petrochemical complex have been carried to the southern counties of Chiayi and
Tainan, said Yen You-li, an associate professor with the Department of Safety,
Health and Environmental Engineering of National United University in Miaoli
County.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a quantitative study conducted between 1994 and 2009, Yen
said the ozone density monitored in Chiayi's Singang Township has been as high
as 221 ppb, much higher than the allowable level of 120 ppb.</P>
      <P>The ozone density monitored in Tainan city and county is also higher than that
found in Yunlin County and its neighboring Changhua County, said Yen at a
workshop sponsored by the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration
on an assessment of the overall industrial examination of the FPG petrochemical
complex.</P>
      <P>Ozone can cause coughing and allergies, Yen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the density of sulfur dioxide in the air at Yunlin County's Taisi
Township has been found to be exceptionally high and complaints lodged by local
residents have also increased noticeably since the petrochemical complex was
built, Yen noted.</P>
      <P>FPG said Thursday that it would not comment on the discussions at the workshop
until the two-day session ended.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi County government said it was paying close attention to the workshop
and the discussions. If finances permit, the county government will launch a
health risk assessment drive in the county, it said.</P>

      <P>Three more cases of indigenous dengue fever have been reported in Taipei County,
bringing to nine the total number of cases recorded in the northern county
within a week, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Among the cases reported this week, eight live in Wugu Township and one in
Sanchong City, according to CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi.</P>
      <P>Despite the sharp rise in the number of dengue fever cases in such a short time,
Shih said he was not overly concerned about the outbreak, since the latest cases
recorded were all related to latent infections that just happen to have been
discovered at the same time.</P>
      <P>The time between infection and the manifestation of symptoms can range from
three to 14 days, but five to seven days is more usual, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the county has only detected the Aedes albopictus mosquito, which
is a less efficient vector of dengue fever than the Aedes aegypti that is
prevalent in southern Taiwan, Shih said.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan, an outbreak there has shown no signs of easing. A total of
230 cases had been reported in Tainan City as of Wednesday, during the height of
the epidemic season, said Hu Shu-chen, head of the city's Health Bureau.</P>
      <P>Around 200 soldiers were deployed around Tainan City Thursday to spray
insecticide in a bid to eradicate adult mosquitoes and prevent further cases, Hu
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has recorded 834 indigenous dengue fever cases this year since August.</P>

      <P>The head of the Taiwanese delegation to the 23rd Tokyo International Film
Festival deserves recognition for the way he defended the country's national
dignity in a name row with China at the event, Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The premier was referring to Chen Chih-kuan, director of the Department  of
Motion  Pictures  Affairs  under the Government Information Office (GIO), who
rejected his Chinese counterpart's rude demand that the Taiwanese delegation
include "China" in its official name on the opening night of the film festival
Oct. 23.</P>
      <P>In the altercation, Chen told Jiang Ping, head of the Chinese delegation, that
since Taiwan has always participated in the festival as "Taiwan, " there was no
reason to deviate from the usual practice. He also advised Jiang not to mix arts
with politics. The spat lasted over 90 minutes and cost both delegations the
chance to join the star-studded Oscar-style "green carpet walk."</P>
      <P>"Chen has set a good model for us with his `neither humble nor arrogant' manner
in dealing with the incident, " Wu said at a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, GIO Minister Johnny Chiang, Chen's direct boss, came up with a
proposal to give Chen an official merit for his efforts to safeguard Taiwan's
national dignity and interests.</P>
      <P>As the 2010 Asian Games will open in China's Guangzhou City Nov. 12, Wu said he
hopes China will be a good host and will show goodwill and sincerity by
refraining from touching on any sensitive name issues at the event.</P>
      <P>He also reminded the Sports Affairs Council to exercise caution and prudence in
dealing with relevant issues.</P>
      <P>"We should abide by Olympic Games regulations and safeguard our national dignity
in a graceful, appropriate manner, " the premier said.</P>
      <P>When asked whether Taiwan will seek a formal response from Beijing on the Tokyo
incident, Chiang said only that the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) had already
issued a statement the previous day on the issue.</P>
      <P>The MAC statement expressed disappointment and regret over China's failure to
apologize for Jiang's instigation of the name issue at the film festival.</P>
      <P>"We hope the Chinese authorities  will understand Taiwan's feelings about being
isolated and denigrated in the international community....  Only if both sides
show goodwill  can hard-won cross-strait detente be maintained and bilateral
relations move forward," the statement said.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Yang Yi said at a
regular press briefing that the incident probably arose from a lack of
communication between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"This is something we do not wish to see, and we believe the matter will not
affect future cross-strait collaboration or exchanges in filmmaking, " Yang
said. He did not reprimand Jiang for igniting the row. DITEM/J</P>

      <P>Work on a Suhua Highway improvement project should not be rushed under pressure
from public opinion, scholars said after serious landslides on the road had
claimed 15 lives and left 23 people missing as of Thursday.</P>
      <P>The warning came after angry residents in the eastern county threatened to stage
a rally in Taipei City Nov. 1 and the Hualien County Council went into
indefinite recess in protest over the central government's long delay in
improving the road linking Yilan and Hualien counties.</P>
      <P>Lee Hong-yuan, a professor of the Department of Civil Engineering at National
Taiwan University (NTU) , said policy makers should not react emotionally simply
because of pressure from the public.</P>
      <P>"We should pay closer attention to the issue of the Suhua Highway improvement
project instead of hastening the government to start the improvement
construction," Lee said.</P>
      <P>His words were echoed by Hongey Chen, professor of the Department of Geosciences
at NTU.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government should spend more time investigating the unique
geological structure of the region and the environmental impact of the project
before construction takes place.</P>
      <P>"If we do not take variables such as faultlines and groundwater into
consideration, building tunnels on the Suhua Highway in haste could do more harm
to the area," he said.</P>
      <P>The Suhua improvement project calls for tunnels to be built to avoid some of the
worst existing sections of the road.</P>
      <P>An environmental impact assessment for the project remains under evaluation by a
review committee, the last hurdle before the bidding process for contractors can
begin.</P>
      <P>During the intervening period, Chen went on, the government should clearly
identify the most unstable sections of the highway.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the government should also examine its ability to manage the
highway after the reconstruction.</P>
      <P>According to the National Police Agency,  there were more casualties due to
traffic accidents than to natural disasters between 2002 and 2007 on the
highway.</P>
      <P>Lee said that without careful planning, the situation will be even worse if car
accidents happen inside the proposed tunnels.</P>
      <P>Other scholars emphasized the importance of seeking long-term solutions for the
people of Taiwan, who have to learn how to live with extreme weather and natural
disasters.</P>
      <P>Liu Shawchen, director of the Research Center for Environment Changes at
Academia Sinica, said the public could take advantage of alternative transport
rather than being caught in a radical yes-or-no situation regarding the road.</P>
      <P>"If we can upgrade the current railway system and even ferry services, I believe
there will be more possibilities for figuring out how to take care of the Suhua
Highway problem," he said.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih is welcome to visit Hualien County, but the county's plan to
stage a protest in Taipei to push for the upgrading of the Suhua Highway remains
unchanged, Hualien Magistrate Fu Kun-chi said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The premier is welcome to visit the eastern county to gain a better
understanding of development there, which lags 40 years behind the rest of the
country, Fu said.</P>
      <P>He was responding to remarks by Wu, who called for Hualien residents earlier in
the day not to make the arduous journey to Taipei in the current stormy weather,
and said he will instead travel to Hualien to meet them and address their
grievances.</P>
      <P>Wu said he wanted to lead a delegation of officials to Hualien to meet residents
there who are planning to lodge the protest in Taipei Nov. 1 demanding that the
government accelerate the start of an upgrading project for the Suhua Highway --
the cliff-edge highway connecting Suao in Yilan with Hualien to the south that
serves as the major route in and out of the area for the people and their
produce.</P>
      <P>He said the administration knows very well the aspirations of the Hualien
residents for an improved highway, and the purpose of their planned protest.</P>
      <P>The road improvement project,  although environmentally and geologically
challenging,  is viable,  Wu said,  adding  that construction can start as soon
as the project has passed an environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>According to the Hualien County government, more than 10,000 local residents
will travel to Taipei Nov. 1 to stage a sit-in demanding an early start to the
road improvement project.</P>
      <P>Fu disclosed that the Hualien County government came under pressure when it
applied for permission to hold the protest in Taipei, and said related central
government units have tried to dissuade the Hualien officials from organizing
the protest.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai Kun-cheng, a legislator representing the eastern county of
Taitung, said residents there have also started planning to join the protest.</P>
      <P>Calls have been mounting for an early start to the improvement project in the
wake of serious landslides caused by Typhoon Megi a week previously on the Suhua

      <P>An elementary School in Pingtung County has received a donation of NT$110,000
(US$3,585) from a Japanese school for a restoration fund, school officials said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Representatives of Kobe Takatsuka Senior High School in Japan, including two
teachers and three students visited the Linbian Elementary School in the
southern county to make the donation during a graduation trip to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One of the teachers said the school's second grade teachers and students raised
the money at the school and in the neighborhood after learning that some areas
of Taiwan were damaged badly by Typhoon Morakot in August last year.</P>
      <P>The school contacted the Pingtung County government, which suggested that the
donation should go to Linbian Elementary School, which was flooded to a depth of
two meters during the typhoon.</P>
      <P>"A massive earthquake struck Kobe 15 years ago and the city's residents
understand the pain suffered by the Taiwanese people during the disaster," one
of the students said.</P>
      <P>"The fund-raising campaign won great support in the city, " the student said at
the donation ceremony.</P>
      <P>Many of the Linbian students' parents became unemployed after the typhoon and
approximately 200 students cannot afford their lunch and tuition fees.
Therefore, the donation will be used to help those students, said the school's
principal, Liu Wan-te.</P>
      <P>At the end of ceremony, the teachers and students of the two schools also
jointly planted a jasmine orange on the campus to commemorate the visit.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou confirmed Thursday that chipmaker  Intel will continue
its support for Taiwan's development of wireless broadband technology WiMAX,
after a meeting with Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government has released six licenses for WiMAX operators and has
invested US$220 million in developing related technologies and applications.</P>
      <P>He said previous cooperative programs with chip company Qualcomm and mobile
network equipment maker Ericsson can be role models for Intel to strengthen its
long-term cooperation with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Otellini's visit has been highly anticipated in Taiwan after the company's
closure of its WiMAX Program Office (WPO) in June sparked speculation that it
was withdrawing support for WiMAX, in which Taiwan has made significant
investments over the past two years.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Stanley Huang, Intel's director of advanced technical sales
and services in the Asia-Pacific region, told reporters that WiMAX still has
prospects in the industry.</P>
      <P>Huang said Intel will not overlook the potential of long-term evolution (LTE)
technology, a WiMAX competitor, as market demand for wireless broadband is
changing all the time.</P>
      <P>"Intel is fully committed to WiMAX because we think it is six to 12 months ahead
of the time to market  compared  with other technologies. At present, we see
business opportunities for WiMAX, " he said.</P>
      <P>"It is user demand, not Intel, that will decide the mainstream technology of the
industry in the future," he added.</P>

      <P>Taiwan routed a young Japanese national team 12-5 Thursday to win its first game
in the semifinal round of the 2010 Intercontinental Cup baseball tournament in
the central city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>Japan could not hold off Taiwan's offensive as the home team blasted 14 hits
against the young Nippon Professional Baseball pitchers, while its reliever Lin
Yu-ching became the unlikely hero of the game.</P>
      <P>Lin came up to the mound after starter Chen Hong-wen and the first relief
pitcher Liao Wen-yang had failed to contain the opposing hitters. The amateur
right-hander pitched 5 1/3 strong innings and gave up only one hit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, scheduled to meet Italy (2-1) in Taichung the following evening, was 2-1
and ranked second behind Cuba (3-0) in the six-team semifinal round. Japan was
1-2.</P>
      <P>Unfazed by a 4-0 early deficit, Taiwan punished Japanese starter Takahiro Iwao
with four hits in the bottom of the second inning, including two doubles and a
triple by Lo Kuo-hui, to tie the score.</P>
      <P>After Japan regained a 5-4 lead, the home boys again took advantage of Japanese
reliever Hideki Sunaga's inconsistency and his teammates' shaky defense. Chen
Chun-hsiu's double was followed by a deadball and an error as Taiwan tied the
game and added two more runs by consecutive sacrifice flies to bring the score
to 7-5.</P>
      <P>The situation almost got out of hand in the top of the fourth inning, when Lin
Yu-ching's consecutive hit batsmen came close to turning the game into a bench-
clearing brawl as players from both teams exchanged heated words on the field
before the umpire managed to regain control.</P>
      <P>Japan, which had an average age of less than 23 as a team, was hurt by five
defensive errors, four of which came in the first four innings, a rare showing
for any Japanese national team. The first baseman Taishi Ota and shortstop Shota
Ohmine committed two errors apiece.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had six consecutive hits with two outs in the bottom of the eighth to add
four runs and turn the game into a rout.</P>
      <P>In other  semifinal  round games Thursday,  Cuba beat the Netherlands 6-3 and
Italy defeated South Korea 5-2.</P>
      <P>Semifinal standings: Cuba 3-0, Italy 2-1, Taiwan 2-1, Japan 1-2, Netherlands
1-2, South Korea 0-3</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday that it issued two statements a
day earlier to drive home the message of regret and disappointment over China's
response to a row over the name of the Taiwanese delegation at the opening
ceremony of the Tokyo International Film Festival Oct. 23.</P>
      <P>MAC Deputy Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said the MAC first issued a statement after
China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Yang Yi said earlier that day that "the
incident probably took place due to a lack of communication between both sides.
This is something we do not wish to see."</P>
      <P>Yang's remarks "failed to live up to our expectations" and no efforts to
maintain bilateral relations were seen, the MAC said in the statement.</P>
      <P>The MAC also expressed "regret and disappointment" at Yang's remarks.</P>
      <P>In the second statement issued a few hours later, the MAC said Yang's remarks
might have meant well, but he obviously lacked knowledge of the Taiwanese people
and could not empathize with Premier Wu Den-yih's "overbearing" description of
Jiang Ping, the leader of the Chinese delegation to the festival, who had
insisted that Taiwan attend the festival under the name of "Taiwan, China" or
"Chinese Taipei," which Taiwanese delegation flatly rejected.</P>
      <P>The incident lasted over 90 minutes and cost both delegations the chance to walk
down the "green  carpet"  at the star-studded Oscar-style event.</P>
      <P>The incident seriously hurt the feelings of the Taiwanese people and was
detrimental to the peaceful development of cross-strait relations, the MAC said
in the statement, urging Beijing to take "immediate remedial measures."</P>
      <P>Liu said the first statement was terse, while the second more fully expressed
the government's stance on the issue.</P>

      <P>The government has been doing its utmost in the search for Chinese tourists who
were probably buried by mudslides on the Suhua Highway when Typhoon Megi hit
northeastern Taiwan Oct. 21-22, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Deputy Chairman
Liu Te-shun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The biggest problem that the rescuers have encountered is the extremely rugged
slopes and the amount of rubble that continues to come down on several sections
of the highway where they are still making all-out efforts to search for the
missing, " Liu said in a routine news briefing.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan government fully understands the grave concerns of their families,
but full-scale search missions are underway and no extra assistance is needed,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Liu's remarks came after Zhang Shenglin, deputy secretary-general of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, offered to
help with the search.</P>
      <P>"China is willing to provide necessary assistance should Taiwan issue such a
request, " Zhang said, who visited Taiwan last weekend upon learning of the
fatal accidents.</P>
      <P>As of late Thursday, 15 people had been confirmed dead and 23 remained missing,
including 20 Chinese nationals.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, upon returning from the highway where she and Chinese
family members of the missing tourists observed the search work, Zhang visited
two Chinese nationals who were rescued from the highway and who were being
treated at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei.</P>
      <P>On behalf  of the  Beijing  authorities,  Zhang  expressed appreciation for the

      <P>The Coast Guard Administration (CGA) said Thursday that it had arrested two
people suspected of smuggling 1,700 doses of sheep placenta into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The total market value of the doses is around NT$8 million (US$242,000),
according to CGA official Chao Chi-tien.</P>
      <P>One of the suspects, surnamed Chiu, was arrested while attempting to deliver 700
doses to Yeh. Both of them were arrested at the scene, Chao said.</P>
      <P>Another 1,000 doses were seized at the cargo terminal at Taiwan Taoyuan
International Airport following the first arrest, Chao added.</P>
      <P>"The profits are handsome," Chao said, adding that sheep placenta is believed to
have anti-aging effects and can be sold in beauty clinics for up to NT$6,000 per
dose, while the cost of buying it in South Korea and smuggling into Taiwan is
less than NT$200 per dose.</P>

      <P>Learning how to swim is a crucial aspect of Taiwanese soldiers' training, to
help them meet the requirements of serving the country, a Taiwanese military
official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"There is no doubt that we would require our soldiers to know how to swim so
they are able to function better for the two most important aspects of the
Republic of China's (Taiwan) armed forces: combat and disaster relief, " said
Wang Shih-tu, Deputy Chief of Staff for Operation and Planning of the Ministry
of National Defense (MND).</P>
      <P>Speaking on the sidelines of a news conference about a national action plan to
promote swimming, Wang said that a military force with around 40 percent of its
soldiers who don't know how to swim "will not be able to do combat in Taiwan,
where there are plenty of rivers, ponds and fish farms."</P>
      <P>"Nor will they be able to execute disaster relief operations when most of the
time they have to wade into the water to rescue people in need and protect
themselves at the same time, " he said.</P>
      <P>The last thing the MND wants to see is the loss of soldiers during disaster
relief operations when the troopers are sent out to rescue people's lives, he
said. "Fortunately, we haven't lost any up to now," Wang said.</P>
      <P>The lieutenant general's remarks came hours after a legislator questioned the
MND's five-year budget of NT$5.4 billion to build and renovate swimming pools in
a legislative session on Thursday morning.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's military had started to implement extensive swimming training since
last May and the results have been fruitful, Wang said, adding that 62.4 percent
of its troops have now met the requirement of 50-meter tests, up from 47.7
percent last May.</P>
      <P>"We see it as a combat skill rather than only a recreational activity. And I'm
glad the commander-in-chief of the armed forces -- President Ma Ying-jeou -- has
recognized the importance of this crucial skill, "Wang said, referring to the
president's assertiveness in promoting swimming.</P>

      <P>Toxic air pollution caused by Taiwan's sixth naphtha cracker complex in Mailiao
Township, Yunlin County, has not just affected that county but has spread to the
two counties further south at even higher density, an academic said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The naphtha cracker complex was run by the Formosa Plastics Group (FPG).</P>
      <P>Ozone from volatile organic compounds discharged from factories in the FPG
petrochemical complex have been carried to the southern counties of Chiayi and
Tainan, said Yen You-li, an associate professor with the Department of Safety,
Health and Environmental Engineering of National United University in Miaoli
County.</P>
      <P>Quoting the results of a quantitative study conducted between 1994 and 2009, Yen
said the ozone density monitored in Chiayi's Singang Township has been as high
as 221 ppb, much higher than the allowable level of 120 ppb.</P>
      <P>The ozone density monitored in Tainan city and county is also higher than that
found in Yunlin County and its neighboring Changhua County, said Yen at a
workshop sponsored by the Cabinet-level Environmental Protection Administration
on an assessment of the overall industrial examination of the FPG petrochemical
complex.</P>
      <P>Ozone can cause coughing and allergies, Yen said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the density of sulfur dioxide in the air at Yunlin County's Taisi
Township has been found to be exceptionally high and complaints lodged by local
residents have also increased noticeably since the petrochemical complex was
built, Yen noted.</P>
      <P>FPG said Thursday that it would not comment on the discussions at the workshop
until the two-day session ended.</P>
      <P>The Chiayi County government said it was paying close attention to the workshop
and the discussions. If finances permit, the county government will launch a
health risk assessment drive in the county, it said.</P>

      <P>Three more cases of indigenous dengue fever have been reported in Taipei County,
bringing to nine the total number of cases recorded in the northern county
within a week, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Among the cases reported this week, eight live in Wugu Township and one in
Sanchong City, according to CDC Deputy Director-General Shih Wen-yi.</P>
      <P>Despite the sharp rise in the number of dengue fever cases in such a short time,
Shih said he was not overly concerned about the outbreak, since the latest cases
recorded were all related to latent infections that just happen to have been
discovered at the same time.</P>
      <P>The time between infection and the manifestation of symptoms can range from
three to 14 days, but five to seven days is more usual, he said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the county has only detected the Aedes albopictus mosquito, which
is a less efficient vector of dengue fever than the Aedes aegypti that is
prevalent in southern Taiwan, Shih said.</P>
      <P>In southern Taiwan, an outbreak there has shown no signs of easing. A total of
230 cases had been reported in Tainan City as of Wednesday, during the height of
the epidemic season, said Hu Shu-chen, head of the city's Health Bureau.</P>
      <P>Around 200 soldiers were deployed around Tainan City Thursday to spray
insecticide in a bid to eradicate adult mosquitoes and prevent further cases, Hu
said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has recorded 834 indigenous dengue fever cases this year since August.</P>

      <P>The head of the Taiwanese delegation to the 23rd Tokyo International Film
Festival deserves recognition for the way he defended the country's national
dignity in a name row with China at the event, Premier Wu Den-yih said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The premier was referring to Chen Chih-kuan, director of the Department  of
Motion  Pictures  Affairs  under the Government Information Office (GIO), who
rejected his Chinese counterpart's rude demand that the Taiwanese delegation
include "China" in its official name on the opening night of the film festival
Oct. 23.</P>
      <P>In the altercation, Chen told Jiang Ping, head of the Chinese delegation, that
since Taiwan has always participated in the festival as "Taiwan, " there was no
reason to deviate from the usual practice. He also advised Jiang not to mix arts
with politics. The spat lasted over 90 minutes and cost both delegations the
chance to join the star-studded Oscar-style "green carpet walk."</P>
      <P>"Chen has set a good model for us with his `neither humble nor arrogant' manner
in dealing with the incident, " Wu said at a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, GIO Minister Johnny Chiang, Chen's direct boss, came up with a
proposal to give Chen an official merit for his efforts to safeguard Taiwan's
national dignity and interests.</P>
      <P>As the 2010 Asian Games will open in China's Guangzhou City Nov. 12, Wu said he
hopes China will be a good host and will show goodwill and sincerity by
refraining from touching on any sensitive name issues at the event.</P>
      <P>He also reminded the Sports Affairs Council to exercise caution and prudence in
dealing with relevant issues.</P>
      <P>"We should abide by Olympic Games regulations and safeguard our national dignity
in a graceful, appropriate manner, " the premier said.</P>
      <P>When asked whether Taiwan will seek a formal response from Beijing on the Tokyo
incident, Chiang said only that the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) had already
issued a statement the previous day on the issue.</P>
      <P>The MAC statement expressed disappointment and regret over China's failure to
apologize for Jiang's instigation of the name issue at the film festival.</P>
      <P>"We hope the Chinese authorities  will understand Taiwan's feelings about being
isolated and denigrated in the international community....  Only if both sides
show goodwill  can hard-won cross-strait detente be maintained and bilateral
relations move forward," the statement said.</P>
      <P>Earlier that day, China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Yang Yi said at a
regular press briefing that the incident probably arose from a lack of
communication between the two sides.</P>
      <P>"This is something we do not wish to see, and we believe the matter will not
affect future cross-strait collaboration or exchanges in filmmaking, " Yang
said. He did not reprimand Jiang for igniting the row. DITEM/J</P>

      <P>Work on a Suhua Highway improvement project should not be rushed under pressure
from public opinion, scholars said after serious landslides on the road had
claimed 15 lives and left 23 people missing as of Thursday.</P>
      <P>The warning came after angry residents in the eastern county threatened to stage
a rally in Taipei City Nov. 1 and the Hualien County Council went into
indefinite recess in protest over the central government's long delay in
improving the road linking Yilan and Hualien counties.</P>
      <P>Lee Hong-yuan, a professor of the Department of Civil Engineering at National
Taiwan University (NTU) , said policy makers should not react emotionally simply
because of pressure from the public.</P>
      <P>"We should pay closer attention to the issue of the Suhua Highway improvement
project instead of hastening the government to start the improvement
construction," Lee said.</P>
      <P>His words were echoed by Hongey Chen, professor of the Department of Geosciences
at NTU.</P>
      <P>Chen said the government should spend more time investigating the unique
geological structure of the region and the environmental impact of the project
before construction takes place.</P>
      <P>"If we do not take variables such as faultlines and groundwater into
consideration, building tunnels on the Suhua Highway in haste could do more harm
to the area," he said.</P>
      <P>The Suhua improvement project calls for tunnels to be built to avoid some of the
worst existing sections of the road.</P>
      <P>An environmental impact assessment for the project remains under evaluation by a
review committee, the last hurdle before the bidding process for contractors can
begin.</P>
      <P>During the intervening period, Chen went on, the government should clearly
identify the most unstable sections of the highway.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the government should also examine its ability to manage the
highway after the reconstruction.</P>
      <P>According to the National Police Agency,  there were more casualties due to
traffic accidents than to natural disasters between 2002 and 2007 on the
highway.</P>
      <P>Lee said that without careful planning, the situation will be even worse if car
accidents happen inside the proposed tunnels.</P>
      <P>Other scholars emphasized the importance of seeking long-term solutions for the
people of Taiwan, who have to learn how to live with extreme weather and natural
disasters.</P>
      <P>Liu Shawchen, director of the Research Center for Environment Changes at
Academia Sinica, said the public could take advantage of alternative transport
rather than being caught in a radical yes-or-no situation regarding the road.</P>
      <P>"If we can upgrade the current railway system and even ferry services, I believe
there will be more possibilities for figuring out how to take care of the Suhua
Highway problem," he said.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih is welcome to visit Hualien County, but the county's plan to
stage a protest in Taipei to push for the upgrading of the Suhua Highway remains
unchanged, Hualien Magistrate Fu Kun-chi said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The premier is welcome to visit the eastern county to gain a better
understanding of development there, which lags 40 years behind the rest of the
country, Fu said.</P>
      <P>He was responding to remarks by Wu, who called for Hualien residents earlier in
the day not to make the arduous journey to Taipei in the current stormy weather,
and said he will instead travel to Hualien to meet them and address their
grievances.</P>
      <P>Wu said he wanted to lead a delegation of officials to Hualien to meet residents
there who are planning to lodge the protest in Taipei Nov. 1 demanding that the
government accelerate the start of an upgrading project for the Suhua Highway --
the cliff-edge highway connecting Suao in Yilan with Hualien to the south that
serves as the major route in and out of the area for the people and their
produce.</P>
      <P>He said the administration knows very well the aspirations of the Hualien
residents for an improved highway, and the purpose of their planned protest.</P>
      <P>The road improvement project,  although environmentally and geologically
challenging,  is viable,  Wu said,  adding  that construction can start as soon
as the project has passed an environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>According to the Hualien County government, more than 10,000 local residents
will travel to Taipei Nov. 1 to stage a sit-in demanding an early start to the
road improvement project.</P>
      <P>Fu disclosed that the Hualien County government came under pressure when it
applied for permission to hold the protest in Taipei, and said related central
government units have tried to dissuade the Hualien officials from organizing
the protest.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lai Kun-cheng, a legislator representing the eastern county of
Taitung, said residents there have also started planning to join the protest.</P>
      <P>Calls have been mounting for an early start to the improvement project in the
wake of serious landslides caused by Typhoon Megi a week previously on the Suhua
Highway.</P>

      <P>An elementary School in Pingtung County has received a donation of NT$110,000
(US$3,585) from a Japanese school for a restoration fund, school officials said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Representatives of Kobe Takatsuka Senior High School in Japan, including two
teachers and three students visited the Linbian Elementary School in the
southern county to make the donation during a graduation trip to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>One of the teachers said the school's second grade teachers and students raised
the money at the school and in the neighborhood after learning that some areas
of Taiwan were damaged badly by Typhoon Morakot in August last year.</P>
      <P>The school contacted the Pingtung County government, which suggested that the
donation should go to Linbian Elementary School, which was flooded to a depth of
two meters during the typhoon.</P>
      <P>"A massive earthquake struck Kobe 15 years ago and the city's residents
understand the pain suffered by the Taiwanese people during the disaster," one
of the students said.</P>
      <P>"The fund-raising campaign won great support in the city, " the student said at
the donation ceremony.</P>
      <P>Many of the Linbian students' parents became unemployed after the typhoon and
approximately 200 students cannot afford their lunch and tuition fees.
Therefore, the donation will be used to help those students, said the school's
principal, Liu Wan-te.</P>
      <P>At the end of ceremony, the teachers and students of the two schools also
jointly planted a jasmine orange on the campus to commemorate the visit.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou confirmed Thursday that chipmaker  Intel will continue
its support for Taiwan's development of wireless broadband technology WiMAX,
after a meeting with Intel President and CEO Paul Otellini in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Ma said the government has released six licenses for WiMAX operators and has
invested US$220 million in developing related technologies and applications.</P>
      <P>He said previous cooperative programs with chip company Qualcomm and mobile
network equipment maker Ericsson can be role models for Intel to strengthen its
long-term cooperation with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Otellini's visit has been highly anticipated in Taiwan after the company's
closure of its WiMAX Program Office (WPO) in June sparked speculation that it
was withdrawing support for WiMAX, in which Taiwan has made significant
investments over the past two years.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Stanley Huang, Intel's director of advanced technical sales
and services in the Asia-Pacific region, told reporters that WiMAX still has
prospects in the industry.</P>
      <P>Huang said Intel will not overlook the potential of long-term evolution (LTE)
technology, a WiMAX competitor, as market demand for wireless broadband is
changing all the time.</P>
      <P>"Intel is fully committed to WiMAX because we think it is six to 12 months ahead
of the time to market  compared  with other technologies. At present, we see
business opportunities for WiMAX, " he said.</P>
      <P>"It is user demand, not Intel, that will decide the mainstream technology of the
industry in the future," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan routed a young Japanese national team 12-5 Thursday to win its first game
in the semifinal round of the 2010 Intercontinental Cup baseball tournament in
the central city of Taichung.</P>
      <P>Japan could not hold off Taiwan's offensive as the home team blasted 14 hits
against the young Nippon Professional Baseball pitchers, while its reliever Lin
Yu-ching became the unlikely hero of the game.</P>
      <P>Lin came up to the mound after starter Chen Hong-wen and the first relief
pitcher Liao Wen-yang had failed to contain the opposing hitters. The amateur
right-hander pitched 5 1/3 strong innings and gave up only one hit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, scheduled to meet Italy (2-1) in Taichung the following evening, was 2-1
and ranked second behind Cuba (3-0) in the six-team semifinal round. Japan was
1-2.</P>
      <P>Unfazed by a 4-0 early deficit, Taiwan punished Japanese starter Takahiro Iwao
with four hits in the bottom of the second inning, including two doubles and a
triple by Lo Kuo-hui, to tie the score.</P>
      <P>After Japan regained a 5-4 lead, the home boys again took advantage of Japanese
reliever Hideki Sunaga's inconsistency and his teammates' shaky defense. Chen
Chun-hsiu's double was followed by a deadball and an error as Taiwan tied the
game and added two more runs by consecutive sacrifice flies to bring the score
to 7-5.</P>
      <P>The situation almost got out of hand in the top of the fourth inning, when Lin
Yu-ching's consecutive hit batsmen came close to turning the game into a bench-
clearing brawl as players from both teams exchanged heated words on the field
before the umpire managed to regain control.</P>
      <P>Japan, which had an average age of less than 23 as a team, was hurt by five
defensive errors, four of which came in the first four innings, a rare showing
for any Japanese national team. The first baseman Taishi Ota and shortstop Shota
Ohmine committed two errors apiece.</P>
      <P>Taiwan had six consecutive hits with two outs in the bottom of the eighth to add
four runs and turn the game into a rout.</P>
      <P>In other  semifinal  round games Thursday,  Cuba beat the Netherlands 6-3 and
Italy defeated South Korea 5-2.</P>
      <P>Semifinal standings: Cuba 3-0, Italy 2-1, Taiwan 2-1, Japan 1-2, Netherlands

      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said Thursday that it issued two statements a
day earlier to drive home the message of regret and disappointment over China's
response to a row over the name of the Taiwanese delegation at the opening
ceremony of the Tokyo International Film Festival Oct. 23.</P>
      <P>MAC Deputy Chairman Liu Teh-hsun said the MAC first issued a statement after
China's Taiwan Affairs Office spokesman Yang Yi said earlier that day that "the
incident probably took place due to a lack of communication between both sides.
This is something we do not wish to see."</P>
      <P>Yang's remarks "failed to live up to our expectations" and no efforts to
maintain bilateral relations were seen, the MAC said in the statement.</P>
      <P>The MAC also expressed "regret and disappointment" at Yang's remarks.</P>
      <P>In the second statement issued a few hours later, the MAC said Yang's remarks
might have meant well, but he obviously lacked knowledge of the Taiwanese people
and could not empathize with Premier Wu Den-yih's "overbearing" description of
Jiang Ping, the leader of the Chinese delegation to the festival, who had
insisted that Taiwan attend the festival under the name of "Taiwan, China" or
"Chinese Taipei," which Taiwanese delegation flatly rejected.</P>
      <P>The incident lasted over 90 minutes and cost both delegations the chance to walk
down the "green  carpet"  at the star-studded Oscar-style event.</P>
      <P>The incident seriously hurt the feelings of the Taiwanese people and was
detrimental to the peaceful development of cross-strait relations, the MAC said
in the statement, urging Beijing to take "immediate remedial measures."</P>
      <P>Liu said the first statement was terse, while the second more fully expressed
the government's stance on the issue.</P>

      <P>The government has been doing its utmost in the search for Chinese tourists who
were probably buried by mudslides on the Suhua Highway when Typhoon Megi hit
northeastern Taiwan Oct. 21-22, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Deputy Chairman
Liu Te-shun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The biggest problem that the rescuers have encountered is the extremely rugged
slopes and the amount of rubble that continues to come down on several sections
of the highway where they are still making all-out efforts to search for the
missing, " Liu said in a routine news briefing.</P>
      <P>"The Taiwan government fully understands the grave concerns of their families,
but full-scale search missions are underway and no extra assistance is needed,"
he said.</P>
      <P>Liu's remarks came after Zhang Shenglin, deputy secretary-general of the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, offered to
help with the search.</P>
      <P>"China is willing to provide necessary assistance should Taiwan issue such a
request, " Zhang said, who visited Taiwan last weekend upon learning of the
fatal accidents.</P>
      <P>As of late Thursday, 15 people had been confirmed dead and 23 remained missing,
including 20 Chinese nationals.</P>
      <P>Earlier that same day, upon returning from the highway where she and Chinese
family members of the missing tourists observed the search work, Zhang visited
two Chinese nationals who were rescued from the highway and who were being
treated at National Taiwan University Hospital in Taipei.</P>
      <P>On behalf  of the  Beijing  authorities,  Zhang  expressed appreciation for the

Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. -- the second-largest banking group in
Japan and the world -- to upgrade its local representative office to a branch

Mencius' lesson of the day: "When a ruler regards his ministers as his hands and
feet, they regard him as their belly and heart; when he regards them as dogs and
horses, they regard him as a common citizen; when he regards them as dirt and
grass, they regard him as a robber and enemy."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>According to National Security Council Secretary-General Hu Wei-jen, the cross-
Taiwan Strait consensus of "one China, respective interpretations"  applies in
the territorial  dispute over the Tiaoyutai Islands because Beijing states that
the island group belongs to "China, " instead of saying that it belongs to "the
People's Republic of China."</P>
      <P>Over the past two years, the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou has been
boasting of how the so-called "1992 consensus" has helped improve the situation
across the Taiwan Strait. In fact, the Ma  administration  is  using  the
illusionary  "respective interpretations" to cheat the Taiwanese people into
believing that it is working hard to "safeguard the Republic of China." Such
trickery cannot withstand scrutiny in international settings.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was granted observer status in the World Health Assembly under the name
"Chinese Taipei, " but the Ma administration was nevertheless overjoyed. At the
Tokyo International Film Festival, the Taiwanese delegation was suppressed by
the Chinese delegation because it used the name "Taiwan" instead of "Taiwan,
China, " or "Chinese Taipei." The Ma administration, however, put on a smiling
face to try to placate Beijing over the spat.</P>
      <P>The Tokyo incident was described by the Ma administration as an "isolated case,
" although there have been numerous such "isolated cases" over the past two
years. We can foresee that such "isolated incidents" will continue to occur. How
much longer do the Taiwanese people have to put up with such deception?

    <TEXT>
      <P>Shares of personal computer vendor AsusTek Computer Inc. made a strong showing
in Friday morning trade after the company reported better-than-expected earnings
for the first three quarters of this year, dealers said.</P>
      <P>At 11: 10 a.m., AsusTek rose 2.46 percent to 249.50 with 3.11 million shares
changing hands, while the benchmark weighted index fell 0.86 percent to
8,282.37.</P>
      <P>AsusTek announced a day earlier that it posted NT$12.47 billion (US$406 million)
in net profit for the first nine months of this year, with an earnings per share
(EPS) of NT$19.88.</P>
      <P>"The EPS is higher than the market consensus of about NT$15.00, " MasterLink
Securities analyst Tom Tang said.</P>
      <P>"Investors appear happy with the results. That's why the stock bucked the fall
seen on the broader market," Tang said.</P>
      <P>Tang said AsusTek is moving in the right direction by promoting its own brands
in the global market after spinning  off its manufacturing arm, Pegatron
Technology Corp., earlier this year.</P>
      <P>He said that as the PC production sector's gross margin has been squeezed badly
amid fierce competition, the spinoff has been a way for the company to boost its
bottom line.</P>
      <P>According to AsusTek, its gross margin stood at 13.9 percent in the third
quarter, up from 11.9 percent recorded in the second quarter.</P>
      <P>"I expect AsusTek's EPS will hit NT$24.00 for 2010," Tang said.</P>
      <P>The company said it ranked as the world's sixth-largest notebook computer vendor
in the third quarter and that it expects to rise one notch to fifth in the
fourth quarter and even grab the fourth-largest vendor position in 2011.</P>
      <P>Tang said that while there is some room for AsusTek's share price to go up,
investors had better stay alert to the prospect of strong technical resistance
as the stock moves closer to NT$280.00.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan was censured by the Control Yuan in September after the top
executives of some government-affiliated corporate bodies were found to receive
higher compensation than the country's president, who is paid NT$6.24 million
per annum.</P>
      <P>Examples cited by the Control Yuan included the presidents of the National
Health Research Institutes (NHRI)  and the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) , who get NT$8.41 million and NT$7.8 million, respectively. The
Control Yuan members said these top executives should not receive higher
salaries than the president or Cabinet ministers, because they have less to do.</P>
      <P>According to economic theory, however, a person's salary should be determined by
his or her contribution, or productivity. Those busy government officials do not
necessarily have any productivity. They are probably busy dealing with such
trivialities as cutting ribbons, giving  addresses,  attending  weddings  or
funerals,  and apple-polishing.</P>
      <P>In Singapore, a minister receives approximately NT$40 million in annual
compensation, which is 18 times the amount paid to a Taiwanese minister.
Because of such excellent  treatment for government employees, the Singaporean
government is able to attract the best talent to its ranks.</P>
      <P>Instead of seeking ways to raise the salaries for our ministers and thereby
attract talent, the Control Yuan is now trying to slash the salaries for the top
position-holders in the NHRI and ITRI, despite their potential contributions to
the country. This is what is called completely misplacing priorities. (Editorial

    <HEADLINE>Premier to visit eastern Taiwan Oct. 31 over Suhua Highway issue</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yi said Friday that he will travel to eastern Taiwan Oct. 31 to
brief residents there on the government's  commitment to upgrading the accident-
prone  Suhua Highway, one of the region's major traffic arteries.</P>
      <P>"I will visit Hualien and Taitung counties Sunday as part of my efforts to
dissuade residents there from traveling to Taipei the following  day to protest
what they  perceive  as government procrastination in launching the highway
upgrade project, " Wu said upon his arrival at the Legislative Yuan to attend an
interpellation session.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Executive Yuan Secretary-General Lin Chung-shen had contacted
Hualien Magistrate Fu Kun-chi and Taitung Magistrate Justin Huang to arrange his
itinerary.</P>
      <P>Wu said he will sincerely brief eastern Taiwan residents on the proposed Suhua
Highway upgrade project in detail and answer their questions about relevant
matters.</P>
      <P>"If Fu still insists on leading Hualien residents to Taipei to lodge a protest,
I will meet them at the Executive Yuan, too, " Wu added.</P>
      <P>Wu said earlier that the highway upgrade project will be launched as soon as it
has passed an environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>The project has been in the works for many years, but due to opposition from
activists over environmental and geological concerns, the project has remained
on the drawing board.</P>
      <P>The Hualien residents' protest plan came after deadly rockslides triggered by
torrential rain Oct. 21-22 on the scenic route that snakes along a cliff
overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The disaster left three dead and 23 others,
including Chinese nationals, missing.</P>

      <P>Walsin Lihwa Corp., a Taiwan-based copper cable and specialty steel maker, said
Thursday that it has signed an agreement to acquire a 49 percent stake in German
solar cell firm Solarion AG.</P>
      <P>Apart from the stake acquisition, Walsin Lihwa will also gain access to
Solarion's patents in copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) thin-film solar
cell production technology through licensing, according to the agreement.</P>
      <P>Based on the patent licensing, Walsin Lihwa will be able to independently
produce and market CIGS-based solar energy products.</P>
      <P>The investment will be carried out through Walsin Lihwa's wholly owned
subsidiary, Ally Energy Ltd., the company said.</P>
      <P>The total consideration of the transactions will be 60 million euros (NT$2.55
billion), while Walsin Lihwa is expected to receive 20 million euros as
subsidies from the city government of Leipzig, where Solarion is located, under
an incentive program to solicit foreign investment, the Taiwanese company said.</P>
      <P>Solarion, founded in 2000, established the first pilot production line of
flexible and highly efficient CIGS thin-film solar cells in Europe in 2002.</P>
      <P>Walsin Lihwa said it will work with its German partner to engage in CIGS solar
cell production and enter into development of the next- generation solar energy
technologies.</P>
      <P>In the first step, the two sides are planning to set up a solar cell plant in
Leipzig with an annual capacity of 20 megawatts in the initial stage, increasing
to 200 MW in the future.</P>
      <P>Construction of the new plant is expected to be completed in 2011 and commercial

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- Weapons are not key to cross-strait issue: AIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/29/10  14:40:02
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Continued engagement is the best guarantee for maintaining peace and stability
in the Taiwan Strait, the de facto U.S. ambassador in Taipei said Thursday in an
exclusive interview  with a local newspaper.</P>
      <P>"Weapons are not the key" to cross-strait issues, said William Stanton, director
of the Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), in the interview
with the United Daily News (UDN).</P>
      <P>On Taiwan-U.S. relations, Stanton confirmed that the two parties are discussing
an extradition agreement, which he said might be signed next year.</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's inclusion in the U.S. visa waiver program (VWP) , Stanton said:
"The truth is that we want you in."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he admitted that the United States is now in a dilemma over the
issue.</P>
      <P>The following is an excerpt of the UDN report about the interview published
Friday.</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>Stanton  reaffirmed  that  the U.S.  welcomes  cross-strait engagement. However,
he added, as Taiwan is a democratic country, it is up to the people of Taiwan to
decide the speed and direction of such engagement.</P>
      <P>Noting that quite a few Taiwanese people remain wary about the cross-strait
detente, evidenced by the results of a series of local opinion surveys, Stanton
said it is an issue that Taiwan's current and future administrations have to
address.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the U.S. government will sell F-16 C/D jet fighters to Taiwan,
Stanton said Washington and Taipei are divided over this aspect of U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In the safeguarding of national security, he said, military power is by no means
the only defense.</P>
      <P>Stanton said he doesn't think that any specific weapon system can be the golden
key to solve an issue. No single weapon system can solely change the whole
situation, he added.</P>
      <P>On the timing for the signing of a bilateral extradition agreement, Stanton said
his personal opinion is that it will take place next year.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that once the accord is struck, major Taiwanese fugitives with
U.S citizenship or green cards will be included on a list of people subject to
extradition.</P>
      <P>Stanton revealed that the U.S. government has been working very hard in
preparation for the signing of the extradition agreement and said that the
Federal Investigation Bureau and the Drug Enforcement Administration, for
instance, have been cooperating in drafting provisions of the accord.</P>
      <P>He said that both Taiwan and the U.S. have done a great deal to make the treaty
a reality, but noted that it is a very complicated issue. Besides differences in
the legal systems on the two sides, extradition also involves some sensitive
political issues, he added.</P>
      <P>Stanton pointed out that the extradition agreement must be approved by each
side's legislative branch. An existing bilateral judicial aid agreement was
approved by Taiwan's Legislative Yuan, but has not been sent to the U.S.
Congress for approval.</P>
      <P>Touching on Taiwan's aspiration to be included in the U.S. visa waiver program,
Stanton said it is not a political problem but a legal issue.</P>
      <P>He said the U.S. is facing a dilemma in that while the U.S. truly intends to
grant Taiwanese passport holders visa-waiver privileges, it also hopes Taiwan
can live up to the conditions set forth by the program.</P>
      <P>Noting that the VWP program has many requirements, Stanton said the major
hindrance to Taiwan's inclusion is its failure to demand that its citizens apply
in person for their passports.</P>
      <P>Last year, only 2.2 percent of the U.S. visa applications filed by Taiwanese
passport holders were rejected, far lower than the standard 3 percent required
to become eligible for visa-waiver privileges, Stanton said.</P>
      <P>The figure indicates that the visa rejection rate is not a hurdle to Taiwan's
VWP inclusion, he added.</P>
      <P>Citing media reports that human trafficking rings have smuggled Chinese citizens
into the United States by falsifying or tampering with Taiwanese passports,
Stanton said the problem is the absence of the requirement  that Taiwanese
citizens must apply for their passports in person.</P>
      <P>With cross-strait exchanges continuing to expand and the number of Chinese
tourist arrivals increasing significantly, the problem could become ever-more
serious, to the point that U.S. immigration officers will routinely suspect
incoming tourists with Taiwanese passports of hailing from China, Stanton said.</P>
      <P>The large number of human trafficking cases has led U.S. officials  to exercise
more caution than usual in immigration interviews with Taiwanese passport
holders, Stanton said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that it is normal around the world that people must apply in person
for their passports, Stanton said he hopes Taiwan will adopt the practice soon.

    <TEXT>
      <P>If the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) fails to retain its existing territory in the
coming mayoral elections in five special municipalities in Taiwan, "it means the
party has lost the battle, "the party's secretary-general said in a newspaper
interview published Friday.</P>
      <P>And if the party loses, he is the person who "should shoulder the whole
responsibility, " King Pu-tsung said in the interview carried by the Chinese-
language United Daily News (UDN).</P>
      <P>The KMT now controls Taipei City and Taipei County which will be upgraded into a
municipality after the Nov. 27 elections and renamed Xinbei City, as well as
Taichung City and Taichung County, both of which will be integrated into a
municipality following the elections.</P>
      <P>King explained that in the upcoming elections, "both political and practical
responsibilities fall on the shoulders of the party secretary-general."</P>
      <P>"From start to finish, from nominating (candidates) to handling campaign
affairs, it has been me who should be held accountable for defeat or victory, "
King said.</P>
      <P>This is because the position of the secretary-general of a political party is
like that of a company CEO, who is responsible for the company's success or
failure, he said.</P>
      <P>He added the party's chairman, President Ma Ying-jeou, has not involved himself
in campaign affairs for these elections.</P>
      <P>King also said in the interview that the percentage of votes garnered for KMT
candidates in the elections is less important than the number of mayorships the
party wins.</P>
      <P>King also criticized his opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
counterpart, Wu Nai-jen, accusing him of making inconsistent remarks about the
political responsibility of DPP Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen, who is also the
candidate for the mayorship of Xinbei City.</P>
      <P>Wu said that if Tsai fails to win, she should step down, but said later that the
chairmanship should be changed only if the DPP as a whole does not secure
victory.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, the DPP will need to take at least three cities before it can
claim success.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on the issue, Tsai replied that "of course the more we win, the
better." However, she did not clearly answer the question of whether or not she
will step down if the DPP only gets two seats, saying only that "it is an option
worthy of consideration, "the UDN reported.</P>
      <P>The DPP currently controls Kaohsiung City, Kaohsiung County, Tainan City and
Tainan County. Kaohsiung County will merge with Kaohsiung City while Tainan city
and county will be integrated into a special municipality after the elections.</P>
      <P>The municipal elections, considered a precursor for the 2012 presidential
election, will take place in Taipei, Xinbei, Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung
cities.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>For the past few months, people might have spotted a man standing on his head
taking photographs in places normally regarded as dangerous.</P>
      <P>The man is Huang Ming-cheng, a renowned stuntman and a dancer with the Lafa
Dance Company, who has been nicknamed "Mr.Candle" and who since March has been
traveling around Taiwan taking more than 1,000 pictures from his unusual vantage
point.</P>
      <P>"I have dreamed about standing on my head and taking pictures since the age of
13," said Huang.</P>
      <P>"I'd like to continue my project of standing upside down and taking photos all
over the world," he told reporters Thursday.</P>
      <P>The 27-year-old said he spent eight months working as a street entertainer to
fund the project that began March 13 in Pingtung County, southern Taiwan and
took him 20,000 km to spots all over the country.</P>
      <P>He would take his photos at locations such as near cliffs, on rocks in the sea,
on top of roofs, even on the back seat of a scooter. "You see things differently
when standing on your head, " he said.</P>
      <P>Sometimes the weather would be so bad that the wind would threaten to blow him
into the sea, but the moment he would stand on his head to take the photos, the
wind would drop and the mission would be accomplished, he said.</P>
      <P>Huang has taken about 1,200 photographs in this way over the past 150 days.</P>
      <P>He first came under the spotlight at the age of 13 when he won the first
international prize from the Chinese Wuqiao Stunt Games, one of the world's four
stunt events. He then studied stunts for stage and circus at National Taiwan
College of Performing Arts.</P>
      <P>He joined the Lafa Dance Company in 2008, an experience he described  as a
turning  point  in  his  life.  He saw  how choreographer/dancer Sheu Fang-yi
and Bulareyaung Pagarlava live their art, and he also discovered the possibility
of fulfilling his dreams.</P>
      <P>Huang, who was scheduled to meet with his fans at the Xinyi Eslite bookstore in
Taipei the following day, will present a circus drama in Pingtung Nov. 11-13 and
in Taipei Dec. 9-12. The drama is inspired by what he experienced during his
five-month journey.</P>

      <P>Taiwan share prices closed down 0.80 percent Friday on profit taking ahead of
strong technical resistance at around the 8,400-point mark, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The weighted index fell 66.96 points to 8,287.09, after moving between 8,278.72
and 8,348.39, on turnover of NT$106.59 billion (US$3.47 billion).</P>
      <P>The market opened down 5.66 points and moved upward to reach the day's high
before investors pocketed their recent strong gains, in particular posted by old
economy stocks, until the end of the trading session, dealers said.</P>
      <P>A total of 2,731 stocks closed down and 1,125 were up, with 280 remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>The plastics and chemicals sector suffered the heaviest losses, down 2.07
percent. Textiles fell 1.49 percent, cement stocks lost 0.93 percent, paper and
pulp shares dropped 0.81 percent and financial issues closed down 0.68 percent.</P>
      <P>The machinery and electronics sector lost 0.6 percent and the construction
sector fell 0.38 percent, while foodstuffs closed up 0.13 percent.</P>
      <P>"Investors seized falls in other regional markets as an excuse to cut holdings
amid fears of a major pullback ahead of 8,400 points, " Concord Securities
analyst Allen Lin said.</P>
      <P>The markets in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul witnessed losses in Friday morning
trade.</P>
      <P>"Investors have been watching closely to see how the U.S. Federal Reserve Board
will adjust its monetary policy in an upcoming policy making meeting scheduled
for Nov. 3," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin said that after the local bourse staged a recent significant rebound,
sentiment took a turn toward caution, so the latest downturn came as no
surprise.</P>
      <P>However, as the market remains awash in liquidity, the market is expected to see
some short-term support at around 8,200 points even if the correction continues,
Lin said.</P>
      <P>In the non high-tech sector, Formosa Plastics fell 2.77 percent to NT$87.80 and
Nan Ya Plastics shed 1.87 percent to end the day NT$68.20, while Shinkong
Synthetic Fiber lost 2.82 percent to close at NT$15.50.</P>
      <P>Personal computer vendor AsusTek bucked the downward trend on the broader

      <P>Three more excavators joined an operation at the 114.5-km mark of the Suhua
Highway on Taiwan's eastern coast Friday to search for a group of Chinese
tourists missing for over a week and feared dead beneath a landslide, a
provisional rescue operation command center said that day.</P>
      <P>The latest deployment brought to six the number of excavators working on a cliff
slope that searchers believed could be where a tour bus carrying 23 people,
including 19 Chinese tourists from Guangdong, might have been buried under rocks
in a landslide that occurred during torrential rain brought by Typhoon Megi the
previous week, the command center said.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Minister of the Interior Jiang Yi-huah reiterated that the
government has deployed a considerably high amount of manpower and equipment for
the search mission.</P>
      <P>"We will send out all we have, " Jiang said while answering reporters' questions
regarding an offer from China to help with the search.</P>
      <P>He noted that over 90 rescue personnel were working at the site that day. If
weather permitting, a further two excavators will be deployed, he added.</P>
      <P>"In an area no bigger than an elementary school playground, it is a big search
group, with a massive scale of personnel and equipment, as well as four sniffer
dogs," Jiang said. He added that there would be little point in making the group
much larger.</P>
      <P>The 19 tourists and their Chinese  tour guide have been unaccounted for since
the rockslide occurred Oct. 21-22.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, body parts found in the water off Yilan County in northeastern
Taiwan were confirmed as being the remains of a Chinese tourist in the Guangdong
group, identified as Gong Yen.</P>

      <P>Shares of TPK Holding Co. Ltd., a China-based touch panel maker more than
doubled its listing price Friday on the first day of trading on the Taiwan Stock
Exchange amid optimism toward the company's earnings outlook, dealers said.</P>
      <P>TPK, which was the second foreign company to make a primary listing on the local
main board, closed at NT$505.00, up from the listing price of NT$220.00, with
9.66 million shares changing hands, while the benchmark weighted index fell 0.80
percent to 8,287.09.</P>
      <P>TPK's production base is located in Xiamen, in China's Fujian Province, while
its management team is largely from Taiwan, the company said.</P>
      <P>It said touch panel technology applications are mainly used by handheld devices
and in particular mobile phones and smartphones.</P>
      <P>Both Nomura Securities and Barclays Capital called TPK, the world's largest
capacitive touch panel maker, "the king of touch panel", praising its lead over
its rival in production technology.</P>
      <P>Nomura Securities said TPK will ride the waves of strong demand for smartphones
and tablet computers to further boost its bottom line.</P>
      <P>Barclay Capital expected the TPK will see its earnings per share grow 52 percent
in 2010, 60 percent in 2011 and 17 percent in 2012, from NT$11.82 recorded in
2009.</P>
      <P>The two brokerages have given a "buy" recommendation on TPK.</P>
      <P>Grand Cathay Securities analyst Mars Hsu agreed, saying TPK has secured large
orders from Apple, HTC and Samsung Electronics and its earnings outlook appeared
convincing to investors.</P>
      <P>Hsu said TPK has been working with Apple, the company's largest customer, to
develop capacitive touch panels and enjoyed patent protection which few of its
rivals can match.</P>
      <P>"TPK's production yield rate exceeds 90 percent, leaving its competitors far
behind. It is not easy to challenge TPK's lead in technology," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he expects TPK's EPS for 2010 will rise to NT$20 and the figure will
rise further to NT$30.00-NT$31.00 in 2011.</P>
      <P>"The NT$220 listing price is too low to reflect the company's fundamentals," Hsu
said.  "That's why the stock staged such a strong showing on its debut."</P>
      <P>"There is some room for the stock to gain further," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu and Barclay Capital set a target price at NT$600 for the stock, while the
target price of Nomura Securities was NT$520.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Fair Trade Commission approved with conditions Friday the
acquisition of Kbro Co., Taiwan's largest cable TV operator, by Daniel Tsai and
his brother Richard, scions of one of Taiwan's richest families.</P>
      <P>Granting the conditional approval, the commission said it does not oppose the
Tsai family's acquisition of Kbro via the recently established Da-fu Media, but
it noted that the buyout will be restricted by 13 conditions to assuage monopoly
concerns.</P>
      <P>Topping the list of strings attached is that Da-fu Media cannot hold or acquire,
directly or indirectly, shares of any other cable TV companies or of Taiwan
Mobile Co., which is also controlled by the Tsai family, without prior approval
from the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
      <P>Daniel Tsai, chairman of Fubon Financial Holding Co., and his brother, who is
chairman of Taiwan Mobile, are buying Kbro from the Carlyle Group for a reported
NT$65.3 billion (US$2.13 billion), which will make them the most influential
cable TV group in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Da-fu Media was created to allow the Tsai family to get around a law banning
public ownership of media groups. Since Da-fu Media does not have any government
shareholders, it does not contravene the law, the National Communications
Commission (NCC) , the official media regulator, said in September.</P>
      <P>The Tsai brothers previously attempted to acquire Kbro through Taiwan Mobile,
but the NCC blocked the deal because the Taipei city government holds a 15
percent stake in Taiwan Mobile's majority shareholder, Fubon Financial Holding
Co., also controlled by the Tsai family.</P>
      <P>According to Fair Trade Commission spokeswoman Shih Hui-fen, once the
acquisition deal goes through, the number of households to which the Tsai family
can provide cable TV will not exceed 33 percent of Taiwan's total cable
subscribers, while the number of channels they own will not exceed 25 percent of
the total number of available cable TV channels.</P>

      <P>Planning to visit Britain but don't know where to find travel  information?  Try
the "Fun in the UK" Chinese-language blog maintained by the British Trade and
Cultural Office (BTCO) in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The blog, launched in March this year, features articles by BTCO Deputy Director
Margaret Tongue and five other staff members, providing information on travel,
shopping, food, culture and events in the United Kingdom to guarantee travelers
an authentic British experience.</P>
      <P>In a "British pub food guide, " for example, Tongue introduces readers to
popular British food besides fish and chips and shepherd's pie. According to
Tongue, sausage and mash as well as toad in the hole, a traditional dish
consisting of sausages in Yorkshire pudding batter, are also common items on UK
menus.</P>
      <P>Tongue also recommends her favorite streets in London. On the historic market
street of Lower Marsh, she writes, there is a knitting shop where people can sit
and drink some beverages.</P>
      <P>On Lamb's Conduit Street, a nurse's uniform used during World War I may be seen
inside the shop window of a publishing house. Also, Tongue says her decision to
come to Taiwan was made in a pub on that same street.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Bonbon, a Taiwanese BTCO staff who is one of the bloggers, shares her
experience during her five-year studies in London.</P>
      <P>Bonbon says in those five years, she often joined her homestay family in
watching EastEnders, a long-running TV soap opera that has been broadcast for 25
years.</P>
      <P>The series is set in the fictional borough of Walford in the East End of London
where many poor people and immigrants live. Because of the realistic depiction
of local life, Bonbon says she once thought Walford actually existed.</P>
      <P>She says watching the TV show helped deepen her understanding of British
culture, lifestyle and the country's racial issue and allowed her to learn a lot
of slangs that were taught in school.  The blog has received very good responses
from readers, who left messages saying that the information provided was both
interesting and useful.</P>
      <P>According to Christy Wang, head of BTCO's Communications Section, "Fun in UK"
has seen more than 37,000 visitors since its launch, with the number of visitors
now standing at around 9,000 per month.</P>
      <P>Besides Chinese-language readers from Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and
the United States, the blog has also attracted readers from 60 other countries.</P>

      <P>The U.S. dollar fell against the New Taiwan dollar Friday, dropping NT$0.042 to
close at NT$30.782.</P>
      <P>Turnover totaled US$727 million during the trading session.</P>
      <P>The greenback opened at the day's high of 30.824 and moved to a low of NT$30.551
before rebounding.</P>
      <P>Dealers said the local currency sustained its upward momentum from recent days
because foreign funds continued to flow into the local market.</P>
      <P>They said the market also was anticipating that the U.S. Federal Reserve would
loosen its monetary policy to boost the country's economy and further drag down
the value of the greenback.</P>
      <P>The selling in the U.S. dollar in the local market mainly came from foreign
banks and exporters, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The central bank again intervened later in the session to prevent too rapid of a
rise in the value of the local currency, they added.</P>
      <P>Thanks to central bank intervention, the Taiwan dollar has closed within a
narrow range of NT$31.07 and NT$30.73 to the greenback since Oct. 11, when it
first broke through the NT$31 barrier, despite rising to much higher levels
during trading sessions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HTC expects Q4 sales to hit NT$100 billion</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Smartphone maker HTC Corp. predicted Friday that its sales in the final three
months of the year would hit a record high of NT$100 billion (US$3.26 billion)
on strong global demand and eclipse the record it set in the third quarter.</P>
      <P>The company also anticipated that sales volume for the fourth quarter would rise
to 9 million units, also a record high, from 6.8 million units recorded in the
third quarter.</P>
      <P>At a quarterly investors conference, HTC said third-quarter sales totaled
NT$75.85 billion (US$2.47 billion), up 24.4 percent from the second quarter, and
net profit rose 28.5 percent to NT$11.1 billion, yielding earnings per share of
NT$13.61.</P>
      <P>Monthly production capacity at its northern Taoyuan factory reached 3 million
units at the end of the third quarter and was expected to rise to 4 million at
the end of this year to meet demand, the company said.</P>
      <P>Smartphones based on the Android operating system have become a hit in North
America and experienced growing demand in Europe, the company added, and it
expected that demand in Europe would act as a driving force in expanding the
company's sales from 2011.</P>
      <P>Investors also have high hopes that China will help HTC reap major benefits
after the company, one of the world's five biggest smartphone makers, launched
HTC branded handsets for the first time in July.</P>
      <P>In the near-term,  however,  the company expected  China's contribution to sales
would be minimal, but in the long-term, it expected to gain from the fast-
growing market, especially after establishing distribution partnerships earlier
this year with three major Chinese telecom operators -- China Mobile, China
Telecom and China Unicom.</P>
      <P>In the July-September period, HTC's gross margin stood at 30.2 percent, and the
company expects it will continue to maintain its gross margin at above 30
percent in the fourth quarter.</P>
      <P>TLG Asset Management analyst Arch Shih expressed doubts, however, that the 30
percent gross margin could be sustained  because accelerating price competition
in the global smartphone market has eroded cell phone makers' bottom line.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Online appeal for Suhua Freeway draws 16,000 endorsements</HEADLINE>

10/29/10  20:40:25

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 16,000 people have joined a Facebook  campaign  to support the
building  of a freeway in northeastern Taiwan to replace the existing Suhua
Highway, Hualien County's main road link to Taipei and northern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Facebook petition for a freeway, led by Huang Ting-ting, Huang Hsiao-jou and
Nico Chen, had 16,000 endorsements as of noon Friday after being launched last
week in response to accidents triggered by Typhoon Megi on Oct. 21.</P>
      <P>The storm's torrential rains caused one tour bus to go missing and led to
landslides that crushed at least two others, leaving three people confirmed dead
and 23 yet to be accounted for.</P>
      <P>Called "Give Hualien Residents a Safe Road Home, " the campaign urged the
government to build a freeway in place of the 78-year-old highway, a narrow
winding road perched above the Pacific Ocean, which the group said had left
thousands of travelers dead and many others injured.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has proposed upgrading the most dangerous stretch of the
highway -- by reinforcing the existing road or bypassing it with tunnels and
bridges -- rather than building a separate freeway.</P>
      <P>But the online petitioners described the plan as unrealistic because it would
still use the existing road.</P>
      <P>They  also  expressed  skepticism  over  a  proposal  by environmentalists to
develop a "blue highway" in waters along the east coast.</P>
      <P>With even naval vessels being battered there during inclement weather, who would
dare board a private ferry navigating in those waters, one petitioner wrote.</P>
      <P>In related news, Hualien County Magistrate Fu Kun-chi said Friday that if the
Suhua Freeway project had been carried out immediately after being planned in
2003, it would have been ready for service by now.</P>
      <P>The project was repeatedly delayed because of environmental concerns and
ultimately failed to pass an environmental impact assessment.</P>
      <P>Fu said that while the central government planned to upgrade the existing road,
it had yet to set a timetable, prompting the county government to organize a
protest Nov. 1 in Taipei to push for an early start to the renovation project.</P>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih urged Hualien residents Thursday not to make the journey to
Taipei in the current stormy weather, and said he will instead travel to Hualien
to meet them and address their grievances.</P>

    <HEADLINE>To leverage ECFA, Taiwan advised to 'de-politicize' relations</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The true benefit of a cross-Taiwan Strait trade pact was the momentum it
provided for Taiwan and East Asian economies to move toward regional
integration, scholars said at a symposium Friday, but they advised Taiwan to
"de-politicize" its relations to take the next step forward.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan can play a more effective role in the process of Asia-Pacific
integration by taking the path of de-politicization, " said Daniel Rosen,
adjunct associate professor of international and public affairs at Columbia
University, at a forum titled "Beyond ECFA: Taiwan and Regional Integration in
the Asia-Pacific."</P>
      <P>The symposium, organized by Taiwan's Institute for National Policy Research,
aimed to define Taiwan's future role following the signing of an economic
cooperation framework agreement (ECFA) with China in June to liberalize and
institutionalize cross-strait trade ties.</P>
      <P>Beijing's readiness to cease impeding Taiwan's links to other economies depends
in part on Taiwan's willingness to de-politicize the significance of those
external links, Rosen observed.</P>
      <P>If the function  of those links is to maximize  Taiwan's prosperity, then Taiwan
would be advised to sidestep Beijing's anxiety, the scholar said.</P>
      <P>Rosen also urged Taiwan to empower private enterprises and serve as a bridge in
Asia between East and West, grasping opportunities to deepen economic relations
across the Pacific and with Europe at the same time.</P>
      <P>The scholar did express some concerns over Taiwan's future course mainly because
of its internal situation, which he said seemed to "get more politicized every
year, and this is not good news."</P>
      <P>John Ravenhill, a political scientist at Australian National University, argued
that the ECFA would have at best a marginal impact on Taiwan's aggregate welfare
but said it would be significant in other ways.</P>
      <P>He believed the pact would affect the dynamics of negotiations on preferential
trade agreements among the four large economies of Northeast Asia -- China,
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The significance of ECFA may lie less in its contents -- or in its welfare
effects -- than in the momentum it will provide for the negotiation of further
agreements in the region, " Ravenhill said.</P>
      <P>"But whether  Beijing  will permit  Taiwan  to participate independently in
bilateral or region-wide negotiations remains to be seen," he added.</P>
      <P>Cho Hui-wan, a professor at National Chung Hsing University, said Taiwan's
government will face many challenges once the agreement takes hold.</P>
      <P>Liberalization means promoting competition and the elimination of weaker
sectors, which is why Taiwan should transform its economy from high-polluting
industries to innovative and value-added industries, Cho said.</P>

      <P>Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will come to Taiwan Sunday to attend
celebrations marking the launch of direct flights between Taipei's Songshan
Airport and Tokyo's Haneda Airport, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Abe, who served as the 57th prime minister of Japan between September 2006 and
September 2007, is scheduled to arrive aboard the maiden flight between the two
downtown airports, the ministry said in a press statement.</P>
      <P>The flights are considered one of the biggest achievements in bilateral
relations since Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou took office in 2008. In the
past, the two airports mostly handled domestic flights. The two sides are also
hoping to boost tourism. Currently, around 1 million Japanese people visit
Taiwan each year. Taiwan is hoping to increase that figure.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan sources said the previous day that Abe will meet with President
Ma and Taiwan's other political heavyweights during his two-day visit.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA statement, scores of other Japanese politicians, including
Naoki Inose, lieutenant governor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and
parliamentarians of the ruling Democratic Party of Japan and the opposition
Liberal Democratic Party, are also scheduled to fly to Taipei via maiden flights
of various carriers serving the route.</P>
      <P>The inauguration of the Songshan-Haneda flights is one of President Ma's major
policy goals, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The MOFA will co-host a cocktail reception with the Ministry of Transportation
and Communications (MOTC) at noon next Monday to celebrate the event, with the
participation of about 300 dignitaries and well-wishers from both countries.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOTC's Civil Aeronautics Administration will host a celebration
ceremony at Songshan Airport on Oct. 31 while the Tourism Bureau will also stage
a welcoming event at the airport the same day, according to the statement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile,  Taiwan's representative office and the Japanese Interchange
Association, a quasi-official organization authorized to handle Taiwan-Japan
exchanges in the absence of diplomatic ties, will also co-organize a celebration
party in Tokyo Monday evening, the statement added.</P>
      <P>On Sunday, 12 Japanese citizens bearing the surnames "Matsuyama" (meaning
Songshan in Chinese) and "Haneda" (meaning Yutien in Chinese) will travel to
Taipei via the Taiwan-based China Airlines' (CAL) maiden Haneda-Songshan flight
departing 7 a.m. for a one-day tour at the co-sponsorship of the Tourism Bureau
and the carrier.</P>
      <P>Besides attending the celebration party, they will also tour the National Palace
Museum in suburban Taipei and sample Taiwanese delicacies before returning to
Tokyo via a CAL flight scheduled to arrive at Haneda Airport at 9:55 p.m. that
same day.</P>
      <P>"The trip will allow the Japanese tourists to experience the convenience of one-
day travel between the two cities," said a Tourism Bureau official.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taiwan-grown 'honey angel' orchids gaining favor in Japan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's dancing-lady orchids have long been favored by Japanese flower
enthusiasts, but a new orchid variety called the "honey angel" is beginning to
win the hearts of Japanese consumers and could be the next export star of local
farmers.</P>
      <P>Orchids account for 78 percent of Taiwan's total flower exports, and the
dancing-lady orchid species, more formally known as "oncidium gower ramsey, " is
the main variety grown for export.</P>
      <P>About 21 million flowers of the species, or 90 percent of the exported
shipments, are sent to Japan every year, according to Council of Agriculture
(COA) figures, but the dancing lady may one day face a challenge for supremacy
from a young, more romantic upstart.</P>
      <P>Dancing-lady orchids, also known as dancing-doll orchids, are generally yellow
with chestnut colored stripes and look like a girl in ruffled skirts.</P>
      <P>The honey angel variety is also part of the oncidium genus but does not have the
chestnut stripes and has a pure yellow color to the naked eye.</P>
      <P>When seen under artificial light, however, it has a romantic fluorescent green
aura, earning its nickname "honey angel," said Chen Wen-chin, director-general
of the Taiwan-based Chinese Development Association of Oncidium Production and
Marketing.</P>
      <P>About 200,000 honey angels were exported to Japan last year, and Chen predicted
the total will soar to 2 million next year.</P>
      <P>He said Friday that he bought 1,000 potted "honey angels" from Japan five years
ago when the variety was relatively unknown in Taiwan, and then started selling
them to Japan during the winter at triple the price of the dancing-ladies.</P>
      <P>Drawn by the high unit price, more Taiwanese farmers began raising "honey
angels" and found the flower to be heat- and transportation- resistant and a
perfect fit for Taiwan's warm and tropical weather, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Once cut, the flower also can last for up to three weeks, a week longer than the
"gower ramsey" variety, making it a favorite in Japan.</P>
      <P>Chen said Pingtung County has become the center for honey angel growing because
of its excellent climatic conditions during the winter and spring, when the
flower is in especially short supply in Japan.</P>
      <P>The COA also plans to promote the honey angel orchid in China by leading a
promotional delegation of orchid farmers to several major Chinese cities,
including Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in December.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Acer Inc.,  the world's second-largest personal computer vendor,
announced on Friday that it would launch a series of tablet computers running
the Windows operating system next month to expand its mobile device offerings.</P>
      <P>"We are going to launch the Windows tablet computers in November and Android
tablet computers in the first quarter of 2011, " Acer Chairman J.T.  Wang said
at the company's  quarterly investor conference held in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Acer President and CEO Gianfranco Lanci predicted the company could achieve a 15
to 20 percent global market share in the tablet computer segment in 2011 based
on Acer's current 18 percent share of the global notebook market.</P>
      <P>The computer maker is hoping to cash in on the success of Apple's iPad in
recreating a market for tablet computers. Dell, Samsung, RIM (Research in
Motion) , and Hewlett-Packard have already introduced their own tablet models,
but Acer is likely to become the first Taiwanese manufacturer to launch a device
in the segment.</P>
      <P>The company is scheduled to introduce its first line of tablet computers on Nov.
23. The new mobile devices will retail for between US$299 and US$699.</P>
      <P>On the same day, Acer will also start open its online software "Next Generation
Store, " which is aimed at attracting developers to the platform and cooperating
with 10 to 20 telecom operators worldwide by the end of 2011.</P>
      <P>Acer hoped the new initiatives would sustain the momentum created by its strong
third quarter, when operating income set a record quarterly high of NT$5.28
billion, up 11 percent from a year earlier.</P>
      <P>The company expected fourth-quarter sales to rise 5-10 percent quarter-on-
quarter, and it projected that sales would grow another 10-15 percent and
shipments would grow by 25-30 percent to 55 million desktop and notebook
computers next year.</P>

      <P>A total of 176 taxi stands will be set up in the greater Taipei area by the end
of March next year in an effort to reduce carbon emissions and improve passenger
safety, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>With the additional taxi stands, fewer taxis will have to cruise around the
streets looking for passengers, and wasting gasoline while doing so.</P>
      <P>The taxi stands will also be in well-lit areas with security cameras -- mainly
in front of convenience stores -- which will improve safety for passengers, the
MOTC said. Passengers can also ask for taxi service at the stores, it added.</P>
      <P>The MOTC will ask the Taipei City and Taipei County governments to design signs
for the taxi stands and help find suitable stores with 24-hour video
surveillance and bright lights, it said.</P>
      <P>Taipei city and county are the first to take part in the program, since they
have the most taxi drivers, the MOTC said, adding that other cities and counties
can also take part in the program if it proves effective.</P>
      <P>In addition, the MOTC will also encourage taxi operators to add more taxi pickup
points to reduce the taxi vacancy rate.</P>
      <P>According to the MOTC, Taipei City currently has seven pickup points that can
accommodate 189 taxis, with some having monitoring equipment and security staff.</P>
      <P>As for Taipei County, it currently has seven service points with 24 parking
spaces.</P>
      <P>Taipei city and county have a total of 54,000 registered taxis, accounting for
around 62 percent of the total number of taxis -- 88,000 -- in the country.</P>

      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih vowed Friday to look into the alleged misconduct at the
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport after a lawmaker criticized the lax
management at the nation's main gateway.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lo Shu-lei of the ruling party Kuomintang said at a legislative
question and answer session that when tropical storm Namtheun hit Taiwan Aug.
30-31, the airport was on alert, but the Central Control Center was having a
party to celebrate the arrival of a new section chief.</P>
      <P>In response, the premier said he has turned over related information  from  Lo
to the Ministry  of Transportation  and Communications (MOTC) ,  which has
jurisdiction over the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) . The CAA oversees
operations at the airport.</P>
      <P>The premier  said  that he has asked  Transportation  and Communications
Minister Mao Chi-kuo to look into the alleged misconduct.</P>
      <P>Mao has promised to get to the bottom of the matter within a week, and if the
allegations are substantiated, personnel involved will be severely disciplined,
according to the premier.</P>
      <P>The premier said that after the poor maintenance of the airport came to light
earlier in the year, the CAA head and the director of the airport were replaced.</P>
      <P>If the Central Control Center were to show dereliction of duty, Wu said, he will
not tolerate it and will ask for efficient supervision and improvement.</P>
      <P>"Otherwise, we will not be able to face our people," he said.</P>
      <P>Lo first revealed in July that airport personnel were partying with alcohol and
food while on duty.</P>
      <P>In the previous month, a jet bridge at the airports' newer second terminal
collapsed.</P>
      <P>The airport was also widely criticized for dilapidated facilities and lax
management.</P>
      <P>The government has formed a task force to address all the grievances, which also
included poor and expensive food service.</P>

which it called the first of its kind in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Win Air, which relies on Gulfstream aircrafts, said it hopes to provide
increased  mobility for business executives  worldwide, especially at a time
when business between Taiwan and China is on the rise.</P>
      <P>"Business aviation has long been mature industries in Europe and the U.S. Yet in
Asia, these services are just taking off, " said Win Air President David Fei.</P>
      <P>The company currently operates two U.S.-registered aircrafts and recently took
delivery of a G550, which is the first business jet to receive Taiwanese
registration.</P>
      <P>Fei said the company hopes to increase its number of airplanes to 20 in five
years.</P>
      <P>The average fare of the charter flights, according to Fei, could range from
US$7,000 to US$10,000 per hour.</P>
      <P>Fei said that as Taiwan and China signed the economic cooperation framework
agreement (ECFA) earlier this year, Taiwan should also prepare to offer cross-
strait business aviation services in the future, noting that this type of
service will be in high demand.</P>
      <P>But while Win Air has made money on its missions to the U.S. and European
destinations, it is unclear whether it will make money from flights between
Taiwan and China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government has hopes that many Taiwanese business people currently
living in China with their families can move their families back to Taiwan and
fly to work in China in the morning and fly back home in the evening. But there
is a large number of direct flights on regular commercial airlines launched
between the two sides, and it is not clear if company executives would choose to
fly the much more expensive chartered flights offered by Win Air.</P>
      <P>According to the Cross-strait Air Transport Agreement signed in 2008, business
aviation is limited to non-commercial business missions. In other words, rich
people who have their own planes can fly between the two sides, but companies
cannot try to make money from flying business executives back and forth.</P>
      <P>So Win Air would not be able to make money from cross-strait flights for
business executives unless further negotiations take place between the Taiwan's
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations Across
the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) to allow commercial business aviation.</P>
      <P>The need to develop the business aviation industry in Taiwan, however, has been
recognized by the authorities.</P>
      <P>In September, there were 55 business flights taking off and landing at the
Taipei International Airport, said the airport's deputy director Chen Jau-yuh.</P>
      <P>As a proposed business aviation center is expected to start operations at the
Taipei International Airport next year, Chen said that Win Air, TransAsia
Airways and Sunrise Airlines have all shown interests.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the bidding process can start by the end of the year," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Gou's  company  Win Air says it believes  eventually  its cross-strait business
will make up 40 percent of its total business.</P>

      <P>The home team, which is now 3-1 in the semifinal round, will earn its chance at
revenge against perennial powerhouse Cuba in the title game if it beats the

    <HEADLINE>Ang Lee's new 3D film 'Life of PI' to be shot in Taiwan</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>New York-based Oscar-winning film director Ang Lee announced in Taipei Friday
that 70 percent of his new 3D movie "Life of PI" will be filmed in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The filming of the fantasy adventure movie is scheduled to start at the Shuinan
Airport in central Taiwan's Taichung City in January 2011," the Taiwan-born
director said at a news conference.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the same occasion, Government Information Office Minister Johnny
Chiang said he was very pleased to see Lee return to Taiwan with a production
crew to shoot a film after having worked abroad and achieved international fame
for more than a decade.</P>
      <P>"We hope Lee's new movie will help our film industry forge new links with the
international community," Chiang said.</P>
      <P>Lee said the idea of shooting the "Life of PI" in Taiwan came to him last year
when he returned to attend the annual Golden Horse Film Festival.</P>
      <P>"At first, I felt a bit uneasy because it will be an epic film with a grand
scale and will involve three tricky elements -- water, children and animals. I
was not sure then whether Taiwan would be an ideal place for location shooting,"
Lee said.</P>
      <P>Much to his surprise, Lee said, 20th Century-Fox Film Corp. decided to have the
film shot in Taiwan and India after an overall evaluation.</P>
      <P>In the past few days, Lee and a 150-member production team searched Taiwan for
suitable filming sites.</P>
      <P>"All crew members have a good impression of Taiwan, which left me feeling
flattered," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The film will be a 3D version of the novel of the same name by Indian writer
Yann Martel. It tells the story of 16-year-old Indian boy PI Patel's life story
of adventure, survival and faith after a harrowing shipwreck on his way from
India to Canada.</P>
      <P>The boy drifted in the Pacific Ocean for 227 days before reaching Mexico.</P>
      <P>As beaches in the Kenting National Park on the southern tip of Taiwan closely
resemble Mexico coasts portrayed in the prize-winning novel, Lee said he will
arrange for PI Patel to land at Kenting in the film.</P>
      <P>The filming in Taiwan will take place from Jan. 3 to the end of May next year,
Lee said, with the movie scheduled to be screened worldwide in December 2010.</P>
      <P>A 17-year-old Indian youth has been selected to play the role of PI Patel.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Male residents aged 15-45 living in a Yunlin County township near Formosa
Plastics' huge petrochemical complex were 1.7 times more likely than men in the
same age group around Taiwan to come down with cancer, a scholar said Friday at
a seminar.</P>
      <P>But Hsu Hui-tsung, an assistant professor in China Medical University's
Department of Health Risk Management, also found that women in Mailiao Township
in the same age bracket did not show any higher prevalence of cancer than their
peers in other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar organized by the Institute of Environment and Resources in
Taipei, Hsu explained that he based his study on data in research reports and
government statistics from 1996 to 2006 related to the health of people residing
in townships surrounding the complex.</P>
      <P>The naphtha cracker complex, covering the two townships of Mailiao and Taisi in
the central Taiwan county, was inaugurated in 2001.</P>
      <P>Hsu also found that compared with Mailiao, the cancer rate of all residents of
Wujie Township in Yilan County in eastern Taiwan, which was originally
designated as the site for the naphtha cracker complex in the 1990s, had not
recorded with any significant changes in the years covered in the study.</P>
      <P>The prevalence of cancer among men in the 15-45 age group in Wujie has even
trended lower, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>He did not speculate, however, on why men but not women showed a higher cancer
rate in the Mailiao area compared to the rest of Taiwan and acknowledged that it
was still too early to say the growing cancer rate among men was caused by the
Formosa Plastics complex.</P>
      <P>At the same seminar, Formosa Plastics said it conducted a study that suggested
that the air pollution from the complex did not have as big an impact on the
health of local residents as critics claimed.</P>
      <P>The company said it looked at the growth of lung cancer cases in the area since
the complex opened because lung cancer was more related to air pollution than
other forms of cancer, and found that there was a much lower increase than in
other parts of the country.</P>
      <P>According to the study, in the 10 years since the complex opened, the incidence
of lung cancer rose 5.6 percent in the Mailiao area compared to 59.8 percent
around the country.</P>
      <P>The growth rate in Mailiao was even lower than the 22.7 percent rise in new lung
cancer cases in Hualien County in eastern Taiwan, known  for its eco-friendly
tourism  and lack  of industrial development.</P>
      <P>The seminar was attended by more than 20 experts and scholars who presented
their studies and observations on the environmental impact of the petrochemical
complex.</P>
      <P>The Formosa Plastics facility has encountered a series of problems in recent
months, including two major fires in July and two reports of foul odor leaking
from the plant in September, which spawned public health concerns.</P>
      <P>Conclusions drawn at the seminar will serve as a reference for the government to
decide whether or not to give the plastics giant a green light to further expand
the complex's production capacity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>More than Matsu enshrined at new temple in Changhua industrial park</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/30/10  10:36:44</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>At first glance, there is little to distinguish the Changhua Coastal Industrial
Park from Taiwan's other manufacturing complexes. Towering power-generating
windmill turbines hover nearby, but the spaciousness of the 3,650-hectare
industrial park -- Taiwan's biggest -- seems to dwarf everything else, including
the factories that dot the wind-swept landscape.</P>
      <P>The park, however, has one relatively small oddity that could soon turn into its
most important landmark. A new temple devoted to Matsu, the widely worshipped
Goddess of the Sea, is currently under construction there, and the building's
structural frame has already been erected.</P>
      <P>The western coast of central Taiwan is peppered with Matsu temples, so the
addition of one more in the Changhua industrial park should in itself barely
cause a stir.</P>
      <P>This one, though, is unique, the only Matsu temple among hundreds in Taiwan
built almost completely of glass.</P>
      <P>Beyond that, however, it is intended to become a symbol of the resilience and
creativity of the country's glass industry, which had been eroded and nearly
driven out of Taiwan by cheap Chinese competition.</P>
      <P>"It will not just simply be a temple," declared Jackson Lin, the CEO of Taiwan
Mirror Glass Enterprise Co. (TMG) , the company that designed the glass temple
and has been working on it since 2007.</P>
      <P>If the temple aspires to become a shrine to the local glass industry, Lin could
be seen as its unofficial deity.</P>
      <P>Nicknamed "big brother" in Taiwan's glass sector out of respect for his
accomplishments in preserving the industry's presence on the island, Lin was the
driving force behind the creation of a glass cluster in the Changhua Coastal
Industrial Park, which now has annual sales of more than NT$20 billion (US$652.5
million).</P>
      <P>Lin's vision originated in 1998, when he received an order from IKEA that was
too big for him to handle. Instead of expanding his own factory's capacity, he
mobilized dozens of glass makers and other related wooden furniture and metal
component manufacturers to band together and supply IKEA and other clients.</P>
      <P>"If individual factories expand production to absorb rising orders, they face
the risk of having to maintain idle production lines once overall output
surpasses demand," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Though motivated as much by minimizing risk as by rescuing Taiwan's glass
industry, Lin's "cluster strategy" successfully kept many local producers at
home at a time when cost pressures had them thinking of moving offshore.</P>
      <P>To further promote the glass grouping, Lin also established a glass gallery in
2006 to serve as a marketing platform for between 140 and 150 local artists and
glass businesses around Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"My boss wanted to have a place where domestic and foreign buyers could see all
of Taiwan's glass brands and glass art creations in one trip," said Lin's
secretary Paggy Shih.</P>
      <P>And how does the glass temple fit in to the gallery?</P>
      <P>"You could call the gallery a data bank of information on the glass industry,
and the temple its concrete manifestation, " Shih said.</P>
      <P>The new temple, called "Hu Sheng, " will provide a place where people can
worship Matsu as well as two other important local deities -- Wangye and the
Land God -- but it also will showcase Taiwan's glass industry.</P>
      <P>The 1,000 square-meter glass temple, a copy of the historic Tianhou Temple in
Changhua County's Lugang Township being built at a cost of NT$70 million, will
consist of 70,000 pieces of glass from 132 glass makers and other related
manufacturers around the country, according to Lin.</P>
      <P>All of the temple's furnishings and ornaments, including the shrine and statues
of the deities, are made of glass, Lin said, a testament to the variety of
glass-processing techniques and glass art at which Taiwan excels. Only its steel
frame is being made of something other than the silica-based material.</P>
      <P>Among its special features is an inner wall shaped like Jade Mountain --
Taiwan's highest mountain also known as Yushan - that is composed of 1,400 hand-
crafted pieces of green glass.</P>
      <P>The temple's transparent walls also mean that when the sunlight slants through
the shrine, it will be bathed in colorful rays, Lin said.</P>
      <P>But perhaps the most enduring trait of the reproduction of one of Taiwan's
oldest temples may be how it embraces 21st century environmental principles.</P>
      <P>Its roof will be made of "miracle glass," an innovation conceived by Young Chin-
huai, an associate professor at National Taiwan University of Science and
Technology  and an expert in green materials.</P>
      <P>Named heat-insulation solar glass, this state-of-the-art material can deflect
harmful  ultraviolet  rays,  transform  heat into electricity,  and can clean
itself.  It will generate  enough electricity to power the temple's lighting
devices, Shih said.</P>
      <P>Other glass materials simulating common worshipping practices have also been
designed for the temple project to minimize pollution. LED lights, for example,
have been installed in glass incense and paper money to recreate the common
practice of making offerings to the gods.</P>
      <P>"The advantages are that these processes don't require cutting down trees or
pollute the air, " Shih said. "Visitors to the glass temple will also be able to
take the incense home with them as a souvenir."</P>
      <P>Lin's temple complex is expected to be completed in 2013, and he is proud of the
many values it represents - sharing, working together,  keeping the glass
industry's roots in Taiwan,  and preserving the environment.</P>
      <P>"Being able to share candles with others will naturally bring honor to oneself,"
the glass industry's "big brother" said. By CNA staff writer Elizabeth Hsu CNA

    <TEXT>
      <P>Political parties in Taiwan often need to gain the favor of specific groups such
as the elderly, ward chiefs, civil servants, farmers and fishermen in order to
win in elections. This is especially true with the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) ,
which owns huge assets that allow it to spend big in elections.</P>
      <P>The problem is once the party gives something good to a group, it has to keep
doing so or it will face the threat of the group switching its support to the
green camp. As a result, many reforms are grounded to a halt around the time of
elections.</P>
      <P>An example is a plan by the Examination Yuan to eliminate poor performing civil
servants, which would require that 3 percent of government employees be given a
"C" rating in a single year, with those receiving a "C" for three years to be
dismissed. After the plan drew a strong backlash from civil servants, the KMT
government dropped the ratio from 3 percent to 1 percent. This minimum ratio was
removed altogether when the plan was finalized and unveiled recently.</P>
      <P>In addition, some KMT legislators have suggested that civil servants be given
one or two days of "blind date leave" every year to encourage them to get
married.</P>
      <P>The government may win the favor of a small minority of voters with such
practices, but it will lose the respect of the majority. This also highlights
the government's non-credibility, cowardice and incompetence. (Editorial

      <P>A Chinese official urged Taiwan Saturday to continue its search for a group of
mainland tourists who went missing in eastern Taiwan during Typhoon Megi last
week.</P>
      <P>"Even if there is only a shred of hope, we hope 100 percent of efforts can be
given (to the rescue operation) , " said Zhang Shenglin,  deputy secretary-
general  of Beijing's  semi-official Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits, upon her departure from Taiwan to return to China.</P>
      <P>Zhang had arrived in Taiwan three days earlier to assess the progress in the
search for the missing tourists.</P>
      <P>Nineteen Chinese tourists and their Chinese tour guide who were traveling on the
Suhua Highway were reported missing immediately after landslides caused a
section of the highway to collapse on Oct. 21 due to heavy rain triggered by the
typhoon.</P>
      <P>One of them was confirmed dead Thursday, after her body part was recovered from
the waters off the coast of northeastern Taiwan and her identity determined
through DNA tests.</P>
      <P>Zhang said she was very thankful that Taiwanese authorities had sent additional
forces to join the search operation at the request of the families of the
missing tourists.</P>
      <P>She said after her departure, officials of China's Cross-Strait Tourism
Association will continue to stay in Taiwan to provide necessary assistance to
the families.</P>

      <P>Draws were held Friday to decide the numerical designations of the candidates
running in the Nov. 27 mayoral elections for Taipei City and four other new and
expanded special municipalities set to be created at the end of this year,
sparking hand-to-hand competition.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of campaigns amid the
approach of the municipal elections -- the precursor of the 2012 presidential
elections:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) is going all out to defend its rule over the capital
city, with a plan to mobilize 100,000 supporters to gather on Ketagalan
Boulevard in front of the Presidential Office on the last Sunday before the
mayoral election in Taipei City. "It's a Saving Private Hau battle, " KMT
members said, as Taipei Mayor Hau Lung-bin is struggling in defeat Su Tseng-
chang of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in a bid for
reelection.</P>
      <P>The DPP camp described the KMT's plan of holding a public parade from the Taipei
City Hall to Ketagalan on Nov. 21 as a display of the party's lack of self-
confidence in winning the election and its inner anxiety.</P>
      <P>Su said he will organize several campaign activities and visit local markets to
solicit supporters.</P>
      <P>Hau picked the No. 2 in the Friday draw, while Su got No. 5. (Oct. 30, 2010).</P>
      <P>China Times:</P>
      <P>The draw in the central Taiwan city of Taichung was completed in chaos and
arguments, with incumbent Mayor Jason Hu of the KMT getting the No. 2 and his
DPP opponent Su Jia-chyuan picking No. 1.</P>
      <P>For the event, Hu disguised himself as the Chilean miner Luis Urzua, who led his
fellow miners to survive when the group of 36 miners were trapped underground
for more than two months. Hu chanted a slogan that he will "lead Taichung to
walk into the light, letting the world see Taiwan."</P>
      <P>But the show drew Su Jia-chyuan's criticism, who described Hu as a "better actor
than mayor."</P>
      <P>During the draw procedure, Su Jia-chyuan's wife Hung Heng-chu had cast doubt on
the size of lots, fearing they might have been changed for Hu to get the best
number "1." The dispute was then resolved after Hu asked a city election
commission staff to draw the lot for him. (Oct. 30, 2010).</P>
      <P>Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>Candidates running in the upcoming elections in the five special municipalities
began battles at close quarters following the draws on Friday. Facing increasing
competition from the DPP, the KMT is using all-out efforts to secure its
grassroots supporters.</P>
      <P>As the countdown began, both the KMT and DPP camps were observed ready to throw
campaign activities to not just promote their candidates but also demonstrate
their determination to win more than half of the seats in the city council of
each of the five municipalities, which are Taipei City, Xinbei City (the
upgraded Taipei County) , Taichung City (the integration of Taichung city and
county), Tainan City (the integration of Tainan city and county) and Kaohsiung
City (a merger with Kaohsiung County.)</P>
      <P>According to the KMT's self-assessment and that by the DPP in the mayoral
elections in the five municipalities, the opposition is leading in the two
southern Taiwan cities of Tainan and Kaohsiung, while the DPP candidates in
Taichung in central Taiwan are catching up to the KMT frontrunner.</P>
      <P>In the capital and Xinbei in northern Taiwan, the KMT and DPP candidates are
meanwhile in a tug-of-war. (Oct. 30, 2010).</P>

    <HEADLINE>Taipei-Tokyo direct flights said to boost property market</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The launch of direct flights between airports in the downtowns of Taipei and
Tokyo slated for Sunday is expected to boost the property market in two areas
near the Taipei airport, according to real estate agents.</P>
      <P>Taipei's Songshan Airport will see its first direct flight carrying 90
passengers -- including former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe -- from
Tokyo's Haneda Airport on Sunday for the launch celebrations in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Property prices in the Songshan and Neihu districts near the Songshan Airport
have already seen price rises since direct flights were launched between Taipei
and Shanghai in June. With the new Taipei-Tokyo flights, property values in the
areas are expected to increase further, market analysts said.</P>
      <P>A local real estate agency said that the residential and commercial properties
in the two districts saw bigger value increases in September than other
districts in Taipei after the airport opened to direct flights from Shanghai in
June.</P>
      <P>"Since June, the transactions in the housing market and the business office
market in the Songshan district rose 6.05 percent and 4.49 percent,
respectively, last month, compared to those in May, " Bright Lee, a spokesman
for Evertrust Rehouse Co., said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The residential property market and the commercial market in the Neihu district
meanwhile  grew 0.68 percent and 6.91 percent, respectively, in September, from
May, he noted.</P>
      <P>"The growths (in both districts) were higher than those in the rest of Taipei,"
Lee said.</P>
      <P>He expressed  confidence  that the upcoming launch of the Taipei-Tokyo direct
flights will serve as another boost to demand in the two districts.  This
prediction came despite the central bank launching a series of tightening
measures since June on bank lending, to control soaring housing prices in
Taipei. The skyrocketing prices have raised complaints and fears that many local
residents are unable to buy homes.</P>
      <P>The average housing prices in Taipei fell 6.87 percent in September from May due
to the central bank's measures, according to Lee.</P>

      <P>Jeremy Lin, the first person of Taiwanese descent to make the roster of a
National Basketball Association (NBA) team, made his regular season debut with
the Golden State Warriors Saturday Taiwan time.</P>
      <P>The 22-year-old point guard -- the first Harvard graduate to play in the NBA in
57 years -- received a standing ovation when he entered the game with 2: 32 left
and the Warriors well out in front of the Los Angeles Clippers on their way to a
109-91 home victory.</P>
      <P>Lin did not attempt a field goal or dish out an assist in his limited
appearance, but he did register a steal, taking the ball away from Clippers
backup center Brian Cook with 47.1 seconds left to play.</P>
      <P>The Warriors turned the close game into a rout with a 32-13 third quarter and
led by as many as 20 points in the final period, giving Lin a chance to get game
experience.</P>
      <P>The 1.90-meter player, who did not play in the Warriors' 132-128 season-opening
win over the Houston Rockets, was kept on the team's roster to provide depth at
point guard behind starter Stephen Curry.</P>
      <P>Lin is behind both Curry and Charlie Bell on the team's depth chart at the
position, but when Curry suffered an ankle injury during the game, neither Bell
nor Lin replaced him. A group of small forwards filled in instead.</P>
      <P>Lin, who grew up in nearby Palo Alto, California, was not selected in the NBA
Draft in June but was signed by the Warriors to a two-year contract after his
strong performance in the summer league.</P>
      <P>His parents emigrated to the United States from Taiwan in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>Lin has already become a celebrity in Taiwan, a status cemented during a trip to
Taipei in late July for a charity game featuring NBA players. The July charity
game was organized by Chinese All-Star center Yao Ming, who plays for the
Houston Rockets.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In a recent interview with the United Daily News, William Stanton, director of
the Taipei Office of the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) , said a U.S.-Taiwan
extradition agreement might be signed next year.</P>
      <P>He also said the United States hoped to include Taiwan in its visa-waiver
program and that bilateral talks under the Trade and Investment Framework
Agreement would be resumed in December.</P>
      <P>This seemed to be the first time that a "timetable" has emerged with regard to
the signing of an extradition agreement, an issue that was delayed by the United
States because of possible opposition from China. With relations improving and
judicial cooperation increasing across the Taiwan Strait, it is reasonable that
the United States takes advantage of the opportunity to promote the agreement
with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Also in the interview, Stanton proposed that Taiwan seek to strengthen its
capacity to conduct non-military engagement with neighboring countries.</P>
      <P>This is a goal that Taiwan must work hard to achieve and also an area where the
United States can provide Taiwan with the greatest help. (Editorial abstract --

      <P>Taiwan made two minor adjustments to its 24-man roster for the Asian Games
baseball tournament in November, replacing two players who perform
professionally in Japan.</P>
      <P>Right-handed pitcher Lo Chin-lung and infielder Kuo Yen-wen were added to the
roster to replace Seibu Lions pitcher Hsu Ming-chieh and Nippon-Ham outfielder
Yang Tai-kang, according to national team manager Yeh Chih-hsien in Taichung
City, where Taiwan is currently competing in the 2010 Intercontinental Cup.</P>
      <P>Lo, who plays for the Triple-A team of the Colorado Rockies, was added because
of his stellar play in the Intercontinental Cup, Yeh said. Yang withdrew from
the team because of an elbow injury sustained during the Japanese professional
baseball season.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which won the baseball gold medal at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha,
Qatar, was left with only three outfielders following the roster changes.</P>
      <P>But Yeh said he was more concerned with the infield defense and believed  that
several  players  on the team could double as outfielders.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will not field any players currently active at the Major League level in
the United States, but eight members of the team play in the minor leagues, and
one (Kuo Yen-wen) played in the Cincinnati Reds' organization before being
released recently.</P>
      <P>The Asian Games will take place in Guangzhou, China, Nov. 12-27. The baseball
competition is scheduled for Nov. 13-19.</P>
      <P>The complete 24-man roster (with team affiliation in parentheses) after the
changes is as follows:</P>
      <P>Pitchers (10) : Cheng Hung-wen (Chicago Cubs) , Yang Yao-shun (Softbank Hawks) ,

      <P>A "pink carnival" held Saturday to raise breast cancer awareness drew a strong
turnout and raised money to support breast cancer education among younger women,
who are increasingly at risk of suffering from the disease.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,552 breast cancer survivors from 35 different charities attended
the carnival, and a special mammography car on-site was kept busy during the
day, according to Lin Wei-chieh, the secretary-general of the Taiwan Breast
Cancer Alliance (TBCA) , the event's organizer.</P>
      <P>"The response was sensational, " said Lin, carrying a pink backpack and holding
a pink umbrella in the rain. She said 40 people had signed up to have a
mammography done on-site just two hours into the event at Sun Yat-sen Memorial
Hall.</P>
      <P>Sixty-nine booths selling merchandise such as pink brooches, cupcakes with pink
ribbon icing, and even pink bras were busy trying to raise money to support the
TCBA's efforts to raise awareness of the disease, especially among younger
women.</P>
      <P>Lin said women in Taiwan were being stricken with the disease at a younger age
than women in other parts of the world and needed to pay attention to it earlier
than in the past.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the peak ages at which Taiwanese women get breast cancer are
45 and 55, 10 years younger than women in the West, and one in 10 local breast
cancer patients are under 40 years of age.</P>
      <P>Lin said her group reminds women 45 years and older to receive government-funded
mammograms each year and urges women above 35 to sign up for breast ultrasounds
to keep the disease at bay.</P>

      <P>Eight-year-old Yeh Chi-chang, the youngest inventor ever to represent Taiwan at
an annual invention show in Nuremberg, has made a splash with his innovative
pants designed to prevent the user from drowning.</P>
      <P>"I got the idea after seeing people on television drown while swimming at sea, "
said the Kaohsiung American School student at the venue  of the four-day  2010
International  Trade  Fair  for Ideas-Inventions-New Products (2010 iENA) that
opened on Oct. 27.</P>
      <P>Yeh's 11-year-old sister, Yeh Yi-you, was also present at the world's oldest
annual invention show and displayed a foldable and energy-saving lamp that can
also be used as a battery charger for cell phones.</P>
      <P>She designed the device to help people get through power blockouts, a common

that he often traveled to schools with invention classes to guide students in

      <P>A series of 15 earthquakes, including two with magnitudes above 4.0, hit
northeastern and eastern Taiwan over an eight-hour period starting late Friday
but did not cause any casualties, the Central Weather Bureau reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>The bureau advised local residents not to panic over the tremors because the
series of small-scale earthquakes did not imply that a stronger earthquake was
imminent.</P>
      <P>But Kuo Kai-wen, director of the bureau's Seismology Center, said residents in
hilly areas of Yilan County needed to exercise extra caution because the
earthquakes may have left the region even more vulnerable to mudslides after the
onslaught of heavy rainfall last week.</P>
      <P>The series of earthquakes that hit between 10: 34 p.m. Friday and 6: 21 a.m.
Saturday was centered in areas adjacent to Yilan's Nan-ao Township and Hualien
County's Hsiulin Township in eastern Taiwan, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>The epicenters of all of the quakes were close to each other, he added.</P>
      <P>According to the Seismology Center's records, nine of the earthquakes in the
series struck between 11 p.m. and midnight.</P>
      <P>The strongest one, a magnitude 4.4 earthquake, hit at 11:27 p.m. at a depth of
21.6 kilometers and was entered 19.4 kilometers south of the Nan-ao seismic
observation center.</P>
      <P>The tremor reached an intensity of 5 at scenic Taroko Gorge in Hualien County,
but lasted for only about 0.3 seconds, the Seismology Center said.</P>
      <P>A magnitude 4.2 earthquake also jolted northeastern Taiwan at 11:30 p.m. in
roughly the same location, according to the center.</P>
      <P>With the Nan-ao-Hsiulin area located where the Eurasian and Philippine Sea
tetonic plates converge, series of earthquakes often occur in the region, the
center added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Extra-inning loss keeps Taiwan out of Intercontinental Cup final</HEADLINE>

      <P>Taiwan lost to the Netherlands 5-3 in 10 innings Saturday, missing an
opportunity to vie for gold in the 2010 Intercontinental Cup baseball tournament
in central Taiwan's Taichung City.</P>
      <P>Mariekson Gregorius' two-run walk-off home run off Taiwanese closer Lo Chin-lung
in the bottom of the 10th inning clinched victory for the Dutch and sent them to
the title game Sunday against Cuba.</P>
      <P>Both Taiwan and the Netherlands tied for second in the six-team semifinal group
with 3-2 records, but the Dutch won the tiebreaker because of their victory over
Taiwan head-to-head.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will play for third place against Italy on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-sheng's RBI single helped Taiwan pull ahead 3-2 in the top of the first
extra inning, when runners were placed on first and second at the start of the
inning based on international rules to help decide games more quickly.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan's pitcher and catcher were suddenly out of synch in the bottom of the
inning as the Dutch scored the tying run on a wild pitch and a passed ball,
before Gregorius finished the host team off.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's manager Yeh Chih-hsien said after the game that the players did their
best, but he admitted there were problems at the plate and with player
chemistry, referring to the wild pitch and passed ball in the bottom of the 10th
and a base-running error that prevented Taiwan from scoring more runs in the top
of the inning.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was limited to six hits for the game while the Netherlands had nine.</P>
      <P>Taiwan rallied to tie the score 2-2 in the seventh inning on a Kao Kuo-ching
two-run double that chased Dutch starter Diegomar Markwell, who held Taiwan to
one hit in the first five innings.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's amateur left-handed starter Chen Kuan-yu, 20, yielded only five hits in
5 2/3 innings, but one of those was a home run by Curt Smith in the sixth that
increased the Dutch lead to 2-0.</P>
      <P>The Netherlands will meet undefeated Cuba in the championship game for the
second straight time. Cuba beat the Netherlands for gold in the 2006
Intercontinental Cup, which was also held in Taiwan.</P>

      <P>China's demand for medical electronic equipment and devices will be one of the
major topics of emphasis at a medical electronics forum that opens on Monday,
according to the Industrial Development Bureau, which is organizing the event.</P>
      <P>As part of the focus on the issue, one of the speakers at the two-day Medical
Electronics and Devices in Taiwan Forum will be Wang Dongsheng, the deputy head
of the China Association of Medical Equipment (CAME), who will discuss the
impact of China's health care reforms and the opportunities they present for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Those reforms have already increased demand not only for basic medical equipment
but also for advanced devices, said Chang Tsz-yin, an analyst with the Taiwan-
based Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) 's Industrial Economics
and Knowledge Center.</P>
      <P>In the past, Europe and the U.S. were the major markets for image-diagnosing
products, but demand for such products in the Asia-Pacific region have grown
significantly thanks to China's health care initiatives, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The analyst contended that Asia will soon become a manufacturing base for the
medical electronics industry because a growing number of international companies
have set up research and development centers in China and India and will likely
procure components in the region.</P>
      <P>Aside from discussions on China's market, experts from companies and
associations in China, the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany and Taiwan
will also talk about the latest market information, management strategies and
innovative applications at the forum, which is being organized by the Industrial
Development Bureau.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Disadvantaged people need health insurance coverage too: group</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A civic watchdog group called on the government Friday to eliminate a regulation
that stops health insurance coverage for those who fail to pay their premiums
when it considers its "second-generation" health reform program.</P>
      <P>Huang Ching-hsiang, an official with the Taiwan Healthcare Reform Foundation,
said the nonprofit organization often received complaints from poorer families
over their plight after their national health insurance cards were invalidated
because their premiums were overdue.</P>
      <P>The insurance cards must be presented at all health care facilities when seeking
treatment if patients want to have the cost of their treatment covered by the
national health insurance program.</P>
      <P>While many low-income households qualified for subsidies under national health
insurance guidelines and could maintain use of their cards, others unable to
afford the premiums were not so lucky, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He described the policy to void cards as violating the right to health care of
disadvantaged groups, particularly people living near the poverty line.</P>
      <P>Citing Bureau of National Health Insurance estimates, Huang said there could be
600,000 people this year who do not pay their premiums on time, with 230,000 of
them having their cards invalidated automatically and the other 370,000
qualifying for subsidies.</P>
      <P>Huang urged the government to reconsider the policy when it puts together its
second-generation national health insurance program, which is expected to take
effect in 2012.</P>

      <P>People intending to visit France should be mindful of their personal safety as
the French police have been tipped off to possible terrorist attacks, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The ministry's Bureau of Consular Affairs also advised local citizens to avoid
visiting areas near the G-20 Summit venue in Seoul, South Korea when the city
hosts the summit on Nov. 11 and Nov. 12.</P>
      <P>The bureau said in a statement that France's four-tier national security alert
system remains at the highest "red" level, which means the country faces threats
of major terrorist attacks and should have disaster-relief and counterattack
measures in place.</P>
      <P>Thus, those traveling in France or intending to go there soon should be on
alert, particularly when taking subways and trains or flying to one's
destination, the statement said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some South Korean activist groups are preparing to stage protests
when the G-20 summit takes place in their capital city, the ministry said.</P>
      <P>It urged local citizens to avoid traveling to the meeting venue when visiting
the country during the summit period because protest activities could turn ugly
or erupt into violence.</P>
      <P>The U.S. Department of State issued a travel advisory on Oct. 27 suggesting that
American citizens refrain from visiting Seoul during the G-20 summit.</P>

      <P>Twenty-five hundred disadvantaged students living in remote areas in Taiwan have
recently received a special gift from the Hon Hai Group -- an "electronic
schoolbag" designed to help them acquire digital skills.</P>
      <P>They were the first batch of students to be given the "schoolbag" by the
"Yonglin School of Hope," founded by the Yonglin Foundation to assist
disadvantaged children in strengthening their computer skills and supplement
their education outside of the classroom.</P>
      <P>Another 1,500 students of the school are expected to get the "schoolbag" --
essentially a portable computer with special functions -- by the end of this
year, the foundation said Saturday at a news conference.</P>
      <P>The donation is part of the foundation's efforts to reduce the rural-urban

      <P>The Yonglin Foundation is a charity organization established by the Hon Hai

      <P>Taiwan's plan to admit Chinese tourists traveling independently rather than with
tour groups will not be affected by the recent Suhua Highway tragedy in which a
Chinese tourist was confirmed dead and 19 others remain missing, a senior
negotiator with China said Saturday.</P>
      <P>"The tragedy was an isolated incident that will not affect the plan to open our
doors to independent Chinese tourists, " said Kao Koong-lian, vice chairman of
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), a quasi-official intermediary body formed
to deal with China in the absence of official ties across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"The two sides will continue negotiating technical details and the program will
be put into practice when the time is ripe, " said Kao after observing search
operations near a collapsed section of the scenic Suhua Highway.</P>
      <P>At present, Chinese nationals can only visit Taiwan for pleasure as part of an
organized tour, but the government hopes that relaxing the restriction will
provide an additional spark to the country's tourism industry.</P>
      <P>Kao said he was visiting the site on behalf of SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung to
express his respect and gratitude for the efforts of emergency search personnel.</P>
      <P>"We hope they will continue doing their utmost to search for the missing people
out of humanitarian considerations," Kao said.</P>
      <P>Responding to complaints by some relatives of missing Chinese nationals that
Taiwan did not mobilize sufficient manpower and equipment for the search, Kao
said rugged terrain and inclement weather hobbled the operation.</P>
      <P>"As a matter of fact, a large number of search and rescue professionals,
military SWAT team members, warships and Coast Guard vessels have taken part in
the operation," Kao said.</P>

Kao Koong-lian on the visit to the Suhua Highway, said the Ministry of Justice

      <P>Direct flights between the city airports of Taipei and Tokyo resumed Sunday
after a hiatus of 31 years, a major milestone in Taipei's ambition to become
part of a golden flight circuit connecting Northeast Asia's major metropolitan
areas.</P>
      <P>A total of 245 passengers, including incumbent Taipei City Mayor Hau Lung-bin,
set off on the inaugural  flight  from Taipei International Airport (Songshan)
to Tokyo International Airport (Haneda) at 7:30 a.m.</P>
      <P>"After our inauguration flight to Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport on June 14, I
believe Taipei City is ready to 'take off,'" Hau said at a ceremony at the
Taipei airport before the EVA Airways Airbus 330 departed.</P>
      <P>Hau said he believed the resumption of Songshan-Haneda flights, one of President
Ma Ying-jeou's major policy goals when he served as Taipei City mayor, would
transform the Taipei airport into a "capital-city business airport."</P>
      <P>The government has positioned the airport as a key link in a "Northeast Asian
Golden Flight-route Circuit" of city airports in Taipei, Seoul, Shanghai and
Tokyo that reduces travel time on the ground and helps businessmen get more done
in less time.</P>
      <P>By leaving from the city airport rather than from Taiwan Taoyuan International
Airport, travelers who live in Taipei can save up to 40 minutes in transit time
to the airport.</P>
      <P>Likewise, landing at Haneda Airport rather than at the more common destination
for international flights outside Tokyo, Narita International Airport, can save
travelers at least 30 minutes on the commute into Japan's capital.</P>
      <P>Taipei International Airport, which was once the country's only international
gateway, offered direct flights to Haneda until 1979, when Chiang  Kai-shek
Airport  opened  in Taoyuan  to handle international flights.</P>
      <P>Tseng Mao-pin, a 77-year-old retired umbrella manufacturer who lives in the
Taipei suburb of Yonghe, said he used to fly the Songshan-Haneda route on
business when he was young.</P>
      <P>"I'm excited to go to see my old friends in Japan again this time on the first
Songshan-Haneda flight, " Tseng said, explaining why he booked a seat on the
groundbreaking flight.</P>
      <P>Other travelers, however, said they were confused because they were more
familiar with Taoyuan Airport.</P>
      <P>Jennifer Chan, who traveled with 43 members of a mountaineering club in Taichung
City in central Taiwan, said they left home at 2 a.m. without knowing that their
travel agent had arranged for them to take the historic flight.</P>
      <P>"I still prefer Taoyuan Airport, not only because we have to spend more time to
come to Taipei than to go to Taoyuan" Chan said. "It's really too small here,
plus the ceiling is incredibly low."</P>

silver medal for his innovative swimming trunks capable of preventing swimmers
from being drowned.</P>
      <P>Yeh's instructor, Hsieh Wen-chan, a lecturer at Taiwan's National United
University, said creativity was primarily developed within one's family and at
school, and the earlier interest in inventing was nurtured, the better.</P>
      <P>Hsieh also contended that Taiwan, which possesses limited natural resources and
faces stiff global competition, would have only a limited economic future if it
relied only on OEM production.</P>
      <P>"Only through innovation can Taiwan create another economic miracle," he
stressed.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu Chih-hsin, a teacher at Catholic Kung Tung Technical Senior High
School in Taitung County, eastern Taiwan, who led his students to the venerable
Nuremberg show for the first time, said he guides his students to create
inventions that have practical applications in everyday life.</P>
      <P>The high school won three medals at the exhibition, including a gold medal for a
hair dryer capable of vacuuming dust and other particles.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a technology to remove heavy metals from the fumes and dust
discharged by garbage incinerators -- developed by National United University
professor Chang Kun-sen -- won a gold medal and an environmental protection
award from the International Federation of Inventors' Associations.</P>
      <P>A thrilled Chang said his new technology, which has been awarded patents by five
countries, could forge a new future for Taiwan in eco-friendly waste management.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Surnames earn 12 lucky Japanese free Tokyo-Taipei flights</HEADLINE>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Twelve Japanese nationals with the same names as the names of city airports in
Taipei and Tokyo were flown for free between the two cities on Sunday to
celebrate the resumption of direct flights between the two gateways after a
31-year hiatus.</P>
      <P>The promotion, co-sponsored by Taiwan's Tourism Bureau and China Airlines,
offered the passengers surnamed "Matsuyama" (or Songshan in Chinese) and
"Haneda" free same-day round-trip travel between Haneda Airport in Tokyo and
Songshan Airport in Taipei and a day tour in Taiwan's capital city.</P>
      <P>The China Airlines flight that left Haneda Airport at 7 a.m. was the first to
fly from the Tokyo city airport to the Taipei city airport since 1979, when
international flights serving Taiwan were moved to newly opened Chiang Kai-shek
Airport (now called Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport).</P>
      <P>Keiko Matsuyama, a 37-year-old businesswoman, said she felt "amazed" to learn
that her last name had the same characters as the Taipei airport, and she was
eager to enjoy her day in the city.</P>
      <P>"I am looking forward to having a massage and some hsiaolungpao (steamed
dumplings)," she said.</P>
      <P>Matsuyama also praised the Taipei airport -- now formally known as Taipei
International Airport -- for its advantageous downtown location and quick
service compared to Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport, saying it took only
five minutes for her luggage to be delivered.</P>
      <P>Matsuyama and her fellow lucky travelers were scheduled to return to Tokyo on a
flight departing from Songshan Airport at 6: 15 p.m. Sunday evening.</P>
      <P>Another 24 Tokyo metropolitan councilors were also on the China Airlines flight
from Haneda and will visit the Taipei City Council and the Presidential Office
during a three-day trip.</P>
      <P>The new flight route is expected to stimulate business travel between the two
cities by saving travel time on the ground and baggage pick-up time at the
airport.</P>
      <P>Commutes from downtown areas to the two cities' more common international
gateways -- Taoyuan International Airport and Narita International Airport --
take about 30 minutes more than to the city airports.</P>
      <P>A total of 56 round-trip flights per week between Songshan and Haneda airports
will be offered by four carriers -- China Airlines (CAL) , EVA Airways, Japan
Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA).</P>
      <P>They said round-trip fares will be roughly NT$14,000 (US$454) , with stays of up
to 30 days allowed.</P>
      <P>According to the Tourism Bureau, 780,000 Japanese travelers visited Taiwan
between January and September, 19.45 percent more than the same period last
year.</P>
      <P>During the same period, 1 million Taiwanese travelers visited Taiwan, a 26
percent year-on-year rise.</P>
      <P>To promote 2010-2011 Taiwan-Japan tourism exchange year, the authorities
concerned said they hope to increase the number of people traveling between the
two countries annually from the current 2 million people to 3 million.</P>

    <HEADLINE>China Times: Broadband infrastructure lag could be fatal</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/31/10  16:50:20
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's lack of urgency in the development of wireless broadband infrastructure
compared to other major Asian economies could lead to a national crisis
involving a cultural collapse.</P>
      <P>Some have blamed the partially state-owned Chunghwa Telecom for causing Taiwan
to lag behind Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea in WiMAX wireless broadband
communication development because it charges unreasonably high fees to system
operators.</P>
      <P>In fact, however, wireless broadband infrastructure development is not simply a
function of Chunghwa Telecom's profits. It is a matter of Taiwan's overall
digital policy.</P>
      <P>Once we lag behind our Asian competitors in the sectors of filmmaking,
television,  information technology (IT) ,  e-book, e-commerce, IT security and
cloud computing and storage, Taiwan will face a crisis involving the collapse of
culture.</P>
      <P>The Encyclopedia Britannica, even with its unarguable authority and veracity,
has been replaced by Microsoft's online counterpart based on Encarta, a former
nobody in the dictionary industry. Microsoft won because its encyclopedia is
globally accessible online, free of charge.</P>
      <P>Wikipedia's story is even more telling. It proved that "the one who controls
digital platform hardware controls the digital content industry."</P>
      <P>Taiwan is an IT giant, with a solid academic and industrial foundation. If the
country were to fail to grasp the opportunity to accelerate the development of
the IT industry -- Taiwan's only advantage -- it would not only fall behind in
industrial growth but also risk losing its culture. (Editorial abstract -- Oct.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's busiest international airport will open a new era Monday when it
becomes a state-run company, a move aimed at enhancing the airport's efficiency
and improving an image tarnished by repeated glitches and heavy criticism of its
services.</P>
      <P>Instilling a "business management spirit" through the airport's corporatization
is one of the ways the government hopes to enhance the airport's management and
develop the facility's adjacent areas, the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications said in a statement Saturday.</P>
      <P>The airport, which has been a government agency since it opened in 1979, has
suffered repeated malfunctions in recent months, including leaky bathrooms,
defective jetways, and a breakdown of the automatic baggage handling system.</P>
      <P>Chang You-hern, the convener of a government task force aimed at improving the
airport's services, has said the government would make the airport one of the
world's top 10 airports within three years. It currently ranks 27th in the
world.</P>
      <P>The ministry will hold a ceremony on Monday to mark the formation of the new
company, which it said was the result of a government plan in 2009 to reform the
airport.</P>
      <P>The government will also invest NT$67 billion (US$2.2 billion) in the
construction of a third terminal for the airport, slated to be completed by
2018.</P>
      <P>By that time, the airport will serve 75 million passengers per year, with the
third terminal able to handle 43 million of them, the ministry projected.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT)  Legislator Tsao Erh-chang recently expressed
skepticism, however, over the ministry's projections, noting that the
international airport has handled only 24 million travelers so far this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>Talk of the day -- KMT, DPP keep to strongholds in elections: polls</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>10/31/10  17:28:05
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With mayoral elections in five special municipalities fast approaching, polls
have shown that candidates from the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) remain strong in places where they are
favored, despite efforts by their opponents to reverse the momentum.</P>
      <P>The following are excerpts from local media coverage of their latest polls on
the Nov. 27 races -- widely seen as a bellwether of the 2012 presidential
election:</P>
      <P>United Daily News:</P>
      <P>The UDN's survey found little change in Taichung municipality (which merges
Taichung City and Taichung County) from a similar poll conducted two months ago.</P>
      <P>Some 52 percent of respondents still expected incumbent Taichung Mayor Jason Hu,
the KMT candidate, to win the election compared with 13 percent who said Hu's
DPP rival, Su Jia-chyuan, would win. The remaining 35 percent said they could
not predict the outcome.</P>
      <P>If the election were held tomorrow, Hu would get 49 percent of the vote,
compared with Su's 31 percent, with 20 percent still undecided. The survey
showed that support for both had risen, as the ratio of undecided voters had
fallen to 20 percent from 32 percent in the previous survey.</P>
      <P>Further analysis showed that in Taichung City, respondents backed Hu over Su by
a 55 percent to 29 percent margin, while in Taichung County, Hu had a 45-32
edge.</P>
      <P>In terms of age, Su's popularity among voters over 60 was on par with Hu's, but
in all other age groups, Su lagged behind Hu by at least 14 percentage points.</P>
      <P>In addition, although both were found to be equally effective in galvanizing
voters of their own parties,  Hu was favored by independent voters.</P>
      <P>The survey also used statistical models to predict who the poll's undecided
respondents would back. After including those estimates, the conclusion was that
if the election were held tomorrow, Hu would get 56 percent of the vote to Su's
44 percent. (Oct. 31, 2010) China Times:</P>
      <P>Hu on Thursday dressed himself as Chilean mining foreman Luis Urzua -- who led
his fellow miners to safety after the group was trapped underground for more
than two months -- when he drew lots to get his numerical designation as a
mayoral candidate.</P>
      <P>Four out of the 32 "miners" who accompanied Hu at the event later showed up at
Su's campaign activity Friday.</P>
      <P>The four said they did not know that they were to campaign for Hu, and that they
stumped for Su because they wanted to be "true" to their political stance.</P>
      <P>One of the four, identified by his surname Liao, said he is a carpenter and when
a labor union official asked if he would like to get NT$600 to campaign for a
candidate, he agreed without bothering to check the name of the candidate he was
to back.</P>
      <P>Hu's camp said three of the four who allegedly supported Su were not the same
people who joined Hu on Thursday, and it was still checking the identity of the
fourth person. The camp said it wanted to get to the bottom of the "defection"
issue to see who was lying.</P>
      <P>Su's camp responded by saying that it welcomed the probe by Hu's camp.</P>
      <P>Hu said it was normal in a democratic society to support different candidates,
and he asked that the four not be given a hard time. He also joked, "if they had
really stayed with me for 69 days underground to get to know who I am, I'm
confident they would give me their full support."</P>
      <P>Su said that if Hu's posing as a foreman was to symbolize leading the city out
of all of its difficulties, he wanted to ask if all the problems were not in
fact the results of Hu's performance in his nine years as mayor. (Oct. 31, 2010)
Liberty Times:</P>
      <P>A survey showed that if voters were to go to polls tomorrow, incumbent Kaohsiung
City Mayor Chen Chu of the DPP would get 43.27 percent support, compared with
18.52 percent for incumbent Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang Chiu-hsing and 7.8
percent for KMT candidate Huang Chao-hsun.</P>
      <P>But it is noteworthy that 30.41 percent have yet to express their opinion.</P>
      <P>In view of the past two Kaohsiung mayoral and magistrate elections in which pro-
KMT pan-blue candidates received over 40 percent of the votes, the poll presumed
that the undecided voters would favor the KMT, meaning the support rate for the
candidates trailing in the poll should be higher than the figures shown.</P>
      <P>Chen's camp said that although the mayor leads her rivals by big margins, she
will not let down her guard.</P>
      <P>Huang's camp said that Huang truly wants to serve the people, a point that the
voters will show they recognize on Election Day.</P>
      <P>Yang's camp believed the Kaohsiung election would end up as a two-horse race
between Chen and him. It said that with up to 30 percent of voters undecided,
more than half of the electorate could oppose Chen. (Oct. 31, 2010)</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>On a day when flights between the city airports of Taipei and Tokyo resumed
after a 31-year hiatus, around 50 aviation union workers gathered outside the
Taipei airport to protest what they called the illegal dismissal of 70 workers
by Japan Airlines (JAL) in July.</P>
      <P>The protesters, holding cardboard signs with slogans such as "Butcher of East
Asia" and "Taiwan is no longer a colony of Japan, " accused JAL of being
contemptuous of Taiwanese people and the employees' working rights.</P>
      <P>"We can't understand why JAL only bullied Taiwanese workers but was afraid to
lay off staff in China, " said protester Lin Chia-wei. "It's a clear sign that
this Japanese company despises Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Four protesters even broke through police lines and ran toward visiting Tokyo
metropolitan councilors during a welcoming ceremony after the arrival of their
historic flight at Taipei International Airport (Songshan Airport) from Tokyo
International Airport (Haneda Airport).</P>
      <P>The protesters hoped to appeal their case to the councilors, but they were
forced away by the police.</P>
      <P>The layoffs were part of a plan by JAL to reduce its global work force by a
third this year as part of a restructuring plan after filing for bankruptcy in
January.</P>
      <P>The protesters also expressed anger at the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) for
not standing up for them even though Taipei City's Department of Labor ruled the
JAL layoffs illegal on Oct. 19, but they did not specify how the layoffs broke
Taiwan's labor laws.</P>
      <P>"We urge the Japanese government to take this issue seriously for the sake of
harmonious bilateral relationships between Taiwan and Japan," said Yang Shao-
yung, the chairman of the aviation union.</P>
      <P>The protesters, who rallied outside the CLA and Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) earlier this month, said they would continue their campaign until Sunday
afternoon, when former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was scheduled to
arrive.</P>
      <P>Abe, in Taiwan on a two-day trip, is expected to meet with President Ma Ying-

      <P>Taiwan suffered its second heartbreaking loss in two days Sunday, a 4-3 defeat
to Italy, to finish fourth in the 2010 Intercontinental Cup baseball tournament
in Taichung</P>
      <P>The game was not decided until Taiwan's final at-bat, when, trailing by a run,
it loaded the bases with two outs. But Kao Kuo-ching could not bring the tying
run home, being thrown out at first after hitting a weak grounder to the
pitcher.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Taiwan missed out on playing in the tournament's title game when it
lost to the Netherlands 5-3 on a two-run walk-off home run.</P>
      <P>Italy, whose third place finish was its best showing ever at the
Intercontinental Cup, set the tone early when it took advantage of two errors by
the home team and stole a base to jump to a 2-0 lead.</P>
      <P>Taiwan added a run in both the first and second inning to tie the game, but
Italy answered with timely hits and took a 4-2 lead into the bottom of the
seventh inning.</P>
      <P>Taiwan cut the deficit to 4-3 in the bottom of the inning, setting up the tense
finish.</P>
      <P>Taiwan manager Yeh Chih-hsien apologized to Taiwan's baseball fans in a
televised post-game interview, saying the team "had let the fans down and didn't
get the job done."</P>
      <P>He also said Taiwan's 12-6 advantage in the hit column was misleading.</P>
      <P>"Our lineup failed to put together consecutive hits. Seven of our 12 hits came
from only two batters, the second and fourth batters in our lineup," Yeh
lamented.</P>
      <P>Taiwan failed to duplicate its third place finish in the previous
Intercontinental Cup, when the tournament was also held in Taiwan in 2006.</P>
      <P>In other games, Japan beat South Korea 2-1 at Douliou Baseball Stadium in the
central city of Douliou, Yunlin County, on Sunday to finish fifth in the 10-team
tournament.</P>
      <P>Nicaragua, the Czech Republic, Thailand and Hong Kong finished the tournament in
the seventh to 10th spots.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Wu Den-yih promised Hualien County residents on Sunday that the project
to upgrade the Suhua Highway -- the county's main road link to Taipei and
northern Taiwan -- will start as soon as an environmental impact assessment
(EIA) is passed.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) had made NT$500
million (US$16.23 million) available to fund the first year of construction, and
he vowed to push the project through even if the funding were insufficient.</P>
      <P>He stressed, however, that the plan could only begin after the environmental
impact assessment  was approved  by a panel of specialists, because if he
ordered an earlier start, he would be violating the law.</P>
      <P>Wu was in Hualien County with a delegation of officials from the MOTC, the
Council of Agriculture and the Research, Development and Evaluation Commission
to try and stave off a rally by county residents in Taipei planned for Monday to
push for an early start to the highway project.</P>
      <P>But following the premier's visit, Hualien County Magistrate Fu Kun-chi said the
rally would be held as planned, arguing that an able government would not shift
responsibility for an infrastructure project to an environmental impact
assessment.</P>
      <P>"All the governments of other nations make their own decisions on the
development of major highways, and EIA panels serve only to tell the governments
how should the roads be built," Fu argued.</P>
      <P>After visiting Hualien, Wu and his entourage proceeded to Taitung County to
address residents' concerns over the lack of road access to their remote county
on Taiwan's southeastern coast.</P>
      <P>The premier promised Taitung County residents that a project to upgrade the
mountainous Southern Link Highway -- Taitung County's main link to western
Taiwan connecting Taimali Township in the east and Fonggang Township in the west
-- would begin in 2011, one year ahead of schedule.</P>
      <P>The highway improvement project is expected to be completed by 2017 at a cost of
NT$16.8 billion, Wu said.</P>

      <P>Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe flew into Taiwan on Sunday for a two-
day visit, taking advantage of the first direct flights between Taipei's
Songshan Airport and Tokyo's Haneda Airport since 1979.</P>
      <P>Abe, Japan's prime minister between September 2006 and September 2007, said upon
his arrival at the Taipei city airport that he was extremely happy that the
resumption of Songshan-Haneda flights -- one of the policies he pushed while in
power -- had finally been achieved.</P>
      <P>When asked about relations among Taiwan, China and Japan, Abe responded briefly
that Japan-Taiwan ties have always been very friendly and he hoped that
triangular relations would remain amicable and constructive.</P>
      <P>After making stops around Taipei during the afternoon, Abe met on Sunday evening
with President Ma Ying-jeou, who also pushed for the direct flights between the
Taipei and Tokyo city airports while serving as Taipei mayor until late 2006.</P>
      <P>Flights between the two airports ended 31 years ago when Taiwan's international
flights were moved to the newly opened Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
(now known as Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport) in Taoyuan County, about 45
minutes from the city.</P>
      <P>Songshan Airport -- now known formally as Taipei International Airport -- then
served as a domestic airport,  but has been repositioned in recent years as part
of a golden flight circuit connecting city airports in Taipei, Tokyo, Seoul, and
Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Soon after arriving in Taipei, Abe had lunch at the famous dumpling restaurant
Din Tai Fung, accompanied by Tadashi Imai, the director of the Interchange

      <P>He then headed to the Martyrs Shrine located in the city's northern suburb of

China helped to conserve, as one of the themes of its pavilion.</P>
      <P>Japan went out of its way to use the rare species to symbolize its friendly

      <P>The world's longest fluorescent fish, bred by Taiwanese researchers, is being
featured in an aquarium exhibition that is introducing Taiwan's research and
development efforts in the aquaculture field.</P>
      <P>The 2010 Taiwan International Aquarium Expo, being held in Taipei between Oct.
29 and Nov. 1, is showcasing many kinds of fish bred in Taiwan and creative
landscapes for aquariums, according to the show's organizer, the Fisheries
Agency, which is hoping for a turnout of 100,000 visitors.</P>
      <P>The fluorescent fish on display, known as convict cichlids, were bred jointly by
Academia Sinica, Taiwan's leading research body, and Jy Lin Trading, a private
Taiwanese company.</P>
      <P>At 12 centimeters in length, the convict cichlids on display are the longest
fluorescent fish in the world, according to the company.</P>
      <P>Another of the show's main attractions are the international prize-winning
discus fish, a colorful fish genus composed of three different species of
freshwater fish native to the Amazon River basin.</P>
      <P>Chen Tian-shou, deputy director-general of the Fisheries Agency, said Taiwan's
team won 14 medals at the International Discus Championship in Duisburg, Germany
early this month, a sign of its prowess in the field.</P>

      <P>Hoping to offset the impact of the closure of a major roadway to the area, the
Taitung County government said Sunday that it will offer a cash incentive to
travel agencies that bring over 1,000 tourists to the county in November.</P>
      <P>"The travel agencies will be given an award of NT$30,000 for bringing at least
1,000 visitors who stay one night, have two meals and see three scenic spots in
Taitung between Nov. 1-30, " said Taitung County Magistrate Justin Chien-ting
Huang, during a meeting in the county with Premier Wu Den-yih.</P>
      <P>"The more people they bring, the higher the award they will receive."</P>
      <P>Huang and representatives of tourism operators in the county called on the
central government to work out concrete plans to minimize the impact of the
closure of Suhua Highway on Taitung's tourism sector.</P>
      <P>The coastal highway connecting Yilan and Hualien counties on Taiwan's eastern
coast north of Taitung represented the fastest way for people from northern
Taiwan to get to the southeastern county by car.</P>
      <P>The 118-kilometer Suhua Highway collapsed during Typhoon Megi on Oct. 21, and
the road is not expected to be opened again to traffic until the middle of
November.</P>
      <P>Huang said his goal is to draw 300,000 tourists per month to the county, famous
for its natural mountain-ocean landscapes, hot springs and aboriginal cultures.</P>

      <P>President Ma Ying-jeou said Sunday he was optimistic about tourism growth after
commercial flights flew between Taipei's Songshan Airport and Tokyo's Haneda
Airport for the first time in 31 years.</P>
      <P>At a meeting with former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who arrived in
Taipei on one of the first direct flights between the two city airports, Ma said
the resumption of flights was a crucial part of his administration's efforts to
seek better relations with Japan over the past two years.</P>
      <P>Direct flights will save valuable time for travelers in both cities, "making
travel between Taipei and Tokyo and doing some business in one day possible."</P>
      <P>He hoped that Taiwan could reach out to 48 Japanese cities or airports through
Haneda Airport, adding that Songshan Airport also connects Taiwan proper and its
outlying islands.</P>
      <P>The number of Taiwanese visitors to Japan grew by 30 percent in the first half
of the year, while Japanese tourists to Taiwan grew by 7 percent over the same
period, the president said.</P>
      <P>"We are optimistic about tourism growth," he added.</P>
      <P>Abe served as Japan's prime minister between September 2006 and September 2007.</P>

      <P>Flights between Kaohsiung and Tokyo were launched Sunday, giving residents of
southern Taiwan the opportunity to fly directly to Japan's capital from an
airport much closer to home.</P>
      <P>The first flight from Kaohsiung International Airport to Narita International
Airport outside of Tokyo Sunday morning, operated by Taiwan's China Airlines,
was fully booked.</P>
      <P>The carrier will offer a round-trip flight between Kaohsiung and Narita every
Sunday, Monday and Thursday.</P>
      <P>In the past, residents of southern Taiwan either had to first fly or drive north
to the Taipei area or to a third destination before flying on to the Japanese
city.</P>
      <P>Tokyo became the southern port city's 16th new international destination added
since 2009, said Kaohsiung City Mayor Chen Chu.</P>
      <P>Ruling Kuomintang (KMT) lawmaker Huang Chao-shun said she hoped that China
Airlines could start service from Kaohsiung to Tokyo's city airport, Tokyo
International Airport, as it did Sunday from Taipei to Tokyo.</P>
      <P>She said launching the route to the Tokyo city airport, known commonly as Haneda
airport, would allow Kaohsiung residents to cut down on their travel time to
downtown Tokyo even further compared to arriving at Narita.</P>
      <P>Chen, Huang, and independent candidate Yang Chiu-hsing, Kaohsiung County'
incumbent magistrate, are the main candidates in the Nov. 27 election for mayor
of the new Kaohsiung municipality.</P>
      <P>Earlier Sunday, another China Airlines flight that left Haneda Airport at 7 a.m.
was the first to fly from the Tokyo city airport to Taipei's city airport (known
commonly as Songshan Airport) since 1979, when international flights serving
Taiwan were moved out of the city to the newly opened Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport.</P>

      <P>Cuba defeated the Netherlands 4-1 in Taichung on Sunday to win its third
straight Intercontinental Cup baseball title and its 11th since the tournament
began in 1973.</P>
      <P>The Caribbean country showed why it is considered to be one of the best baseball
countries in the world, going undefeated in eight games in the tourney.</P>
      <P>The win, however, did not come without some drama for the defending champion,
which seemed to have little to worry about with a 4-0 lead entering the top of
the ninth inning.</P>
      <P>The Dutch hitters, who had only produced two hits in eight innings against Cuban
starter Miguel Martinez, punished closer Yadier Pedroso with three hits to score
their first run and threatened to narrow the gap further by loading the bases.</P>
      <P>But right-hander Jonder Martinez finished off the next three batters, striking
out two of them, to end the suspense.</P>
      <P>Cuba had 10 hits in the game, including a solo home run by Alexeis Bell, to the
Netherlands' five.</P>
      <P>It was Cuba's second consecutive victory over the Netherlands in the
Intercontinental Cup title game. It beat the Netherlands 6-3 in the 2006
championship game, which was also held in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Italy beat host Taiwan 4-3 in the bronze medal game earlier Sunday for its first
ever medal finish in the tournament. Japan beat South Korea 2-1 in the fifth
place game.</P>
      <P>Nicaragua, the Czech Republic, Thailand and Hong Kong took the seventh- to 10th-
place spots in the 10-team tournament.</P>
      <P>According to the official Web site of the International Baseball Federation
(IBAF), the 2010 Intercontinental Cup played in Taiwan may be the final edition
of the tournament.</P>
