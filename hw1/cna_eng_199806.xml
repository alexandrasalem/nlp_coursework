    <HEADLINE>MA CANDIDACY BOOSTS KMT'S MORALE, SAY OVERSEAS PARTY MEMBERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San   Francisco,   May   31  (CNA)
(By Neil Lu &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Justice Minister Ma
Ying-jeou's announcement that he was entering the race for Taipei
mayor sent a shock through Taipei political circles and has breathed
new life into the Kuomintang sectors in the United States, a KMT
source in western US said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ma's announcement has suddenly cleared a cloud that has shadowed
the Republic of China's ruling party caused by its long-time failure
to produce a proper candidate for the mayoral election.</P>
      <P>An associate professor at National Chengchi University, Ma had
continually rejected the KMT's call for his candidacy in the year-end
Taipei mayoral election until Saturday.</P>
      <P>At a press conference shortly after his father registered on his
behalf in the KMT primaries, Ma said he is entering the race to meet
public expectations. While Ma had previously said he would not run
unless the political environment had changed, he said he was
enlightened by a great number of supporters recently and decided that
he himself should help bring about that change.</P>
      <P>Chao Chuan-san, a senior member of the KMT headquarters in
western US, said he personally is thankful to Ma for changing his
mind at the last minute to jump into the race on behalf of the KMT
after deciding to discard his personal issues with the party.</P>
      <P>Chao said all KMT members on the westcoast of the United States
are relieved now that Ma, a KMT stalwart who has enjoyed high
approval ratings in almost all public opinion polls in Taiwan in the
past, has decided to run for the KMT in the Taipei mayoral race. "We
believe Ma will win back the Taipei mayorship for the KMT," he said.</P>
      <P>Cheng Kwang-chih, another senior KMT member in the western US who
is now attending a conference in Washington, D.C., also gave his
support for Ma over a telephone interview on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Ma's pitching into the race signifies the beginning of
a new round of esprit de corps in Taiwan's ruling party, a new
strength which will help the party to win in all local or legislative
elections in years to come.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WRECKAGE OF MISSING F-16 LOCATED IN WATERS OFF PENGHU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following 70 days of intensive search, a
naval minesweeper finally pinpointed the wreckage of an Air Force
F-16 jetfighter in waters off the coast of Penghu Sunday evening,
military sources reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>The sources said debris of the jetfighter scattered to more than
10 places beneath waters some 10 miles west of Hsiyu, a small islet
of the Penghu (Pescadore) island group.</P>
      <P>Naval officers aboard the minesweeper were quoted as saying they
were almost sure the wreckage belonged to the two-seater F-16 from
the Chiayi airbase in southern Taiwan which lost contact during a
routine training flight on March 20.</P>
      <P>The sources said the navy has dispatched additional naval vessels
to join search and salvage operations.</P>
      <P>The bodies of the two air force pilots aboard the missing fighter
-- flight instructor Wen Chin-sung and trainee Chang Chia-cheng --
have not yet been discovered, according to the sources.</P>
      <P>The ill-fated F-16, with the serial number 6828, was on a
training flight in skies about 50 kilometers southwest of Makung in
the offshore Penghu County when it lost contact with authorities at
around 2:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>The military has since mobilized numerous naval ships and
aircraft for search and rescue operations. Such efforts had been
futile until Sunday.</P>
      <P>Under its 10-year military modernization plan, the Republic of
China struck a deal with the United States in 1992 to purchase 150
F-16 A/B jetfighters. Each plane reportedly costs more than US$20
million. Forty-four of them have been delivered to Taiwan. The first
F-16 squadron was formed last October and another squadron was
commissioned earlier this year.</P>

      <P>A Taichung school in central Taiwan will
have to suspend its operations and pay a fine of NT$60,000 (US$1,800)
for violating zoning regulations, Lin Fang-min, an official of the
Taichung City Government, said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin, director of the Bureau of Public Works of Taichung City
Government, made the remarks while fielding questions in Taichung
City Council.</P>
      <P>City Councilor Hsieh Ming-yuan pointed out that the site of the
Taichung American School, located at the Taken section of Taichung
City, was designated as a posh residential zone.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that the builder rented the tract of land to Anna Lee,
President Lee Teng-hui's daughter, who did not apply to have the
land rezoned before using it for the school.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said the regulations allow Taken builders to construct
residential homes, hotels, entertainment facilities, agricultural and
other necessary public facilities, which includes kindergartens,
nurseries and retirement homes.</P>
      <P>The case has attracted a great deal of attention due to the
involvement of Anna Lee, founder and principal of the Taichung
American School, which offers a total of 15 classes, from
kindergarten to 12th grade.</P>
      <P>The school was also found to be in violation of regulations
concerning a ban on accepting local students. As a foreign school, it
may only accept foreign students, or Taiwan students who possess dual
citizenship.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia is concerned about British
reports of cosmetics and air fresheners containing musk xylene, which
reportedly causes cancer.</P>
      <P>Reckitt and Colman, a manufacturer of international household
products, told reporters that the company decided to investigate and
test a wide range of cosmetics and air-fresheners in Australia after
British government scientists had disclosed recently that one key
ingredient, linked to cancer, can remain in human body almost
indefinitely.</P>
      <P>British scientists have announced that they would test cosmetics
and air fresheners in their country that contain musk xylene, which
is one of a family of low-cost chemicals created to mimic natural
musk, an expensive scent extracted from deer glands and is commonly
used in perfumes, soaps and other products.</P>
      <P>Concern in the U.K. follows a laboratory test by Japanese
scientists who found mice exposed to high quantities of musk xylene
developed liver tumors.</P>
      <P>A more extensive investigation in Germany showed the human body
took three months to break down half the amount of the substance.</P>
      <P>Products containing musk xylene include certain perfumes, shaving

    <HEADLINE>E.U. OFFERS FEW SIGNS OF PROGRESS IN FARM REFORM TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, May 31 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>European Union agriculture ministers offered
few signs of progress in negotiations to reform the E.U. cereal, beef
and dairy sectors, according to reports from the Geneva-based World
Trade Organization (WTO) Sunday.</P>
      <P>Ministers did, however, underscore what the most controversial
issues will be during negotiations in the months to come.</P>
      <P>Evidence of difficulties ahead came in a joint declaration after
a two-day monthly meeting of the ministers. The declaration relates
to a proposal by the E.U. Commission, the E.U. executive, to reduce
guaranteed E.U. cereal, beef and dairy prices in the year 2000 and to
increase direct E.U. farm aid from that year to compensate for the
price reductions.</P>
      <P>The proposal would cut the cereal support price by 20 percent in
2000, the beef support price by 30 percent in the period between 2000
and 2003, and butter and skimmed milk powder support prices by 15
percent between the same period.</P>
      <P>It would also increase the overall E.U. milk quota by 2 percent
between 2000-2003, extend the milk quota system until 2006 and give
E.U. countries a greater say over how to allocate E.U. beef and dairy
aid.</P>
      <P>Key negotiating issues are the extent of the proposed price cuts,
the level of proposed extra farm aid and the proposed right of E.U.
countries to allocate beef and dairy aid according to national
priorities, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the proposed size and extension of milk quotas after
2000 will be significant issues, the report said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC INTERIOR MINISTER CALLS FOR CROSS-STRAIT EFFORTS IN CRIME FIGHTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen on Monday
urged that concerted cross-strait efforts at cracking down on crime
be made the top issue on the agenda once both sides of the Taiwan
Strait resume talks.</P>
      <P>In his report delivered at a regular Kuomintang weekly meeting on
the operations of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), Huang cited the
larger number of Taiwan criminals hiding in mainland China than those
repatriated back to Taiwan as one of the reasons that necessitate
closer contact and cooperation between authorities from the two sides
on crime fighting issues.</P>
      <P>There are at least 191 Taiwan criminals who have fled the country
and have sought refuge in mainland China, compared to only 43 others
who were repatriated from the mainland back to Taiwan, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>He urged the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council, the top
government agency in charge of formulating Taiwan's policy toward
mainland China, and the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, an
intermediary body authorized to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of formal ties with mainland China, to see to it that crime
fighting and related affairs be put on the top of the agenda of the
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has been the "black hole" of Taiwan's law
enforcement endeavor, Huang said. Not only do wanted criminals from
Taiwan hide in the mainland, but also stolen automobiles and
motorbikes often end up there and a large volume of smuggled weapons
and drugs in Taiwan originate from the mainland, he stated.</P>
      <P>Huang said it is hoped that representatives from the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait will meet soon and talk on arms and drugs
smuggling, fishery disputes, piracy in the seas, and other related
issues to help restore social order and security on both sides.</P>
      <P>In addition to seeking mainland China's cooperation, Huang said
the MOI is also striving to improve its own proficiency, including
expanding investigation and arresting operations overseas, bolstering
exchanges and cooperation with international police authorities,
beefing up Taiwan's coastal policing forces, and strengthening
security forces at harbors and fishing ports islandwide.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian said on
Monday that his biggest challenge now is the clock, and vowed to
improve city works during the second half of the year.</P>
      <P>The popular Chen, of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP), had no comment on the man chosen by the ruling Kuomintang
(KMT) to run against him in the year-end Taipei City mayoral
election, saying only that the KMT's problems will not be resolved in
the short term, or by one man alone.</P>
      <P>The mayor said that his most urgent task is continuing to push
for reforms and more efficient city government which will allow
Taipei City's residents to enjoy a higher quality of life.</P>
      <P>The announcement over the weekend that former Justice Minister Ma
Ying-jeou will enter the mayoral race for the KMT poses a grave
threat to Chen, who has enjoyed wide popularity so far.</P>
      <P>Recent poll results show that Ma will be a formidable rival in
the race, with a popularity rating on a par with, or even surpassing,
the incumbent mayor's.</P>
      <P>However, Chen emphasized that the poll results should only be
taken as a reference, adding that he still has strong conviction
about his ability to win the race.</P>
      <P>Saying that his city works will not bear fruit during his first
four-year term, he appealed to the electorate to give him four more
years of mandate to allow him to complete his agenda to build a
better Taipei.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL ASSEMBLY SPEAKER TO ATTEND US SENATOR'S FUNERAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC National Assembly Speaker Fredrick
Chien, on behalf of President Lee Teng-hui, left for the United
States on Monday to attend the funeral on June 3 of late Senator
Barry Goldwater.</P>
      <P>Goldwater, one of the ROC's staunchest American supporters, died
of natural causes on Friday at his home in Phoenix, Arizona. He was
89.</P>
      <P>His family said the funeral will be held on Wednesday at the
Arizona State University in Tempe, which the former senator attended
as a young man, although he never graduated.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, chief ROC representative in the United States,
telegraphed the condolences of the ROC government and people to Mrs.
Goldwater last Friday upon hearing of Goldwater's death.</P>
      <P>In his telegraph, Chen lauded Goldwater as "truly one of the
greatest statesmen of the 20th century... a hero who battled with all
forms of tyranny and injustice so that we might live in liberty."</P>
      <P>NA Speaker Chien was appointed presidential envoy to the
Goldwater funeral in part because he held the posts of chief ROC
representative in the United States between 1983 and 1988, and of ROC
foreign minister between 1990 and 1996. He has also maintained close
and long-term relationships with the many friends he made in the US.</P>
      <P>ROC diplomats in the US capital described Goldwater as the most
loyal friend of the ROC. Over the past five decades, he was always
there, standing up to speak for the ROC's cause amid turbulent
relations across the Taiwan Strait, they said.</P>
      <P>In December 1978, after former President Jimmy Carter announced
US recognition of the Beijing authorities, Goldwater filed a suit
with the US Supreme Court against Carter, accusing him of violating
the US Constitution by recognizing the communist regime.</P>
      <P>One of Goldwater's greatest contributions to the ROC before he
retired from the US Congress in 1987 was his strenuous efforts in
pushing for the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1978.</P>
      <P>This act has since contributed to the protection of Taiwan's
security, allowing Taiwan to develop political democracy and secure
economic prosperity. It has also provided a framework for the US and
Taiwan to continuously develop bilateral relations in the absence of
formal diplomatic ties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRISIS OPENING DOOR FOR SYDNEY AS KEY FINANCIAL CENTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  1 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis has opened "a
window of opportunity" for Sydney to become a key financial center
for international banks and financial markets, but a stronger
promotional blitz should be made to achieve that goal, according to
the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE).</P>
      <P>SFE chief executive Les Hosking, who also serves as chairman of
the Australian government's financial center task force, said
Australia's strong regulatory framework and stable corporate culture
can make Sydney a strategic location to develop financial services
and security trading sectors on a global scale.</P>
      <P>He said concerns over regulatory systems in Hong Kong and
Singapore have created the potential for Sydney to make some major
inroads in that direction.</P>
      <P>"The timing is good to push what Australia has to offer and the
sea-change in technology is breaking down our disadvantage of
distance," he said.</P>
      <P>Based on their growth in the past 20 years, both Hong Kong and
Singapore have developed stronger markets in foreign exchange and
equities.</P>
      <P>The current disadvantages for Australia are its small population
of about 18.5 million and its uncompetitive tax regime which serve as
key impediments to attracting more financial businesses to Sydney,
Hosking said.</P>
      <P>He said if these disadvantages are negated with investment
incentives, Sydney will have no problem of becoming the financial
center of Asia.</P>
      <P>He said: "Tokyo has lost preeminence in the region, with some
people suggesting that this has been through mismanagement and
corruption."</P>
      <P>He said his task force will deliver a status report later this
month in which he will recommend that the Australian government seize
the opportunity by offering investment incentives through stronger
marketing promotions.</P>
      <P>He said the government should establish a marketing bureau to
promote Australia as a base for financial service companies because
the country is well-placed to win more contracts providing
back-office capabilities for Asian banks in the future as a result of
its stable economy.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Aero Industry Development
Center (AIDC) is looking for a new partner to upgrade its F-5 jet
fighters for advanced pilot training, following the dissolution of a
business agreement with US Northrop Grumman Corp., according to the
latest issue of US Defense News.</P>
      <P>The weekly reported from Washington that AIDC and Northrop
Grumman allowed their October business agreement to lapse due to the
inability of the Los Angeles-based contractor to secure US export
licenses for software source codes needed for the upgrades.</P>
      <P>A Northrop spokesman told Defense News that his company continues
to maintain contact with AIDC in the hope of pursuing other areas of
cooperation.</P>
      <P>A US State Department source noted that export license requests
to Taiwan are generally scrutinized because of sensitivity associated
with Washington's official relationship with Beijing and unofficial
ties with Taipei.</P>
      <P>In a May 26 interview with Defense News, the source added that
many export licenses for Taiwan are currently delayed pending the
outcome of US President Bill Clinton's June summit in Beijing with
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>The original Northrop-AIDC plan called for prototype construction
of the Northrop Grumman F-5 IV, a version of the F-5 that mimics the
avionics and cockpit characteristics of the US F-16 fighter.</P>
      <P>Defense News said Taiwan is seeking to form a new international
partnership that mates AIDC's manufacturing capabilities and the
Taiwan military's excess fleet of 100 single-seat F-5Es with a
Western aircraft design, engineering and marketing firm.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXECUTIVE YUAN ESTABLISHES SOUTHERN TAIWAN SERVICE CENTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has established a new
southern Taiwan service center in the hope that it will allow "spring
to come to Kaohsiung," Premier Vincent Siew said on Monday at the
center's opening ceremony.</P>
      <P>Siew pointed out that feedback obtained during his many visits to
southern Taiwan in his capacity as premier shows that the public
longs for more central government support for regional developments,
prompting the decision to establish a government administration
service center in the southern Taiwan region.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development under the Executive Yuan, will serve concurrently as the
new director of the service center.</P>
      <P>Immediately following the opening ceremony, Siew presided over
the first Executive Yuan meeting ever to be held in Kaohsiung, where
various major regional developments, such as the progress on the
Tainan Science-based Industrial Park, were discussed.</P>
      <P>Voicing his hope that the various ministries and commissions will
consult local opinion via personal visits to southern Taiwan before
making major decisions affecting development projects in the region,
Siew stressed that his new "mobile Cabinet" will be able to instigate
many administrative actions.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih recognized Siew's support for the new
center and said he hopes that the central leadership will visit
regional localities more often to understand the condition of the
people, but he also took the opportunity to express his indignation
at the injustice of 100 years of north-south inequality.</P>
      <P>The mayor said he hopes Siew will make more frequent visits to
southern Taiwan to better understand local needs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND SPIES IN TAIWAN SAID NOT TO EXCEED DOUBLE DIGITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 1 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of mainland Chinese secret agents
in Taiwan doesn't exceed 100, the Republic of China's intelligence
chief reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>Yin Tsung-wen, director of the National Security Bureau, said in
a speech at National Chengchi University that mainland China has
taken advantage of increased exchanges across the Taiwan Strait to
send intelligence agents to Taiwan through various channels.</P>
      <P>However, Yin said he doesn't think that the number of mainland
agents working in Taiwan is as large as has been reported. "My
observation is that the actual number should be no more than two
digits," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Asked why the government has not taken action against these
agents, Yin said that as a country ruled by law, the ROC must abide
by the law in handling this kind of affair. He stressed that all
suspected mainland agents are monitored closely by local security and
intelligence authorities.</P>
      <P>Yin further pointed out that the major intelligence threat to
Taiwan doesn't come from Beijing's spies here, but from Taiwan people
who visit mainland China. He said the National Security Bureau has
stepped up surveillance of local people suspected of funneling
military and technological secrets to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Quoting official statistics, Yin said Taiwan residents have made
more than 12 million visits to the mainland since the ROC lifted a
cross-strait travel ban in 1987, while mainland people have made
about 300,000 visits to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It is noteworthy that after the Chinese Communist Party held a
working meeting on Taiwan affairs last month, mainland authorities
have vowed to increase efforts to court the people of Taiwan," Yin
cautioned, adding that mainland China has employed "united front"
tactics in an attempt to win the hearts and minds of Taiwan
residents.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND DISSIDENTS TO MARK TIANANMEN MASSACRE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New York, May 31 (CNA)
(By Huang Kung-chun and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twelve dissidents in northwestern mainland
China released an open letter on Sunday calling on the people of
mainland China to stand up and seek vindication for the June 4, 1989
Tiananmen massacre, in which thousands of pro-democracy protesters
were killed in a show of military force by Beijing's communist
authorities.</P>
      <P>According to the US-based "China Human Rights," an organization
which advocates democracy for mainland China, the twelve dissidents
included Ma Xiaoming, Lin Mu, and Gao Junsheng.</P>
      <P>Lin Mu, a leading voice of dissent based in the northwestern
region of the mainland, once served as a secretary of Hu Yaobang, the
late secretary-general of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and
president of the Northwest University. He has been under constant
persecution and monitoring by mainland Chinese state security forces
after launching a series of dissident activities in recent years.</P>
      <P>In the letter, the 12 dissidents first conveyed their condolences
to the families of the victims killed in the incident and paid their
respects to those pro-democracy fighters who are still imprisoned.
They went on to point out that the corruption and the violation of
the rule of law now rampant in the mainland government are direct
results of the clampdown on democratic activists nine years ago.</P>
      <P>The only way to ease the displeasure of the people and resolve
the corruption and injustice which abounds in mainland society is to
"reassess" the June 4 incident, the letter points out.</P>
      <P>It is the first time that mainland democracy activists have
issued such an open letter to the public, rather than to government
authorities, and it seems to be a bid to use the force of public
opinion to find a solution to the problems, the human rights group
said.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, 21 other dissidents in Beijing, Fujian, Hunan,
Liaoning, and Zhejiang issued their own statement calling on mainland
China's National People's Congress, the State Council, and the
CCP's to apologize for the June 4 incident, according to a Hong
Kong-based human rights group.</P>
      <P>They demanded that mainland authorities concede their error in
opening fire on their patriotic countrymen and issue a public apology
to the entire country.</P>
      <P>They also demanded that mainland authorities erect a
commemorative plaque for the protesters killed in the demonstration,
and recognize human rights as a universal principle by releasing all
political prisoners, as well as allowing dissidents living in exile
overseas to return to the mainland.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>No major breakthrough has been made in
search of an F-16 jetfighter which lost contact during a routine
training flight on March 20, the Air Force General Headquarters
(AFGH) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>"The search for the missing plane is still going on," the AFGH
said in a press release, adding that neither the wreckage of the
plane nor the bodies of the two pilots aboard have so far been
discovered.</P>
      <P>The Air Force issued the statement in an apparent attempt to
clarify earlier reports that a naval minesweeper pinpointed the
wreckage of the ill-fated F-16 beneath waters some 10 miles west of
Hsiyu, a small islet of the Penghu (Pescadore) island group, on
Sunday evening.</P>
      <P>The Air Force said the reports were incorrect. It pledged to
continue its search for the missing aircraft in cooperation with the
Navy. In addition, the Air Force said, it plans to employ foreign
salvage experts to assist in the operations.</P>
      <P>The twin-seater F-16, with the serial number 6828, was on a
training flight in skies about 50 kilometers southwest of Makung in
the offshore Penghu County when it lost contact with military
authorities at around 2:30 pm on March 20.</P>
      <P>The military has since mobilized numerous naval ships and
aircraft for search and rescue operations. Such efforts have been
futile so far.</P>
      <P>Under its 10-year military modernization plan, the Republic of
China struck a deal with the United States in 1992 for purchasing
150 F-16 A/B jetfighters. Each plane reportedly costs more than
US$20 million. Forty-four of them have been delivered to Taiwan. The
first F-16 squadron was formed last October and another squadron was
commissioned earlier this year.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 1 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The length of compulsory drivers' education
classes for drunk drivers is being extended from half a day to a
whole day, effective Tuesday, Taipei city government traffic
authorities announced Monday.</P>
      <P>Classes will run from 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. every Tuesday.
Afterward participants will be tested on the class, and anyone
failing the test must retake the class.</P>
      <P>Traffic police said that fines, which range from NT$6,000 to
NT$12,000, are a poor drunk driving deterrent to the city's
higher-income residents, while six-month driving suspensions are
useless, given the police's inability to determine whether all
motorists are properly licensed.</P>
      <P>Day-long drivers' education classes, however, will inconvenience
busy Taiwan residents and, perhaps, deter them from drinking and
driving in the future, police said.</P>
      <P>Regulations that require drunk drivers to attend the classes were
among new measures enacted by the city government late last year to
reduce the number of car accidents. Other measures in the package
include higher drunk driving fines and one that prohibits drunk
drivers from driving their cars away after being stopped.</P>
      <P>Drivers who refuse to attend the classes will be fined NT$1,800.
In addition, the traffic supervision office will not allow them to
transfer automobile registrations nor will the office accept license
plates and registrations from cars the owners intend to discard,
which means the owners must continue to pay taxes on those vehicles.</P>
      <P>The first class took place on Dec. 12 last year with Taipei Mayor
Chen Shui-bian teaching the class himself to demonstrate his
government's determination to crack down on drunk driving.</P>

      <P>Scientists have warned that temperatures
might increase all over the world, and sea levels might rise to cause
floods in the next 50 years if global warming continues unabated at
its present rate.</P>
      <P>Temperatures will increase by almost 2 degrees Centigrade in the

      <P>Singaporeans have already had a taste of higher temperatures,
with average monthly temperatures last year higher than those of the
previous 15 years by 0.4 to 1.3 degrees, according to the
Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS).</P>
      <P>But temperatures have also been rising elsewhere, with
temperatures worldwide reaching their highest levels in the 20th
century last year.</P>
      <P>As for the rising water levels in the next 50 years, Singapore
has low topography, with more than 60 percent of its land not
exceeding 15 meters above sea level.</P>
      <P>Its coastal areas are also generally flat with extensive land
reclamation, said the MSS.</P>
      <P>However, according to the Singapore Environment Ministry, a rise

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman
Chang King-yuh on Monday called on one of Taiwan's leading business
tycoons to continue supporting the government's "no hast, be
patient" policy toward investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang made the appeal after a local newspaper reported that
Formosa Plastics Group (FPG) Chairman Y. C. Wang arrived in
Zhangzhou in the southeastern mainland province of Fujian on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Chang said the veteran petrocehmical baron once assured the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) that he will not violate the
government's cautious mainland investment policy.</P>
      <P>"Mr. Wang himself has said he would abide by government
policy...We believe he has in mind the delicate ties between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Wang's mainland trip, Chang said the government
currently doesn't ban local entrepreneurs from making market
inspection tours of the mainland.</P>
      <P>The Taipei-based Commercial Times reported on Monday that Wang
is making a low-profile trip to the mainland and will meet with
mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji to brief him on a controversial
power plant project in Zhangzhou.</P>
      <P>The report said Wang will fly to Beijing after visiting the site
of the thermal power plant being constructed. Wang reportedly would
seek the mainland premier's understanding of the fact that, in order
to circumvent current Taiwan restrictions on mainland investment,
the FPG had had to transfer its holding in the US$3 billion
Zhangzhou power plant project to a foreign investor. Wang told the
local press earlier this year that the FPG will buy the stake back
once Taiwan's investment regulations are eased.</P>
      <P>Wang's mainland trip comes at a sensitive time, Four Taiwan
merchants were recently arrested on the mainland on charges of
espionage.</P>
      <P>The FPG's three flagship companies -- Formosa Plastics Corp.,
Nan Ya Plastics Corp., and Formosa Chemical and Fiber Corp. --
originally planned to jointly hold a 60 percent stake in the
Zhangzhou power plant, which is scheduled to come on line in the
year 2000.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui ordered a review of the mainland
investment policy in late 1996 as Beijing stepped up its efforts to
isolate the Republic of China on Taiwan in the international
community. Lee's "no haste, be patient" policy is also aimed at
preventing Taiwan from becoming too reliant on the mainland market
as Beijing has never renouced its attempt to use force against the
island.</P>
      <P>Under the tightened restrictions, local companies are banned
from investing in any mainland infrastructure project worth more than
US$50 million.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June 1 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Inevitably, the modest acts of democracy in
Hong Kong will be noticed by mainland Chinese citizens, a Canadian
newspaper said in an editorial on Monday.</P>
      <P>Many of these citizens will then ask: "If our fellow citizens in
Hong Kong can vote for their legislators, however incomplete and
imperfect the election, why can't we?" said The Ottawa Citizen.</P>
      <P>It pointed out that mainland China's leaders have long held that
"western-style" democracy is not compatible with what they call
"Asian values." Hong Kong's latest elections put the lie to this, the
daily said.</P>
      <P>Last June, when the world was watching the impending handover of
Hong Kong to mainland China, The Economist published an editorial
entitled "How Hong Kong Can Change China," the Citizen said.</P>
      <P>The magazine was asking if it is possible that instead of
mainland China taking over Hong Kong, Hong Kong might conquer
mainland China with its powerhouse economy and fledgling democratic
structures?</P>
      <P>"One year later, we pose the question anew," said the Citizen.</P>
      <P>Last Sunday's election delivered "a loud raspberry to anyone who
would limit rights and freedom," it noted. In the next few days, many
Hong Kongers will go further by participating in the Tiananmen Square
commemorations, it added.</P>
      <P>It stressed that respect for human rights is the wave of the
present and the future. Western leaders -- including US President
Bill Clinton -- must continue to press Beijing for reform, it said.</P>
      <P>However, nothing teaches like example. "If so, Hong Kong's
pluralistic values may yet conquer the East," the editorial
commented.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's ability to launch a military
attack against Taiwan should not be underestimated given its
redeployment of troops and jet fighters along the mainland's southern
and eastern coasts, a Taiwan security leader warned on Monday.</P>
      <P>Even more worrisome is the fact that Beijing has drawn up
military scenarios that cast Taiwan as the enemy, said Yin Tsung-wen,
director of the National Security Bureau.</P>
      <P>Yin raised the warnings in a speech at Taipei's National Chengchi
University as part of the NSB's efforts to recruit university
graduates into the organization.</P>
      <P>He noted that the mainland has redeployed forces formerly
stationed along its Russian border to coastal areas in mainland's
southern and eastern sections in the wake of the Soviet Union's
collapse.</P>
      <P>Newly-acquired, Russian-made Sukhoi-27 jet fighters, as well as
the mainland's own F-8s, have been deployed in those regions as well,
bringing Taiwan into the fighters' combat range.</P>
      <P>Besides emphasizing Beijing's ability to attack Taiwan and
warning the island not to relax its guard, Yin called "hasty
reunification with mainland China," "hasty independence for Taiwan"
and "counter-intelligence operations" the three most dangerous
threats Taiwan faces.</P>
      <P>These areas all fall within the NSB's area of concern, Yin
further noted.</P>
      <P>The NSB has determined that the missiles fired during tests
Beijing conducted in the run-up to Taiwan's presidential elections in
1996 represented the first part of Beijing's landing operations
against the island.</P>
      <P>Beijing initially planned a four-stage assault, in which missile
strikes would first damage Taiwan's military facilities. Mainland
forces would then secure air and naval supremacy. Finally, an
amphibious assault would be launched, Yin said.</P>
      <P>The 1991 Persian Gulf War, however, underscored the importance of
electronic warfare, and Beijing has since revised its plans to
include an electronic warfare component. In fact, such warfare would
now precede missile strikes, Yin said.</P>

fellow opposition party the Democratic Progressive Party but also
members of the Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan and the KMT's
Central Committee.</P>
      <P>Yok said some KMT members are suspicious of Ma's about-face and
are trying to uncover his real motives. There is concern that Ma is
being manipulated by forces within the KMT that oppose President Lee.</P>
      <P>Jaw Shau-kong, the NP's general-manager of elections, also called
Ma a "tool of the anti-Lee forces."</P>
      <P>Lee Sheng-feng, manager of the NP's mayoral primaries, said at
the press conference that Ma's participation in the election has sped
up the splintering of the KMT and increased its sense of paralysis.</P>
      <P>Lee said that if the New Party were to back Ma, it would become
embroiled in the KMT's family feud. The move would ultimately drag
the New Party down, he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>As the Taipei Computer Exposition 1998 opens
on Tuesday, the China External Trade Development Council (CETRA) has
invited American information industrialists to the fair to capitalize
on the local currency's devaluation by ordering components from local
suppliers.</P>
      <P>The US Board of Marketing Associates, which is composed of
information industrialists with annual revenues exceeding US$50
million, has been asked by the CETRA to encourage its members to
visit Taiwan and order Taiwan-made mother boards.</P>
      <P>CETRA officials predict 16,000 foreign buyers will come to the
island for the show.</P>
      <P>Although the output of Taiwan's information and electronics
industry surged by more than 20 percent in 1997 to US$35.7 billion,
products were made mainly for foreign original equipment
manufacturers. As a result, CETRA is trying to pitch sales of
products carrying Taiwan companies' own brand names.</P>
      <P>Nearly 1,000 companies applied for stalls in the exhibition, but
there was only enough space to accommodate 892, CETRA officials said.</P>

      <P>Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) officials
confirmed on Monday that Taiwan has agreed to grant Thailand an
initial import quota of 4,000 compact cars, with an annual increases
of 10 percent.</P>
      <P>The deal was made before Minister of Economic Affairs Wang

      <P>While saying that he believes the increased quota will not have

arrange meetings and conduct visits and exchanges with its mainland
Chinese counterpart, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Shi made the remarks while commenting on a message received from
the ARATS on Monday regarding an invitation sent by the SEF on May
12. The SEF had invited an ARATS representative to visit Taiwan
sometime in May.</P>
      <P>But the ARATS replied by saying it would prefer to first set
conditions on the scope of the visit and then commission its deputy
secretary general to form a visiting group to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The reply also reiterated that the ARATS continues to welcome a
visit to the mainland by SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu.</P>
      <P>The SEF and the ARATS are intermediary bodies that represent the
governments across the Taiwan Strait in the absence of official
relations.</P>
      <P>Shi said any high-ranking meetings or talks between the SEF and
the ARATS should be aimed at settling practical problems. One such

    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  June  1 (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of Hong Kong's elections last
week indicate that voters accept electing a limited number of
legislative council members for now, but will demand greater
electoral powers when Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa's term runs out
in 2002, the Bangkok Post said Monday in an editorial.</P>
      <P>The English-language daily said Beijing would be wise to realize
its perception of the Hong Kong public is wrong.</P>
      <P>"Last week's vote showed that democracy is so important to Hong
Kong's people -- so important they would walk through a flood to get
it," it said.</P>
      <P>"The people of Hong Kong have interests that go well beyond their
pursuit of business and the almighty Hong Kong dollar.</P>
      <P>"Hong Kongers not only turned out for the first democratic
election on Chinese soil in recorded history. They turned out in
record numbers," the editorial said, pointing out that more than 50
percent of eligible Hong Kong voters turned up at the polls.</P>
      <P>The percentage rate of voter turn-out is said to be more than
that in Bangkok, even for the most controversial elections. Hong
Kong's people have sent a message to their new leaders in Beijing,
the editorial continued, adding that now they have discovered
democracy, Hong Kong people want more of it and they are prepared to
 go through much inconvenience for it.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the election of a minority of representatives to
the parliament in Hong Kong, the Bangkok Post said the new parliament
is controlled by a combination of communists and anti-democratic
business interests.</P>
      <P>"These two groups are combined in their opposition to democracy
in Hong Kong and in (mainland) China," the paper continued.</P>
      <P>"The communists believe in a single-party system where the
people's representatives are conveniently chosen for them by the
all-knowing leadership.</P>
      <P>"Narrow-minded business interests still far behind the
fast-developing times, think that democracy will somehow make Hong
Kong unstable -- either because debate will expose rifts in society,
or because Beijing will get upset again, as it did at the Tiananmen
massacre."</P>

      <P>Canada offers Taiwan's business community
with enormous opportunities, just as the markets of Taiwan have
attracted Canada's most innovative and entrepreneurial businesses,
Canada's Industry Minister John Manley said Monday.</P>
      <P>Speaking in Ottawa at the 12th joint meeting of the Canada-Taiwan
Business Association, Manley urged Taiwan's business leaders to seek
opportunities for investment and trade, and to build upon the solid
foundation of cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>He said Canada has built its strengths in natural resources to
value-added, knowledge-intensive industries, particularly in the
transportation and communication sectors.</P>
      <P>"Clearly, Canada has much to offer the information and
communications technology needs of Taiwan," he told some 200 business
and government leaders from both countries over lunch at a downtown
hotel.</P>
      <P>"I would like to emphasize that we are looking for Taiwan
investment and expertise as well," Manley added, noting that Canada
wants to build a semiconductor facility, "and Taiwan would make an
excellent partner for such a venture."</P>
      <P>Canada has an annual semiconductor trade deficit of US$3 billion,
even though it has world-class design skills and laboratories. Taiwan
is strong in manufacturing, marketing, and possesses abundant
capital.
 Another high-tech industry which Manley sees great potential for
cooperation between Canada and Taiwan is telecommunications.
 He announced that his department had just signed a memorandum of
understanding with Taiwan's Directorate General of Telecommunications
which will "close the loop on the initial stage of a cooperation
agreement in the fields of communications and information
technologies."</P>
      <P>"Canada welcomes the growing openness in Taiwan's
telecommunications market," the minister said, adding that he hoped
the memorandum will further improve the climate of cooperation
between the two countries.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADA URGES TAIWAN TO SIGN DOUBLE TAXATION AVOIDANCE PACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June 1 (CNA)
(By S. C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canada's international trade minister urged
Taiwan Monday to speed up negotiations over an agreement to avoid
double taxation.</P>
      <P>Sergio Marchi told a joint meeting of the Canada-Taiwan Business
Association, "Geography may not have made us neighbors, but history
has made us friends and the time has come for commerce to make us
partners."</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has become Canada's ninth largest trading partner, with
Canadian exports to Taiwan exceeding C$2 billion last year, there are
several significant initiatives to facilitate trade between the two
countries, Marchi said.</P>
      <P>For example, he pointed out, he hoped progress will be made on an
agreement to avoid double taxation.</P>
      <P>"This would benefit Canadians operating in Taiwan and Taiwanese
operating in Canada, and I think this is something that should be
done -- and done quickly," he added.</P>
      <P>He said during a recent meeting in Geneva with Taiwan's minister
of economic affairs, Dr. C.K. Wang, they discussed the potential for
closer economic ties -- "a relationship that I am determined to see
flourish and grow."</P>
      <P>Marchi lauded Taiwan for being a dynamic economy which "has
weathered the regional pressures better than most, and its resilience
is clear testimony both to its internal strengths and its
international reputation."</P>
      <P>Turning to bilateral trade problems, the minister said concerns
regarding access for foreign companies "will have to be addressed" as
Taiwan prepares for its membership in the World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>He urged Taiwan to "dedicate itself to a non-discriminatory
system of trade," referring to Taiwan's preferential treatment to
some US farm products that Canada does not enjoy.</P>
      <P>Another trade issue is trade imbalance, as "Taiwan sells almost
twice as much to Canada as it buys from us," Marchi pointed out.</P>
      <P>To balance trade and increase economic cooperation, he suggested
that Taiwan buy more of Canada's quality goods and services and
consider Canada's investment environment which is "second to none."</P>
      <P>He mentioned the increasing people-to-people exchanges between
the two countries, in the forms of tourists and students, but did not
divulge the economic benefits they -- and thousands of economic
immigrants -- bring to Canada every year.</P>
      <P>A Taipei official said that if these non-trade figures are
counted, Taiwan might be on the deficit side of "overall" economic
exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US TO SELL ADVANCED F-16 RADARS TO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   June  1  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a move likely to boost the
confidence in Taiwan, the US Department of Defense on Monday
announced the proposed sale of advanced radar systems for
installation on the island's newly acquired F-16 jetfighters.</P>
      <P>Pending congressional approval, the deal involves the
provision of 28 sets of Pathfinder/Sharpshooter navigation
and targeting pods, their integration with the F-16
fighters, training, maintenance and relevant support, the
Pentagon said in a press notice.</P>
      <P>The deal will cost an estimated US$160 million.</P>
      <P>This marks the first time that the United States has agreed to
sell the sophisticated nighttime combat equipment to Taiwan since the
two countries struck a deal in 1992 for the sale of 150 F-16s.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon said the Pathfinder/Sharpshooter pods will help
Taiwan's F-16 pilots navigate at low altitudes and allow them to
target weapons more accurately.</P>
      <P>According to defense industry sources, the new equipment will
also give 28 of Taiwan's F-16s the capability to combat at night.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative office in the United
States would not comment on the Pentagon announcement, other than to
point out that it is an established US policy to furnish Taiwan with
adequate defensive weapons.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Stephen Chen, the de facto ROC ambassador to the
US, said he was pleased to hear the announcement amid
rumors that the Clinton administration may be considering suspending
arms sales to Taiwan in an attempt to improve ties with mainland
China.</P>
      <P>This marks the second major weaponry deal between the US and
Taiwan so far this year. In January, the Pentagon announced the
lease of three Knox-class frigates and related equipment to the ROC
Navy at a cost of US$300 million.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon said in its brief notice to the press that the
Pathfinder/Sharpshooter deal will not affect the basic military
balance in the region, nor will there be adverse impact on US
defense readiness.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon further said the sale will not require the
assignment of any additional US government personnel in Taiwan,
while the prime contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp., will send five
to six representatives to provide technical support for about
three to six months.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon has informed Congress of the planned arms sales to
Taiwan. Congress has 60 days to object to the deal, otherwise the
sale will go forward.</P>
      <P>According to Pentagon sources, Taiwan made the overture to
purchase the advanced equipment for installation on its F-16 fighters
during the 1997 Taipei-Washington weaponry deals meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has taken delivery of 80 F-16s and 20 of them are still in
the US being used for training of ROC pilots at American air bases.
According to the terms of the 1992 purchase contract, the delivery
should be finalized by the turn of the century.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDIVIDUAL DEBT IN AUSTRALIA HITS RECORD HIGH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Individual debt in Australia hit a record
high of A$61 billion (US$40.7 billion) at the end of March 1998 due
to growing personal loans, higher credit card bills and greater use
of overdrafts, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS).</P>
      <P>The figure compares to A$53.4 billion (US$36.3 billion) from the
same period last year, according to the ABS figures, which excludes
loans for buying homes and operating businesses.</P>
      <P>ABS officials and economists attributed the surge of individual
debt to low interest rates, loyalty programs and "easy" money.</P>
      <P>The surge in individual debt has become a growing concern for
consumer groups because people will find it difficult to repay their
debts next year, they said.</P>
      <P>Analysts also said Australian banks have already begun setting
aside increased reserves in expectation of more bad debts.</P>
      <P>"Lower interest rates makes it more attractive for people to
borrow. Loyalty programs on credit cards have also had a major
impact. People now balance their points rather than balancing their
debt," said Andrew Willink, managing director of the Cannex Australia
Ptd.</P>
      <P>"Credit is far easier to get. Now you can just pick up your phone
and have a cheque delivered to your door," he added.</P>
      <P>Peter Kell, industrial officer of the Australian Consumers'
Association in Sydney, said Olympic credit cards are attractive to
customers because the holders can avoid paying bank fees.</P>
      <P>Many consumers used credit cards to minimize fees and charges
paid to financial institutions, he said.</P>
      <P>"We hope consumers are going into it with their eyes open. People
have to keep in mind that we are at a low point in the interest rate
cycle and they must be wary about not going in too deep," Kell added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER REAFFIRMS BAN ON INVESTING IN MAINLAND PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang
reaffirmed on Tuesday the government's ban on investment in the
petrochemical industry in the mainland will stand.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks following reports that Y.C. Wang, chairman
of Taiwan's Formosa Plastics Group (FPG), met with Fujian Province
officials in southeastern mainland Monday to discuss his stance on a
power plant initiated by the FPG in 1996.</P>
      <P>Reports also stated that Y.C. Wang would meet with mainland
Premier Zhu Rongzi Tuesday to explain that he would have to
temporarily transfer 60 percent of the stakes in the proposed plant
and will buy back the stakes in due time so as not to contravene the
government's ban.</P>
      <P>Wang said the ministry will closely monitor reports that the
Taiwan tycoon will transfer the stakes of the proposed plant to the
investors in the United States.</P>
      <P>FPG's Wang applied for government permission to build the US$3
billion thermal power plant in Zhangzhou, Fujian Province in early
1996, but withdrew the application after President Lee Teng-hui
called for a slowdown in mainland investment in August 1996.</P>
      <P>Economic officials said the ministry will continue to monitor
FPG's capital movement. So far, there has been no transferring of
money from FPG's three enterprises -- Formosa Plastics Corp., Nan Ya
Plastics Corp., and Formosa Chemical &amp; Fiber Corp., overseas.</P>
      <P>Officials also said the three flagship enterprises of the FPG are
all listed companies, and the transfer of money overseas will have to
be approved by the shareholders first.</P>

      <P>Liu Sung-fan, president of the Legislative
Yuan, stressed on Tuesday that he believes in the innocence of the
four Taiwan businessmen who have been arrested in mainland China on
charges of espionage, and he urged the Beijing authorities to
investigate the case as soon as possible and to allow their families

      <P>Liu made the remarks during a meeting with the families of the
four men, where he said the entire legislature is very concerned over
the arrests, and added that as they lack the special training
required to act as intelligence agents, it is impossible that the
four men could have undertaken any spying activities.</P>
      <P>In a written statement, the dependents of the four businessmen
said that although tens of thousands of Taiwan businessmen have
invested in mainland China, the separation of more than 40 years
between the two sides sometimes causes misunderstandings, which might
be the case in the recent arrests.</P>
      <P>The statement expressed the hope that Liu, in his capacity as

    <HEADLINE>DPP TO LAUNCH 'SAVE TAIWAN' CAMPAIGN ON EVE OF CLINTON-JIANG SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of lawmakers from the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) said on Tuesday they will launch
a series of activities demanding US President Bill Clinton not to
sacrifice Taiwan's rights and interests during his forthcoming state
visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>DPP Legislators Yeh Chu-lan, Hung Chi-chang, Chang Chun-hsiung
and Ko Chien-ming declared at a news conference that they have form a
"Save Taiwan, Defend Formosa" alliance to promote their cause.</P>
      <P>Also present at the press conference were several other DPP
heavyweights, including party advisors Lin Yi-hsiung and Wang
Shih-chien, as well as Frank Hsieh, the DPP candidate for the
year-end Kaohsiung mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Yeh said the alliance is aimed at reminding Clinton not to put
Taiwan people's rights and interests at stake during his summit
talks with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>As part of its action plan, Yeh said, the alliance will launch a
three-day signature campaign at the Taipei Railway Station
from June 20. "We hope to collect at least 10,000 signatures to
underscore our concern about Taiwan's security."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the alliance will organize a delegation to travel to
the United States later this month to convey Taiwan people's worry or
unease over the possible adverse impact on their well-being of the
Clinton-Jiang summit.</P>
      <P>In addition, the alliance will set up a website on Internet for
local people to air their views or opinions on all related issues to
US policymakers.</P>
      <P>The alliance will also sponsor an "anti-sellout" vigil at the
2-28 Peace Park in downtown Taipei on June 24 to call on Clinton not
to boost ties with Beijing at the expense of Taipei.</P>
      <P>At the end of the vigil, Yeh said, the alliance will issue a
declaration, reaffirming its stance that Taiwan is an independent,
sovereign state and expressing its strong opposition to "communist
China's attempt to swallow Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Yeh said the alliance will seek the support of all major
domestic political parties and elected representatives at various
levels for its cause. "We'll also push the Ministry of National
Defense and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to collect latest
information about mainland China's military buildup and developments
in Washington-Beijing engagement," she said, adding she believes
Beijing is unlikely to renounce the use of force against Taiwan
before cross-strait issues are resolved.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWENTY-FIVE CHILDREN DIE OF COMPLICATIONS CAUSED BY ENTEROVIRUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 2 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A total of 25 babies and children have died
of complications caused by a virulent type of enterovirus, with
another 100 in critical condition due to complications caused by the
virus since an epidemic broke out in the middle of last month, the
Department of Health (DOH) reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Tsung-neng, director of the National Quarantine Service under
the DOH, said the complications include encephalitis, meningitis and
acute myocarditis, and noted that several of the deaths have been
confirmed as resulting from enterovirus type 71.</P>
      <P>He said most of the fatalities have been reported from the
Changhua Christian Hospital in Changhua, central Taiwan, and from the
Linkou branch of the Chang Gung Hospital in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan,
which suggests that the virus is more rampant among children in
Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Miaoli, Taichung and Changhua counties.</P>
      <P>The Changhua Christian Hospital has so far reported nine deaths,
the Chang Gung Hospital has reported seven deaths, the Taipei
Veterans General Hospital has reported three, the National Cheng Kung
University Hospital in the southern city of Tainan has reported two,
while the Tri-services Hospital and the Kaohsiung Chang Gung Hospital
have each reported one.</P>
      <P>Wu estimated that so far, an estimated 200,000-300,000 infants
and children have fallen victim to the epidemic, caused mainly by the
enterovirus, along with the similar coxsackievirus. He noted that
this type of virus is usually very active during the summer months,
but added that this year, it has caused more fatalities than usual.</P>
      <P>He said that so long as infected children develop only
hand-foot-and-mouth disease and herpangina, the most common symptoms
of the infection, parents should not worry too much. But he warned
that if infected children also suffer from unrelieved high fever,
nausea, headache, rapid breathing, and lack of appetite, parents
should take them to a hospital.</P>
      <P>Saying that there is no vaccine for the enterovirus, Wu called on
parents not to take their children to public places, and to make sure
their children wash their hands more often. If necessary, parents
should keep their children away from day-care centers and
kindergartens for a short period.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite falling exports and a depreciating
new Taiwan dollar, investment willingness at home remains bullish and
the local economy will continue to grow, Economic Affairs Minister
Wang Chih-kang said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang said investment in the domestic market is expected to
increase by 16 percent to 17 percent for 1998, as a number of
large-scale investment projects worth about US$800 million-US$1
billion in the biochemical and aviation industries are set to be
carried out this year.</P>
      <P>The economics minister made the remarks while answering questions
from reporters after attending a seminar sponsored by Tamkang
University on management strategies for the small business sector in
the transition into the new millennium.</P>
      <P>Although export performance is a major indicator of a country's
business condition, Wang said investment willingness is another
leading indicator.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports dropped by 6.7 percent in the first quarter of
this year compared to the same period of last year, and estimates for
the second quarter are not expected to post an increase, although the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has been attempting to boost
outbound shipments to the United States and Europe to maintain the
island's export growth.</P>
      <P>The Committee of Economic Research and Development under the MOEA
said a weaker local currency will help sharpen export
competitiveness, while the bearish sentiments prevailing in the local
bourse are just a short-term phenomenon. Local market demand remains
strong and Taiwan's economic growth rate should be able to reach the
6 percent target, it added.</P>
      <P>MOEA statistics show that Taiwan charted a considerable 22
percent annual increase in capital investment in the first four
months of the year, an indication that private sector investment
interest remains high.</P>
      <P>The MOEA predicts that the export sector will regain momentum in
the second half of the year because of the government measures to
boost exports, and because Southeast Asia is expected to begin a
recovery from the current financial storm.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Television-Culture Research Committee
on Tuesday urged the government to speed up the legislation of a
cable television law to properly regulate scrambled programs and
sales of decoding devices for such programs.</P>
      <P>The committee also called for amendments to the existing
children's welfare law to strictly ban sales of decoders to underage
persons. The current law doesn't prescribe penalties for those who
sell or provide decoders to the underage.</P>
      <P>The committee said it conducted a field survey of nine night
marketplaces in the greater Taipei area last month. The survey found
that decoder sales to teens are rampant.</P>
      <P>A committee spokeswoman quoted shopkeepers and street vendors
interviewed as saying that junior and senior high school students
form the bulk of underage customers of decoding devices for
scrambled TV programs.</P>
      <P>According to a recent telephone poll of 975 adult residents in
Taipei City and Taipei County, conducted by CNA on behalf of the
committee, 48.6 percent of the respondents said they have purchased
decoders from street vendors, sales booths at night markets, or
shops, while 42.9 percent said they have bought such devices from
cable TV operators.</P>
      <P>Another recent survey conducted by the committee itself also
found that homes are the main place for adolescents to access
scrambled programs. Fifty-two percent of teenage respondents said
they have watched scrambled programs at home, while 44 percent said
they have accessed such programs at the homes of their classmates or
friends.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, more than half of their parents interviewed admitted
that they have fixed decoders on TV sets. "Such a practice has
offered youngsters easy access to scrambled programs," the
spokeswoman warned.</P>
      <P>About 38 percent said they would equip their TV sets with
decoders only when they want to watch scrambled programs.</P>
      <P>As scrambled programs mostly feature themes related to rape,
sexual abuse and incest, the committee urged decoder importers and
retailors to exercise self-discipline and decline sales of such
devices to the underage.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BUSINESS TYCOON INTERVIEWED BY JAPANESE NEWSPAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  May  2  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If mainland China really wants to woo more
investment from Taiwan, it should openly "renounce the use of force"
against the island, Jeffrey Koo, chairman of the Taiwan-based Chinese
Federal Association of Industry &amp; Commerce, said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Koo said that if
Beijing unequivocally renounces the use of force against Taiwan, then
Taiwan investment in the mainland will increase immediately.</P>
      <P>Addressing the effect of the Asian financial crisis on Taiwan,
Koo said that Taiwan's exports to Southeast Asia have decreased,
describing the situation as worrisome.</P>
      <P>He said that the development of Asian economies in general will
hinge on the exchange rate of the Japanese yen, adding that if the
yen is stable, then the Asian economies will gradually take a turn
for the better.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that if the yen continues to slide and
hover at between 140 and 150 against the US dollar, then the South
Korean won and the new Taiwan dollar will suffer. In that situation,
mainland China will have no reason to prop up the renminbi, and will
have a good excuse for devaluing its currency.</P>
      <P>Looking to the future, the Southeast Asian financial crisis is a
great investment opportunity, Koo said, noting that Thailand,
Malaysia and Indonesia will have more financial liberalization, and
that their land prices will also be cut dramatically.</P>
      <P>The business tycoon said that Taiwan investment in the mainland
has decreased following President Lee Teng-hui's August, 1996 advice
to Taiwan businessmen to be more cautious when investing in the
mainland -- the oft-touted "no haste, be patient" policy.</P>
      <P>He also said that the cross-strait economy is inseparably
intertwined, pointing out that Taiwan has an ample pool of managerial
talent, while the mainland has vast labor resources. If both sides of
the Taiwan Strait were to engage in agricultural cooperation, then
agricultural production would increase three or four times.</P>
      <P>Koo said that both sides of the Taiwan Strait should put aside
their differences on the concept of "one China," maintain the status
quo for the time being, and push for cooperation and economic
exchanges.</P>

      <P>The new equipment will help Taiwan's F-16 pilots navigate at low

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Many Australians have tightened their
belts as regards consumer spending due to the Asian financial crisis,
and local manufacturers are bracing for production cuts to cope with
rising stock surpluses, according to the Australian Bureau of
Statistics.</P>
      <P>The ABS figures show that retail turnover rose by only 0.2
percent to A$11.3 (US$7.5) billion in seasonally adjusted terms in
April, well below market expectations.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the sluggish consumer demand resulted in a largely
unwanted 2.9 percent seasonally adjusted build-up in stocks in the
first quarter of 1998 -- the biggest increase in the 13-year history
of the official figures.</P>
      <P>ABS officials said the figures mean that Australian companies
will have to wind back their production significantly over the rest
of 1998 to get rid of the unwanted stock.</P>
      <P>The figures have prompted private economists to revise their
forecast for Australia's gross domestic product growth in the first
quarter of 1998.</P>
      <P>They also believe that the Asian crisis will not fully affect the
Australian economy until the second quarter of 1998 and that the
effect on the first quarter is only the beginning of the impact.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT INDEX DROPS 1.55 PERCENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture under the
Executive Yuan announced on Tuesday that Taiwan's agricultural
production index stood at 98.45 in 1997, a decline of 1.55 percent
from the previous year.</P>
      <P>The COA attributed the reduction to measures enacted to boost
Taiwan's chances of being accepted into the World Trade Organization
and last year's outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, which decimated
the island's hog population.</P>
      <P>The livestock industry's production index for 1997 stood at 92.4,
a drop of 7.6 over one year earlier, according to COA statistics.</P>
      <P>The forestry industry's production index, however, gained ground,
moving up 12.49 percent. Meanwhile, the fishing and agrobusiness
industries' production indexes advanced 2.09 and 1.05 percent,
respectively.</P>
      <P>Rice field acreage grew also. Last year the island had 364,212
hectares of rice fields, an increase of 4.73 percent over the
previous year. Some 2.04 million tons of brown rice were produced
during the island's two growing seasons last year.</P>
      <P>Soybean production, however, nose-dived, dropping 51.28 percent
compared to the previous year, while green bean production fell 35.85
percent. The reductions stem from reduced tariffs on agricultural
imports, which have made both crops less profitable for domestic
producers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>AIDS and drug abuse are two subjects on the
agenda of the upcoming National Anti-drug Conference, which will open
in Taipei on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The supervisor in narcotics administration for the Department of
Health, Li Jih-heng, said the island's rising drug abuse problem is
causing concern about a possible increase in AIDS infections among
drug addicts who use intravenous needles.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's current AIDS infection rate among addicts of drugs taken
intravenously posts 3.6 percent, Li said. This compares to infection
rates of 42 percent in Argentina, 33 percent Uruguay, 26 percent in
Brazil and 11 percent in Paraguay.</P>
      <P>Despite the relatively low infection rate, Li said more must be
done to prevent the island's growing drug abuse problem from
developing into a public health hazard.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE PEOPLE GOING ONLINE IN TAIWAN AND HONG KONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  June  1  (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>There are now 1.75 million people
online in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and the number is increasing day by
day, according to a story which appeared in the Los Angeles Times
business edition on Monday.</P>
      <P>It began when three Stanford graduate students created a website
with information from Taiwan in Chinese three years ago. It was so
popular, would-be users jammed the bandwidth, crashing the
university's server.</P>
      <P>"We got kicked off," said one of the culprits, Hurst Lin, "but we
realized we were on to something."</P>
      <P>That "something" became Sinanet.com, one of the Web's most
popular Chinese-language sites, with an estimated 1.2 million page
views, or hits, per day. The guide was like a beacon in one of the
Internet's last frontiers, where finding specific Web pages in
Chinese was largely a matter of guesswork, word-of-mouth, and luck.</P>
      <P>Last month, after several years of jumping technical and
political hurdles, Sinanet added a Chinese search engine, and on
Wednesday will unveil a partnership with Excite, another search
engine, that will allow users to comb one million Chinese Web pages
for information.</P>
      <P>Previously, creating a special system to navigate the Chinese
portion of the Web didn't seem possible or profitable. In mainland
China, fewer than 10 percent of the population have their own
telephones, much less computers. Access to the Internet was expensive
and tightly restricted, Chinese Web sites were sparse, and Internet
advertisers nonexistent.</P>
      <P>But since the Beijing regime has begun to officially encourage
Internet use for research and business, providing computers for
universities and state-owned companies, user numbers have surged from
60,000 to nearly 600,000 in just over a year, according to
information industry sources.</P>
      <P>Another 1.75 million people are online in Taiwan and Hong Kong,
putting the region on track to be the world's largest market after
the US by 2001.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC MINISTER LAUDS TAIWAN'S ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  1  (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China has weathered the
Asian financial crisis because its economy possesses key
characteristics lacking in less economically stable Asian countries,
said ROC Minister without Portfolio Shirley Kuo.</P>
      <P>Addressing the 12th meeting of the Canada-Taiwan Business
Association, which opened in Ottawa on Monday, Kuo compared the
economic characteristics of Asia's hardest-hit countries to those of
Taiwan. Although Taiwan has been affected somewhat by the crisis, she
said, overall it has performed well.</P>
      <P>Kuo cited Taiwan's 1997 economic growth rate of 6.8 percent, an
increase of 15.6 percent in private sector investments, an increase
in consumer prices of only 0.9 percent and an unemployment rate of
2.75 percent as indications of Taiwan's economic health.</P>
      <P>Countries such as South Korea and members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), however, face sharply lower economic
growth rates, in some cases negative growth, Kuo said.</P>
      <P>Analyzing the economies of South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Thailand, Kuo cited numerous factors that contributed
to those countries' financial crises: private investments far
exceeding long-term savings, massive levels of foreign debt --
particularly in the form of short-term loans -- and a tendency for
companies with low capitalizations to borrow excessive sums all led
to weak financial infrastructures, she said.</P>
      <P>In Taiwan, on the other hand, savings have exceeded investments
for years, enabling domestic savings to support investments in the
public and private sectors, which has lessened the need for foreign
funds.</P>
      <P>In addition, Taiwan has huge foreign exchange reserves, whereas
crisis-stricken countries have accumulated huge trade deficits made
worse by overvalued currencies.</P>
      <P>Taiwan spent 15 years in a gradual process of economic and
financial liberalization that included lowering tariffs, opening the
island up to imports and speeding up manufacturing advancements. The
crisis-stricken countries, meanwhile, were liberalized their
economies more slowly.</P>
      <P>Besides calling for mutual cooperation among all Asian countries,
Kuo said that greater cooperation between Canada and Taiwan, in areas
such as commerce, investment, finance and technology, could help
promote regional prosperity.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MND CONFIRMS UNIDENTIFIED UNDERWATER OBJECT AS PLA SUBMARINE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) on
Tuesday confirmed that one of two unidentified underwater objects
discovered by the ROC military last Thursday was a communist Chinese
submarine.</P>
      <P>The diesel-powered People's Liberation Army submarine was first
spotted by the navy near Hsiyu, a small islet in the Penghu
(Pescadore) island group in the Taiwan Strait, according to MND
spokesman Kung Fan-ting.</P>
      <P>An S2T anti-submarine aircraft was then mobilized by the air
force to jointly monitor the still-unidentified target.</P>
      <P>The submarine went into silent mode when it discovered it was
being monitored, before escaping amid bad weather that caused
turbulent waves and poor visibility, Kung said.</P>
      <P>The navy and air force have been continuing with a
search-and-rescue operation since March 20 when a brand-new F-16 jet
fighter disappeared during a routine training flight, Kung noted.</P>
      <P>The other unidentified underwater object, an old sunken ship, was
not positively identified until Monday, when a special undersea probe
was sent to the seabed, Kung said, adding that the two confirmed
identifications dashed earlier hopes that one of the objects was the
missing plane.</P>
      <P>The ill-fated F-16, serial number 6828, was on a training flight
in the skies about 50 kilometers southwest of Makung, capital of
offshore Penghu County, when it lost contact with military air
controllers at around 2:30 p.m.</P>
      <P>A full-scale search has since been underway, but all efforts to
find the plane or its two-man crew of pilot and instructor have so
far proved futile.</P>
      <P>Under its 10-year military modernization plan, the ROC struck a
deal with the United States in 1992 to purchase 150 of the advanced
F-16 fighters, at a reported cost of more than US$20 million each. To
date, 44 have been delivered, and the first squadron of the new
planes was formed last October. A second squadron was commissioned
earlier this year.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Free publication of newspapers, free
elections, freedom of expression, and other features of democracy
may come to mainland China in a decade, a well-known mainland
Chinese dissident said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Wang Dan, who was released from prison on a medical parole in
April, said this is because "the trend of historical development is
irresistible."</P>
      <P>However, it may take a longer period of time for the democratic
system in mainland China to take root, he added.</P>
      <P>Wang, 29, was arrested in July 1989 and sentenced to four years
in prison for his part in the Tiananmen incident, which took place
one month earlier. He was arrested again in October 1996 and
sentenced to 11 years in prison for advocating democracy.</P>
      <P>He said in a telephone interview with the Hong Kong Radio Station
that he still hopes mainland China will become a democratic country.</P>
      <P>Wang, who is living in exile in the United States, said that
last week's Legislative Council election in Hong Kong has indicated
that people there are very enthusiastic about democracy. Voter
turnout in the election was extraordinarily high. On this basis Hong
Kong will have "a very good influence" on mainland China, he added.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong can serve as a window, through which mainland Chinese
can watch the outside world and can also see the benefits of
implementing democracy in Hong Kong, he said, adding that Hong Kong's
role in catalyzing the democratization of mainland China is
irreplaceable.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that President Bill Clinton will urge
Beijing leaders to release more political prisoners, when he visits
the Chinese mainland later this month.</P>

      <P>The China Steel Group, established recently
by China Steel Corp. in cooperation with 13 other related companies,
is targeting an annual turnover of NT$150 billion (US$4.4 billion) by
the turn of the century, CSC Chairman Wang Chung-yu said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Of the companies involved in the partnership, CSC and China Steel
Structure are now listed companies, while China Steel Carbon is
expected to become a listed company at the end of this year, Wang
added.</P>
      <P>Formerly a state-run enterprise, CSC has strived to diversify its
operations and expand operations overseas since it was privatized
nearly two years ago.</P>
      <P>The group is currently in discussions with Vietnam's state-owned
steel corporation and several other companies on a possible
joint-venture steel mill in Vietnam, Wang said. An agreement on the
investment project, aiming at the production of 210,000 metric tons
of stainless steel plate in coils annually, is expected before year's
end.</P>
      <P>Among its diversification initiatives, the group is planning a
line to develop up-stream materials for making silicon wafers, as
well as lines for producing integrated circuit chips and other
high-tech products, Wang said.</P>
      <P>By diversifying its operations, the group's turnover is expected
to top US$5.88 billion annually by 2005, Wang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SEEKS DELAY IN MFN VOTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Clinton administration is seeking to
delay an annual vote on Beijing's trade status that could embarrass
the President before he leaves for a summit in Beijing on June 24.</P>
      <P>President Clinton has until June 3 to renew mainland China's Most
Favored Nation trade status. The yearly renewal process often ends up
a review of the mainland's human rights record, proliferation of
weapo2s and trade practices.</P>
      <P>After the President renews a country's MFN status, Congress has
90 days to override the decision. No Congress, however, has yet
overturned a presidential decision to award mainland China MFN
status.</P>
      <P>Although renewal is ultimately expected, this year's debate will
be saddled by allegations that mainland China donated money to the
Democratic Party, according to reports from the World Trade
Organization. The administration has come under heavy criticism over
the allegations.</P>
      <P>Congress is expected to agree to delay the vote, but observers
believe attacks on the administration will only be deferred until
after the summit. "This way Republicans get to rain on any positive
publicity the President gets out of the trip," the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>The mainland's MFN status imposes the same low-level tariffs on
mainland Chinese goods as that apply to imports from most US trading
partners. The US business community launches intense lobbying efforts
whenever mainland China's MFN status appears in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>The administration, meanwhile, is trying to head off two
controversies. First, some of the money donated to the Democratic
Party by California businessman Johnny Chung appears to have come
from Liu Chaoying, the daughter of mainland China's most powerful
military official. These revelations put Liu at the center of a
Justice Department investigation into alleged attempts by mainland
China to influence the 1996 congressional and presidential elections.</P>
      <P>The administration is also under fire for allowing a US satellite
to be launched atop a mainland Chinese rocket. The satellite was
built by Space Systems Loral, whose chairman had made large
contributions to the Democratic Party. At the time the license was
granted, the company was reported to be under investigation by the
Justice Department for passing sensitive information to mainland
Chinese.</P>

      <P>A survey in the wake of the recent
Indonesian unrest has found that a majority of Taiwan businessmen
believe the turmoil will dampen Taiwan's investment in Southeast
Asia.</P>
      <P>The poll, commissioned by Lai Shih-pao, a National Assembly
member belonging to the opposition New Party, found that 49.4 percent
of the small- and medium-sized enterprises interviewed think the
government should review it's "go south" policy which encourages
local firms to invest in Southeast Asia rather than mainland China.</P>
      <P>Among the respondents, 61.5 percent said the Indonesian upheaval
has discouraged them from investing there, while 75 percent think the
government should review its "no haste, be patient" policy regarding
investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Nearly half, or 48.7 percent of the respondents, said the ROC
government has not provided them with sufficient assistance, and
named the following areas, in order of priority, in which they would
most like to see improved government help: the conclusion of
investment-protection pacts; the provision of information or
consulting services; comprehensive evacuation plans in cases of
emergency; help for investors claiming compensation for damages; and
better loan services.</P>
      <P>Of a total of 1,023 questionnaires distributed in the survey
conducted between May 21-26, only 165 replies were considered valid,
43 percent of which approved President Lee Teng-hui's policies
regarding business.</P>
      <P>The survey results were released at a public hearing on the
relative merits of the government's "go south" policy compared with
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party's "go west" policy, which
encourages businessmen to put their money into mainland China.</P>

criticized the government's policy of countering market forces by
trying to divert the island's capital flow from the lucrative
mainland China market to the turmoil-besieged Southeast Asian markets
for political reasons.</P>
      <P>This policy has been largely successful, partly because Beijing

      <P>After Pakistan's sixth nuclear test,
exporters in many East Asian countries, including Taiwan, have

increased risks of doing business with Pakistani firms.</P>
      <P>According to a recent report in the Islamabad-based Business

and South Korea, have informed their Pakistani business partners that
they would not accept letters of credit of 120 days or 180 days
issued by Pakistani banks. Exporters are instead asking for guarantee
letters issued by foreign banks.</P>
      <P>The report cited the country's recent nuclear tests for the

      <P>The move, coupled with a recent freeze by Pakistan's national

    <HEADLINE>NARCOTICS-RELATED CRIME ON THE RISE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Narcotics-related crime has risen over the
past year and drug abuse among adolescents has also become more
prevalent, a senior law enforcement officer reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Wu Ying, director of the anti-narcotics center under the Ministry
of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB), issued the warning at a
national anti-drug meeting held at the Veterans General Hospital in
suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>Wu said drug-related crime increased last year, reversing a
downward trend that began in 1993 when the government launched a war
on drugs aimed at eradicating illegal narcotics trafficking and abuse
on the island.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Wu said law enforcement authorities
handled more than 45,000 new narcotics-related criminal cases in
1997, up 24 percent from the year-earlier level. Meanwhile, 2,900
kilograms of contraband drugs were seized last year, up 40 percent on
the 1996 figure.</P>
      <P>"All these figures indicate that drug crime surged again in 1997
after declining steadily for four years," Wu noted, adding that
mainland China remained the largest source of narcotics smuggled into
Taiwan last year.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Liu Wei-chung, a prosecutor with
the Taiwan High Court, said the number of repeat drug offenders has
also risen steeply in recent years.</P>
      <P>Repeat offenders accounted for 31 percent of narcotics-related
convictions in 1993. This percentage rose to 41 percent in 1994, 47
percent in 1995, 52 percent in 1996 and 62 percent in 1997, according
to government statistics.</P>
      <P>Liu attributed this rise mainly to the high profits to be made in
the drug trade and the difficulties involved in overcoming drug
addiction.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Liu said, drug abuse among teens and young adults has
also become more rampant, with the number of convicted juvenile drug
offenders picking up 3.09 percent in 1997 compared with the
year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>His claim was illustrated by official tallies which show that the
number of convicted drug abusers aged between 14 and 24 made up 24
percent of total offenders in 1995, rising to 26 percent in 1996.</P>
      <P>The national anti-narcotics meeting was part of a series of
activities held to mark the June 3 Opium Suppression Movement Day,
which has been observed since 1930 in commemoration of the 1839
burning of imported opium in China during the Opium War against
Britain.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan delivered a keynote speech at the
opening ceremony of the meeting, in which he reaffirmed the
government's determination to continue its all-out anti-narcotics
campaign for the nation's well-being.</P>
      <P>Lien said that as Taiwan sits on a convenient geographical
location and has a liberal, booming economy, many international drug
rings try to use the island as a narcotics transshipping and money
laundering center.</P>
      <P>"Against this backdrop, we must step up cooperation with other
countries and mainland China in thwarting such attempts," Lien said,
adding that Taiwan must also establish a comprehensive legal system
to fight all narcotics-related crime.</P>
      <P>Lien said relevant government agencies should also join forces
with private social groups to help drug addicts quit their habits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COSTS FOR SYDNEY'S OLYMPIC GAMES SKYROCKET TO US$4 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 3 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The cost of hosting the 2000 Olympic Games
in Sydney has ballooned to A$6 billion (US$4 billion) from the
original estimate of A$2.3 billion (US$1.5 billion), according to New
South Wales (NSW) Treasurer Michael Egan.</P>
      <P>In submitting the 1998-99 budget at the NSW parliament yesterday,
Egan said the total cost of hosting the Olympic Games in Sydney would
exceed US$4 billion.</P>
      <P>When Sydney defeated Beijing in a bid to host the event in 1993,
its proposal did not take into account the costs for items such as
police security, waterway maintenance, transport and health
services.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Organizing Committee of Olympic Games' (SOCOG) updated
estimate has NSW government spending on construction of venues and
other infrastructure at A$2.2 billion (US$1.47 billion), private
sector spending at A$1.1 billion (US$730 million), and an additional
A$617 million (US$411 million) in government spending.</P>
      <P>The Olympic Games will be held in September 2000, in Sydney with
more than 10,000 athletes from at least 100 countries expected to
compete in various events.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States leads the world in
Internet usage with almost 40 percent of its total population having
gone online. Taiwan ranks fifth ahead of Japan, the United Kingdom,
South Korea, mainland China and France, according to a poll conducted
by Intel.</P>
      <P>During his visit to Tokyo, Intel Chairman Andy Grove said Japan
was lagging behind the US in information technology (IT) investment
and warned that if this trend continued, Japan could fall behind in
its global competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Japanese investment in IT is running at two percent of
gross domestic product compared with four percent in the US.</P>
      <P>The primary driver of growth in the IT industry was the
Internet, Grove said. In Japan, only 23 percent of all businesses
were connected to the Internet compared with 50 percent in the US.</P>
      <P>He added that the Internet business market in the US is growing
dramatically, and at last count was worth 1.25 trillion Japanese yen
compared with only 81.8 billion yen in Japan.</P>
      <P>Japanese companies are the world's dominant suppliers of hardware
in this digital age, but the country is reliant on American companies
for operating systems and for microprocessor units.</P>
      <P>Grove said it would take more than a year for Japan and other
Asian countries to catch up to the US in Internet usage.</P>
      <P>The Intel survey results ranked Malaysia second in the usage of
the Internet, followed by Australia and Germany. Taiwan ranked fifth,
followed by the UK, Japan, Korea, France, mainland China, Thailand,
the Philippines and Russia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENIOR APEC OFFICIALS AGREE ON AGENDA FOR TELMIN3</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  2  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior officials of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) set the agenda for the Third APEC
Ministerial Meeting on the Telecommunications and Information
Industry (TELMIN3), which is slated to start Wednesday in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The two-day senior officials' meeting proceeded smoothly with
representatives from the 18 APEC economies reaching an agreement on
several significant areas of cooperation.</P>
      <P>They agreed to push forward a pro-active agenda on
electronic-commerce (e-commerce). To do so, they defined a
constructive APEC telecommunications reference framework for action
which will:</P>
      <P>1. promote e-commerce for use by businesses and consumers;</P>
      <P>2. contribute to the harmonization of the region's e-commerce
policies;</P>
      <P>3. promote the development of e-commerce infrastructure, services
and applications in ways relevant to the needs of users in the
region; and</P>
      <P>4. facilitate the electronic delivery of government services.</P>
      <P>These initiatives will enhance the capabilities of APEC economies
to harness available information technologies to function effectively
in an increasingly digital economy.</P>
      <P>Recognizing the importance of the private sector in this field,
officials have recommended an enhanced partnership with the private
sector to ensure the success of these efforts.</P>
      <P>The officials also expressed their commitment to work
cooperatively with other APEC forums that have also undertaken
e-commerce activity, in particular the APEC Electronic Commerce Task
Force. Both Singapore and Australia are co-chairs of this task force.</P>
      <P>Senior APEC officials also finalized details of the world's first
multilateral Mutual Recognition Arrangement (MRA) covering
telecommunications equipment.</P>
      <P>The MRA will reduce technical barriers to trade in
telecommunications equipment by allowing equipment to be tested in
the exporting economy in accordance with the importing economy's
standards. Telecommunications equipment can then be accepted in the
importing economy with minimal additional regulatory action, thereby
reducing the time it takes for a product to appear on the market.</P>
      <P>Negotiations on the MRA were concluded in the short space of nine
months with the majority of APEC economies indicating on Wednesday
their willingness to commit to dates for their participation.</P>
      <P>Ministers are expected to endorse this landmark agreement when
they meet on Thursday, conference sources said.</P>
      <P>Senior APEC officials also identified a key impediment to
economies' transition into the digital economy, that is, access to
basic telecommunications infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The senior officials will seek the ministerial endorsement of a
list of Universal Access Principles which will provide guidance on
how APEC economies should address this task in a manner consistent
with existing legal and regulatory environments of each economy.</P>
      <P>TELMIN3 sources said the APEC task force on e-commerce was set up
in response to a call by APEC leaders last November for a coordinated
APEC-wide work plan on e-commerce.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The US International Trade Commission
(ITC) voted Tuesday to investigate patent infringement charges
against 12 companies, including one from Taiwan's Hsinchu Industrial
Science Park.</P>
      <P>Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation of Tokyo, Japan, and Mitsubishi
Chemical America, Inc. of New York, filed the complaint on April 30,
1998. The items in question are certain organic photoconductor drums
and other similar products.</P>
      <P>Under the Tariff Act of 1930, section 337, it is illegal to
import to the United States, sell for importation, or to sell within
the United States after the importation, items and products which have
been patented in the US.</P>
      <P>Mitsubishi, the patent owner for the organic photoconductor drums
identified the following companies in its complaint: Sinonar Corp. of
Hsinchu, Taiwan; AEG Elektrofotografie GmbH, of Warstein, Germany;
AEG Photoconductor Corp., of Hamilton, Ohio; Dainippon Ink &amp;
Chemicals, Inc., of Tokyo, Japan; DIC Trading (USA), Inc., of Fort

      <P>By instituting an investigation, the ITC has not yet decided on
the merits of the case, the commission said in a press release.
Within 45 days after instituting the investigation, the ITC will set
a target date for completing the investigation.</P>
      <P>The administrative law judge will make an initial determination
as to whether there was a violation of section 337, and that initial
determination is subject to review by the commission.</P>
      <P>The products at issue in the investigation are coated cylinders
that are the central components in laser printers, copier machines,
facsimile machines, and other electrophotographic machines.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW ARMS SALE UNRELATED TO BEIJING SUMMIT: ROC DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposed sale of an advanced radar
system for the Republic of China's newly acquired F-16 jet fighters
"seems not at all related" to the upcoming summit in June between US
President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
Chiang Chung-ling, the ROC's minister of national defense said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Monday's announcement by the US Department of Defense that it is
willing to provide Taiwan with 28 Pathfinder/Sharpshooter navigation
and targeting pods just weeks before the Beijing summit appeared to
indicate the US' commitment to continued defensive arms sales to the
ROC military.</P>
      <P>However, Chiang ruled out the possibility that this second major
weapons deal between the US and Taiwan so far this year "bears any
relations to the Beijing summit," and has no "special meaning" in
this respect.</P>
      <P>Chiang stressed that established US policy was followed in the
proposed US$160 million deal, the main purpose of which is to improve
the navigation and targeting abilities of some of the F-16s.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon said the Pathfinder/Sharpshooter pods allow the F-16
to navigate at low altitudes and find targets more accurately.
According to defense industry sources, the new equipment also greatly
improves night flight safety.</P>
      <P>The Pentagon has informed the US Congress of the planned arms
sales to Taiwan. Congress has 60 days to object to the deal,
otherwise the sale will go forward.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has taken delivery of 80 F-16s since the two countries
struck a deal in 1992 for the sale of 150 F-16s, with another 20
still in the US, where they are being used at US air bases to train
ROC pilots.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FPC MAY SIGN INVESTMENT AGREEMENT WITH MAINLAND CHINA: REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3  (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Wang Yung-ching, chairman of the board of
the Formosa Plastics Corporation (FPC), is likely to sign an
investment agreement with mainland China's Fujian Province, according
to an unconfirmed report.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Investment Commission under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) stressed that an investment agreement is just
an expression of intention, rather than an actual investment, and
thus does not violate regulations laid down by the government of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>However, as a leader in Taiwan's petrochemical industry, FPC's
intentions are of great concern to the government, and although
Wang's current trip to the mainland is a personal affair, MOEA
officials said it is under close scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Wang is scheduled to meet with Fujian provincial government
officials during his trip, said the report, which also disclosed that
Wang has paid visits to several "important ports" in the province, in
addition to continuing his commitment to construct a power plant in
Zhangzhou, also in Fujian.</P>
      <P>The report said Wang is likely to sign an investment agreement
with Fujian Province, which will probably be connected with FPC's
intention to play a future leading role in the petrochemical and
energy resource industries on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The MOEA officials said that it is still uncertain whether an
investment agreement will be signed, but added that they are
monitoring developments in the matter very carefully.</P>

    <DATELINE>Ottawa, June 2 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Representatives from Canada and the Republic
of China announced the signing of a joint communique on developing
bilateral trade relations at the 12th joint meeting of the
Canada-Taiwan Business Association (CTBA), which ended Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The communique was signed and read by Tom Appleton, chairman of
the CTBA, and Theodore Cheng, chairman of the Canadian Committee of
the Chinese National Association of Industry and Commerce. They both
noted that the optimistic atmosphere surrounding the two-day meeting
was further enhanced by the lively discussions and the continued
prosperity of Canada and Taiwan's economies.</P>
      <P>The importance both governments placed on the conference was
evident in the attendance and speeches of Sergio Marchi, Canada's
minister of international trade; John Manley, Canada's minister of
industry; Shirley Kuo, ROC's Cabinet minister without portfolio and
George S.Y. Chen, ROC's executive vice minister of transportation and
communications.</P>
      <P>Marchi lauded Taiwan for being a dynamic economy which "has
weathered the region's pressures better than most. Its resilience is
a clear testimony both to its internal strengths and its
international reputation."</P>
      <P>Marchi said bilateral relations should be based on
non-discriminatory and mutually beneficial agreements. He said he
hoped Taiwan could accomplish this to ensure its early entry into the
World Trade Organization. He also urged both sides to speed up
negotiations over an agreement to avoid double taxation.</P>
      <P>Manley indicated that the potential for the two economies to
become partners was great, and cited the signing of a memorandum of
understanding for cooperation in communications and information
technologies on Monday as an example. In addition, he suggested
aviation safety and environmental technology as other ideal areas for
cooperation.</P>
      <P>The next joint meeting of the CTBA is scheduled to be held in
Taipei next year. Doug Young, a heavyweight in Canada's Liberal
Party, replaced Appleton as chairman of the association on Tuesday,
and Keith Pope, vice president of Canadian Airlines International
became the new vice chairman. They pledged continued efforts to
improve Canada-ROC economic relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TSMC CHAIRMAN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT SEMICONDUCTOR SECTOR'S FUTURE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  3  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Morris Chang, a heavyweight in Taiwan's
semiconductor industry, said on Wednesday that he sees "no dark
clouds" over the semiconductor industry, despite its current setback
in the island's stock market resulting from the regional financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSMC) chairman made
the optimistic remarks in a speech on the future development of
Taiwan's semiconductor industry at Computex Taipei '98 on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The massive five-day exhibition opened on Tuesday at the Taipei
World Trade Center, with 892 local and foreign businesses displaying
their latest information technology products.</P>
      <P>Chang said that Taiwan is enjoying a similar experience to that
of Japan in developing its high-tech sector, explaining that like
Japan, Taiwan holds a precious resource -- professional personnel
full of creative energy, who have created in a relatively short
period a semiconductor sector able to compete in the international
market.</P>
      <P>Chang pointed out that the semiconductor industry did not start
to take root on Taiwan until 1976, when the government began trying
to introduce new technologies to the island from the United States.</P>
      <P>In less than two decades, the semiconductor sector has grown into
one of Taiwan's leading industries, with a current production value
of around NT$247.9 billion (US$7.29 billion), he said.</P>
      <P>Chang added that the island is home to 60 design companies, three
manufacturers of silicon wafer materials, 20 silicon wafer makers, 23
packing factories and 11 companies for product tests.</P>
      <P>The chairman said that he is very optimistic of the sector's
future development, noting that although a number of semiconductor
stocks have been seen significant declines recently, this merely
reflects periodical sluggishness.</P>
      <P>However, Chang indicated that Taiwan's semiconductor industry is
now suffering from insufficient innovation, which is expected to be
the sector's largest obstacle to business expansion and development.
He suggested that domestic enterprises and educational institutes
should spare no effort to cultivate innovation resources that are
able to contribute to the sector's continued competitiveness.</P>

      <P>Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman
Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China, is unlikely
to pay a visit to the mainland before October, ranking officials in

visit the mainland prior to the event. They opined that the SEF
chairman will probably realize his mainland trip in late September
or, more likely, early October.</P>
      <P>During the interim period, the mainland authorities will make
gestures showing that they would welcome a visit by Koo, while at the
same time seeking to damage Taiwan's international image with moves
such as the recent spying allegations against several Taiwan
businessmen, in a bid to push the United States into compromising on
the "Taiwan issue," the MAC analysts said.</P>
      <P>After an impasse of almost three years, cross-strait relations
began showing signs of improvement in late April after the SEF and
its mainland counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- reached consensus on arranging a meeting
between Koo and his ARATS counterpart Wang Daohan within this year.</P>
      <P>But bilateral relations again hit a low ebb after the ARATS
turned down an SEF invitation on May 12 inviting an ARATS vice
secretary-general to visit Taiwan in late May.</P>
      <P>Turning to the possible Koo-Wang meeting, the MAC officials
warned the government of Beijing's intention to use the occasion to
make the US believe that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have
agreed to end their state of hostility, thus backing their demands
that Washington stop arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semiofficial organizations set up to
represent Taipei and Beijing in bilateral exchanges in the absence of
formal contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Regular SEF-ARATS talks were unilaterally cut by Beijing in 1995
after President Lee Teng-hui paid a visit to the United States
earlier that year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIB TO HELP ABDUCTED GIRL SEEK HER BIRTH PARENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 3 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) said
on Wednesday it will help a Taiwan girl who was sold to an Australian
couple by a criminal ring in March 1981 to find her biological
parents.</P>
      <P>CBI Deputy Director Lin Kuo-tung said the girl, whose Chinese
name is Lin Mei-li, was one of 64 Taiwan babies sold to couples in
several Western countries by the Chu Li-ching white slavery ring in
the late 1970s and early 1980s.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the girl was sold to an Australian couple
residing in Melbourne for US$3,000 - US$4,000 when she was six months
old.</P>
      <P>"With the CBI's assistance, Mei-li, now 17, will fly to Taiwan on
June 9 for a homecoming visit in the company of her adoptive
parents," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin Mei-li, who was named Kartja Elizabeth Wunderle by her
adoptive parents, will hold a news conference to plead for public
assistance in seeking her real parents.</P>
      <P>Lin said the CBI will collect DNA samples from Mei-li to
facilitate the identification of her biological parents.</P>
      <P>Lin further said CBI officers have already questioned Chu
Li-ching, the mastermind behind the white slavery ring, and her
accomplices, about Mei-li's birth parents.</P>
      <P>"However, none of them knows who Lin Mei-li's parents are," Lin
said, adding that if her parents come forward, the CBI will arrange
for them to meet their daughter in private to protect their privacy.</P>
      <P>Lin said the CBI still doesn't know whether Mei-li was born out
of wedlock and deserted by her parents or whether the baby girl was
stolen by the ring.</P>
      <P>Chu's white slaving ring was busted in 1982, by which time it had
sold 64 babies for adoption in the United States, Australia, Germany
and Switzerland.</P>

      <P>President and Kuomintang Chairman Lee
Teng-hui on Wednesday urged the National Health Insurance Bureau to

encourage the public not to squander government medical resources.</P>
      <P>He called on the NHIB to partially refund insurance deductions or

cards for an entire year. Each card entitles a person to six visits
to hospitals or clinics.</P>
      <P>Lee also requested that the bureau consider subsidizing three
special groups -- laborers without permanent employers, handicapped

    <HEADLINE>RESIDENTS NEAR FORMER RCA PLANT TO BE GIVEN FREE PHYSICAL CHECKUPS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 3 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following a controversy over a contaminated
tract of land in Taoyuan, northern Taiwan, the Taiwan Provincial
Assembly has decided to give local residents free physical
checkups.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Assembly will also ask the Taiwan
Provincial Government to compensate the former workers of the now
defunct RCA factory and their relatives.</P>
      <P>Peng Tien-fu of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party said
in the Taiwan Provincial Assembly on Wednesday that the
victims of the contaminated land are not limited to former workers at
the factory, but also include local residents who consumed well water
contaminated by the factory.</P>
      <P>Peng demanded that the provincial government's Department of
Health provide local residents with free physical checkups, and that
tap water be supplied to the whole area.</P>
      <P>He said that the Department of Labor Affairs should compensate
the former workers according to labor vocational damage regulations,
and provide help for the families of workers who have already died.</P>
      <P>At Peng's request, the national assembly passed a resolution to
convene a meeting of environmental officials, labor representatives
and related agencies, to discuss the problem as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Quality Protection Foundation, a non-profit
group, said recently that as many as 43 former RCA workers contracted
cancer due to water contaminated by the factory. Nearby residents
have also reported cancer cases. For many years, RCA provided the
contaminated ground water for the workers to drink because tap water
was not available at the site at that time.</P>
      <P>RCA established a production facility for the manufacture of
electronics and electric home appliances on the 23.71-acre plot in
1970. The US-based General Electric Co. took over the plant's
operations in 1986, and two years later, the operation went to
French-based Thomson Corp. The factory was closed several years ago.</P>
      <P>The land now belongs to two local companies -- Hong Yi and Chang
Chung -- which reportedly purchased it for some NT$1.6 billion
(US$48.8 million).</P>
      <P>The two companies first applied to rezone the industrial land for
commercial and residential use shortly after the purchase, but the
application was put on hold in 1994 when reports emerged that RCA had
dumped toxic waste into wells on the land for nearly two decades,
seriously contaminating the whole area.</P>
      <P>At the request of the two companies, GE and Thomson launched a
six-month clean-up project late last year to get rid of the
contaminated ground water, and the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) has now been informed that the clean-up is
complete.</P>
      <P>The EPA is scheduled to examine the site later this month, and if
the project is found to have been unsuccessful, the site will be
declared "permanently contaminated" and banned from commercial and
residential use.</P>

      <P>The Third APEC Ministerial Meeting for
Telecommunications and Information Industry officially opened at
Singapore's Ritz Carlton Hotel Wednesday morning with more than 700
delegates and industry leaders from APEC's 18 member economies
attending.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening ceremony, Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said the Asian economic crisis was partly due to
globalization and revolutionary changes in telecommunications and
information technology.</P>
      <P>"Our world has shrunk in distance and time," he said. "Financial
decisions and the transfer of funds can be made at the click of a
mouse, far away from the place where their impact is felt. This is
the global village we are living in."</P>
      <P>He said the meeting's theme "Realizing the Asia-Pacific
Information Society: Reaping the benefits of convergence for the
Asia-Pacific's new role in the Global Information Society" is
appropriate and timely.</P>
      <P>The creation of an Asia-Pacific information society will shape
not only the development of telecommunications and information
technology but also future society, he said.</P>
      <P>The prime minister warned against countries in the region being
diverted from developing their information infrastructures by the
current economic crisis.</P>
      <P>"The financial crisis has shown how crucial it is for us to deal
with the challenges of an increasingly interdependent and networked
global environment," he said. "Our markets have become so interlinked
that the difficulties one economy faces invariably affect other
economies."</P>
      <P>In response to these challenges, several APEC economies,
including Singapore, are constructing national information
infrastructures and implementing national IT plans, he said.</P>
      <P>Last year, he said, Singapore launched its pilot national
multimedia broad-band network, Singapore ONE. By the end of this
year, Singapore ONE will be available not only to all homes and
businesses but also to schools, libraries and community centers.</P>
      <P>He said Singapore will link its information superhighway with all
APEC economies. So far, Singapore ONE has broad-band connections to
Canada, Japan and the United States, he said.</P>
      <P>Besides the ministerial meeting, ministers and delegates held
separate dialogues with telecommunication and IT industry leaders on

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's growth rates for the next two
years are expected to fall only slightly short of its 6.8 percent
growth in 1997, according to a forecast by the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council (PECC).</P>
      <P>The PECC forecasts growth of 6.3 percent in 1998 and 6.4 percent
in 1999.</P>
      <P>While Taiwan's economic growth may slow slightly over the next
two years, its private investment outlook during the period is
expected to brighten. With the opening of new international air
transport routes, increased investment is expected in cargo-carrying
aircraft. Ongoing, large-scale construction projects will bring in
further investment as well.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's government is expected to continue removing investment
obstacles and promoting the build-operate-transfer model being
followed in the construction of its high-speed rail project. The
establishment of the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park is also
expected to induce more domestic and foreign direct investment in
electronics, the report said.</P>
      <P>Based on these factors, private investment is expect to grow
about 14 percent in 1998-1999. This is Taiwan's highest growth rate
in the past seven years. The continuing privatization of state-owned
enterprises, however, means investment in publicly owned enterprises
will register negative growth.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's real growth of exports and imports in 1998 is
expected to amount to 7.6 percent and 7.2 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The PECC further forecast a three percent rise in the consumer
price index and a five percent rise in the wholesale price index in
1998.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan has weathered the region's economic turmoil,
owing to its healthy economic fundamentals, the local currency has
dropped more than 15 percent since last October.</P>
      <P>But Taiwan should be able to cope with the turmoil and continue
its robust economic performance over the long term, according to the

Taipei Council. The KMT mayoral hopeful said the election should be a
battle among gentlemen.</P>
      <P>Because of his lack of experience in local government
administration, Ma called on the councilors to provide him with
information on how the city's government can be improved.</P>
      <P>The KMT councilors not only welcomed Ma's return to the party but
also said they would establish a strategic task force to back up him
in the election campaign.</P>
      <P>Ma noted that while serving as justice minister, he received
support not only from the KMT but also from both opposition parties.
As a result, he is confident that he can help mend relations between
the Taipei government and the council, which have been tense since
Chen was elected mayor.</P>
      <P>In related news, Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian on Wednesday said
his performance while in office guarantees he will win the election.
Chen also reiterated his determination to improve the city's
administration in the six months that remain before he faces the
city's voters.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-shien, the New Party's nominee in the Taipei mayoral
race, on Wednesday continued his attack on Ma's credibility. Wang
chided Ma for entering the race after saying more than 200 times he
would not run.</P>
      <P>The former Minister of Finance, however, stressed that his
election campaign will not focus on criticizing Ma or Chen. He added
that while he may have had an incentive to team up with Ma in the
past -- their common goal being Chen's removal from Taipei's helm --
he said that now there is only a slim chance of cooperation between
the two men.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>UNI Airlines, Great China Airlines and
Taiwan Airlines have been given the green light to merge into a
single company, which will also operate under the name UNI Airlines,
an UNI official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Hung-chih, president of UNI Airlines, said that the augmented
UNI Airlines, with a combined staff of nearly 2,000 employees, will
devote itself to both domestic and regional routes, including flights
to Phuket, Palau and Rangoon.</P>
      <P>After the merger is completed, the company will have a fleet of
32 planes and will serve cities throughout Taiwan, as well as
offshore islands.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the new company hopes to build a close-knit
network, so that wherever there are airfields, "there are UNI Airline
planes."</P>
      <P>UNI Airlines is an offshoot of EVA Airways.</P>
      <P>Lin said that in the past year, Taiwan's domestic air industry
has undergone drastic changes. All airlines need to provide
better service, improve their reputations and maintain decent
flight safety records to distinguish themselves from competing
airlines, he said.</P>
      <P>A spate of air disasters earlier this year prompted a review of
flight safety records and suggestions that some of the island's
smaller airlines merge.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Farmers will have to increasingly rely on
genetic engineering to produce enough food to feed the world's
growing population in the next 30 years, according to reports from
the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"People must realize that these GMO or genetically modified
organisms are going to be part and parcel of agriculture production,"
Graham Blight, president of the International Federation of
Agricultural Producers, said in the WTO report.</P>
      <P>"There's something like US$18 billion worth of crops grown ...
now in the world from genetically engineered products. It will be far
greater than what we have seen in the past 15 years," he stated.</P>
      <P>Blight said it will be possible to develop every single vegetable
variety through genetic engineering in the next five to 10 years.</P>
      <P>Aside from better quality products and higher yields,
biotechnology may also be the answer to shrinking farmlands and water
resources.</P>
      <P>"(Biotechnology) is going to increase productivity," Bob Frieson,
second vice president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, was

      <P>Farmers said they would need more land and water sources if they

      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard and
his senior ministers for the first time criticized Member of

      <P>Howard told Parliament Wednesday that Hanson's speech on the

      <P>It was the first time Howard has spoken out against Hanson since
she made her first parliamentary speech on September 10, 1996, which
contained anti-Asian immigration and anti-Aborigine sentiments.</P>
      <P>Howard's comments were followed by those of Deputy Prime Minister
Tim Fischer, who ridiculed Hanson's absence from two-thirds of the

      <P>Federal Treasurer Peter Costello took part in the criticism.</P>
      <P>"Social Hansonism starts from the wrong values. Economic

    <HEADLINE>US DISEASE CONTROL EXPERTS TO HELP TAIWAN ERADICATE ENTEROVIRUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  4  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two specialists from the US' Center for
Disease Control &amp; Prevention (CDC) are due to arrive in Taiwan to
help arrest the spread of enterovirus, which has killed 29 infants in
nearly one month, sources from the Department of Health (DOH) said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The US epidemiologists are expected to visit major medical
centers in Taiwan to discuss enterovirus cases and to conduct
laboratory diagnostic tests.</P>
      <P>According to reports as of Wednesday night, a total of 29 babies
and children have died of complications caused by enterovirus
infections, particularly enterovirus 71, since an epidemic broke out
early last month.</P>
      <P>Ten more young patients were admitted into hospitals in critical
condition on Wednesday, increasing the number of hospitalized cases
of those affected by enterovirus to 132. Conditions of some of those
are extremely critical, and chances of survival are slim.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the reported number of infected children who visited
hospitals for treatment totaled 9,047 islandwide as of Thursday
morning.</P>
      <P>Gravely concerned about the epidemic, Premier Vincent Siew on
Thursday ordered the establishment of a crisis prevention task force
to accelerate the effective handling of this disease.</P>
      <P>DOH Director-General Chan Chi-shean visited the Changhua
Christian General Hospital in central Taiwan, where the most number
of fatalities were reported, to gain a better understanding of the
epidemic.</P>
      <P>Doctors remain undecided as to what has led the virus to kill,
and whether the victims died of heart, lung or brain failure. To
determine the cause of death, an autopsy must be performed, but so
far no parent has agreed to permit such an operation on their child.</P>
      <P>While DOH officials say the number of reported enterovirus cases
is beginning to subside, some doctors believe the epidemic has not
yet reached its peak.</P>
      <P>According to Dr. Lee Ching-yun from the Pediatrics Department of
National Taiwan University Hospital, some 200,000 to 300,000 infants
and children have fallen victim to the epidemic islandwide.</P>
      <P>As the group of enteroviruses, including type 71 and
coxsackievirus reported earlier in April, are usually more active
during the summer, they are expected to affect more young children
before September, Lee said. He estimated that the number of infected
children may top 500,000 islandwide over the next four months.</P>
      <P>Many of the infected children develop hand-foot-and-mouth disease
and herpangina, the most common symptoms of the enterovirus
infections. But if victims also suffer from unrelieved high fever,
nausea, headaches, rapid breathing and lack of appetite, parents
should take them to the hospital, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Although the epidemic is found to be more rampant among children
in central and northern counties of Taichung, Changhua, Miaoli,
Hsinchu and Taoyuan, similar cases were also reported in Tainan,
Kaohsiung and Pingtung Counties in southern Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC RANKS SIXTH IN WORLD COMPETITIVE RANKINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  4 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China moved up to sixth
place in the Swiss-based World Economic Forum's (WEF) 1998 global
competitive rankings. Taiwan ranked eighth in last year's survey.</P>
      <P>The WEF placed Singapore on top of its list again this year while
Hong Kong and the United States retained their second- and
third-place positions in the new rankings list released Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Despite the economic turmoil affecting the Asian region, the WEF
said recent data indicated that Singapore would continue to enjoy
good conditions for growth over the next five to 10 years.</P>
      <P>Singapore and Hong Kong performed well in all eight factors used
to compile the rankings; they were openness, government, finance,
infrastructure, technology, management, labor and institutions.</P>
      <P>Other Asian manufacturing economies -- the ROC, Japan, mainland
China, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines
-- scored well on government and labor markets. However, low scores
in technology, management and institutions led to lower rankings.</P>
      <P>The WEF study, which ranks 53 countries and areas, showed that
some of the economies worst hit by the Asian financial crisis saw an
erosion of competitive levels.</P>
      <P>In this year's global rankings, Indonesia ranked 31st, down 16
places; Malaysia ranked 17th, down eight; and Thailand was 17th, down
three. South Korea was ranked 19th, up two rungs while China was
placed 28th, up one notch.</P>
      <P>The United States owed its third-place position to high scores in
finance, infrastructure, and especially technology and management,
the WEF said. It emerged from the world's most competitive large
countries with populations of more than 50 million. Britain was
second and Japan was in 12th place.</P>
      <P>The study noted that entrepot economies -- Hong Kong, Luxembourg,
Singapore and Switzerland -- were easily the most competitive nations
in the world.</P>
      <P>"This group of small, highly open economies has the highest
scores on all of the factors except technology and institutions,
where the Anglo-Saxon countries rank first," the WEF said.</P>
      <P>The top 10 economies in the WEF's 1998 global competitiveness
rankings are as follows:</P>
      <P>Rank Country (area) Competitiveness</P>
      <P>1998 1997 Index 1998</P>
      <P>1 1 Singapore 2.16</P>

      <P>A 25-member parliamentary delegation will
leave for the United States on June 14 to express the Republic of
China's stance prior to US President Bill Clinton's departure for a
state visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>"The nonpartisan delegation will meet with American officials to
express our country's opposition to the so-called 'new three no's'
policy," Jao Ying-chi, a Kuomintang legislator who will head the
group, told the press on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Jao said Beijing has been pushing the Clinton administration to
spell out in more detail its commitment to the "one China" principle,
which is against the creation of two Chinas or one Taiwan, one China,
and is against the independence of Taiwan and its joining the United
Nations or any other organizations involving sovereign states.</P>
      <P>"We hope the United States will not just respond to Beijing's
new three no's demand. It should also listen to our position," Jao
said, adding that his mission will urge the Clinton administration to
push Beijing to promise not to use force against Taiwan, not to
suppress Taiwan's presence in the international community and not to
coerce Taiwan into accepting its "one China" definition.</P>
      <P>During his visit to the mainland from June 25 to July 3, Clinton
will hold a summit meeting with his mainland counterpart, Jiang
Zemin. Jiang said in an interview with AFP Chairman Jean Miot on
Wednesday that the Taiwan issue will certainly be high on the agenda.</P>
      <P>Jao said the delegation will remind Clinton not to sacrifice
Taiwan's rights and interests in his talks with Jiang.</P>
      <P>"We'll express our rejection at becoming a sacrifice of the
Clinton-Jiang summit," he stressed.</P>
      <P>The delegation, composed of legislators and National Assembly
deputies from different political parties, will meet with senior
Clinton administration officials and congressional members as well as
give interviews to major American media during its 10-day US visit.
The mission is scheduled to return to Taipei on June 24.</P>

hospital.</P>
      <P>Wu shot Shen once in the head and once in the breast. He then
shot himself in the head. Both of them remain in critical condition.
Wu used his pistol in the shootings, and the NPA is still trying to
determine how Wu managed to take his gun with him after going off
duty Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The NAP, in analyzing more than 70 police suicides over the past
decade, said broken relationships accounted for about 30 percent of
the deaths, while problems with families, jobs and health were also
causes.</P>
      <P>NPA statistics indicate the number of suicides per year among
policemen peaked at 15 in 1991. Though the number has since declined,
the NPA is alarmed that the suicide rate among policemen is still
higher than that of the general public.</P>
      <P>NPA officials said that the ratio of policemen committing suicide
was 1.09 per 10,000 officers in 1996, while the rate among the
general public was 0.86 per 10,000 people.</P>

    <DATELINE>New York, June 3 (CNA)
(By Huang Kuang-chun and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>On the eve of the ninth anniversary of the
Tiananmen Square massacre, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
proclaimed June 4, 1998 as "New York City Supports Chinese Democracy
Day" in memory of those who died for democracy and freedom.</P>
      <P>In his proclamation, Giuliani remembered Chinese supporters of
democracy who lost their lives or faced long-term imprisonment in the
wake of Beijing's military crack down on June 4, 1989.</P>
      <P>Fifty years after the United Nations announced its Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, New York City seeks to affirm the
efforts of those who have made sacrifices for democracy and freedom
around the world, particularly the pro-democracy activists in
mainland China, Giuliani said.</P>
      <P>The groups and individuals in mainland China and their pursuit of
political, religious and labor reforms have awakened the American
people, allowing them to understand that millions of people in the
world are still living under oppressive policies, Giuliani added.</P>
      <P>A long-time supporter of the pro-democracy movement in mainland
China, Giuliani openly expressed his disgust for Beijing's autocracy
and oppression of human rights by snubbing mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin during his visit to the United States last October.</P>
      <P>Giuliani refused to receive Jiang when he visited New York
because of Beijing's dismal human rights record. However, he received
renowned mainland Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng shortly afterward
and gave Wei a "Key to the City" to express his welcome.</P>
      <P>When Beijing released pro-democracy dissident Wang Dan on medical
parole in April, Giuliani met with him and welcomed him to settle in
New York.</P>
      <P>On the day of the ninth anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre,
mainland China democracy movement organizations and ethnic Chinese
living in New York will stage a protest in front of the mainland
Chinese embassy in New York. Giuliani's proclamation will be recited
as a part of the activities.</P>
      <P>After weeks of protests in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, thousands
of students and workers who were calling for political reforms were
killed or injured on June 4, 1989 in a bloody military crack down.
Hundreds of others were also arrested.</P>

      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the ROC's

mainland China's most urgent need at present is political reform.</P>
      <P>This will lay the groundwork for the implementation of its goal

      <P>With the conclusion of mainland China's First Session of the

      <P>While discussing cross-strait relations, Chang said Taipei has
promoted good relations by gradually lifting restrictions on
private-sector exchanges and creating bodies such as the National
Unification Council, the MAC and the Straits Exchange Foundation.</P>
      <P>Competition between Taipei and Beijing, stressed Chang, should
not be based on diplomatic or military rivalry, nor should it be
rooted as a national or cultural competition. Instead it should been
viewed as a race between different systems, and all Chinese people
should have the right to choose their own way of living, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>RUSSIAN STATE DUMA SPEAKER BLOCKS REVIEW OF TAIWAN RELATIONS BILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Moscow,  June  3  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In a surprise move, the speaker of
the Russian State Duma, Gennady Seleznev, arbitrarily decided on
Tuesday to remove a Taiwan Relations Bill from the agenda for the
parliament's Wednesday plenary session.</P>
      <P>Seleznev, a Communist Party member, personally chaired an
impromptu meeting of the Rules Committee Tuesday afternoon during
which time he said the State Duma need not review the Taiwan
Relations Bill because it doesn't comply with Russia's "one China"
policy.</P>
      <P>Under the "one China" policy, Seleznev said, Russia recognizes
the People's Republic of China as the only legitimate government of
China and that Taiwan is part of China. Against this background,
he said, the State Duma has no reason to screen a Taiwan Relations
Bill.</P>
      <P>Seleznev's remarks drew strong protests from Alex Mitrofanov,
chairman of the Committee of Geopoliticis, who stressed that the
bill is simply designed to regulate trade and economic relations
between Taiwan and Russia, and has nothing to do with any third
country.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Mitrofanov said the bill was formally listed on
the agenda for the June 3 plenary session when the Rules Committee
held its last procedural meeting on May 22. "At an impromptu
meeting, only the order of agenda topics can be changed and
decisions to drop bills from the agenda cannot be made," he asserted.</P>
      <P>As the Communist Party now dominates the State Duma, protests
from Mitrofanov and other pro-Taiwan parliamentarians turned out to
be futile.</P>
      <P>Vladimir Zhirinovsky, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party,
said he will continue seeking to have the bill discussed at the
legislative floor in the future.</P>
      <P>The unexpected development has drawn much media attention. Many
major Russian newspapers gave prominent reports on the Seleznev's
arbitrary decision to "kill" the bill.</P>
      <P>The bill, patterned after the United States' Taiwan Relations
Act, was initiated last year by Mitrofanov and other pro-Taiwan
parliamentarians in consideration of Taiwan's increasing economic
clout in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Since April 1997, Mitrofanov and his colleagues had pushed for
its reading in the State Duma, hoping the enactment of the bill will
lay a legal framework to facilitate Taiwan-Russian exchanges.</P>
      <P>The initiative, however, had met strong opposition from the
Russian executive branch, particularly the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, on the grounds that an administrative decree issued by
President Boris Yeltsin in 1992 is sufficient to take care of
Russian-Taiwan ties.</P>
      <P>Acknowledging that the chances for the bill to smoothly pass the
State Duma in three readings in the near future are slim,
pro-Taiwan Russian parliamentarians said they originally hoped
that discussions on the bill in the parliamentary floor would
help increase Russian public's awareness of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They said Beijing has exerted strong pressure on the Russian
foreign ministry to prevent the State Duma from discussing
the bill.

    <TEXT>
      <P>Cisco Systems Inc., a leading provider of
computer networking equipment, on Thursday signed an agreement with
Taiwan's Institute for Information Industry to provide the island
ADSL technology.</P>
      <P>Six Taiwan companies -- Askey Computer, DB Networks, GVC
Corp., Sun Moon Star, Tecom and Zyxel Communication Corp.
-- expressed interest in joining the ADSL development project, which
is aimed at accelerating the adoption of ADSL technology and
production of ADSL equipment by the island's manufacturers of
communications equipment.</P>
      <P>ADSL, which stands for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line, is a
communications technology that transmit data at up to six megabits
per second -- a speed more than 125 times faster than that of a
56Kbps modem. And unlike other high-speed data communications
technologies, ADSL operates over existing copper telephone wires.</P>
      <P>The agreement was signed by III President Kuo Yun and Cisco Vice
Chairman for Global Operations Gray Daichendt in Taipei in the
presence of Vice Economics Minister Chang Chang-pang.</P>
      <P>The global output of Internet-related products, said Kuo,
currently totals US$40 billion a year, but Taiwan's output amounts to
only US$1.6 billion a year. Cooperating with industry leaders is one
way for Taiwan companies to push further into this market, he said.</P>
      <P>There are currently more than 2 million Internet users in Taiwan,
with 3 million expected by 2000.</P>
      <P>Cisco's turnover for the first half of this year amounted to
US$3.89 billion, up 28 percent from its year-earlier level, according

      <P>Jack Tang, deputy director of the Committee for Aviation and

engineering talent is crucial to improving flight safety.</P>
      <P>He estimated that by 2004, the production value of Taiwan's

Chia-cheng that he is not open-minded and has not contributed
anything to Taiwan's democratization.</P>
      <P>Ma announced his decision to run in the year-end mayoral election
for Taiwan's largest city last week, giving a shot in the arm to the
KMT, which has found it difficult to find a candidate strong enough
to challenge the incumbent, Chen Shui-bian of the opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Lin blasted Ma, a former minister of justice and currently an
associate professor of law at National Chengchi University, for
serving a conservative regime, advocating an outdated indirect
presidential election system, and supporting the National Security
Law, which Lin said limits the freedom of the people.</P>
      <P>Ma, who is considered the KMT's best hope for winning the mayoral
race, resigned as minister without portfolio last year, saying at the
time that he would not join the race on the KMT ticket.</P>
      <P>He said Lin's lack of understanding of past events has led him to
a misguided conclusion, pointing out that before the National
Assembly amended the Constitution in 1994 to allow direct
presidential elections, the KMT had already weighed the possibilities
for both the direct and indirect systems.</P>
      <P>Turning to the National Security Law, Ma said that it was at his
insistence that articles limiting the people's freedom of speech were
dropped from the draft law which was later enacted by the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Ma also lauded Mayor Chen for playing an important role in past
opposition movements and contributing to the democratization of

    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 4 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's economy is expected to decline
sharply in the second quarter of this year as the full force of the
Asian economic meltdown hits the country, economists predict.</P>
      <P>This comes after surprisingly strong growth of 4.9 percent
between April 1997 and March 1998.</P>
      <P>The Australian Bureau of Statistics released economic figures
showing the country's gross domestic product rose a solid 1.3 percent
in the first quarter of 1998.</P>
      <P>"Australia is probably the fastest growing country in the
industrialized world and certainly the strong economy of the Asian
region," said Federal Treasurer Peter Costello.</P>
      <P>Private economists, however are skeptical about the ABS figures.
They said Australia's robust growth was largely the result of an
unintended build-up of unsold goods by manufacturers and retailers
with private consumption flattening and exports falling.</P>
      <P>They said manufacturers will be forced to reduce their production
significantly over the second quarter of this year to clear their
shelves as consumer spending is expected to remain weak -- reflecting
the impact of the Asian crisis on consumer confidence, which will
slow the country's economy.</P>
      <P>The economists said the latest figures could represent the
economy's peak growth period. Growth will certainly slow in the
coming months, they said, as the full force of the Asian crisis hits.</P>

its 'one China' definition," said Lyu-shun Shen, director of the
MOFA's North American Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Shen made the appeal while meeting with a group of legislators
who will leave for the United States on June 14 to express the
Republic of China's basic stance on relations across the Taiwan
Strait prior to Clinton's departure for his two-week mainland visit
later this month.</P>
      <P>Shen said the ROC hopes the Clinton administration will not just
respond to the Beijing-proposed "three no's" overture. "The United
States should take into account our new three no's."</P>
      <P>He went on to urge Clinton not to issue any unilateral or joint
statement concerning Beijing's "three no's" overture. "Such moves
are very unfriendly," Shen noted.</P>
      <P>Beijing's "three no's" overture is against the creation of two
Chinas or one China, one Taiwan, and is also against the independence
of Taiwan and its joining the United Nations or any other
organizations involving sovereign states.</P>
      <P>Shen said the ROC also hopes Clinton will not issue any public
statement hinting that the "one country, two systems" formula
Beijing has used to take over Hong Kong may be applicable to Taiwan.
Clinton will make a stop in Hong Kong during his two-week mainland
visit from June 25 through July 3.</P>
      <P>Shen further urged the United States to faithfully implement the
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, its "six guarantees" to Taiwan
issued in 1982 and its 1994 review of policy toward Taiwan. All
these documents require the US to imporve substantive ties with
Taiwan and provide the island with defensive weapons to ensure
security and stability in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chang King-yuh
said Clinton should not discuss Taipei-Washington relations with
his mainland Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, during his
Beijing visit.</P>
      <P>While Beijing has consistently intended to discuss what it calls
the "Taiwan issue" with Washington, Chang said there is no such
issue. "What exists is how the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
will treat each other," Chang stressed.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The revenue from securities transaction
taxes in May is expected to drop to NT$6.8 billion (US$198.83
million) from April's NT$9.3 billion (US$271.93 million) due to
dwindling turnover in the stock market, the Ministry of Finance (MOF)
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-chung, director of the Department of Accounting under the
MOF, said however that the accumulated securities transaction tax
revenue for fiscal 1998, which ends in June, will reach a record
high, as the revenue collected since the beginning of last July has
reached NT$111 billion (US$3.25 billion).</P>
      <P>Hsu said that the turnover in the stock exchange and
over-the-counter market in May amounted to NT$2.266 trillion
(US$66.26 billion) and is expected to bring tax revenue of some
NT$6.8 billion (US$198.83 million). Over the 22 transaction days in
May, daily turnover averaged NT$103.03 billion (US$3.01 billion), he
added.</P>
      <P>He indicated that if daily turnover in June can be maintained at
NT$95 billion (US$2.78 billion) on average, the total securities
transaction tax revenue for fiscal 1998 will surpass NT$117 billion
(US$3.42 billion), giving a record high.</P>
      <P>The annual securities transaction revenue target of NT$57.2
billion (US$1.67 billion) for fiscal 1998 was reached as long ago as
Dec. 9 last year, when the daily market turnover for that day surged
to NT$219.25 billion (US$6.41 billion).</P>
      <P>The share prices on Taiwan stock exchange dropped 217.24 points
on Thursday to close at 7425.96 on a market turnover of NT$92.97

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Roy Wu, spokesman for the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs (MOFA), on Thursday expressed his ministry's
appreciation for the support from 77 Russian lawmakers for Taiwan,
although a bill they raised on bilateral cooperation was vetoed on
Wednesday in the 450-seat State Duma, the lower house of the Russian
parliament.</P>
      <P>Expressing gratitude to the 77 lawmakers who voted in favor of
the proposal, Wu said the Republic of China government will continue
boosting two-way relations based on existing ties.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire services reported on Wednesday that the Russian
parliament had rejected the bill, with parliament speaker Gennady
Seleznyov explaining that "the State Duma is unaware of the existence
of such a country."</P>
      <P>After verification by the ROC representative office in Moscow, Wu
said that what Seleznyov meant is that "there is no country called
`Taiwan' in the charter of the United Nations."</P>
      <P>Wu lamented the failure of the bill's passage, saying that it
would have helped further increase a wide range of exchanges between
the two countries.</P>
      <P>Bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and Russia entered a new era
when the ROC established a representative office in Moscow in 1993.
Russia also opened a representative office in Taiwan in 1996.</P>
      <P>According to the MOFA spokesman, two-way trade totaled US$1.5
billion in 1997, and the figure for 1998, which has already reached
US$430 million for the first four months of the year, is expected to
hit US$1.8 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan travelers made a total of more than 8,000 visits to
Russia last year, and local colleges, including National Chengchi
University and Tamkang University, have signed a number of
cooperative ventures with their Russian counterparts in recent years
to strengthen technology exchanges.</P>
      <P>In January, a 48-member Russian delegation, led by a former prime
minister, participated in the second technology meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Taipei, and more recently,
a Russian delegation composed of five constitutional court judges
took part in the World Capitals Forum sponsored by the Taipei City
Government late last month.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) has decided to
nominate no more than 114 candidates to run in the year-end
legislative election, and predicts that the party will capture at
least 93 out of the 164 Legislative Yuan seats to be contested.</P>
      <P>The party is expected to complete the final part of its list of
nominees next week, after which it will be submitted for approval by
the party's central standing committee on June 10.</P>
      <P>The ruling party had previously planned to field a total of 112
candidates, until it saw its morale boosted by the fact that Ma
Ying-jeou and Wu Deng-yih are set to represent the party in the
Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections, prompting it to add to its
nominees.</P>
      <P>The spotlight of the KMT nomination is currently on whether
former Provincial Government Spokesman Hwang Yi-chiao will be
nominated to run in Taichung City, in central Taiwan. A high-ranking
KMT official has excluded this possibility on the grounds that Hwang
did not register as a candidate and that the nomination list is
already full. He also denied that Taiwan Provincial Governor James
Soong will be given a say in deciding whether Hwang should be
nominated.</P>
      <P>In the last legislative election in 1995, the KMT captured 85 of
the 164 seats, its worst performance ever, and that the party's
overall share of the vote dwindled to 46.1 percent. The main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party won 54 seats, with 33.2
percent of the vote, while the New Party, with 13 percent of the

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The high-speed train crash in Germany is
not expected to affect Taiwan's cooperation with Germany in building
a high-speed rail system on the island, a senior official with the
Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>MOTC Vice Minister Chang Chia-chu said the cause of Wednesday's
high-speed train crash in the northern German city of Eschede, some
50 kilometers north of Hanover, is still being investigated.</P>
      <P>"If thorough investigations show that the crash has anything
to do with mechanical failures or troubles, we'll demand the main
German contractor to make necessary improvement and provide us with
the safest machine and equipment," Chang said, adding that safety
is the government's top concern.</P>
      <P>Taiwan High-Speed Railway Consortium, which has won the priority
right to negotiate with the MOTC for building the island's first
high-speed rail system under a BOT (build-operate-transfer) formula,
has tentatively decided to introduce Germany's ICE locomotives and
France's TGV double-deck railway cars to Taiwan's high-speed rail
system.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the multinational consortium said it has yet to
sign formal purchase contracts for either locomotives or railway
cars. "In case the German high-speed train crash is really
caused by mechanical problems, we still have room to make
adjustments," he added.</P>
      <P>Basically, the spokesman said, Taiwan's high-speed rail system
will be much safer than Germany's. "We'll build a brand new railway
exclusively for use of high-speed trains, while some sections of the
German high-speed system use conventional railway," he explained.</P>
      <P>The consortium, composed of several major Taiwan business
groups, Siemens AG of Germany and GEC Alsthom SA of France, has yet
to sign a formal agreement with the MOTC.</P>
      <P>The 345 km high-speed ralway, which will stretch from Taipei in
the north to Kaohsiung in the south, is scheduled to become
operational by 2003.</P>
      <P>At least 100 people were killed in Germany's high-speed train
crash, the worst tragedy in that country's railway history since
World War II.</P>

      <P>A central government-level task force will
be set up to help local governments improve their treatment of stray

Thursday.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA), the COA said it will raise funds to subsidize local
governments in order to allow them to improve their measures for
handling the stray dog problem.</P>
      <P>The COA said that it has drafted an "animal protection bill,"
pending the approval of the Legislative Yuan, and that it will also
take effective measures to carry out a sterilization program for
stray dogs before the bill passes the legislative floor, in an
efforts to reduce the number of stray dogs on Taiwan's streets.</P>
      <P>The COA said about 310,000 stray dogs were spayed or neutered
last year, adding that it has also helped the National Pingtung
University of Science and Technology in southern Taiwan to establish
a "halfway house and training center" for stray dogs, in a bid to set
an example of how to protect and regulate homeless animals.</P>
      <P>The COA's remarks came after international animal protection
groups staged protests at ROC overseas outposts in six cities around

      <P>Meanwhile, local animal conservation groups have accused the

      <P>The WEFA forecast that the world economy will grow by 2.6 percent

Asian financial plague which broke out in the middle of last year.</P>
      <P>Global economies, except those of European countries, have not

      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday instructed
the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to take immediate measures necessary to

      <P>Siew issued the directive after hearing a briefing by Finance
Minister Paul C.H. Chiu on the current stock market situation.</P>
      <P>Share prices opened low and closed even lower on the TAIEX on
Thursday, with the index dropping sharply by 217.24 points to close
at 7,425.96, its lowest level since January 14 of this year.</P>
      <P>Chiu said in his report that the MOF has asked the Security and

      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Thursday said
that despite the Asian financial crisis, Taiwan's economic growth for
last year reached as high as 6.81 percent, signaling the sound
economic fundamentals enjoyed by the country.</P>
      <P>Lien told a group of business leaders at a dinner party hosted by

economic growth for last year was its highest since 1992, adding that
with economic growth of nearly 6 percent for the first quarter of

percent, the world's sixth-highest.</P>
      <P>Lien went on to say that South Korea's economic growth posted 3.8
percent negative growth for the first quarter of the year, the
poorest quarterly record in 18 years. Hong Kong and Malaysia have
reported minus 2 percent and minus 1.8 percent growth, respectively,
for the first three months of the year, their first quarterly
stumbles in 13 years. As for Indonesia and Thailand, they are likely

      <P>The vice president also said that according to a survey conducted
by the Far Eastern Economic Review, nearly 30 percent of business
leaders interviewed in 10 Asian countries cited Taiwan as the most
powerful economy in Asia.</P>
      <P>However, he pointed out that Taiwan has already encountered
difficulties in economic expansion as the effect of the Asian
financial turmoil has been felt in its reduced exports to Asian
countries, and he called on the island's corporate leaders to
diversify their export outlets and upgrade their competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Lien also said that as a member of the global village, Taiwan has
to make sure its industrial development meets world wide
environmental protection standards.</P>
      <P>He cited the Kyoto global climate agreement, which is aimed at
helping save the earth from catastrophic global warming, as a good

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S HIGH-SPEED TRAIN WILL DIFFER FROM GERMAN CRASH MODEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  June  6  (CNA)
(By M.J. Tsou &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The high speed railway that the Eurotrain
Consortium is going to build for Taiwan will be completely different
to the one which crashed on Wednesday in the German town of Eschede,
consortium spokesman Ernest Thompson said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Although the precise model to be developed for Taiwan has yet to
be decided, Thompson said, it will be an integrated one which is
completely different to the first-generation Intercity Express (ICE)
train involved in Wednesday's accident.</P>
      <P>During an interview with the CNA in the wake of the worst rail
disaster in Germany's post-war history that has left at least 96 dead
and 42 seriously injured, Thompson said the Taiwan model, to be
jointly developed by Germany's Siemens AG and France's GEC Alsthom
companies, which comprise the Eurotrain Consortium, will be much more
advanced, in terms of both building technology and design concept,
than the ICE.</P>
      <P>No official explanation has yet been given for why the ICE
Munich-Hamburg train slammed into an overpass pylon at 200 kilometers
per hour near the northern German town.</P>
      <P>However, one hypothesis suggests that a faulty wheel casing may
have caused one of the carriages, very likely the first carriage
immediately behind the locomotive, to jump the tracks, propelling two
other carriages into the concrete pillar, and in turn dragging the
other carriages off the rails, according to German news reports.</P>
      <P>In a test ride conducted in northern Germany on May 3, the
Eurotrain Consortium conducted a successful demonstration of the
integrated high speed train system that is likely to be built for
Taiwan, which was witnessed by its Taiwan partners and an 80-member
delegation including the ROC representatives in Germany and France,
Director-General of the Bureau of Taiwan High Speed Rail Liao
Ching-lung, and representatives of the Taiwan High Speed Rail
Consortium (THSRC).</P>
      <P>During the test ride, the Taiwan delegation experienced the
Eurotrain system which uses German-built locomotives and French
double-deck carriages.</P>
      <P>In January 1998, the THSRC was selected by the ROC government as
the "preferred bidder" for Taiwan's planned high speed rail system.
An initial concession agreement between the THSRC and the ROC
government was approved in February this year.</P>
      <P>If everything goes smoothly, the THSRC and the Eurotrain
Consortium are expected to sign a formal contract in July and
construction will begin later this year.</P>
      <P>With a total budget of US$17 billion, the 345-kilometer high
speed rail line is one of the world's largest transportation
infrastructure projects currently under development.</P>
      <P>The project includes a variety of civic work elements, including
viaducts, tunnels and environmental protection features. At a design
speed of 300 kilometers per hour, travel time between Taipei and the
southern port city of Kaohsiung will be 90 minutes with a
three-minute stop in Taichung, central Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SEMICONDUCTOR WORKERS PRONE TO HF POISONING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Semiconductor workers who use hydrofluoric
(HF) acid to etch chips and remove corrosion are likely to develop
symptoms of HF acid poisoning, a doctor at the Veterans General
Hospital in Taipei reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Deng Chao-fang, director of Clinical Toxicology at the hospital,
said that the hospital received 90 cases of HF acid poisoning between
1985 and 1997. Among them, about 60 were contracted in the workplace,
with semiconductor workers accounting for 56 cases.</P>
      <P>Deng said that HF acid is an inorganic acid widely used in the
semiconductor industry for chip etching and corrosion removal.</P>
      <P>The toxicology expert said that careless handling of the acid can
lead to painful skin inflammation, and necrosis, or skin death, in
severe cases, while high doses can even lead to death from
hypocalcemia, or low levels of calcium in the blood.</P>
      <P>In terms of industry sectors, Deng said that workers in the
semiconductor sector accounted for 78 percent of HF acid poisoning
cases, followed by the chemical engineering sector at 9.7 percent,
and the cleaning sector at 6.9 percent.</P>
      <P>Housewives using the acid to remove corrosion in the home also
accounted for 5.6 percent of the cases, he said.</P>
      <P>In view of the rapid development of the semiconductor industry in
Taiwan, Deng urged the sector to make sure they train their workers
and take precautionary measures against acid contamination.</P>
      <P>He advised workers who splash HF acid onto their skin to wash for
20 to 30 minutes using copious amounts of water, and then to apply
calcium gluconate cream or solution before getting to a hospital as
quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the Industrial Technology Research
Institute show that the production value of Taiwan's semiconductor
industry soared to US$10.01 billion in 1997, up from just US$1.57
billion in 1990.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Industrial Development Bureau also reported that
HF acid usage increased to 1,433 metric tons last year from 600
metric tons in 1994, showing that while the island's semiconductor
sector is developing fast, the hazard of HF acid poisoning is also
increasing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AGRICULTURE  LOSSES EXCEED NT$170 MILLION AS FLOODS CONTINUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Pingtung,  southern  Taiwan,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Losses and damage to
Taiwan's agricultural sector had exceeded NT$175 million (US$5.1
million) as of Saturday noon as heavy rains which have battered
southern Taiwan over the last five days were reported to be moving
toward the north.</P>
      <P>Traveling at the head of a seven-member Cabinet mission, Premier
Vincent Siew flew to Taiwan's southernmost Pingtung County on
Saturday to inspect flood-stricken areas there.</P>
      <P>The predominantly agricultural county has been hardest-hit by a
cold front which has brought heavy downpours, resulting in serious
flooding and landslides to southern Taiwan since Monday. Flooding has
affected extensive areas of farmland in the county, causing losses
worth NT$31.7 million in farm produce. The rains have also blocked
roads, left one aquaculturist drowned, and washed away several
farmhouses in the county.</P>
      <P>In addition to promising timely salvage assistance to farmers,
Siew also guaranteed that each hectare of damaged farmland will be
compensated to the tune of NT$6,000 to help the affected farmers get
back on their feet.</P>
      <P>In Pingtung County, several schools were forced to close on
Friday, and firefighters had to be dispatched to rescue students
trapped by rising water. Over 10,000 households in the county
suffered blackouts.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taiwan Provincial Government announced that flood
damage to the island's agricultural industry as a whole had exceeded
NT$175 million as of Saturday noon, with cropland bearing the brunt
of the heavy rains, incurring losses totaling NT$173 million (US$5
million) in that sector alone.</P>
      <P>The worst-affected farmland, totaling 4,338 hectares, was in
Kaohsiung, Pingtung, and Tainan counties in southern Taiwan, and in
central Taiwan's Yunlin, Changhua and Miaoli counties.</P>
      <P>Weathermen have forecast that the front will move north on
Saturday, threatening the central and northern parts of the island
with similar disastrous conditions.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TUNG CHEE-HWA: CHINA WANTS HK TO SUCCEED FOR TAIWAN'S SAKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>China is giving full support to Hong Kong
so that its "one country, two systems" model can work and will be
applied for the sake of reunifying Taiwan -- a bigger fish -- in the
future, according to Tung Chee-hwa, Hong Kong's chief executive.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the mass-circulation newspaper The
Australian published Saturday, Tung said, "China is supportive of
Hong Kong and it wants 'one country, two systems' to succeed."</P>
      <P>Moreover, the mainland is allowing Hong Kong to run itself:
"China really stays out of Hong Kong," he said.</P>
      <P>Despite the recent election victories of Hong Kong's Democratic
Party, Tung said his government will not increase the pace of
democratization in Hong Kong. Instead his main priority is to restore
Hong Kong's economic growth.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong's economy fell two percent in the first quarter of
1998, its first drop in 13 years.</P>
      <P>"The outlook is for a painful adjustment brought about
principally by the very high cost of doing business, property values,
high inflation and high wages," Tung said.</P>
      <P>Although Hong Kong's condition is being made worse by the
region's financial turmoil, Tung said its ample reserves, young labor
force, high level of savings, desire to succeed and acceptance of
technology will enable the territory to rebound.</P>
      <P>Tung said the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the
US dollar. He said he would "absolutely" keep the peg.</P>
      <P>He said Hong Kong's strengths are its position as a financial
center for China and a service provider for the region and its
ability to remake itself.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 6 (CNA)
(By Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Johnnason Liu, director of the Legal Affairs
Department of the Mainland Affairs Council under the Executive Yuan,
on Saturday urged the Beijing authorities to allow families escorted
by Straits Exchange Foundation personnel to visit the four Taiwan
businessmen who were detained recently in the Chinese mainland on
charges of espionage.</P>
      <P>The call was issued because there has been no response from the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait -- the mainland's
quasi-official body authorized to handle civil contacts with Taiwan
-- to a similar request from the SEF.</P>
      <P>The SEF sent a letter to its counterpart, ARATS, on June 2,
expressing its hope that the ARATS could arrange visits between the
detainees and their families and SEF personnel.</P>
      <P>Families of the four detainees have told the SEF that the
businessmen have been involved in mainland investment activities for
several years and could not possibly be guilty of spying, the
families claim.</P>
      <P>As the mainland has not yet responded to requests from Taipei,
Liu remarked an interview Saturday that the authorities in Beijing
need to understand Taipei's concerns, adding that he hopes the
detainees' families, accompanied by SEF personnel, will be permitted
by Beijing to visit their relatives soon.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOUSE COMMITTEE DEMANDS BEIJING TO RENOUNCE USE OF FORCE AGAINST ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 5 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A US House of Representatives committee
passed a concurrent resolution on Friday, demanding Beijing to
renounce the use of force against democratic Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The House Committee on International Relations adopted the
concurrent resolution with a unanimous verbal vote, which is mainly
aimed at acknowledging Taiwan's desire to play a positive role in
the current Asian financial crisis and affirming the support of the
American people for peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and
security for Taiwan's democracy.</P>
      <P>The resolution demanded President Bill Clinton seek, at the June
summit meeting this year in Beijing, a public renunciation by
mainland China of any use of force, or threat to use force, against
democratic Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It also demanded the United States abide by all previous
understandings of a "one China" policy and its abiding interest in a
peaceful resolution of Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>The resolution, introduced by Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-NY) on
April 30, will be referred to the House floor for approval next week.</P>
      <P>Although the resolution is not binding to the executive branch,
it expresses the sense of the Congress. The executive branch usually
would pay due attention to non-bidnding resolutions unanimously
adopted by the House and the Senate.</P>
      <P>During Friday's discussion, Rep. Doug Bereuter (R-NE), chairman
of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, said the concurrent
resolution will convey the Congress' high respect for the people of
Taiwan and its firm conviction that issues related to Taiwan's
future should be resolved by peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Rep. Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), chairman of the Committee on
International Relations said he is pleased to see the
passage of the resolution prior to Clinton's mainland visit
from June 25 through July 3.</P>
      <P>In the past, the US government had demanded Beijing renounce the
use of force against Taiwan. Beijing, however, had consistently
rejected such demand.</P>

(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Canadian think tank said on Friday that
Canada's exports to Asia have dropped by almost a quarter since last
July, a result of the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>In a report on the world economic outlook, the Conference Board
of Canada said Asia's problems will affect growth within the G-7
countries during the next two years.</P>
      <P>It noted that exporters to the region will be particularly hard
hit. Exports to Japan alone -- Canada's second-largest trading
partner -- are down 28 percent since July and down 52 percent to
Southeast Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Although there have been signs of improvement in Asia since
March, the board said the crisis is far from over. The region's
fragile financial system and massive overcapacity will stymie quick
recovery, it predicted.</P>
      <P>Peter Lok, the author of the study, said there is a real danger
of a second round in the Asian crisis. "The sharp deceleration in
economic growth in China and the plunging Japanese yen are
particularly worrying," he said.</P>
      <P>Asia accounts for about 10 percent of Canada's exports. However,
the United States, which accounts for 80 percent of the country's
exports, may already be showing some signs of an Asian slowdown and
that will eventually hurt Canada.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) has been gaining
momentum and is confident of winning the year-end elections, KMT
Secretary-General John Chang said here on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chang said he believes the party's election candidates will win
back voters who might have lost faith in the grand old party.</P>
      <P>Asked whether former Justice Minister Ma Ying-jeou's entry into
the Taipei City mayoral race last week has boosted the KMT's sagging
morale after the long and anguished search for a candidate strong
enough to race against the popular incumbent Chen Shui-bian of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), Chang said it is
evident that the KMT is gaining momentum daily.</P>
      <P>He added that party solidarity will have a positive effect on the
year-end legislative election and the election for Taipei and
Kaohsiung city mayors and councilmen.</P>
      <P>Chang met with party heavyweights on Saturday morning to discuss
the strategy for Ma's campaign support.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, although Wang Chien-hsien, the opposition New Party
(NP)'s candidate for Taipei City Mayor, was placed in an awkward
position following Ma's last-minute entry into the race, NP officials
vowed on Saturday to throw their full weigh behind him, saying that
they will not consider a proposal to join hands with Ma to crush the
popular incumbent.</P>
      <P>Chou Yang-shan, convenor of the NP's National Election and Reform
Committee, said that his party will present its best candidate to the
voters, and will not resort to personal attacks or vilification
strategies in the campaign.</P>
      <P>Jaw Shau-kang, manager of the NP's national campaign, also
revealed that "high-ranking" KMT officials approached the NT in April
about the possibility of cooperating to wrest power from Mayor Chen.</P>
      <P>He said the NP agreed not to present a candidate for the Taipei
City mayoral race on certain conditions, including a promise that
President Lee Teng-hui, in his capacity as KMT chairman, would lift
the ban on the three "noes" -- no direct trade, no direct postal
links, no direct transportation links -- suspend the "go slow" policy
toward investing in mainland China, and recognize NP policies on
foreign policy, environmental protection, and social order.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT refused to accept these conditions and the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  6  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One more infant appears to have fallen
victim to an enteroviral epidemic that has claimed 26 lives in Taiwan
in less than two months.</P>
      <P>In at least one of those cases, the victim succumbed to a
mutation of enterovirus type-71.</P>
      <P>The most recent death was that of a seven-month-old female who
died Saturday morning at Taichung Veterans General Hospital in
central Taiwan. She had been in critical condition since being
admitted on Tuesday, said a pediatrician in charge of the infant's
care.</P>
      <P>The baby, however, did not develop symptoms typical of an
enteroviral infection, such as blisters or a rash on the skin, the
doctor said, which led him to wonder whether the virus had mutated.</P>
      <P>That same day, researchers at Taipei-based Veterans General
Hospital confirmed the existence of a mutation. Medical researcher Wu
Yu-chi said the mutation was discovered in tissue samples taken from
a child who recently died of an enterovirus infection at the same
Taichung hospital as the latest victim.</P>
      <P>There are two main subtypes of enterovirus type-71, and the newly
discovered mutation demonstrates characteristics of both, researchers
said. One subtype results in encephalitis and myocardistis, while the
other results in hand-foot-and-mouth disease.</P>
      <P>Parents of the most recent victim have agreed to allow an autopsy
to be performed. Results from the autopsy are expected to shed light
on the cause of the viral epidemic.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-shiung, a counselor for the Department of Health (DOH),
on Saturday said the enterovirus epidemic seems to have cooled down
somewhat. He cited a latest medical report that indicated throughout
Taiwan, only two enterovirus cases were reported to the DOH over the
past two days.</P>
      <P>However, the DOH official warned that the new viral hybrid could
lead to more deaths.</P>
      <P>He urged people in Taiwan to pay greater attention to personal
hygiene, noting that the virus breeds most easily during the warm and
damp summer season.</P>

major infrastructure construction projects in the province, s
stronghold of Taiwan-funded companies. Wang also inspected the
FPG-invested ventures in the region.</P>
      <P>According to a Hong Kong newspaper, Wang met with National
People's Congress Chairman Li Peng, a former mainland premier, on
Wednesday. During the meeting, Li reportedly had inquired Wang about
his opinions on a set of mainland regulations aimed at protecting
Taiwan investments on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The report further said Wang was originally scheduled to meet
new mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji to seek his understanding of
the reasons behind the FPG's decision to transfer its stake in a
multibillion-dollar thermal power plant project in Zhangzhou, Fujian
to a foreign business group. However, Zhu didn't meet Wang because
of his busy schedule, the report said.</P>
      <P>The FPG's three flagship companies -- Formosa Plastics Corp.,
Nan Ya Plastics Corp. and Formosa Chemical and Fiber Corp. --
originally planned to each hold a 20 percent stake in the US$3
billion Zhangzhou power plant project. However, the FPG, Taiwan's
largest private manufacturing enterprise, was forced to transfer its
stake to a foreign partner earlier this year to avoid violating
Taiwan's "no haste, be patient" mainland investment policy. Under
the terms of the contract with its partner, the FPG will be able to
buy back the stake in the Zhangzhou power plant when Taiwan's
cross-strait investment policy is eased.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui ordered a review of the policy on
mainland-bound investment in late 1996 as Beijing stepped up its
efforts to isolate Taiwan in the international community. Under the
tightened restrictions, local companies are banned from investing in
any mainland infrastructure project worth more than US$50 million as
well as in high-tech industries.</P>
      <P>The "no haste, be patient" mainland investment policy is also
aimed at protecting this country from becoming too reliant on the
mainland market as Beijing has never renounced its attempt to use
force against Taiwan.</P>

      <P>In an investigation of six foreign schools
in Taiwan, only Taichung's Lincoln American School in central Taiwan
was found to have violated regulations, officials of the Department
of Education under the Taiwan Provincial Government said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Officials ordered the investigation after a controversy erupted

      <P>Officials said that among Lincoln American School's 184 students,
three Taiwan nationals were found enrolled in the school's
kindergarten. The school offers a total of 15 classes, from
kindergarten to 12th grade.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China is facing widespread
confusion and rising unemployment as Premier Zhu Rongji moves to
restructure his central government by laying off up to 4 million
public servants by year's end, according to The Sydney Morning
Herald.</P>
      <P>Zhu plans to reduce the number of ministries in mainland China
from 40 to 29, and the reduction program is creating confusion and
being met with resistance, according to the paper.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch from Beijing, the daily's correspondent David Lague
quoted foreign diplomats as saying that some key sections of the
Beijing bureaucracy are now in disarray as Zhu continues to prune the
number of government ministries in the biggest public service
upheaval since the Cultural Revolution.</P>
      <P>"I think he (Zhu) has probably overreached himself this time.
People are worrying about whether they will have a job next week
rather than concentrating on their work," an unnamed foreign diplomat
said.</P>
      <P>Diplomats and businessmen in Beijing said Zhu had been hailed
both within the mainland and abroad for his economic acumen. However,
mainland China's mounting economic difficulties are now too much for
any leader to overcome, they said.</P>
      <P>The Chinese government has mounted a major propaganda blitz to
encourage workers shed from collapsing state-owned companies to find
new jobs, but an urban unemployment rate that has reached about 20
percent makes this nearly impossible.</P>
      <P>Chinese labor activist and political dissident Han Donfang, who
works in Hong Kong for Radio Free Asia, said Beijing appears to have
no answer to its unemployment problem.</P>
      <P>"As a result, the countdown to an explosion of anger has already

trade liberalization in the telecommunications market has been
recognized by other member-economies of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum.</P>
      <P>Transportation and Communications Minister Lin Feng-cheng made
the remarks during an interview with CNA after APEC's three-day
ministerial-level information and telecommunications conference
concluded Friday in Singapore.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is one of 18 members of APEC.</P>
      <P>Lin, who led a delegation aiming to boost electronic commerce and
promote free trade in telecommunications products, spoke of Taiwan's
measures to open its market.</P>

private businesses to provide cellular phones services, and recently
a decision to open satellite and Internet communication markets was
made.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China welcomes a US
congressional resolution urging President Bill Clinton to demand
Beijing renounce the use of force against Taiwan, Foreign Ministry
spokesman Roy Wu said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The House Committee on International Relations on Friday passed a
resolution calling on Clinton to seek from mainland authorities, at
the summit meeting in Beijing later this month, a public renunciation
of the use of force or the threat of the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We welcome this resolution and appreciate all the support the
American lawmakers have extended to us," Wu said at a press
conference.</P>
      <P>Wu said the resolution, adopted with a unanimous voice vote,
indicates that the US Congress hopes to restrict Beijing's threat to
use force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"It also signifies American lawmakers' concerns about peace and
stability in the Taiwan Strait," Wu noted.</P>
      <P>The non-binding resolution notes Taiwan's desire to play a
positive role in resolving Asia's current financial crisis and
affirms the support of the American people for Taiwan's security.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen, June 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Chen Shui-tsai on Saturday
presided over the first meeting called to discuss the status of a
pilot desalination plant on Kinmen, the ROC's major frontline island
outpost, located off the mainland coastal province of Fujian.</P>
      <P>Chen and officials from the Kinmen Water Department heard a
briefing offered by a Montgomery Watson Taiwan affiliate on the
plant's development.</P>
      <P>Construction on the plant, designed by Montgomery Watson and
being built by an engineering operation under the Cabinet-level
Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen, began last
April and is scheduled to be completed next January.</P>
      <P>The desalination plant, once fully operational, is expected to
supply some 2,000 metric tons of water daily.</P>
      <P>Chen said he expects the plant will help ease Kinmen's persistent
water shortages. In Kinmen rain water is scare and running water is
limited, he added.</P>
      <P>The plant is expected to alleviate the more serious shortages
that occur each summer when the island is swarmed by tourists from
Taiwan, who visit the island for its natural beauty and historical
attractions, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Since the ROC government lifted restrictions on tourists
traveling to Kinmen nearly five years ago, about 600,000 Taiwan
tourists visit the island each year.</P>
      <P>On Kinmen, about 20,000 members of the ROC military and an
unknown number of civilians, rely on a combination of running water
and water obtained from reservoirs and storm-water collection ponds.
About 50,000 civilians are registered residents of Kinmen, but it is
not known how many actually live on the island.</P>
      <P>Fujian Province, aware of Kinmen's persistent water shortages,
has offered to provide Kinmen water, since the island is located
closer to Fujian than Taiwan. ROC authorities, however, have been
reluctant to accept the mainland's offer.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan girl who was sold to an Australian

      <P>Kartya Elizabeth Wunderle, now 17, returned to Taiwan from her
Melbourne home for the first time Friday night in the company of her
adoptive mother Nola.</P>
      <P>During her meeting with CIB Director Yang Tzu-ching, Kartya
expressed her strong desire to know her true identity. "I look
forward to meeting my biological parents, and your assistance will be
deeply appreciated," she told Yang.</P>
      <P>Kartya had her blood samples taken at the CIB laboratory for DNA
tests to facilitate the identification of her true parents.</P>
      <P>Kartya, whose Chinese name was Lin Mei-li, is scheduled to meet
the press on Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>CIB officials said they have received phone calls from
some 10 counples in the past few days claiming themselves as
Kartya's true parents, but none of them would come forward or reveal
their identities.</P>
      <P>The CIB unveiled its phone numbers (27678305 and 27670588) and
Kartya's fax number in Australia -- 00261393183523 -- to facilitate

      <P>Kartya was one of the 64 abducted Taiwan babies sold to couples
in the United States, Australia, Switzerland and Germany by the Chu
Li-ching white slavery ring in the late 1970s and early 1980s for up
to US$5,000 each.</P>
      <P>The ring was busted in 1982. Its mastermind, Chu Li-ching also
known as Julie Chu, was convicted in 1982 and had been freed after
serving a seven-year jail term. Some 30 others, including doctors

who posed as parents and signed false adoption agreements, were also

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's grassroots election campaign was
officially launched Sunday as voters islandwide are scheduled to go
to the polls on June 13.</P>
      <P>Election officials said 19,602 candidates are vying for 8,755
wardenships in three administrative districts which are Taiwan
Province, Taipei and Kaohsiung cities.</P>
      <P>There are an additional 6,901 candidates who are competing for
3,727 seats in councils of rural and urban townships as well as
cities in Taiwan province.</P>
      <P>The competition for wardenships in Taipei city is particularly
fierce, with 1,231 candidates vying for 435 posts. This is in part
due to the recent increase in the salary for wardens which is about
NT$45,000 (US$1,323), significantly higher than their counterparts in
Taiwan Province and Kaohsiung. Only 66 candidates are running without
rival.</P>
      <P>There are 1,136 persons in competition for 664 wardens in
Kaohsiung and 17,235 persons for 7,656 wardens in Taiwan Province.</P>
      <P>Although campaigning was not supposed to begin until Sunday, some
candidates began stumping on Friday, according to local papers.</P>
      <P>Other reports of illicit maneuvering include changing the
registered residence of supporters to special constituencies,
violence and four incidents of gunshots aimed at scaring rivals out
of the race.</P>
      <P>However, there were no reported evidence of attempts at
vote-buying. It has been common practice for candidates to hand out
monetary gifts to garner voters. The mass-circulated United Daily
News reported Sunday that some candidates are offering between NT$200
to NT$3,000 in exchange for voter support.</P>
      <P>The elections, widely believed to be a harbinger of the year-end
elections for legislators and mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung, have
taken on new importance since the ruling Kuomintang lost its strong
grip on power in the city and county chief elections in 1997.</P>

      <P>A re-vote for the election of the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) chairman was held on Sunday in Kaohsiung
after violence and vandalism marred the original election on May 26.</P>
      <P>Voting in the southern Taiwan city will complete the process in
which the party will select its next chairman from six candidates.</P>
      <P>In an effort to prevent cheating or a repeat of the violence,
the DPP leadership kept security tight during the event.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung has approximately 16,000 DPP members eligible to vote
in the chairmanship election while the number of party members across
the island stands at around 96,000.</P>
      <P>Polling stations are scheduled to close at 4 p.m. which will be
followed by the counting of Kaohsiung ballots as well as those 40,000
votes which had been sealed and placed at DPP headquarters since the
original elections.</P>
      <P>The counting of votes is expected to be completed by 9 p.m. and
the DPP will hold a news conference at 9:30 to announce the results
of the election. Although the race is being contested by six
candidates, the party's top adviser, Lin Yi-shiung, and
Legislator-at-large Chang Chun-hung are seen as the top favorites.</P>
      <P>Other contestants are Taoyuan County Magistrate Annette Lu,
former DPP spokesperson Sisy Chen, Legislator Yen Chin-fu and Huang
Fu, president of a radical pro-Taiwan independence faction within the
DPP.</P>
      <P>The DPP held its election for party chairmanship on May 26.
However, voting in Kaohsiung had to be suspended after a group of men
stormed into the city's only polling station in Chungshan Stadium and
destroyed tables, chairs and cameras. They also overturned several
ballot boxes ruining hundreds of ballots.</P>
      <P>After the incident, the DPP decided to hold a re-vote in
Kaohsiung while the remaining 30 ballot boxes across the island were
sealed and transferred to party headquarters in Taipei to await a

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A price war between local airliners that
operate Taipei-Kaohsiung flights is expected to break out on Monday
when six carriers call an end to their joint operation cooperation on
flights between the two cities.</P>
      <P>Six local airlines -- China Airlines (CAL), EVA Airways, Far East
Air Transport Corp., TransAsia Airways, UNI Airlines and Formosa
Airlines -- reached an agreement on joint operation on
Taipei-Kaohsiung flights last February.</P>
      <P>U-Land Airlines, one of the seven airliners that ply
Taipei-Kaohsiung flight, was the only company at that time which did
not join the agreement as it targets a different segment of the
market.</P>
      <P>The agreement allowed passengers who held tickets from any one of
the six companies to take flights offered by those carriers in the
pact. Airliners benefited from not having to compete so fiercely
with their pricing strategies. The cost of a one-way ticket rose from
NT$600-700 to NT$1,100 as a result.</P>
      <P>However, a series of aviation disasters, including CAL's crash on
Feb. 16 which killed 202 people and Formosa Airlines' crash on March
18 which claimed 13 lives, resulted in a decrease of passenger load
capacities.</P>
      <P>In the face of fewer passengers, airline companies have launched
a variety of promotional offers to woo back customers, leading to the
end of the joint operation cooperation.</P>
      <P>CAL and Formosa Airlines announced they were withdrawing from the
pact in late March. One-way ticket fares have been cut to NT$999 for
those approaching the airport counter and to NT$760 for those
purchasing tickets via local travel agents.</P>
      <P>Far East Air Transport Corp. is offering one-way tickets at
NT$980 to students, soldiers and policemen. If passengers take
flights between Monday and Thursday with VIP cards issued by the
airliner, they can get an additional NT$200 discount coupon for their
next flight.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, TransAsia Airways offers customers a 15 percent
discount on all flights if they pay by credit card. In addition, the
airliner gives out convenience store coupons with every ticket
purchase on the Taipei-Kaohsiung route.</P>
      <P>The street market price of a Taipei-Kaohsiung one-way ticket is
known to be as low as NT$650, lower than the fare of train ticket for
the highest class.</P>
      <P>Aviation authorities are currently taking a hands-off approach to
the price war. They may however change their policy, but before they
do, local travelers will benefit from the keen competition between
local airlines given that aviation security is not a concern.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian is lagging
behind former Minister of Justice Ma Ying-jeou in a popularity poll
conducted by the mass-circulation newspaper the United Daily.</P>
      <P>The poll showed that 46 percent of the respondents said they
support Ma, the Kuomintang's (KMT) candidate in the contest for
Taipei city mayor, while only 30 percent said they would vote for the
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP) Chen.</P>
      <P>According to the survey results, support for Ma has mounted since
he unexpectedly announced his candidacy for the post last week. In a
similar poll at that time, Ma secured 42 percent of support compared
with Chen's 32 percent.</P>
      <P>The support rate of New Party candidate Wang Chien-shien
remained stable at approximately 5 percent in both surveys.</P>
      <P>However, when asked who had a better chance of winning the
year-end mayoral election, 36 percent of those polled named Ma, while
34 percent picked up Chen. Only one percent said that Wang had the
greatest chance among the three.</P>
      <P>The survey also suggests the gap between Ma's and Chen's support
rates would expand 16 percentage points to 22 percentage points with
Ma gaining 51 percent approval and Chen 29 percent if Wang decides
not to run in the race.</P>
      <P>Asked if they thought Ma's credibility should be questioned
because he refused to run in the mayoral race until the last minute,
25 percent answered yes, while 22 gave a negative response. Thirty
percent felt that Ma's candidacy has nothing to do with his
credibility, while 20 percent had no comment on the issue.</P>
      <P>Even among those who said Ma lacked credibility, as high as 32
percent still believe that Ma is the best candidate for Taipei mayor
compared to 54 percent in that group who said no.</P>
      <P>The poll was based on telephone interviews of 1,056 Taipei
residents held between June 4 and 6.</P>

    <DATELINE>Bonn,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Chinese-Taipei team won a gold and a
bronze metal on the second day of the World Cup Taekwondo
championships being held in Sindelfingen, Germany.</P>
      <P>Hung Chia-chun won a gold medal in the women's feather-weight
class while Hsu Feng-chih of the men's light-weight class beat
competitors from Kuwait and Lesotho, but yielded to Iran.</P>
      <P>Hsu's bronze is so far the first medal won by the Chinese-Taipei
men's team in the three-day contest.</P>
      <P>The Chinese-Taipei women's team have won two golds and two
bronzes in the first two days of the competition. Coaches expect the
team to win the women's group championship if the two competitors in
the middle- and heavy-weight classes perform equally well on Sunday.</P>
      <P>In addition to the two women's divisions, three of the men's
divisions, namely fly-, bantam- and welter-weight classes, will have
compete on the last day of the events.</P>
      <P>Coaches said it was not surprising for the Chinese-Taipei team
to win more medals in the women's divisions. Taiwan athletes have
been winning medals in taekwondo for years and are recognized
internationally as accomplished competitors in the sport.</P>
      <P>In the past, Chinese taekwondo athletes have won more than 200
medals, among which are some one hundred gold medals, in
international competitions. As taekwondo will become an official
event in the 2000 Olympic Games, taekwondo athletes from Taiwan are
considered medal contenders.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT MAY FIELD MA YING-JEOU FOR MAYORAL RACE ON WEDNESDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 7 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kuomintang Secretary General Chang Hsiao-yen
said Sunday Ma Ying-jeou will hopefully be named KMT candidate in the
Taipei mayoral race during the KMT Central Standing Committee meeting
to be held on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The KMT Taipei City Committee has suggested that since only Ma
has registered for the KMT primary for candidates in the Taipei
mayoral race, there would be no point in holding a primary.</P>
      <P>Chang said the KMT screening committee will meet on Monday and
Tuesday to decide the namelist of the third batch of candidates for
the year-end legislative elections.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui is expected to formally support the
fielding of Ma for the mayoral race at the meeting on Wednesday as
there is no other KMT candidate up for the post.</P>
      <P>As for the KMT primary for Kaohsiung mayoral candidates, Chang
said results will be submitted to the KMT Central Standing Committee
to decide on the candidates after the completion of the primary.</P>
      <P>Commenting on cooperation between the ruling party with the
opposition New Party in the mayoral race in Taipei, Chang stressed
that at present, there was no possibility of cooperation between the
two parties, as for future development, it will depend on the
situation by that time.</P>
      <P>Chang also denied allegations made by New Party leader Jaw
Shau-kong that the KMT has sent people to speak with New Party
members on possibility of cooperation between the two parties. He
said the KMT is very careful with its strategy, and any cooperation
between Ma and New Party candidate Wang Chien-shien may incite a
strong reaction from voters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACADEMICS, OPINION LEADERS APPEAL FOR RELEASE OF BUSINESSMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Academics and political opinion leaders
attending a Sunday seminar urged the government to seek the release
of Taiwan businessmen detained by mainland authorities through
political means.</P>
      <P>Quasi-officials in charge of dealing with mainland China
responded to the calls by saying the only way to protect Taiwan
business interests in the mainland was to sign an investment
guarantee accord with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Liu Yih-chun, a research fellow at Academia Sinica, Taiwan's
highest-level research institution, said the most important issue now
was whether the basic human rights of the Taiwan businessmen
currently under arrest in the mainland are fully protected.</P>
      <P>Beijing announced late last month that four Taiwan businessmen
were arrested by mainland state security authorities in March on
espionage charges.</P>
      <P>Liu called on the mainland authorities to make public evidence
which justifies their arrest, noting that the incident will serve as
a benchmark on whether Taipei and Beijing will be able to move toward
cooperation instead of confrontation.</P>
      <P>Central Police University (CPU) Vice President Liu Shih-lin said
Beijing's intention is to use the incident to pressure Taiwan to go
to the negotiating table, and serve as a warning to others conducting
business in the mainland. Similar cases will re-occur in the future,
he warned.</P>
      <P>CPU Professor Huang Yen-tung called on the people of Taiwan to
write a letter to mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin to protest
against the Taiwan citizens' arrest as Jiang prepares to meet with US
President Bill Clinton later this month.</P>
      <P>National Chengchi University Professor Chang Tai-lin said the two
sides should begin talks on a joint effort to crack down on criminal
activities, and to find out whether there is evidence showing that
the Taiwan businessmen had really engaged in illegal activities.</P>
      <P>If the mainland authorities fail to respond positively to
Taiwan's call, then Taiwan residents can consider launching a boycott
against investments and travel to mainland China, he said. Taiwan
should also consider lodging complaints with international human
rights groups as well, he added.</P>
      <P>National Assembly Deputy Wu Mao-hsiung said the case cannot be
resolved through legal means and pointed out that holding political
negotiations is the only possible way of finding a solution to the
problem.</P>
      <P>Echoing Wu's view, National Assembly Deputy Tsai Chih-hung said
the motive behind Beijing's arrest of Taiwan citizens, which took
place just before the ninth anniversary of the June 4 massacre and
the Clinton-Jiang meeting, is "not simple."</P>
      <P>Beijing might use the case to make the United States believe
Taiwan is at fault for strained cross-strait relations, and for
refusing to begin cross-strait talks, Tsai said. He added that
mainland China might be issuing a warning to political dissidents in
the mainland with the arrests.</P>
      <P>He forecast that Beijing would announce a verdict on the detained
Taiwan businessmen and repatriate them back to Taiwan before
Clinton's planned visit to mainland China in a bid to underscore its
efforts in building friendly ties with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>An official of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), Taiwan's
semi-official organization in charge of negotiating with mainland
China in the absence of official relations between the two sides,
revealed that the SEF and a group of legal experts are studying
feasible ways to rescue the Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>Since 1991, there have been around 460 trade disputes across the
Taiwan Strait, according to the official. And 184 of them were
criminal cases against the personal safety of Taiwan investors, such
as killing, kidnapping, detentions and robberies.</P>
      <P>Chou Chang-hsiang, brother of Chou Chang-ming, one of the four
Taiwan businessmen who were arrested by the mainland authorities,
said families of the four men are very worried about their personal
safety in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Expressing the desire that the four be properly treated in
accordance with mainland laws and set free as soon as possible, Chou
called on the government to take a moderate and low-profile approach
to deal with Beijing authorities in the case.</P>
      <P>He said they prefer to take a low-key strategy to prevent
exacerbating cross-strait relations and to ensure the safety of their
family members in the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACTING HEAD OF INVESTIGATIVE BUREAU ACCUSED OF RAPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice announced Sunday it
would investigate charges that acting head of the ministry's
Investigation Bureau Cheng Chuan had attempted to rape the daughter
of a friend.</P>
      <P>The charges, which Cheng has denied, were made by Democratic
Progressive Party National Assembly Deputy Lai Ching-lin at a news
conference Saturday. Lai said Cheng attempted to rape the daughter of
Yang Wan-shou on Sept. 13, 1996 in Paris.</P>
      <P>Lai said Cheng, who studied in France between 1974 and 1977, was
in Paris for a reunion with his acquaintances and friends there.</P>
      <P>He allegedly attempted to sexually assault Yang's daughter, then
19, when they were left alone in a hotel room. Cheng stopped when
Yang's wife Chiou Pai-lien entered the room, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Yang filed complaints with French police and Taiwan authorities
but to no avail because Cheng use his status as deputy director of
the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) to block the
investigation, said Lai.</P>
      <P>Lai added that the victim was so shocked and traumatized by the
assault that she almost collapsed and continues to require
psychological counseling and medical treatment.</P>
      <P>The assembly deputy lambasted Cheng for "biting the hand that
feeds him" because Yang and his wife helped Cheng financially while
he was studying in Paris.</P>
      <P>Lai claims that Cheng also assaulted several other women while he
was a student in France.</P>
      <P>Cheng denied the accusations and dismissed it as a plot to dampen
his chance to head the MJIB.</P>
      <P>Cheng, who has been the MJIB deputy director for over 10 years,
began doubling as director four months ago when the former bureau
head Wang Rong-jou was named deputy finance minister. He has been
hoping to fill the vacancy officially.</P>
      <P>To support his claim of innocence, Cheng ordered his bureau to
disclose his schedule during his stopover in Paris between Sept. 11
and 14, 1996 which was filled with visits and social events with
friends and Taipei diplomats posted there.</P>
      <P>Cheng admitted to having visited Yang at his Paris home, but on
Sept. 12 and not Sept. 13, the date of the alleged incident. He added
that he was accompanied by his entourage during the whole visit.</P>
      <P>Lai, in a news conference on Sunday, called Cheng a liar, and
asked Cheng to reveal his whereabouts on Sept 13, when the victim
claims to have been assaulted by Cheng in a hotel room where he was
staying.</P>
      <P>Lai also produced documents of the original complaint the
victim filed with the French police.</P>
      <P>Cheng refused to reply Lai's accusation on Sunday saying that he
is consulting with lawyers and could take legal steps to defend his
reputation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile the Minister of Justice Liao Cheng-hao, who is Cheng's
immediate superior, decided after an emergency meeting Sunday to
convene a panel to probe the allegations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ministry was informed of Yang's complaints by the
office of president in March 1997, Liao said that he ordered the then
director Wang Rong-jou to look into the case. In a brief issued in
September 1997, Wang said there was no evidence to support the claim.</P>
      <P>Liao promised to reopen the investigation by setting up an ad hoc
panel consisting of senior justice officials to get to the bottom of
the case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INDIA CUTS DUTY TO BOOST IMPORT OF COMPUTER PARTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Computer and computer-related manufacturing
companies with operations in India should benefit from import duty
reductions announced by the Finance Ministry in the national budget
for fiscal 1999 through March 31.</P>
      <P>The impact of duty reductions, which are substantial in some
cases, would have been even more significant if it were not countered
by the 8 percent special customs duty slapped on almost all imports,
the Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU) said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Computer use in India is still very limited, with a ratio of
about two PCs for every 1,000 persons. This means India has
tremendous growth potential, which also makes it a large market for
exports of information technology products. The United States is a
major exporter of both hardware and software to India.</P>
      <P>Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has announced that it wants
to make India a computer software powerhouse in 10 years. A
government-appointed task force has been established to draw up a
national policy to achieve this objective.</P>
      <P>India was committed to abolishing the import duty on information
technology products under the Informational Technology Agreement. The
duty cuts and nationalizations announced by India's Finance Ministry
will make imports of components and parts significantly cheaper than
fully built units, the EIU said.</P>
      <P>The duty on floppy, hard and CD-ROM drives has been reduced to 5
percent from 12 percent. Duty on computer parts excluding printed
circuit boards will come down to 22 percent from 25 percent. Cathode
ray tubes for color monitors will have a duty of 5 percent against 15
percent, and the duty on deflection components for such monitors will
be 5 percent versus 25 percent.</P>
      <P>Duty on software for telecommunications -- a major growth area in
India -- has been cut to 30 percent from 40 percent. Import duty on
telecommunication equipment parts will be 20 percent, the EIU added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR SEEN CONTINUING TO FALL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June 6 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Australian dollar, once regarded as a
stable currency, is expected to continue its slide in coming weeks as
a result of external factors, including weakening commodity prices,
deepening regional problems and Australia's higher foreign debt.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar hit a 12-year low of 60.55 US cents on
Friday, down from 61.07 US cents on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Market economists predicted the currency could trade below 60 US
cents in the coming days or weeks and move toward 55 US cents when
the full effect of Asia's deepening economic crisis hits. The
currency's previous low was 57.10 US cents in July 1986 when
Australia's economy was suffering.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) had failed to
prop up the value of the Australian dollar above 61 US cents even
after spending about A$3 (US$2) billion on Thursday and Friday.</P>
      <P>They believed the RBA will continue to buy more Australian
dollars if the currency, which is one of the 10 most active
currencies, depreciates further.</P>
      <P>The RBA is not strong enough to keep the currency from sliding
further because Australia holds only around A$24 billion (US$16
billion) in both gold and foreign exchange reserves, they said.</P>
      <P>This week's slide of the Australian currency was caused by
massive selling by US investors, including Merrill Lynch, Citibank
and George Soros.</P>
      <P>"Most people in the world are bearish on the Australian dollar
because of Asia which is in a mess and will only be getting worse,"
Rory Robertson of the Bankers Trust Australia in Sydney said.</P>
      <P>Economists believe speculators could further bring down the value
of the Australian dollar because the currency no longer appears to be
the safe haven it was during the Gulf War in 1991.</P>
      <P>They attributed the plunge of the dollar, which was still at 76
US in June 1997, to weakening commodity prices in the world market,
falling Australian exports, surging net foreign debt of A$225 billion
(US$150 billion) in April and above all the impact of the Asian
economic meltdown.</P>
      <P>"There is a risk that in the next three months the currency will
be sufficiently weak to force the RBA to raise (interest) rates. The
trouble is they have a limited number of reserves and the
Australian dollar is not going to rise anytime soon," Robertson said.</P>
      <P>He and other economists believed the RBA could be forced to raise
interest rates because of growing fears of the inflationary pressure
as a result of the falling Australian currency, which causes imports
to be more expensive.</P>
      <P>RBA Governor Ian Macfarlane, who is currently on visit to London,
has ruled out any possibility of further interest rate cuts because
of fears of a higher inflation rate. He described the rate cut as
"unlikely."</P>
      <P>Australia's inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index, is
now hovering between 1.5 and two percent despite five consecutive
interest rate cuts between July 1996 to July 1997, which brought down
the official rate to five percent from 7.5 percent.</P>
      <P>On two-way trade, Australia has long-suffered trade deficits due
to rising imports to its exports.</P>
      <P>Australia's exports, including gold, metals, coal, iron ore,
wheat, seafood and other agricultural products, have dropped due to
slackening demand in Asia, which accounts for about 60 percent of
Australia's total exports.</P>
      <P>Other exports, including education, and tourism, also experienced
declines due to the economic meltdown in Asia.</P>
      <P>But there could be a silver lining for Australian exporters to
North America, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America because
their products are more competitive in these markets.</P>
      <P>Economists believe the US operators of hedge funds will continue
selling the Australian dollar because it is a currency in Asia with
enough liquidity.</P>
      <P>"There is still some selling to be done by US hedge funds because
they are short US dollar and long Asian currencies," Mark O'Leary of
the Macquarie Bank in Sydney said.</P>
      <P>He and other economists believed the RBA will continue to
intervene in the foreign exchange markets to slow down the
depreciation of the Australian dollar.</P>
      <P>"But the intervention will only have some effect on the
Australian dollar because the RBA has only limited power to
substantially prop up the value of the currency," one economist said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese communities in Paraguay and Brazil
have widened their yearly charity efforts and donated over US$50,000
in relief aid as well as food to those suffering from the harsh
winter conditions and drought.</P>
      <P>The disadvantaged in Ciudad del Este and of the City of Foz have
received US$46,000 so far, and refugees of a drought in North East
Brazil received more than ten thousand US dollars.</P>
      <P>A severe drought in northeast Brazil led Chinese residents in Sao
Paulo to form an ad hoc committee to collect and offer aid in the
form of 10,000 kg of food in late May.</P>
      <P>Unwilling to let their fellow countrymen in Brazil outdo them,
the Chinese community in Paraguay offered 1,200 bags of food as
relief for the poor of Foz, a Brazilian frontier city with Paraguay,
in late May. They also donated 50 bags of food to refugees in
drought-stricken northeastern Brazil.</P>
      <P>On June 5, Chinese residents in the Ciudad del Este offered 2,000
bags of food and a similar quantity of cotton quilts for the poor of
the city, adding to the previously donated 50 wheelchairs.</P>
      <P>Ciudad del Este Mayor Juan Carlos Barreto told the CNA that the
citizens of the Ciudad del Este appreciate the kindness of Chinese
citizens very much. The Chinese community is one of the only foreign
communities in the city to provide relief for the poor and their
benevolent actions are increasing. Last year, they offered 1,200 bags
of food and this year, it was 2,000.</P>
      <P>Each bag of food includes five kg of rice, five kg of flour, two
kg of noodles, 900 ml of soybean oil, one kg of bean, 500 gm of
tomato ketchup, two kg of sugar, one kg of salt, 500 gm of powdered
chocolate, one kg of powdered corn, and 500 gm of biscuit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EVERGREEN FOUNDER INVITED TO BE PHILIPPINE PRESIDENTIAL ADVISER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Evergreen Group Chairman Chang Yung-fa, who
maintains interests in shipbuilding, construction and airlines
worldwide, has been invited to be an economics adviser to Philippine
President-elect Joseph Estrada, company sources reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Chang founded Evergreen Marine Corp. in Taiwan with one
second-hand vessel in 1968 and steered the company into becoming the
world's largest container ship operator 17 years later.</P>
      <P>He visited Manila shortly after May 29 when the Philippine
Congress proclaimed Estrada the winner of the May 11 presidential
elections at the invitation of the president-elect.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, Estrada invited Chang to be an economics
adviser to the presidential office, and Chang accepted, the sources
said. Chang was also invited to attend Estrada's inauguration slated
for June 30 in Manila.</P>
      <P>Estrada and Chang, who have been long-time associates since
Estrada served as vice president to the Philippines, met again on
Sunday to discuss business and trade issues as well as national
policies.</P>
      <P>After the meeting, Estrada hinted that he would seek
constitutional changes to spur investment in the Philippines.</P>
      <P>Estrada told reporters that he urged Chang to invest in
Philippine seaports but that Chang was apprehensive due to a
constitutional limit on foreign ownership of most businesses at 40
percent.</P>
      <P>Many foreign investors have gotten around the limit by using
Filipino dummy companies, Estrada said, adding that Chang told him
that foreign businessmen in the Philippines are leery of such an
arrangement because dummy firms sometimes break under-the-table
agreements designed to get around the investment law.</P>
      <P>This will be Chang's second such appointment by a foreign
government. He was named a presidential adviser to Panama and an
honorable consul-general of the Republic of Panama in the Republic of
China on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under Chang's leadership, Evergreen expanded its operations in
1989 to aviation by establishing EVA Airways, Taiwan's second airline
serving international flights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNIVERSITY STUDENTS CONFIDENT IN CHEN'S REELECTION BID: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than half of university students around
the island would like to see incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian
reelected in the year-end mayoral election, according to a survey
conducted by a National Chengchi University student paper.</P>
      <P>The paper sent 811 copies of questionnaires to students at 20
selected universities around the island on June 1-2. It managed to
collect 771 valid replies as of June 6.</P>
      <P>Survey results show that 55 percent of the respondents threw
their support behind Chen, a heavyweight in the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>About 35 percent said they would vote for former Justice Minister
Ma Ying-jeou, a Kuomintang (KMT) stalwart who, in a surprise move,
announced late last month his candidacy for the mayoral contest.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that the support rate for Wang Chien-hsien,
the New Party's candidate for the race, is only about 3 percent.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as many as 66 percent of the respondents said they
believe Chen will be able to win his reelection bid.</P>
      <P>The same survey further found that only 25 percent of the total
respondents are eligible to vote in the Taipei mayoral election. More
than half of these eligible voters said they would vote for Chen if
the election were to take place the following day, while 30 percent
would opt for Ma.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, most of Chen's supporters admire his
guts, decisiveness and efficiency in carrying out administrative
reforms and major municipal development projects, while Ma's
supporters recognize his passion for social services and constant
concern about the well-being of the underprivileged.</P>
      <P>As for the motivations behind Ma's decision to enter the Taipei
mayoral race, most respondents said they think that Ma mainly wants
to help sustain the KMT's dominance in Taiwan politics.</P>
      <P>Many respondents further said they think Ma's integrity is
questionable because he had rejected calls for his candidacy until
the last minute.</P>

      <P>Losses in agriculture from the recent
torrential rains have reached about NT$570 million, the Taiwan
Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry said on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Yunlin County in central Taiwan suffered the biggest losses
totaling NT$293 million, followed by Kaohsiung County in southern
Taiwan with about NT$74 million, the department said.</P>
      <P>The department said affected farmers can apply for low-interest
government loans and subsidiaries and that it has released 4,000
metric tons of frozen vegetables to ease local market demand. It also
said it will begun helping farmers resume operations.</P>
      <P>Rainfall is expected to continue across Taiwan and the department
has called on farmers to take preventative measures to protect their
crops.</P>
      <P>The aquacultural husbandry industry located in coastal areas in
central and southern Taiwan has been blamed for the heavy flooding as
its overuse of underground water sources has lead to the sinking of
soil, officials said.
 The government has encouraged local aquacultural husbandry
cultivators to shift to other sectors or relocate their operations to

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew is scheduled to visit
Republic of China allies Tonga and Solomon Islands in the South
Pacific early in July, Government Information Office Director-General
Chen Chien-jen said.</P>
      <P>The trip, the first by an ROC premier to that part of the world,
may also take Siew to Fiji which has no formal diplomatic ties with
the ROC but maintains cordial relations with Taiwan, the government
spokesman said.</P>
      <P>Siew will attend the celebrations marking the 80th birthday of
King Taufa'ahau Tupou IV of the Kingdom of Tonga, and will be one of
the Solomon Islands' honorable guests at galas marking the country's
40th founding anniversary, according to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>King Tupou, who turns 80 on July 4, paid a four-day state visit
to the ROC in August last year.</P>
      <P>Before proceeding to the South Pacific, MOFA officials said, Siew
will likely fly to Manila to attend the inauguration of Philippine
President-elect Joseph Estrada slated for June 30.</P>
      <P>From Manila, officials hope Siew may stop-over in Australia,
from where he will then proceed to Tonga. Relevant contacts are
being made to secure the possibility of the stop-over, they said.</P>
      <P>If the stop-over approval materializes, Siew will be the
highest-ranking ROC official to set foot in Australia, they noted.</P>
      <P>Tonga and Solomon Islands are two of the ROC's four diplomatic
allies in the South Pacific, which also include Nauru and Tuvalu.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMMITTEE OF 100 URGES CHINA AND TAIWAN RAPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Francisco, June 6 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As US President Bill Clinton prepares
for his visit to mainland China on June 25, the Committee of 100, an
influential Chinese-American group, urged the administration to
encourage greater rapport between Beijing and Taipei.</P>
      <P>At its 7th annual conference, the Committee of 100 presented a
paper on Clinton's coming visit to China titled "Seeking Common
Ground, While Respecting Differences: Essentials of a Winning China
Policy."</P>
      <P>In pursuit of peace in the Taiwan Strait, the committee offered
suggestions for Clinton to propose while on his visit to China for
both Beijing and Taipei to agree upon. They are as follows:</P>
      <P>-- refrain from any political and military provocation that would
increase tension and escalate conflict across the Taiwan Strait;</P>
      <P>-- to establish the three currently banned direct links between
the mainland and Taiwan (shipping, trade and mail),</P>
      <P>-- set, as early as possible, a more concrete agenda for the
leadership of both sides to meet and begin a constructive dialogue;</P>
      <P>-- encourage further economic cooperation;</P>
      <P>-- initiate more artistic, athletic, cultural and educational
exchanges;</P>
      <P>-- hold frequent joint conferences, seminars and study groups
attended by non-government experts, scholars, and business executives
from both sides of the Taiwan Strait to study the question of
peaceful reunification.</P>
      <P>Among the 10-point recommendation to President Clinton, the
committee said the US should encourage direct dialogue between
mainland China and Taiwan so that both sides may peacefully settle
cross-strait issues according to their own terms, continue to make
clear that the US will not interfere or take sides, and reaffirm a
"One China" policy.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration is urged to take positive steps in
handling US-China relations in the following 10 areas: a bipartisan
China policy; frequent meetings with administration officials;
frequent exchange with Congress; promotion of human rights; help
China with the rule of law; encourage China and Taiwan rapport;
promote cultural and educational exchanges; expand trade and export;
global stability and security; and assistance with environmental and
urban development.</P>
      <P>Chinese ambassador to the US Li Zhaoxing had earlier told the
conference that the Taiwan issue is the most sensitive one between
the US and China. However, he does not expect the Clinton visit to
produce any "fourth communique" on the issue.</P>
      <P>As long as both countries can fully implement the words and
spirit of the existing three joint communiques, the Sino-American
relations will be very good, said Li.</P>
      <P>ROC Representative to the US Steven Chen has been invited to

    <HEADLINE>OFFSHORE ASSETS REPORTING LAW JUSTIFIED: CANADA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, June 6 (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An authority in the Canadian government says
the proposed offshore assets-reporting law is justified because a
growing number of Canadians are hiding assets overseas to avoid
paying taxes.</P>
      <P>Canada's Auditor General Denis Desautels said Friday he reached
that conclusion after completing an in-depth review of the
controversial law.</P>
      <P>"Canadians, increasingly, are investing offshore and there are
signs that some are not reporting their foreign income to Revenue
Canada," he said. "Therefore, they are not paying tax on this income.</P>
      <P>"This violates the basic principle that residents in Canada are
taxed on their worldwide income. It is also unfair to taxpayers who
are reporting 100 percent of their income and who must shoulder a
greater portion of the tax burden."</P>
      <P>Desautels was asked by the government last December to review the
law. He concluded it is "justified and appropriate because there is a
potentially serious erosion" of Canada's tax base.</P>
      <P>The conclusion strengthens the federal government's hand to put
the law, which would require Canadians to report their overseas
assets, into effect. This comes in spite of strong opposition from
rich immigrants from Hong Kong, Taiwan and other countries.</P>
      <P>Critics of the legislation disagree with Desautels' findings and
predict the Canadian economy will lose more than it gains because the
law will drive out many immigrant families and discourage others from
coming here. Some have already left Canada in protest, and more
prospective wealthy immigrants are hesitating to come, they said.</P>
      <P>The assets-reporting law has caused a furor in the business
community, particularly in British Columbia, when the federal
government first introduced it in the 1995 spring budget.</P>
      <P>The legislation was passed last spring but implementation has
been postponed until April 1999. It requires Canadian residents to
disclose all assets held outside the country if their original cost
exceeds C$100,000. Exempted are property used exclusively in an
active business, and residences for personal use.</P>
      <P>Critics complained the reporting rules are an invasion of
privacy, are difficult to comply with, and may be a precursor to a
wealth tax.</P>
      <P>Opponents said while they recognized Ottawa's main aim is to stop
the flow of billions of dollars each year from large Canadian
corporations into offshore tax havens, many middle-class individuals
will end up being caught by the low C$100,000 threshold.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN AT THE ROOT OF ASIA'S PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa,  June  6  (CNA)
(By S.C. CHANG)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan is at the root of Asia's financial
problems and because it accounts for two-thirds of the region's GDP,
there is no easy cure for Asia's ailing economies, the Financial Post
of Canada reported Saturday.</P>
      <P>It has been almost a year since Asia's economy slammed into a
wall and provided the rest of the world with an ugly lesson in the
consequences of speculative investing, the Post's editor Diane
Francis wrote.</P>
      <P>In a column which is also carried by The Ottawa Sun, Francis said
Japan's desperate and insolvent banks never confessed to, or dealt
with, the problems that hit them in 1989 with the collapse of the
Japanese stock and real estate markets.</P>
      <P>"To make up for these losses they engaged in ill-considered
lending practices with their neighbors, thus creating speculative
bubbles in real estate and stocks and currencies," she pointed out.</P>
      <P>Between 1996 and 1997, the adverse shift in net private capital
flow was US$109 billion, roughly equivalent to 10 percent of their
combined GNPs before the crisis, she noted.</P>
      <P>As business and government scandals have undermined Japan's
confidence, and the government is pushing down interest rates to
encourage spending, she believes Japan "faces a daunting long-term
problem."</P>
      <P>She pointed to Japan's need to increase investment to fund the
medical and pension needs of its aging population.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the failure of Japan to ignite spending or to
deal with its fat cat bankers' mistakes impedes the recovery in all
of Asia, Francis said.</P>
      <P>She observed that if Japan's banks offer debt relief to other
Asian countries, they can emerge as economically healthy, democratic
societies. "Not GNP growth based on speculative bubbles," she
stressed.</P>

(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan recorded a trade surplus of US$570
million in May, the highest single-month level since December, the
Ministry of Finance statistics showed Monday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan exported US$9.39 billion worth of products and services in
May while imports amounted to US$8.82 billion, according to the
tallies.</P>
      <P>Although the May trade surplus figure registered a decrease of
US$1.3 billion from the same period last year, it was the highest
month's total in six months.</P>
      <P>The May export value was down 7.5 percent from the same period in
1997, while the import value was up 3.1 percent on an annual basis,
the statistics indicated.</P>
      <P>A Finance Ministry official attributed the fall in outbound
shipments last month to plummeting exports to Japan and Association
of Southeast Asian Nations member states, which were down 22.5
percent and 28.2 percent, respectively, from a year ago. Exports to
Hong Kong fell by 5.4 percent, he added.</P>
      <P>The growth in May imports is a result of increased inbound
shipments of machinery equipment, which rose by about 23 percent from
the same month a year ago, an indication that investment sentiments
remain bullish at home, the official said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan fell to
US$1.39 billion in May, Ministry of Finance officials said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The figure compares with US$1.8 billion in February, US$1.81

      <P>But officials noted that exports to Japan have continued to
decline by 20 percent in the first five months of the year compared
to the same period last year.</P>
      <P>If the trends continues, the trade deficit with Japan this year
could exceed the record figure of US$17.3 billion reported in 1997,
they stated.</P>
      <P>They also indicated if Japan's economy rebounds and if Taiwan can
increase its exports to Japan, then the island would still be able to
cut its trade deficit with Japan.</P>
      <P>If the Taiwan dollar continues to slide against the greenback,
officials said it would be difficult to predict the effect of the
depreciated New Taiwan dollar. It could boost Taiwan exports but it
could also lead to inflation due to higher prices on imports, they

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MIGHT AGREE TO CROSS-STRAIT SUMMIT IN INT'L SETTING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China might ask US President Bill
Clinton to help arrange for the top leaders from the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to meet in an international setting before the end of
this year, an opposition lawmaker said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Trong Chai from the pro-independence opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) made the revelation in a written
interpellation to the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Chai said Beijing has furnished the Clinton administration with a
report detailing the issues that communist authorities want to
discuss with Clinton when he visits the mainland later this month.</P>
      <P>Chai quoted the report as saying that if Clinton is willing to
conduct an in-depth discussion on Taiwan-related issues during his
June 25-July 3 mainland visit, Beijing would not mind letting the US
help arrange a cross-strait summit meeting in an international
setting before year's end.</P>
      <P>According to Chai's report, Beijing is also demanding that the US
reaffirm its commitments to the so-called "one China" principle,
which is against the formulas of "two Chinas, or one China, one
Taiwan," and is also against independence for Taiwan or its
membership of the United Nations and other international
organizations involving sovereign states.</P>
      <P>Chai further said Beijing will produce a timetable for resolving
cross-strait issues and will seek Clinton's support for its proposal.
"The two sides are almost certain to issue a joint statement at the
end of Clinton's summit with his mainland counterpart, Jiang Zemin,"
he added.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chai said, Washington and Beijing have yet to come
to terms on the content of this joint statement, as the Clinton
administration still doesn't want to include the so-called "Taiwan
issue" in the statement.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chai reminded the government here of the possibility
of Beijing taking politically motivated action in the run-up to
Clinton's visit, either to highlight its claim over Taiwan or to
justify the urgency with which it wants to tackle what it calls the
"Taiwan problem."</P>
      <P>Chai urged the government to keep a close watch on developments
surrounding the upcoming summit in order to prevent Taiwan from
becoming a sacrificial lamb on the altar of Beijing-Washington
rapprochement.</P>
      <P>He also suggested that the government step up its lobbying of the
US Congress to push American lawmakers to firm up their support for
Taiwan and pressure Clinton not to reach an easy compromise with
Beijing at Taipei's expense.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEWLY ELECTED PARTY CHAIRMAN MEETS WITH DPP OFFICIALS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>One day after winning the election for party
chairman of the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP),
Lin Yi-hsiung met on Monday with several DPP heavyweights.</P>
      <P>Lin, who won 62.07 percent of the vote, beat his closest rival,
Chang Chun-hung, by a wide margin in Sunday's election. Chang managed
to garner only 29.24 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>Lin met with incumbent DPP chief Hsu Hsin-liang, and DPP
secretary-general Chiu Yi-jen over lunch on Monday to learn about
their experiences in leading the country's largest opposition party.</P>
      <P>Addressing the issue of personnel arrangements, Lin said that he
will not bring in any faces from a foundation headed by him, but will
focus instead on ability and character when choosing his right-hand
men.</P>
      <P>Asked about the intercommunication between the DPP and the ruling
Kuomintang (KMT), Lin said that both parties should "join hands to do
what is best for the people," with regard to matters such as national
health insurance and constitutional reform.</P>
      <P>He stressed that all political parties should take the welfare of
the people as their first priority.</P>
      <P>On the year-end elections, he said his party will work with and
coordinate among its various candidates, saying that the party will
combine the benefits of its policy studies, campaign strategies and
its clean image, in the election race.</P>
      <P>He expressed the belief that whatever the elections -- be they
the race for the mayorships of Taipei and Kaohsiung cities, the
election of city councilmen, or the legislative election -- DPP
candidates will have to woo voters through legitimate means, adding
that only if the DPP can win the mandate of the voters will it be
able to win political power.</P>
      <P>The advocate of Taiwan independence also said that Taiwan's
position as an independent sovereignty is an historical fact. He
lamented that this is still not recognized by most nations in the
international community, or even by some local people, and vowed that
the DPP will step up moves to solicit support for the idea.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US NEWSPAPER INTERVIEWS ACER CHAIRMAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  June  7  (CNA)
(By Chu Lu-sheng)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>"The Taiwan economy's blend of
government backing and small-company verve has helped it weather the
Asian financial crisis better than other countries, and is seen as a
model for the rest of Asia," Stan Shih, Chairman of Taiwan's Acer
Group, was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>So said James Flanigan, the Los Angeles Time's senior economic
editor in a report on Taiwan's successful experience in coping with
the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Stan Shih, an electrical engineer who founded Acer group 20 years
ago, said in a an inteview with James Flanigan, the Los Angeles
Time's senior economic editor that the crisis signals once and for
all that the region's reliance on high-volume manufacturing is
ending.</P>
      <P>"Labor-intensive manufacturing of hardware is not sustainable for
any country in Asia," Shih said in the report entitled "Asian
Miracle", adding "Automation and new materials change the product,
and even-cost producers are left behind.</P>
      <P>"That is why every country now must move forward to knowledge,
education, management skills -- the elements of intellectual property
that now define world industry," he was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Americans will find such musings familiar, but Shih is making an
important point for Asia. The rise of Asian economies in the last 50
years, even that of mighty Japan, has been based on the skilled
manufacturing of goods. Cars, televisions, industrial machinery --
turned out with great precision -- won world markets because of high
quality and reasonable prices.</P>
      <P>The quality is still there; the price is even cheaper now. But
something has changed: The skilled manufacturing of Asia has been
devalued. New car plants in South Korea aren't worth what it cost to
build them, not only because the Korean currency, the won, is
devalued but because cars are in surplus everywhere. A plant by
itself has no great value unless it's linked with good customer
relations, a distribution system, and a hard-won brand image,
according to the report.</P>
      <P>Shih's own company, and indeed Taiwan, illustrate these trends.
Shih and a few associates founded Acer in 1976 as a low-priced
manufacturer of computer hardware for other companies, IBM among
them.</P>
      <P>It still makes computers for IBM and many others, but Acer has
become a worldwide giant in its own right, with US$6.5 billion in
sales of computers, software and networking systems. In addition to
Taiwan, it manufactures in the Netherlands, Texas, the Philippines,
Malaysia and mainland China, where it is starting a computer software
development center in Shanghai.</P>
      <P>With a lead from Acer, Taiwan has become a leading manufacturer
of computer systems through entrepreneurial companies working in
government-backed high-tech industrial parks. The work is a big step
forward in sophistication from turning out low-cost home appliances,
Taiwan's chief activity just 10 years ago.</P>
      <P>Shih offered a provocative judgment:</P>
      <P>"One cause of the Asian crisis is that America has moved into the
information age while Japan has remained tinkering with automation
and mass production.</P>
      <P>"The greatest value in business from now on will be in intangible
property. Customers will pay more for knowledge and information,"
Shih said. "Look at the profit of automobile companies -- hardware
earns maybe 5 percent on sales. But software earns 30 percent to 40
percent on each dollar of sales -- look at Microsoft."</P>
      <P>In simpler terms, according to the report, Shih was saying that
service industries will spur the growth of Asia's economies when they
recover. To be sure, Asia's manufacturers will still turn out quality
goods. But in country after country, labor costs and shortages are
forcing a shift of such manufacturing work. Malaysia, for example,
has labor shortages. And manufacturers are leaving mainland China's
coastal cities for lower-wage towns in its vast interior.</P>
      <P>In the future, the report said, look for service industries --
finance, marketing, medical care and business services -- to provide
the bulk of urban employment, as they do in the US and other
developed economies, the report concluded.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 8 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Under the terms of newly revised immigration
laws, Japan on Monday resumed 72-hour visa-free privileges for
Republic of China nationals intending to visit a third country via
Japan.</P>
      <P>The Taipei office of the Japanese Interchange Association (JIA),
which represents Japanese interests in Taiwan in the absence of
diplomatic ties between the two countries, said the privileges are
applicable only to those travelers whose destination is a third
country.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the JIA also began printing Japanese visa stamps
directly into ROC passports, a move seen as recognition by Japan of
the ROC passport as an official document.</P>
      <P>Since switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in
1972, Japan had been issuing separate entry permits to prospective
ROC visitors instead of printing visa stamps directly into their
passports.</P>
      <P>This practice had increased the workload for JIA staff, and with
the rapid increase in the number of Taiwan visitors to Japan in
recent years, this workload had reached an intolerable level.</P>
      <P>In April this year, thanks to strenuous efforts by pro-Taiwan
Japanese lawmakers, the Japanese Diet finally passed amendments to
Japan's visa regulations.</P>
      <P>Under the revised law, Japan now recognizes the validity of ROC
passports and authorizes its representative office in Taipei to print
visa stamps directly into the passports of ROC applicants.</P>
      <P>Since the JIA usually takes only one working day to process visa
applications by prospective visitors from Taiwan, the first ROC
passports bearing official Japanese visa stamps will be picked up
from the JIA office on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>More than 800,000 ROC nationals visited Japan in 1997, up nearly
10 percent from a year ago.</P>

      <P>A seven-month-old baby boy
died in the Taichung Veterans General Hospital on Monday, increasing
to at least 30 the number of babies and young children to have fallen
victim to the enteroviral epidemic currently sweeping Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The child, who had remained in a coma since being admitted to the
hospital on May 18, died of massive organ failure and other symptoms
of enterovirus infection, hospital staff said.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, a seven-month-old baby girl also succumbed to the
infection and died in the same hospital, although pediatricians
suspected that this baby was killed by an enteroviral mutant not
previously seen during the current epidemic, because she did not
develop the symptoms typical of an enteroviral infection, such as
blisters or a skin rash.</P>
      <P>In Taipei County, where the situation up till now has been less
serious than in the counties of central Taiwan, a public kindergarten
in Yungho City on Monday announced a week-long closure of its classes
for children aged 2-4 after seven children were found to have been
infected.</P>
      <P>With some 130 children currently under intensive hospital
monitoring in critical condition, the reported number of infected
children visiting hospitals for treatment was nearing 10,000 as of
Monday, although it is estimated that as many as 200,000-300,000
infants and children have been infected by the epidemic islandwide.</P>
      <P>As the group of enteroviruses -- including type 71 and
coxsackievirus -- responsible for the epidemic are usually more
active during the summer months, they are expected to affect more
children aged under three before September.</P>
      <P>Amid rising panic islandwide among families with babies and young

      <P>A task force set up by the Ministry of

France to probe the case further, Vice Justice Minister Chiang Hao
said on Monday.</P>
      <P>In order to avoid violating the jurisdiction of the host country,
Chiang, head of the task force, said the bureau will send a number of
anti-corruption and personnel officials to investigate the alleged
incident, rather than dispatching a team of police officials.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, National Assembly Deputy Lai Ching-lin of the
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, who called a news conference
to raise the allegations against Cheng on Saturday, released the
contents of a tape as further evidence to back his charges.</P>
      <P>In the tape, Lai's friend, surnamed Yang, accused Cheng of
attempting to rape his daughter, then 20, on Sept. 13, 1996 at a
Paris hotel where he was staying while on official business.</P>
      <P>Yang's wife and daughter were visiting Cheng, a former family
friend, at his hotel, when Cheng made an excuse in order to induce
the mother to leave the hotel on an errand. While she was gone, he
attempted to rape the daughter, and was only stopped when Yang's wife
returned unexpectedly.</P>
      <P>The girl has been reported to have suffered mental problems since
the alleged offense occurred.</P>
      <P>Yang went on to say that he immediately reported the case to
French police later on the same day and has since stopped all contact
with Cheng. He expressed the hope that Lai will help him seek justice
for his daughter and said that "scum" like Cheng does not deserve his
official position.</P>
      <P>Over the past two days, Lai has produced a medical checkup
certificate for the girl issued by a French hospital, and the
complaint form filed at the time with French police, as well as
letters of petition sent by the victim to the Presidential Office,
the Executive Yuan, and the Control Yuan in search of justice.</P>
      <P>Cheng has so far declined to make any comment regarding the

      <P>After the meeting, CBC Governor Peng said the central bank will
intervene if the domestic foreign exchange market shows signs of
abnormal fluctuations.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar faced strong selling pressure on Monday because
of a further weakening of the Japanese yen. The NT dollar sank below
NT$34.5 against the greenback level soon after market opening and
closed at an 11-year low of NT$34.697.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to stabilize the domestic financial
market, the central bank funneled NT$25 billion in postal savings
funds on Monday into the capital market through open market
operations in an attempt to local interest rates within its target
ranges.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, CBC officials called on local people to remain
calm and not to feel panic over the temporary market fluctuation.
The officials stressed that they see no reasons other than
psychological factors for the NT dollar to drop along with the
Japanese yen since Taiwan's financial and economic fundamentals are
healthier than Japan's.</P>
      <P>Economics Ministry officials also said the central bank should
intervene to bolster the value of the NT dollar. Some fianncial

contribute to regional peace and stability.</P>
      <P>In fact, the sources said, the United States has conducted joint
military exercises with five major Southeast Asian countries in the
South Pacific annually. In the past few years, the US has invited
mainland military brass to observe such joint military drills.</P>
      <P>By so doing, the sources said, the US hopes mainland
China will understand its strong military force and deter the
Chinese communists from lightly provoking a war in the region.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Chinese Activists from the United States,
Hong Kong, and Taiwan are planning to go to Tiaoyutai islets by small
fishing boats later this month to proclaim sovereignty over the
disputed islets.</P>
      <P>Tiaoyutai islets are a group of small uninhabitable islands some
200 kilometers northeast of Taiwan. The small islets in the East
China Sea are claimed by Japan, mainland China, and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Disputes over the islets by Japanese and Chinese activists made
headlines after Japanese activists built a lighthouse on one of the
islets in 1996. Chinese activists from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and the
United States landed and put national flags on one of the islets
later that year. They were turned back by Japanese maritime patrol
boats when they were sailing to the islets on fishing boats last
summer.</P>
      <P>The activists are planning to sail to the islets again on June 24
to claim sovereignty over them, one of the activists said, adding
that they will tear up a wooden Japanese national flag on one of the
islets, if they can land on the islet successfully.</P>
      <P>To ensure a successful landing, some of the activists practiced
landing on a small islet off northern Taiwan coast Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YANG SHIH-CHIEN CALLS FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 8 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of State Yang Shih-chien on Monday
urged Taiwan's major business enterprises to set up investment funds
to help promote the biotechnology industry, considered one of the
21st century's most promising high-tech industries.</P>
      <P>Yang, who will preside over the second Steering Review Board
meeting on biotechnology development strategies on Tuesday, said the
Executive Yuan has drafted a plan to promote the industry, and NT$20
billion will be invested in the industry over the next 5 years.</P>
      <P>Government promotion measures include development funds from the
Council for Economic Planning and Development and the Ministry of
Economic Affairs' Medium and Small Business Administration, in
addition to funding from the Executive Yuan. Funding from all three
groups will provide long-term loans to spur product development
within the industry.</P>
      <P>In addition to encouraging the private sector to invest in the
biotechnology industry, the government is attempting to persuade
state-run companies, such as the Taiwan Tobacco &amp; Wine Monopoly
Bureau, the Chinese Petroleum Corp. and the Taiwan Sugar Corp. to
develop biotechnological products.</P>
      <P>The development of a new industry cannot rely solely on
governmental planning and promotion; the private business sector's
participation will play an important role, said Yang.</P>
      <P>The five-day Steering Review Board meeting, to be held at the
National Central Library, will focus on such topics as the continued
development of Chinese medicine, the establishment of mechanisms to
turn biotechnology research into commercial products and the
introduction of state-sponsored research projects.</P>
      <P>In addition, a round-table meeting will be held in which overseas
biotechnology experts and scholars and government officials will
meet. Subjects to be discussed include gene research, agricultural
biotechnology, biotechnological intellectual property rights and
cooperation within the biotechnological industry.</P>
      <P>Meeting participants will include such US experts as S. Leslie
Microck, an expert in biotechnological intellectual property; Noubar
Afeyan, president of Perseptive; Frank Lee, a leading scientist at
Millennium; Michael Su, a senior researcher at Vertex; and Lee
Shih-hsiung, technical director at Merck.</P>
      <P>In addition, a group of Academia Sinica members, including Wang
Yi-jiau, Cheng Yung-chi and Wu Tuan, will attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>The meeting will end on June 12. Vice Premier Liu Chao-shuan will
preside over the closing ceremony.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An Australian girl of Taiwanese origin on
Monday held a press conference to solicit public assistance in
locating her birth parents, whom she has not seen since she was 7
months old.</P>
      <P>Kartya Elizabeth Wunderie, 17, expressed her strong desire to
find her birth parents, saying she has been thinking about them for
the past 17 years.</P>
      <P>Kartya is believed to be one of 64 Taiwan babies abducted by a
criminal ring that operated in Taiwan in the late 1970s and early
1980s. The babies were sold to couples in the United States,
Australia, Switzerland and Germany for up to US$5,000 each. The group
was broken up in 1982 and its ringleader, Chu Li-ching, was
imprisoned.</P>
      <P>Accompanied at the conference by her adoptive mother, Nola,
Kartya, whose Chinese name is Lin Mei-li, said that if she had been
abducted by the ring, her birth parents must have wondered what
became of her.</P>
      <P>Saying that she dearly loves her adoptive parents, who have
raised her as their own, Kartya thanked them for supporting her
efforts to find her birth parents.</P>
      <P>Nola Wunderie said she and her husband had no idea Kartya had
been abducted when they adopted her. Since she was little, though,
Kartya has asked who her birth parents were and why she had been
given up. The questions have caused Kartya "distress and many
problems," her adoptive mother said.</P>
      <P>The pair arrived in Taipei Friday and visited the Criminal
Investigation Bureau on Saturday to seek its assistance. Blood
samples were taken from Kartya at the bureau's laboratory for DNA
testing.</P>
      <P>After Kartya's story was revealed by the media, prior to her
arrival in Taiwan, the bureau received phone calls from some 12 women
who say they may be Kartya's birth mothers. So far, however, only
three people have come forward and undergone DNA testing, the
results of which are still unknown.</P>
      <P>Nola and her husband have two biological sons and two adopted
daughters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YEAR-END ELECTIONS A PLAY-OFF BETWEEN KMT, DPP: HSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The three elections slated for the end of
this year will be a play-off between the Kuomintang and the main
opposition Democratic Progressive Party, said outgoing DPP Chairman
Hsu Hsin-liang on Monday.</P>
      <P>"Especially, the results of Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral
elections will be an index indicating which party will be at the helm
of the central government," Hsu said at a press conference before he
left for a visit to northern Europe.</P>
      <P>Hsu's tenure as DPP chairman expires next month. In his last
overseas trip as DPP chairman, Hsu is scheduled to visit Riga, Latvia
and Helsinki, Finland.</P>
      <P>Regarding the elections as "a war of defending its ruling
status," the KMT is fielding Professor Ma Ying-jeou, former justice
minister and minister without portfolio, as its candidate for Taipei
mayor.</P>
      <P>Ma has long been considered the KMT's best hope of challenging
incumbent Mayor Chen Shui-bian, a member of the DPP.</P>
      <P>Neither the KMT nor the DPP is capable of capturing half the
seats being contested in the upcoming Legislative Yuan elections,
making cooperation between the two parties necessary to avoid
political instability, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>"If that's the case, then the New Party will be marginalized, as
it will no longer be a checking power," Hsu said. The New Party, now
Taiwan's second-largest opposition party, was founded by a group of
KMT mavericks.</P>
      <P>Should the DPP win both the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral
elections, it will signal "the age of the DPP as Taiwan's ruling
party," Hsu said. The party currently controls 12 of Taiwan's 23
county and city governments.</P>
      <P>Besides mayoral and legislative elections, elections for Taipei
and Kaohsiung city councils will be held on Dec. 5.</P>
      <P>Hsu was jailed in 1989 on treason charges but was granted amnesty
and released the following year. He was elected DPP chairman in 1990
and again in 1996.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that he will speed up preparations for contesting the
2000 presidential election after he steps down as DPP chairman.</P>

      <P>A new drug extracted from Chinese herbal
medicine shows promise in battling cancerous tumors and will undergo
clinical tests later this year, according to the Ministry of Economic
Affairs' Industrial Development Bureau.</P>
      <P>The drug, known as Extract U-995, starved tumors in laboratory

the tumors. Surrounding healthy cells, however, were not affected by
the drug -- a quality unmatched by existing anti-cancer drugs, said

cancer patients who volunteered to take the drug. The patients'
tumors shrank significantly after taking the medicine for 10 days,
doctors found.</P>

      <P>Acer Chairman Stan Shih on Monday said the
New Taiwan dollar's recent declines will not affect Taiwan's business
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Psychological anxiety over the currency's depreciation, rather

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The viral epidemic currently sweeping
through Taiwan may be related to a contagion that attacked Malaysia
last year, US epidemiologists who came to Taiwan to help stop the
epidemic's spread said on Monday.</P>
      <P>The experts from the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention
said that the two waves of epidemic in the two countries have
somthings in common including the range of ages of the infected with
the virus, the symptoms of the infection and the sudden death of the
infected. However, they said that they are still not certain of this.</P>
      <P>Enterovirus type-71 has claimed the lives of 30 infants and young
children in Taiwan in recent weeks. All the victims developed a fever
and a rash with ulcers on their hands, feet and mouths. They died
from complications from the virus, including meningitis and
encephalitis, shortly after being admitted into hospitals.</P>
      <P>It is not known whether this same viral strain was responsible
for a viral outbreak in Malaysia last year, as researchers had
trouble obtaining bodies for autopsies to determine the exact cause
of death.</P>
      <P>The epidemiologists -- Anthony Mounts, Umesh Parashar and Hsieh
Wen-ju -- warned that mainland China, Indonesia and other Southeast
Asian countries may experience similar epidemics in the near future.
They did not exclude the possibility that the epidemic may have
already spread to those countries without being detected.</P>
      <P>The experts, who arrived on Saturday, will remain in Taiwan for
up to four weeks. More time is needed for the investigation, they
said, especailly since only one child's body was donated for
autopsy.</P>
      <P>Although ROC health officials have claimed the virus, which
typically strikes children under 5 years old, has already reached its
peak, they warn that the virus is usually most active during the
summer. Recent flooding, brought about by torrential rainfall, could
further spread the disease, they said.</P>
      <P>As there is no vaccine for the virus, health officials suggest
parents keep their children away from public places and make sure the
children wash their hands often to reduce the risk of infection.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Love is what women need -- not an orgasm
pill, the New York Daily News reported Monday.</P>
      <P>That was the consensus Sunday as women reacted to word that the
makers of Viagra, the male anti-impotency pill, and their rivals were
racing to perfect a pill that would help women climax.</P>
      <P>"I mean, if you're not in love, you're not in the mood," said
18-year-old Elizabeth Jose of Manhattan.</P>
      <P>"If you need a pill to have an orgasm, then maybe you shouldn't
be doing it," added her sister Keyla, 20.</P>
      <P>Li-Mai Cooper, 24, of Plainfield, N.J., wondered whether the
proposed pill would make men obsolete as she paused from wheeling her
year-old son, Kai-san.</P>
      <P>"I still don't understand how it could work if a woman isn't into
it," Cooper said.</P>
      <P>But 22-year-old Mari Potter of Kew Gardens, Queens, said she had
no objections to an orgasm pill, hastening to add, "I don't have
that problem."</P>
      <P>"But if a woman ... does, why not take something to help make her
sex life better?" Potter said.</P>
      <P>Her husband of five years, Eric, 26, agreed. "A person whose sex
life is not spicy wouldn't be romantic anyway," he said.</P>
      <P>Fortysomething Jill of Vancouver begged to differ.</P>
      <P>"A man would say that," Jill said as she shopped with her
girlfriends. "You need the love and romance first."</P>
      <P>Jill's 31-year-old pal, who asked not to be named, said "sex
should be natural.... You shouldn't have to take a pill for that."
The shyest member of the group said she'll leave the chemical
climaxing to the Americans.</P>
      <P>"We're from Canada," she said. "We're not into that."</P>
      <P>Viagra works by increasing blood flow to the erectile tissues

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE TO FOSTER COMPETITION IN FINANCIAL SECTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  8  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore aims to concurrently open up
its financial sector to greater foreign competition and strengthen
its local banks, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong
said Monday.</P>
      <P>He made the statement in a keynote address as chairman of the
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) at the 25th anniversary dinner
of the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS).</P>
      <P>Lee outlined five areas where the MAS will be taking action over
the next few months.</P>
      <P>Firstly, he said, the MAS will raise Singapore's bank disclosure
norms to international standards.</P>
      <P>Local banks should stop the current practice of maintaining
hidden reserves. They should disclose the market value of their
investments and the level of their non-performing loans, as well as
past and future provisions.</P>
      <P>These new accounting practices are consistent with international
standards and the global trend toward greater transparency in both
the banking and corporate sectors.</P>
      <P>As Singapore banks are well-capitalized and financially strong,
clearer disclosure should strengthen market confidence in them, Lee
said. Better disclosure and market scrutiny will also put banks under
pressure to operate efficiently and deploy resources to uses which
yield the highest risk-adjusted returns. This discipline will sharpen
their competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the MAS will adopt a risk-focused approach to its
examination of banks. It will inspect the banks more frequently and
regularly, ideally at least once every two years, he said.</P>
      <P>More frequent inspections will enable the MAS to distinguish
stronger banks with well-developed systems of internal control from
weaker ones. The MAS can then give more flexibility to the stronger
banks while maintaining stricter controls on the weaker ones.</P>
      <P>The MAS will start to implement this new approach to bank
inspection this year, he said.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the MAS will lower banks' minimum cash balance (MCB)
from 6 percent to 3 percent. This is part of the MAS' effort to align
its prudential stipulations with the best of international practice.</P>
      <P>Banks in Singapore have been required to maintain an MCB with the
MAS of 6 percent of their liabilities base with their domestic
banking units, and minimum liquid assets (MLA) of 18 percent of their
liabilities base. The purpose is to ensure that banks maintain
adequate cash and liquid reserves to meet any sudden withdrawals by
depositors.</P>
      <P>Fourth, the MAS will progressively open up Singapore's financial
sector to greater foreign competition. It will create a more level
playing field for local and foreign institutions in the banking,
securities and insurance sectors.</P>
      <P>Lee said the fifth policy is to develop strong local banks.
"While we open up the financial sector to greater competition, we
should also build up our domestic institutions," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee pointed out that a more competitive environment is critical
to Singapore's further development as an international financial
center.</P>
      <P>Greater participation by strong foreign financial institutions
can bring new technology, management expertise and financial
innovation; attract more international investors; and help local
institutions upgrade their services and become more efficient.</P>
      <P>Lee said the ferment in the global banking industry brings fresh
surprises almost daily. The end game is impossible to forecast.</P>
      <P>"But one thing is certain, our banks will face ever-growing
competitive pressures," he said.</P>
      <P>"Now is the time -- when we are in a position of strength and
have the luxury of choice -- to start thinking and preparing how to
meet this competitive challenge.</P>
      <P>"If we do this right, we will be well-positioned to become the
premier banking center in Asia," he concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO SEEK MAI OBSERVER STATUS: MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will apply to join the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Multilateral
Agreement on Investment (MAI) as an observer, Economic Affairs
Minister Wang Chih-kang said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>It is hoped that by joining the MAI, touted as an agreement which
will open doors around the world for investors, Taiwan will solicit
more foreign investment into the island and acquire sufficient
protection for its overseas investment as well as business and trade
interests abroad, Wang noted.</P>
      <P>The MAI was initiated in 1996, but is only this year expected to
come into effect as major OECD member-states have been divided on
some key points.</P>
      <P>Relevant officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
who have studied and evaluated the MAI's possible impact on Taiwan's
future financial and economic development, said Taiwan will benefit
more by joining the MAI than not.</P>
      <P>By signing the MAI, Taiwan will directly declare itself a
liberalized and globalized economy which is conducive to attracting
more foreign investment to the island. This will accelerate the
adjustment of the domestic economic structure and raise Taiwan's
international competitiveness, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>According to the latest United Nations World Investment Atlas, as
of the end of 1996, Taiwan is the world's 17th largest capital source
in terms of overseas investments.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan joins the MAI, the officials continued, local
businessmen can take advantage of the agreement's international
arbitration body to settle disputes for those with investments
abroad.</P>
      <P>Taiwan will also be entitled to equal treatment as other
signatory members and the privileges of the most-favored treatment if
it joins the MAI, they added.</P>
      <P>The 29-member OECD, also known as "the rich men's club," acts as
a think tank for rich industrial nations. Its recommendations are
not binding but can play a role in shaping its members' economic
policies. Taiwan became an OECD dialogue partner a few years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENTAGON DENIES REPORT OF US-PRC NAVAL DRILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US Department of Defense on Tuesday
denied a Hong Kong newspaper report that the United States will hold
a joint naval exercise with communist China next year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the Pentagon confirmed that Beijing has accepted a
US invitation to send observers to a Pacific Rim naval drill in
Hawaii and an air superiority exercise in Alaska to be held this
summer.</P>
      <P>The Hong Kong Standard reported on Monday that the United
States and mainland China will for the first time conduct a joint
naval drill in 1999.</P>
      <P>"Hong Kong press reports on this issue are spurious," a Pentagon
official said in a telephone press briefing.</P>
      <P>In the past, the official said, the United States and Hong Kong
conducted joint search and rescue exercises, call SAREX.</P>
      <P>The most recent SAREX was after Hong Kong's reversion to
Beijing and was held on Dec. 2-5, 1997, the official said, adding
that the Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department and US Air Force and
Coast Guard personnel from the Joint Rescue Coordination Center in
Honolulu took part in that drill in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>"Another SAREX is scheduled to take place in December this
year," the official added.</P>
      <P>As to the reported joint exercise with mainland China, the
official said the Pentagon does not have any such plan at the moment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the official said the commander-in-chief of the US
Pacific Fleet has invited mainland military brass to observe
Exercise Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) '98 in Hawaii.</P>
      <P>RIMPAC '98 is a joint naval exercise involving eight
countries, including the US and Japan, the official
explained.</P>
      <P>The commander of the US Pacific Air Forces has also
invited Beijing to send observers to Cooperative Cope
Thunder '98, an air superiority exercise to be held in
Alaska, the official said, adding that the invitations are a gesture
designed to upgrade military transparency of the two countries.</P>
      <P>With relations between Washington and Beijing improving, the
official said, the Pentagon looks forward to increasing exchanges or
engagements with mainland military.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, we hope to boost mutual understanding and minimize
the risk of any military conflict in the Asia-Pacific region," he
noted, adding Beijing's consent to send observers to the two
exercises indicates that the Pentagon's efforts have paid off.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA)
recently rejected China Airlines' (CAL) application to ply two new
flight routes on the basis of flight safety.</P>
      <P>CAA Acting Director-General Chang Chia-chu said CAL will not be
granted permission to expand its fleets or fly new routes until an
improvement is seen in its current efforts to boost flight safety.</P>
      <P>Chang stressed CAL's current priority is flight safety.</P>
      <P>CAL had planned to launch flight service between Taipei and
Hanoi, Vietnam, as well as a domestic flight from Hsinchu in northern
Taiwan to the island's southern city of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>CAL, the Republic of China's former flag-carrier, was widely
criticized for its operations particularly after an Airbus A300
crashed in a failed landing attempt at Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport on Feb. 16, killing all 196 people onboard and six others on
the ground.</P>
      <P>The disaster was the second for CAL in less than four years.
Another A300 crashed at Japan's Nagoya airport on April 26, 1994,
killing 264 of the 271 aboard.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CAA has drafted a bill which would impose
penalties on airlines if they are found at fault in a serious air
accident causing death. These include a year-long ban on new
international passenger flight service, Chang said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT TALKS MAY TAKE PLACE NEXT SPRING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 10 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China
said on Wednesday that it is reasonable to assess that both sides of
the Taiwan Strait could resume talks next spring.</P>
      <P>But C.F. Koo, chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF), did not rule out a visit to the mainland sometime
this year for talks with his counterpart, Wang Daohan, chairman of
the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS).</P>
      <P>Koo was responding to a recent letter from the ARATS which
reaffirmed its welcome to a visit to the mainland by Koo.</P>
      <P>The landmark Koo-Wang talks which took place in Singapore in 1993
established a framework for regular dialogue between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait, but this dialogue was disrupted in 1995 after
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in June of that
year. Beijing believes that the trip was a veiled attempt to solicit
support for Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Koo said that the timing of his trip will have to wait for
reaffirmation by Shi Hwei-yow, the SEF secretary-general.</P>
      <P>He also said that the SEF has invited an ARATS deputy
secretary-general to visit Taiwan to exchange views on a resumption
of talks. Should this official decline to come, the SEF will not rule
out inviting Tang Shubei, ARATS vice chairman, to come to Taiwan to
discuss the matter, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the SEF and ARATS reached some consensus in
preparatory talks in April, Shi said the SEF will arrange for groups
to visit the mainland to step up exchanges, following the visit to
Beijing in late June by US President Bill Clinton, and in advance of
the Koo-Wang talks.</P>
      <P>He said that these groups will comprise senior reporters, Taiwan
businessmen, notaries, and crime crackdown specialists, and that they
will travel to the mainland in July or August.</P>
      <P>Following the recent arrest of four Taiwan businessmen on charges
of espionage in the mainland, Shi said that personal safety and the
rights of Taiwan investors will be given top priority in the
cross-strait dialogue.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  9  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton insisted on
Tuesday that observing mainland China's diplomatic etiquette and
accepting a welcoming ceremony that Beijing authorities plan to hold
in Tiananmen Square will not ruin his ability to promote the
principles that the American people cherish most.</P>
      <P>Clinton said that as he is visiting mainland China at the
invitation of Beijing, it is Beijing's responsibility to arrange a
welcoming ceremony, and it would not be proper to propose his own
conditions for such a ceremony. Clinton made the remarks at a joint
news conference with South Korean President Kim Dae-Jung.</P>
      <P>In view of the recent Asian financial turmoil and the nuclear
testing on the Indian subcontinent, it is more crucial than ever for
the US to establish a constructive, positive relationship with
mainland China, added Clinton.</P>
      <P>Beijing also wants to improve this relationship, Clinton said,
which is why the Beijing authorities are being far more tolerant of
different political opinions than before. He pointed out that several
dissidents have been released since mainland Chinese president Jiang
Zemin visited the US last year, but he stressed that his trip to the
mainland will give him the opportunity to express categorically the
views of the American people regarding human rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ACTIVISTS TO LAUNCH ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO LAND ON DISPUTED ISLANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  10  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Several activists said on Wednesday that
they will make another attempt later this month to land on the
disputed Tiaoyutai islands in the East China Sea to highlight the
Republic of China's claims to the islands.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Councilor Chin Chieh-shou made the remarks when he
and the group of activists went to the suburban residence of Shintaro
Yamashita, Taipei's director of the Japan's Interchange Association, 
the de facto Japanese embassy here.</P>
      <P>Yamashita had already left for work and the activists did not
meet him, but Chin, convenor of Taiwan's task force to protect the
Tiaoyutais, said that he had already faxed a statement to the
association's Taipei office.</P>
      <P>Chin said that wanted to inform Yamashita that Chinese around the
world will launch another attempt to land on the Tiaoyutais, known in
Japan as the Senkaku islands, on June 21.</P>
      <P>Chin urged the Japanese side to impose "self-restraint," warning
that the task force will adopt "necessary measures" in order to avoid
potential grave consequences.</P>
      <P>Chin also said that the Tiaoyutais are ROC territory, and pointed
out that the Japanese government's claim to the islands, its
dispersal of Taiwan fishing boats, and its beating of fishermen, have
led to resentment among Taiwan fishermen.</P>
      <P>To avoid clashes between the two nations, Chin expressed the hope
that the Japanese government will stop taking improper action against
Taiwan fishing boats and fishermen.</P>
      <P>The disputed islands lie about 200 kilometers northeast of Taiwan
and 300 kilometers west of the Japanese island of Okinawa. Japan was
given control of the islands in 1972 by the United States, which had
administered the islands along with Okinawa since the end of World
War II.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HEART DRUG WITHDRAWN FROM MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, June 9 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Less than a year after it was approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the heart drug Posicor was
taken off the market in 38 countries Monday amid mounting evidence
that it is dangerous and possibly lethal when used in combination
with other drugs.</P>
      <P>According to The New York Times Tuesday, the drug, made by Roche
Laboratories of Nutley, N.J., is used to treat high blood pressure
and the chest pains known as angina, particularly among the elderly.
It has been used by 400,000 people worldwide, including 200,000 in
the United States.</P>
      <P>FDA officials have long known that the drug did not mix well with
certain other medications. However, over the last few months, the
list of drugs that cause toxic interactions with Posicor grew so long
officials asked Roche, a subsidiary of Roche Holdings, to withdraw it
from the market.</P>
      <P>The list of drugs, 26 in all, includes such common medication
such as antihistamines, antibiotics, cholesterol-lowering drugs and
the cancer-fighting drug tamoxifen.</P>
      <P>Both the FDA and Roche urged patients who are taking Posicor not
to stop taking the drug but rather to consult their doctors to find
an alternative therapy.</P>
      <P>It is extremely rare for the FDA, which is widely regarded as
being extremely safety-conscious, to withdraw a drug once it has been
approved, the Times said.</P>
      <P>Posicor, which is part of a class of medications known as calcium
channel-blockers, inhibits certain liver enzymes that enable the body
to eliminate other drugs. When the enzyme is not active, those other
drugs can build to toxic levels.</P>
      <P>The FDA has been monitoring Posicor since it went on the market
last July and has received dozens of reports of adverse side effects
when it is taken in combination with other drugs. Symptoms include
dangerously low heart rate, irregular heart beat and a breakdown of
muscle that can cause permanent damage to the kidneys.</P>
      <P>There have been 24 reported deaths of patients taking Posicor,
but it is unknown whether they were caused by the drug. FDA officials
believe two or three deaths could be directly attributed to the drug
taken in combination with other medication.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEER OEM BIDDING REQUIREMENTS TO BE ANNOUNCED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 9 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau
will announce in a few days the bidding requirements for foreign beer
companies interested in producing their beer locally at the bureau's
Chunghsin plant, Bureau Deputy Director Chen Wen-kai said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The bureau has already drawn up the bidding requirements for the
original equipment manufacturing (OEM) of a foreign beer product, he
said, adding that several companies have contacted the bureau
expressing interest in the cooperative project.</P>
      <P>The government-run enterprise is looking for a beer company that
is both well-known abroad and well-established in Taiwan, with a
proven domestic sales record and leading market share, Chen said. The
final choice for a partner will be decided by a bureau task force
according to established standards and requirements.</P>
      <P>Domestic food companies interested in the venture cannot be
accepted as valid bidders because according to a draft law currently
under deliberation, only manufacturers are valid bidders. Since the
bureau has a monopoly over beer manufacturing in Taiwan, only foreign
companies are eligible, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Explaining that beer is 90 percent water and freshness is vital
to the product's quality, Chen said that local production will help
guarantee product freshness and reduce shipping costs normally
involved with imported beer -- incentives for the foreign companies
to take advantage of this cooperative arrangement.</P>
      <P>A stipulation attached to the offer is that the foreign company
cannot continue to import the beer it will be manufacturing in
Taiwan. To simplify the process, the company will also provide its
own raw materials, and the bureau will be responsible for only
production, not sales.</P>
      <P>Chen pointed out that the beer market is open, and no one product
will be able to dominate the entire market. By producing beer for
another company, the bureau is mainly interested in fully utilizing
its current manufacturing capacity and in promoting constructive
competition among foreign manufacturers, he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  June  9  (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tibetan Buddhist leaders in India and
abroad have launched a worldwide campaign to pressure Beijing into
releasing the reincarnation of the 10th Panchen Lama who is being
held somewhere in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The "Free Gedhun Campaign" refers to Gedhun Choekyi Nyima who was
declared the 11th Panchen Lama by the Dalai Lama on May 14, 1996.
Shortly afterward, Beijing declared another boy was the "official"
Panchen Lama and has held Gedhun in custody since then.</P>
      <P>The campaign is gaining momentum in Southeast Asia as well as the
US, Europe, Canada and Australia, officials from the Dalai Lama's
official headquarters in Himachal Pradesh told the Daily News, a
Sri Lanka-based English daily.</P>
      <P>As a part of the campaign, world bodies such as the United
Nations are being asked to demand the release of the eight-year old
boy, and to allow him to function as the 11th Panchen Lama of the
Tibetan Order.</P>
      <P>As an indication that the campaign has gained international
support, the Brussels-based European Parliament launched a massive
signature collection drive to pressure Beijing into releasing Gedhun.</P>
      <P>Born on April 25, 1989, Gedhun is considered the true
reincarnation of Panchen Rimpoche who was the 10th Panchen Lama of
Tibet. After the death of Panchen Rimpoche, the Dalai Lama received
30 names of possible reincarnations of Panchen Rimpoche from Tibet
and other parts of the world. In 1991, a divination was performed by
the Dalai Lama followed by another in 1993.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, a team of lamas traveled Tibet and the world to
search for and identify the reincarnated Panchen Rimpoche. The search
ended in January 1995 when Gedhun Choekyi Nyima was picked as the
reincarnated Panchen Rimpoche.</P>
      <P>After Gedhun was crowned as the 11th Panchen Lama, the Dalai Lama
asked Beijing to recognize him as the "true and only religious leader
of Tibetan Buddhists." Beijing instead named their own Panchen Lama
and asked Tibetans to accept their nominee, Gyalsen, as the true
Panchen Lama.</P>
      <P>Beijing, bowing to UN pressure, recently disclosed that Gedhun
was "safe and in its custody".</P>

    <HEADLINE>US HOUSE DEMANDS BEIJING TO RENOUNCE USE OF FORCE AGAINST TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  9 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US House of Representatives passed
a concurrent resolution with a unanimous 411-0 vote on Friday,
demanding Beijing to renounce the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The resolution acknowledges Taiwan's desire to play a positive
role in the current Asian financial crisis and reaffirms the support
of the American people for Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>It also expresses the sense of the Congress that President Bill
Clinton should seek from mainland authorities, at the summit meeting
in Beijing later this month, a public renunciation of the use of
force or the threat of the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The non-binding resolution further demands the US government
abide by all previous understandings of a "one China" policy and
maintain its interest in a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan Strait
issue.</P>
      <P>Before the resolution was put to the vote, Chairman Benjamin
Gilman (R-NY) of the House Committee on International Relations said
Taiwan has played a pivotal role in regional prosperity and
stability.</P>
      <P>"But this prosperity and stability can be threatened. We need
only to look back to the ominous period in the spring of '96, when
Chinese M-9 missiles flew across the Strait of Taiwan into
international air and sea lanes in a heavy-handed attempt by Beijing
to threaten the first democratic elections in 5000 years of Chinese
history," Gilman said.</P>
      <P>That sort of missile diplomacy on the part of communist China is
unacceptable and it is appropriate that the Congress calls on
Beijing to renounce the use of force in settling the Taiwan Strait
issue, the influential congressional leader stressed.</P>
      <P>Gilman further said: "I want to state my firm belief that the
issue of one China must be settled peacefully and first and foremost
by the Chinese people on both sides of the Strait of Taiwan, not by
one side dictating terms to the other through missile diplomacy or
otherwise..."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-NY), who
introduced the resolution on April 30, said: "As the author of this
simple resolution, let me just say that it is necessary because of
the continuing belligerent attitude of the Communist Chinese toward
our great friends, the people of Taiwan, our strongest allies in the
history of this nation."</P>
      <P>Solomon pointed out that Communist China has repeatedly and
brazenly refused to renounce the potential use of military force to
resolve its dispute with Taiwan."And it has shown on more than one
occasion that it is willing to intimidate Taiwan with military
force."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Rep. Doug Bereuter (R-NE), chairman of the
Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, said while it is true only the
Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can determine their
future, "the United States must continue to play a role in ensuring
the peace and stability of the region."</P>
      <P>The resolution notes that Clinton will visit mainland China on
June 25-July 3 to discuss the common interests of the two countries
and that the American people desire strong relations with the people
on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The resolution also affirms that it is an established US policy
to take all necessary action to ensure peace and stability on the
Taiwan Strait, while continuing mutually beneficial trade relations
with Taiwan's vibrant economy.</P>

      <P>The bank rating agency said in a report released Tuesday the
impact of the financial crisis on South Korea's real economy is
deeper than previously anticipated. The timetable for a turnaround is
therefore likely to be further delayed.</P>
      <P>Recently released figures of the gross domestic product for the
first quarter of this year show that the country's economy contracted
by 3.8 percent, more sharply than most forecasts.</P>
      <P>The downturn has been made worse by the occurrence of stagflation,
as inflation looks set to overtake previous estimates of 6.7 percent,
reaching levels of 10 percent or higher by the end of this year, the
report added.</P>
      <P>The export growth of the country slowed for the first time in
five months in May, as Korean exporters started to feel the effects
of a steadily weakening Japanese yen and a domestic credit crunch.</P>
      <P>Interest rates have been kept high to defend the external value
of the Korean won, hampering the ability of local firms to repay
their obligations. The report added that the problem has been
exacerbated by the high debt-to-equity ratios of Korean firms.</P>
      <P>An estimated 20 trillion won (US$14.28 billion) worth of bonds
mature during this month alone, the report said.</P>
      <P>The country's short-term domestic obligations have been rolled
over, but banks are unlikely to put up with this situation for long
given their own precarious situation. The government's efforts to
recapitalize banks have so far been inadequate.</P>
      <P>Reflecting the worsening outlook, the Kospi stock market index
fell to a 11-year low during the last week of May. Foreigners are
still reluctant to enter Korean markets as it appears likely that the
economic downturn will continue through the second and third quarters
of this year.</P>
      <P>In the midst of the generally depressed economic picture,
however, there have been some encouraging developments. South Korea's
foreign reserves have steadily risen, quadrupling from US$8.9 billion
at the end of last year to US$38.76 billion at the end of May, the
report stated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HK, TAIWAN HAVE FREEST MEDIA: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan and Hong Kong are the two areas
in Asia where journalistic freedom is respected the most among the
economies of the region, according to the results released on
Wednesday of a public opinion poll of Western business people working
in Asia.</P>
      <P>The respondents think that among the 11 Asian economies, only
Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines and Thailand enjoy journalistic
freedom, the poll found.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic
Risk Consultancy Ltd. (PERC), canvassed opinions on media freedom,
censorship and quality in countries and areas throughout Asia.</P>
      <P>The poll found that according to the respondents, six countries
in the region have stepped up news censorship, while only four others
have relaxed their press restrictions.</P>
      <P>However, the PERC researchers said the respondents' opinions
might be biased due to their personal partiality for certain
countries or areas. For example, they said, the finding that Taiwan
was considered in the survey to have greater press freedom than Japan
is probably controversial.</P>
      <P>In the survey, the respondents said Hong Kong has the
highest-quality mass media workers among all the economies in the
region, while Taiwan's media personnel are just mediocre, although
they have potential for improvement.</P>
      <P>Taking the Asian economic turmoil as an example, the PERC
researchers said, the Taiwan media and other Asian media have carried
far fewer reports than their Hong Kong counterparts on regional
impact and regional points of view.</P>
      <P>This insufficient coverage could be one of the major factors in
the failure by most countries and areas in the region to cope with
the regional crisis, they pointed out.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAJOR JAPANESE FIRMS SHUN BATTERED AUSSIE DOLLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  10  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major Japanese insurance companies,
including Nippon Life, have temporarily stopped investing in
Australian-dollar denominated assets such as bonds and stocks despite
efforts of senior Australian officials to calm foreign investors.</P>
      <P>In a survey conducted by The Australian Financial Review in
Tokyo, Nippon Life, Dai-Ichi Mutual, Meiji Mutual, Mitsui Mutual and
Sumotomo Mutual have all expressed concern about the foreign exchange
rate risks of Australian investment due to depreciation in the
country's currency.</P>
      <P>The Japanese companies said they are rethinking their Australian
portfolio investment strategies because the Australian dollar appears
to be continuing to slide against the US dollar and other major
currencies, including the German deutsche mark.</P>
      <P>The daily quoted Meiji Mutual as saying, "We consider the current
situation a phase of global disinflation, and we take a deliberate
stance against investment in Australian dollar assets as it is
closely linked with the commodities market."</P>
      <P>Australia Treasurer Peter Costello and his senior colleagues on
Tuesday talked up the Australian dollar, saying the country's
economic fundamentals remained good. They also indicated that the
Australian dollar was undervalued at its current state.</P>
      <P>"Obviously there has been a lot of interest in the Australian
dollar over recent weeks and there has been quite a deal of
speculation in relation to its levels," Costello said, adding "Quite
a lot of that is based on commentary which is not well based. The
important thing about the Australian dollar and the Australian
economy are the fundamentals, and it's the fundamentals which are
going to determine the overall levels of the dollar over the long
term as people put aside ill-informed commentary."</P>
      <P>Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer said, "In
the broader context, I emphasize that we are holding up and
weathering the storms out of Asia extraordinarily well."</P>
      <P>In a speech in New York, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said,
"It clearly important that in New York, there is an understanding of
the strengths of the Australian economy, and I think there is."</P>
      <P>The tough comments bolstered the value of the Australian dollar
to 60.08 US cents at one stage Tuesday, but it soon dropped to close
at 59.87 US cents. The dollar was trading at one point during the day
at 59.63 US cents, the lowest level since it fell to 57.10 US cents
in July 1986.</P>
      <P>Investors were apparently not convinced of the politicians'
remarks particularly after seeing the Japanese yen plunge to a
seven-year low of 141.25 against the greenback. Japan is Australia's
largest trading partner.</P>
      <P>The Herald's survey shows Japanese institutions were net sellers
of the Australian-dollar denominated securities for eight of the nine
months up to March 1998.</P>
      <P>Up to March 31 this year, Japanese insurance firms sold 3.9
trillion (US$30.7 billion) Australian securities compared with their
purchases of 3.5 trillion, leaving net sales of 372 billion yen.</P>
      <P>The Japanese institutions attributed their sales of the
Australian securities to lower economic growth and a riskier foreign
exchange market down under as a result of the Asian crisis.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-level official of the Republic of
China's Kinmen Defense Command (KDC) on Wednesday denied being
consulted by mainland China before its navy carried out underwater
mine-clearing operations in nearby Amoy Bay.</P>
      <P>Mainland China announced at the end of April that its navy had
completed clearing underwater mines left in Amoy Bay in the wake of
the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan which ended with the
surrender of Japan in 1945.</P>
      <P>Mainland China further stated that the KDC was consulted through
the mainland's Red Cross Society and Amoy's Taiwan Affairs Office
before the operation began, but the Kinmen official stressed that the
claim was "pure fiction."</P>
      <P>The Red Cross never contacted the KDC over the mine-clearing
operation, the official stated adamantly, adding that in any case,
the command was not in a position to make any decisions regarding the
issue.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out that mine-sweeping is not an offensive
military mission, so if mainland China wanted to conduct these
operations in its waters, it can "take care of its own business"
without having to seek permission from the KDC.</P>
      <P>The Kinmen islands, consist of 12 ROC-controlled islets off the
southeastern coast of mainland China's Fujian Province, located in a
key position in the Taiwan Strait. The shortest distance from the
main island of Kinmen to mainland China is only 2,310 meters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HOUSE RESOLUTION TO DETER CLINTON FROM SACRIFICING TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  9  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US House of Representatives'
unanimous vote for a concurrent resolution demanding Beijing to
renounce the use of force against Taiwan is expected to deter
President Bill Clinton from sacrificing Taiwan's interests during his
upcoming visit to mainland China, political observers said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The House passed the non-binding resolution with a unanimous
411-0 vote on Tuesday evening to express the Congress' opinion that
Clinton should seek from mainland authorities "a public renunciation
of the use of force, or the threat of the use of force, against
democratic Taiwan" at the summit meeting in Beijing later this month.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said the move not only signifies the Congress'
sympathy toward Taiwan, it also indicates that Clinton's June 25-July
3 mainland visit will not lead to any unexpected developments in the
Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-NY), the chief architect of the
resolution, said on the floor of the House that the resolution is
aimed at reminding the Clinton administration not to engage Beijing
at Taiwan's expense.</P>
      <P>Solomon said the resolution is necessary not only because of
Beijing's continuing belligerent attitude toward Taiwan but also
because of disturbing trends in the Clinton administration's policy
regarding the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>"President Clinton has had in place a policy of unmitigated
appeasement toward communist China for five years now..." Solomon
noted.</P>
      <P>Even before the House adopted the resolution, political observers
said, Taiwan's friends in the US Congress had taken many steps to
prevent Clinton from reaching any easy compromise with Beijing over
the Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>For instance, the Congress in May invited Stanley Roth, assistant
secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and several
other Clinton administration officials, to testify on Taiwan-related
issues. These officials made many promises in favor of Taiwan,
including that Clinton will neither sacrifice Taiwan's interests
during his summit meeting with mainland President Jiang Zemin in
June, nor sign any new joint communique concerning Taiwan.</P>
      <P>They also reaffirmed commitments to providing Taiwan with
adequate defensive arms and to supporting peaceful resolution of the
Taiwan Strait issue.</P>

tenth foreign school, is scheduled to open here in August.</P>
      <P>The new American school, founded by the Nangang Baptist Bible
Church in eastern Taipei, is planning to enroll 120 students, ranging
from three kindergarten classes to a class each from first grade to
sixth grade. In addition to English, the new school will also offer a
90-minute daily Chinese class to its students.</P>
      <P>According to a church spokesman, it was decided to establish a
new American school in Taipei due to increased demand from the
growing number of American businessmen and missionaries residing in
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The church's Taiwan congregation had also expressed the desire
for such a school, because some local parents wishing to send their
children to study overseas are afraid that their offspring will have
difficulty adapting to living abroad, the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>The Grace Christian Academy will be the tenth international
school in Taipei. The nine other foreign schools, including the
Taipei American School, the Taipei English School, the Deutsche
Schule Taipei, and the Taipei Japanese School, were all founded years
ago.</P>
      <P>The announcement of the opening came a day after Premier Vincent
Siew attended the inauguration of the Swire European Campus in
Yangmingshan, suburban Taipei.</P>
      <P>The German, French and British schools, which have all moved to
the brand new site, will share the campus, teaching and housing
facilities, while retaining their own national curricula.</P>
      <P>Addressing the inauguration ceremony, Siew said the event marked
a giant step for Taipei in its efforts to develop itself into an

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The panic selling on the Taipei stock
market triggered by heavy drops in both the Japanese and Hong Kong
stock markets and their currencies seems to indicate that local
investors are overreacting to those foreign setbacks, Finance
Minister Paul C.H. Chiu said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chiu told the CNA that Taiwan enjoys a firmer financial system
than either of those two economies and it also has sound economic
fundamentals, so there's no need to worry about a possible financial
collapse for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's share prices dropped 3.1 percent on Wednesday following
the local currency's further depreciation due to the Japanese yen's
fall through 141 against the greenback.</P>
      <P>The "abnormal" performance in both the stock and foreign exchange
markets prompted mounting calls for the government to implement
effective measures to halt the crisis.</P>
      <P>Wang You-theng and Koo Chen-fu, two commercial and industry
heavyweights, were reported to have called on Premier Vincent Siew in
the wake of the stock market and NT dollar drops, to voice their
worry about the inflation which will hit the island after the serious
currency devaluation.</P>
      <P>Wang, chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic
of China, said a "reasonable" value of the NT dollar is around 32-33
against the greenback. "It is not right" that the unit has been
devalued to under 34, he said.</P>
      <P>Wang noted that he and Koo, honorary chairman of the Chinese
National Association of Industry and Commerce, have both suggested
that Siew pay close attention to investors' expectations of a further
weakening of the NT dollar. "Such expectations might also cause an
inflation crisis," Wang stressed.</P>
      <P>According to statistics from the Central Bank of China (CBC), the
NT dollar has suffered a 19.88 percent decline since the end of last
June. The value of the currency moved down to 34.715 to the US dollar
on Tuesday from the 27.812 level of June 30, 1997, which was

sell Australian currency and shares.</P>
      <P>Speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia would raise
interest rates to prop up the currency's value caused further

cents -- which they say is indeed possible -- the country will become
"a banana republic."</P>
      <P>Businessmen are worried that a rise in interest rates would blunt

costs.</P>
      <P>Likewise, tens of thousands of Australian home buyers are worried

a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>Hu said the resolution complies with the Republic of China's
basic stance that cross-strait issues should be resolved peacefully
by the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The minister said although the House resolution is not binding to
the executive branch, the Clinton administration is not expected to
ignore such unanimous congressional opinion.</P>
      <P>Touching on Clinton's June 25-July 3 mainland visit, Hu said the
ROC government hopes that the United States will not take the
initiative to make the Taiwan Strait issue a centerpiece of the
agenda for the Clinton-Jiang summit meeting.</P>
      <P>"We also hope the US will not sign any documents with mainland
China concerning the Taiwan Strait issue," Hu said.</P>
      <P>Barring unexpected developments, Hu said, the topics or
directions of the upcoming meeting will not be very different from
that of the first Clinton-Jiang summit meeting held in Washington,
D.C. last year.</P>
      <P>"The United States looks forward to seeing its engagements with
Beijing benefit the delicate Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations. We
think this US stance has remained unchanged," Hu noted.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that both Taipei and Washington hopes to see
the triangular Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations move on a
stable, peaceful direction.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hu said the government has always remained
cautious in watching developments in Beijing-Washington
engagements. "We must keep alert in order to protect our
national interests."</P>
      <P>Hu further said although the US and mainland China have
agreed to increase exchanges of military information
and personnel, they are still far away from exchanging
weaponry systems because of differences in vaules and military
concepts.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN PAPER REPORTS TAIWAN TO REMAIN A SAFE HARBOR AMID A STORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  10 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will remain an economic haven in
Asia despite the beating its currency has taken in the wake of a
weakening Japanese yen, said Chen Chien-jen, director general of the
Government Information Office.</P>
      <P>In a story published in The Sydney Morning Herald, Australia's
oldest mass-circulation newspaper, Chen also was quoted as saying ROC
President Lee Teng-hui is prepared to consider visiting Beijing, "but
definitely not as head of a provincial government. No way. He would
like to go as president of the ROC."</P>
      <P>Chen said that despite regional turmoil, Taiwan's economy remains
robust, with inflation of about 2 percent and low unemployment. He
predicted economic growth of 6 percent this year compared to 6.8
percent last year.</P>
      <P>"In the first quarter we were not able to achieve 6 percent, but
I believe in the second half of this year we are going to do somewhat
better than in the first half," Chen said.</P>
      <P>In that same story, Mainland Affairs Council Chairman Chang
King-yuh, was quoted as saying that China's "one country, two
systems" formula cannot be applied to Taiwan because the model "was
irrelevant to Taiwan, which was not a colony."</P>
      <P>More than 80 percent of the people of Taiwan reject the notion
that "one country, two systems" is applicable to the Republic of
China, he said.</P>
      <P>Whether the Chinese formula on Hong Kong will work or not remains
to be seen not in the first year, but over 50 years, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Talks on the reunification of Taiwan and China could happen only
after Beijing agrees to "further modernize, emphasize the rule of law
and evolve into an open and pluralist society and, eventually, a
functioning democracy," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC CHIEF OUTLINES NEW DIRECTIONS FOR CROSS-STRAIT TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 10 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Future consultations between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait should focus on promoting peaceful development
and national unification under a democratic system, a senior mainland
affairs official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang King-yuh, chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), made the statement at an interministerial mainland
affairs working meeting.</P>
      <P>The chief mainland policy architect also said Taiwan must
exercise flexibility and pragmatism in engaging mainland China in
order to avoid falling into the Beijing-proposed 'one China'
predicament or being troubled by squabbling over whether cross-strait
talks should first deal with political issues or focus on technical
and practical issues.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang stressed the importance of resuming normal
operations of institutionalized cross-strait dialogue channel, noting
that maintaining a healthy consultative mechanism is essential to
ensure long-term harmony and stability in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Since mainland China unilaterally suspended regular
cross-strait dialogue in mid-1995, Chang said the Republic of China
has never stopped its efforts to push for early resumption of
institutionalized cross-strait consultations. "Our stance is
always coherent and consistent."</P>
      <P>Chang went on to say that future cross-strait relations will face
a new climate in the future and that many new interactions will also
emerge.</P>
      <P>"We must keep confidence in our national goals and work
hand-in-hand to promote cross-strait rapprochement in line with the
National Unification Guildelines," Chang said. "By so doing, we'll
be able to reduce unnecessary suspicion and increase mutual
understanding with mainland China."</P>
      <P>Chang also reminded government officials in charge of mainland
affairs that Beijing will intensify its "united front" tactics to
court Taiwan investors or business people.</P>
      <P>"Mainland China held a Taiwan affairs meeting in mid-May, during
which time communist officials vowed to seek headway in
cross-strait economic cooperation and to push for direct
trade, transport and postal links," Chang recalled.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Chang said, Taiwan must maintain its
"no hast, be patient" mainland investment policy in order to protect
the island from becoming very vulnerable to mainland China's
economic and political clout.</P>
      <P>"We must regulate cross-strait economic exchanges from an
omnibus perspective to sustain Taiwan's domestic economic growth,"
Chang said, adding that the government will further imporve
information services and offer more assistance to Taiwan companies
with interests on the mainland.</P>

      <P>Ma Ying-jeou, the ruling Kuomintang's
Taipei mayoral candidate, said on Wednesday a good mayor must learn
from and listen to city residents.</P>
      <P>Ma, who was formally named by the KMT Central Central Committee
as the party's candidate on Wednesday morning, said at a press
conference that he will combine human resources from commerce,
industry and academic and administrative fields to engage in a
dignified election campaign.</P>
      <P>Commenting on his motives for entering the race, Ma said that
before making his decision, he had been caught in a tug of war
between responsibility and sincerity. In the end, however, he decided
not to be a bystander anymore.</P>
      <P>Ma said that although he is, at present, less knowledgeable about
city administration than Taipei's present mayor, he will solicit
views and opinions from the city's residents and officials, as well
as from experts and scholars, before formulating his policies.</P>
      <P>The former justice minister's campaign team will comprise leaders
of industry and commerce, administrators and academics. The team will
be organized by the KMT's city committee, and Wu Poh-hsiung, senior
adviser to the President, will lead a supplemental support team.</P>
      <P>Ma stressed that he intends to set an example and run an
honorable race, adding that he will, if elected, seek out the
assistance of people from different political parties, using each
person according to his talents and abilities.</P>
      <P>Noted painter Yeh Tsui-pai presented a painting depicting
horses to Ma at the conference and wished him success in the year-end

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu hailed his
presence at a recent conference of the Organization of African Unity
as a valuable opportunity to enhance Taiwan's visibility on the
international stage.</P>
      <P>On returning Wednesday from Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, where the
OAU held its 34th annual conference, Hu told reporters that the
Republic of China will not forgo any opportunity to "be seen, be
heard and be felt" in the international community. The OAU conference
provided a forum for the island to increase its presence in Africa,
he said.</P>
      <P>On the meeting's sidelines, diplomats from many African states
approached Hu and expressed a willingness to tighten ties with
Taipei, he said.</P>
      <P>Although not an OAU member and despite the absence of diplomatic
relations with Burkina Faso, Beijing dispatched a four-member
delegation to the conference, an indication of Beijing's eagerness to
woo African states, said Hu.</P>
      <P>Noting that the Republic Of China places importance on
international conferences hosted by its allies, Hu said the island
looks forward to more opportunities to attend meetings of regional
economic and trade forums. However he brushed aside questions on
whether Taiwan will attend the OAU event regularly.</P>
      <P>Hu declined to elaborate on his African trip itinerary, saying
that presenting a laundry list of his initiatives could jeopardize
their future harvests.</P>
      <P>Hu attended the OAU meeting, which took place from June 6 to 10, 
at the invitation of Ablasse Ouedraogo, foreign minister of Burkina
Faso. He arrived without advance announcement after concluding a
meeting in Europe with ROC envoys to 27 states on June 1-2.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry issued a statement regarding Hu's European
trip after the envoys' meeting but remained tight-lipped as to the
meeting's location, saying only that it was held in a European state
that does not maintain official ties with Taipei.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the ministry did not disclose Hu's presence at the OAU
meeting until the meeting had nearly drawn to a close.</P>
      <P>The OAU, founded in 1963, is an association of African nations
that aim to promote unity among African peoples. It comprises 52

      <P>Although ROC Premier Vincent Siew does not
expect any surprises will come out of the upcoming summit between US
President Bill Clinton and his Beijing counterpart, Jiang Zemin, he
urged Washington on Wednesday not to improve ties with Beijing to
Taipei's detriment.</P>
      <P>Reiterating Taiwan's official position that Washington's ties
with Taipei and Beijing are separate and that close
Washington-Beijing ties are in the interests of regional stability

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  10  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The cabinet issued a strongly-worded
rebuttal late Tuesday afternoon to criticism made by Taiwan Provincial
Governor James Soong against the central government regarding recent
flooding in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Calling Soong's remarks "totally groundless and unacceptable" at
an emergency news conference, government spokesman Chen Chien-jen
said the central government must make clear its position and called
on Soong to discuss with the central government.</P>
      <P>Chen made the statement after Soong harshly criticized the
central government earlier in the day for failing to cooperate with
provincial authorities in their efforts to improve long-standing
problems with flooding in central and southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>During an inspection of Chiayi City and Huko township in Yunlin
County, both of which have seen widespread flooding from recent
torrential rains, Soong was questioned by local chiefs on why he
failed to keep his promise to help the two localities prevent future
floods from occurring.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that the provincial government has done its best to
achieve that goal, an angry Soong accused the central government of
attempting to write off the provincial government's flood-control
efforts by freezing funds allocated for fiscal 1999. He also accused
the central government of "devoting itself to eliminating the
provincial government and ignoring the welfare of the people."</P>
      <P>Rebutting Soong's comments, Chen called them "irrational and
totally groundless," adding that the central government would not
tolerate such accusations.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the central government is deeply concerned about
the welfare of people throughout the island, Chen said as much as
NT$49.2 billion (US$1.2 billion) has been allocated over the past
five years to help the provincial government combat flooding. It is
now time to examine the results of the provincial government's
flood-control efforts, he said.</P>
      <P>Soong and central authorities have been at odds since the central
government decided to reduce the size and scope of the provincial
government in late 1996.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC SWIMMING TEAM TO CROSS ITALIAN CHANNEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  11 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A channel-crossing team from the Republic
of China is set to swim the Circeo Channel in Italy later this month,
team leader Wang Han announced on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wang said the crossing of the channel, located about 100
kilometers south of Rome, will take place as originally scheduled
between June 22 and 24.</P>
      <P>The team, which consists of seven men and women long-distance
swimmers, will leave for Italy on Friday and will train for at least
four days prior to the attempt.</P>
      <P>Wang has swam across 11 channels over the past 13 years. He
started his cross-channel swimming career in 1986 when he became the
first ROC swimmer to cross the Strait of Gibraltar.</P>
      <P>He told reporters that the team wants to prove once again that
the Chinese from Taiwan possess physical strength and sportsmanship.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the ROC sports sector, Chinese Taipei Sports
Federation Chairman Chang Wan-li presented the national flag to the
team on Thursday, and encouraged the swimmers to do their best.</P>
      <P>With regards to the attempt, Wang said the water temperature in
the Circeo Channel ranges between 18- and 20-degrees Celsius during
this time of the year. Five team members and an Italian swimmer will
take part in the 45-km crossing. It will take an estimated 12 to 15
hours to complete the crossing.</P>
      <P>The team had previously applied to cross the Strait of Messina
which separates Sicily and Italy, and the Strait of Bonifacio which
separates the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, but the applications
were turned down for security reasons. The team then settled for the
Circeo Channel.</P>
      <P>The Circeo crossing will be the team's last attempt before they
take on the crossing of the Taiwan Strait by 2000, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Since 1985, Wang's team has successfully swam the Gibraltar
Channel, English Channel, the Bosporus Strait, which separates Europe
from Asia, Hawaii's Maui Channel, Cape of Good Hope, Canada's Juan de
Fuca Channel, Japan's Tsugaru Channel, Australia's Platypus Channel,
New Zealand's Cook Strait, and the San Pedro Channel in the United

      <P>The United States stainless steel

accusing them of dumping stainless steel sheet and strip in coil at
below fair market price.</P>
      <P>Identified in the complaint were the Yieh United Steel Co., Tang

      <P>The new measures follow a damning report on the elite Australian

      <P>He said it was "not a great pleasure" to release the report, but
it was necessary to reassure the public that the Defense Force was

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economic performance research
authority expressed optimism over the island's economy despite the
overall bearish sentiment in the stock and currency markets.</P>
      <P>Thomas M.F. Yeh, director of economic research in the Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said that Taiwan's imports
posted small but positive growth during the first five months of this
year.</P>
      <P>There was a significant increase of imported capital goods, the
value of which reached more than NT$10 billion (US$287.36 million),
up 22.9 percent from the same five-month period last year, Yeh said.
He added the growth indicate the willingness to invest in the island
did not dissipate due to the recent drop in value of the NT dollar.</P>
      <P>Yeh's observation was supported by CEPD's Vice Chairman K.C. Lee,
who said that although most leading indices for the island's economic
performance convey a downward trend, he thought domestic interaction

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  11  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Surging divorce rates in Australia and
the United States have changed the nature not only of marriages but
also of fatherhood, according to experts.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the Men and Family Relationships Forum in Canberra
Wednesday, Professor Paul Amato of the University of Nebraska said
more than 40 percent of first marriages in Australia end in divorce.
 "Because most divorces involve children and because most children
reside with their mothers following divorce, large numbers of men ...
are discovering that fatherhood means being a non-resident father.
Non-resident fatherhood is, in fact, a new type of fatherhood, which
we are just beginning to understand," Amato told participants of the
meeting.</P>
      <P>He said there was little evidence to support the notion that
frequent contact between non-resident fathers and their children is
good for children.</P>
      <P>A better predictor of a child's future academic success was
financial support as opposed to the number of contact hours with the
father, he said.</P>
      <P>"Studies consistently find that fathers' payment of child support
improves not only children's standard of living, but also their
health, educational attainment and general sense of well-being.
Overall, the social science research appears to indicate that
non-resident fathers are important for their money, but for very
little else," Amato said.</P>
      <P>According to the research, fathers' relationships with their
children were primarily recreational in nature. Fathers generally did
not provide authoritative parenting which involves warmth,
responsiveness, everyday assistance and instruction.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Industrial cooperation between Japan's
leading corporations and their Taiwan counterparts might be an
effective initiative to help correct Taiwan's chronic trade imbalance
with Japan, officials from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Working toward that goal, Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Yin
Chi-ming led a Taiwan business and investment delegation to Japan in
April this year. During the visit, ROC officials met with executives
from Fuji Heavy Industries Co. and other leading Japanese industrial
conglomerates for talks on cooperation.</P>
      <P>The visit began to pay off this month when a fact-finding mission
from Fuji visited Taiwan last week in a bid to tap the feasibility of
cooperating with the domestic aerospace industry.</P>
      <P>Fuji, after its officials visited five Taiwan aerospace companies
over the last week, has initially decided to co-produce parts and
components with Taiwan partners. The five Taiwan companies were
Chenfeng Machinery &amp; Enterprise, Fong Sou Machinery, Jui Li
Enterprise, Taiwan Aerospace Co., and the state-run Aerospace
Industrial Development Corp.</P>
      <P>According to the MOEA officials, Fuji has taken part in similar
cooperation with manufacturers in mainland China, India and
Singapore, but none of the efforts produced satisfactory results.</P>
      <P>If the initial cooperation with Taiwan proves successful, Fuji
officials said, the Japanese company will consider expanding the
cooperation to other lines including the assembly of major aircraft
parts and development of advanced materials for aircraft.</P>
      <P>Fuji Heavy Industries Co., which maintains five major operations
in Subaru automobiles, industrial equipment, household goods, rail
cars, and aerospace industry, posted an annual turnover of 856
billion Japanese yen in 1997 with a workforce of 15,400.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan reached a record high of
US$17.3 billion in 1997, which was a stunning increase of 25.2
percent over the previous year.</P>
      <P>In 1997, Taiwan imported US$29 billion worth of goods from Japan,
up 5.6 percent from 1996, mainly because of increased imports of
capital goods as domestic investment rose, MOEA officials said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The problems arising from having mainland
Chinese professionals visit Taiwan need to be addressed, a
high-ranking official of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Wu An-chia made the remarks at a seminar about
the situation and development of cross-strait cultural and social
exchanges. The MAC is in charge of mapping the nation's policy toward
the mainland.</P>
      <P>Wu said some of the private groups in Taiwan inviting mainland
professionals to the island did not have an adequate knowledge of the
goals behind allowing such visits. These groups were either trying to
establish communication with the mainland or seek profits from the
visits.</P>
      <P>Another problem Wu cited was that some of these mainland visitors
made improper remarks that ran counter to the current policies of the
Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Some visitors had defamed Taiwan or advocated establishing the
three currently banned direct links between the island and the
mainland (which are trade, postal, and transport), or promoted the
"one country, two systems" formula for reunification.</P>
      <P>Some visitors have even criticized the government and the leaders
of the ROC, Wu said.</P>
      <P>A number of mainland professionals, after coming to Taiwan, have
engaged in activities incompatible to their original purpose of
coming to Taiwan, including working, sight-seeing, giving commercial
performances or trying to woo Taiwan investors.</P>
      <P>Such activities have badly affected the results of good-will
exchanges across the strait, Wu stressed.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE OFFICE VOWS TO HELP TAIWAN INVESTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's representative office in
Taipei on Thursday agreed to extend a helping hand to a
group of Taiwan investors who allegedly have been swindled money by a
multinational investment company whose Asia-Pacific headquarters is
located in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The Singapore Trade Office made the promise after 50-plus Taiwan
investors, headed by New Party Taipei City Councilor Chu Mei-feng,
appealed for its assistance in freezing Global International
Investors Trading Limited's (GIITL) assets in the Southeast Asian
city-state.</P>
      <P>Chu told Pang Te Cheng, deputy head of the de facto Singapore
embassy here, that many Taiwan investors had invested in the GIITL's
Global Managed Equity Portfolio partly because its regional
operations were based in Singapore which Chu said is the envy of
Taiwan people for its low crime rate and good business reputation.</P>
      <P>Chu said scores of Taiwan investors traveled to Singapore last
week to file lawsuits against GIITL's Asia-Pacific affiliate, SCLA
Creation Ltd. However, Singaporean lawyers told them that only
judicial authorities of the country where the crime took place can
handle the case.</P>
      <P>Chu said Taiwan investors hope the Singapore government will
help probe the whereabouts of GIITL SCLA Chairman James Cheng and
immediately put a freeze on all of his assets.</P>
      <P>In response, Pang said his office would contact Singapore's
foreign ministry, commercial crime investigation department and
other related law enforcement authorities and push them to help
probe the alleged fraudulent case.</P>
      <P>Pang said he will also urge his country's law enforcement
authorities to cooperate with their Taiwan counterparts in
investigating where the GIITL's capital has flowed.</P>
      <P>GIITL opened branch offices in major Taiwan cities last
year to sell a financial product, named Global Managed Equity
Portfolio, to investors around the island. They lured investors with
guarantees of high profit rates, ranging between 30 percent and 40
percent.</P>
      <P>Its Taiwan branches even claimed that their prduct was backed by
the Standard Chartered Bank. However, the British bank's Taipei
office issued a statement last Friday, insisting that it has never
been the trust supervising bank or guarantor in connection with the
GIITL product.</P>
      <P>According to local press reports, GIITL had illegally collected
about NT$5 billion (US$143.68 million) from local investors, many of
whom were retired government employees or office workers.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB) has launched
a probe into the case. Top executives of the company's
Taiwan branches, including Huang Po-ching and Chen Chin-wen, have
not been seen in public since late last month. MJIB sources said they
might have fled abroad with the money they had collected here.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON TO DEFEND HIS BEIJING TRIP AND ENGAGEMENT POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 10 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton is to deliver
a speech on Thursday in which he will defend his "constructive
engagement" policy toward Beijing and upcoming trip to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Clinton is to address the National Geographic Association
Thursday morning, where he "will directly answer those critics that
suggest that it would be better at this point in human history to
isolate the billions of people who live in China and treat that
nation as a rogue nation," said White House spokesman Michael McCurry
in a press briefing Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Clinton will be the first US president to visit mainland China
since its army crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989.</P>
      <P>A human rights alliance has written to Clinton urging him to
avoid Tiananmen Square, the site of the massacre. Nine years after
the slaughter, the Beijing authorities have showed no repentance at
all, said the alliance.</P>
      <P>Clinton is also expected to defend his controversial decision to
approve the transfer of satellite technology to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Washington observers, however, say Clinton will have a tough time
winning over critics, especially after a House International
Relations subcommittee watched a video on forced abortions in
mainland China and held hearings that included testimony accusing
Beijing of continuing its policy of practicing forced abortions.</P>
      <P>During the hearings, one former mainland Chinese official
testified that he personally witnessed an abortion performed on a
woman who was nine month's pregnant.</P>
      <P>"I witnessed the mouth of the fetus was moving, and so did its
hands and feet. A doctor injected poison into its brain and cast the
baby into a garbage can after its death," said the former Chinese
official.</P>
      <P>McCurry did not dismiss the allegations, but he insisted that the
best way to handle this issue, as well as others, is to take them up
with authorities in Beijing directly.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Share prices slid a mere 0.2 percent on
Thursday in Taipei, as the government propped up the market with
funds aimed at stemming panic selling triggered by bearish sentiments
in Japan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>In the wake of Wednesday's 232.5-point plunge, the Taiwan Stock
Exchange's weighted price index, the market's key barometer, slipped
12.39 points to close at 7,210.74, with the index fluctuating between
7,073.22 and 7,238.92.</P>
      <P>The bourse dropped nearly 150 points after opening amid investors
undertaking margin sales. Dealers said the release of government
funds helped bolster buyer sentiment. In addition, several companies
began to buy back their shares to prevent further price declines.</P>
      <P>A total of 2.01 billion shares changed hands on a market turnover
of NT$98.32 billion (US$2.83 billion) during the three-hour session.</P>
      <P>Losers outnumbered gainers 247 to 176, with 63 stock remaining
unchanged.</P>
      <P>Of the TAIEX's eight major categories, only two -- foodstuffs and
financial issues -- gained ground, while paper and pulp shares lost
the most, falling 1 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BAD MANNERS TOP TOURISTS LIST OF GRIPES ABOUT TOUR LEADERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  11 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most complaints from Taiwan tourists last
year centered on the poor manners of tour group leaders and travel
agency officials with whom tourists were involved in disputes, the
Consumers' Foundation said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The foundation received 285 complaints last year, with 30
focusing on the poor manners of tour group leaders and agency
officials and another 24 noting the improper handling of tourists'
travel documents.</P>
      <P>Changes to tour itineraries were the subject of 22 complaints,
while another 15 bemoaned the fact that agencies had not confirmed
accommodation or vehicle reservations and, consequently, had to make
last-minute alterations. Dissatisfaction over shopping and
entertainment facilities, as well as the quality of accommodations,
accounted for another 14 complaints.</P>
      <P>Lee Feng-hsiang, secretary-general of the foundation, said that
the tour group leaders are crucial to the quality of the tourism
industry, adding that some group leaders do not meet professional
standards.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-chuan, secretary-general of Tourism Quality Protection
Association, said that leaders and guides play different roles in
handling tour groups. The statistics released by the foundation seem
to have confused the two, he said.</P>
      <P>Chen said most tourists' complaints about group leaders' manners
stem from unhappiness over compulsory trips or shopping expeditions
or rigid tour itineraries. The leaders, however, are acting in
accordance with their agencies' policies and should not take all the
blame, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION URGE EMERGENCY LEGISLATIVE MEETING TO SAVE STOCK MARKET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  11  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With no end in sight for the local stock
market's current slide, opposition party lawmakers urged the
Legislative Yuan to hold an emergency meeting to save the market by
passing two amendments to the securities exchange law.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Lin Wen-lang and New
Party Legislator Tsai Cheng-yang jointly urged the legislature to
reconvene in an emergency meeting to pass the amendments, which are
currently awaiting second readings.</P>
      <P>Both amendments, which deal with treasury stocks, are
substantially beneficial to stimulating the stock market, Lin said,
adding that they are the only measures that can halt the market's
plunge.</P>
      <P>Lin pointed out that the "deplorable" stock market's
"never-ending stumbles" have already caused a domestic financial
crisis.</P>
      <P>Although the Ministry of Finance has already put forth three
major measures to reverse the Taiwan Stock Exchange's downward
motion, they have not been effective, he said.</P>
      <P>Lin said investors should turn to the Legislative Yuan for a
solution rather than hope for too much from the Executive Yuan's
ministry-level policies.</P>
      <P>Regarding divided opinion over whether the government should
first rescue the stock market or the currency, Lin said that
stabilizing the exchange rate would require the use of hard-earned
foreign exchange reserves, a move that will adversely affect Taiwan's
financial foundations.</P>
      <P>Instead of paying so high a price, the government should start by
stabilizing the stock market, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that delaying action until the next legislative
session opens in September would be too late; only by holding an
emergency meeting to examine the proposed amendments can benefits be
brought to Taiwan's stock market and its economy, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING MAY BECOME MORE FLEXIBLE AFTER CLINTON-JIANG SUMMIT: MAC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June  11  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior mainland affairs official
predicted on Thursday that mainland China may become more active and
more flexible in promoting relations across the Taiwan Strait after
US President Bill Clinton's state visit to the mainland later this
month.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairman Chang King-yuh made the
forecast at a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Chang said Clinton will hold summit talks with his mainland
counterpart, Jiang Zemin, during his June 25-July 3 mainland visit.
This will be the third Clinton-Jiang meeting in eight months, and
Beijing authorities have made it clear that the Taiwan Strait issue
will be on the agenda.</P>
      <P>Noting that basic US stances on cross-strait issues are closer
to Taiwan's than to mainland China's, Chang said he doesn't think
the Clinton administration will deviate from its existing stances
following the Beijing summit.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chang said he expects mainland China to become
more active and more flexible in promoting cross-strait relations
after the Clinton-Jiang meeting.</P>
      <P>"Beijing may take the initiative to press for the opening of
cross-strait political talks and adopt more flexible strategies and
tactics in dealing with cross-strait affairs," Chang predicted.</P>
      <P>In related news, Vice Chairman Wu An-chia suggested at an
interministerial mainland affairs meeting that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait sign an agreement to institutionalize
bilateral information and news exchanges.</P>
      <P>Wu said cross-strait journalistic and information exchanges have
been unbalanced because of gaps in political systems and attitudes
toward news events.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Wu said, it is necessary for the two
sides to seal a formal accord on the establishment of
institutionalized channels to facilitate cross-strait information
exchanges and boost mutual understanding.</P>
      <P>Wu said Taiwan's newspapers and magazines have consistently
run detailed reports on major mainland news events. Local publishing
houses have also published many books authored by mainland writers
and scholars, and television companies have presented many mainland
China-originated programs.</P>
      <P>"Through all these media, local people can understand recents
developments or trends in mainland China," Wu said, adding that the
increasing popularity of Internet services have offered even easier
access to information about mainland China.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, Wu said mainland media have seldom reported
on Taiwan-related news stories. "Worse yet, mainland media often
offered distorted or misleading reports on Taiwan-related issues.
Mainland authorities have also imposed many restrictions on Taiwan
journalists concerning news coverage," Wu said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Wu said, mainland China has lowered the quota of
offshore programs to be aired on its TV channels since 1990 for fear
of cultural invasion from Hong Kong, Taiwan and other free countries
and areas. Mainland authorities have also imposed strict
restrictions on Internet surfing and linkup, he added.</P>

and opposition parties gave high praise to Taiwan's political and
economic achievements and are willing to enhance bilateral ties with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu made the remarks en route to Finland after concluding a
two-day visit to Latvia.</P>
      <P>The DPP chairman said the main purpose of his Latvian visit is to
gain an understanding of the country's democratization progress after
gaining independence from the former Soviet Union in August 1991.</P>
      <P>Hsu said he visited government officials and political party
leaders during his stay and held a seminar with a pro-Taiwan
parliamentary group.</P>
      <P>Claiming that both Latvia's ruling and opposition parties are
friendly to Taiwan and that both have expressed a desire to
strengthen two-way relations, the DPP chairman said the Latvian
government and private sector welcome Taiwan businesses to invest in
the country.</P>
      <P>Located near the Baltic Sea, the Latvian capital of Riga was an
important port for the former East European bloc, Hsu said. Taiwan
companies can take advantage of the city's strategic location and its
proximity to the vast markets of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu will proceed to Stockholm from Helsinki before returning home
on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu is expected to step down from his post in July, making this

    <HEADLINE>ROC  TOPS  LIST  OF  ARMS  IMPORTERS  IN  1997</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  11 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China topped a list of
the world's 15 biggest importers of weapons in 1997, according to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI).</P>
      <P>Figures released by the institute in its authoritative annual
report on world arms sales show that the ROC spent US$4 billion on
arms last year compared to US$1.5 billion in 1996.</P>
      <P>Saudi Arabia is second on the list, having spent US$2.3 billion
on arms in 1997. Mainland China is third, with US$1.8 billion.</P>
      <P>The ROC has been relatively untouched by the Asian economic
crisis which hit the region in July last year, while the worst
affected countries -- Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and Malaysia
-- have canceled major arms orders.</P>
      <P>Among its large weapons contracts with Western countries were
orders for 150 F-16 combat aircraft, Patriot air defense missiles and
helicopters from the United States, as well as six La Fayette-class
frigates and 60 Mirage 2000-5 combat aircraft from France.</P>
      <P>Economic crisis notwithstanding, Asia stayed the No. 1 arms
buyer, with a 49 percent share of global imports, up from 31 percent

    <TEXT>
      <P>Some 50 representatives of South Korean
fishery organizations Thursday staged a demonstration at the embassy
of mainland China in Seoul against mainland Chinese piracy and
illegal fishing in the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>An organizer of the demonstration said that since the two
countries established diplomatic relations in 1992, mainland Chinese
fishermen have robbed and illegally fished in South Korean waters
more and more often. They accused the Beijing government of ignoring
the problem.</P>
      <P>He said the mainland Chinese pirates are reminiscent of the "Jap
pirates," who ravaged the coastlines of China several hundred years
ago. South Korean fishery organizations set up a "countermeasure
committee" Thursday to help resolve the problem, he added.</P>

      <P>Mainland China constitutes a grave threat
to Taiwan's social order, as 64 percent of the narcotics seized by
local law enforcement authorities in 1997 originated there, according
to figures compiled by the Cabinet-level Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Taiwan law enforcement authorities intercepted a total of 2,900

      <P>However, the DGBAS also said that drug-related crime seems to
have declined this year, as only 9,431 people involved in 13,536
drug-related crimes were prosecuted in the first four months of the

    <HEADLINE>DOH CHANGES PERSONNEL AMID VIRAL OUTBREAK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) announced a
personnel change on Thursday amid a viral outbreak that has infected
thousands of children around the island and claimed the lives of
more than 30 babies and toddlers.</P>
      <P>DOH Director-General Chan Chi-shean said he has approved the
resignation of Wang Li-hsin from his position as director of the
Bureau of Communicable Disease Control (BCDC).</P>
      <P>Chan said Hsu Kuo-hsiung, a DOH adviser, will serve as acting
BCDC director for the time being, while Wang will take up the post
of deputy director of the National Institute of Preventive Medicine.</P>
      <P>Wang tendered his resignation last week amid rising criticism
of the DOH's slow response to the enterovirus 71 outbreak and its
failure to come up with contingency counter-measures.</P>
      <P>Usually spread by physical contact, the virus has been plaguing
central and southern Taiwan where most of the deaths were found.
However, Lee Ching-yun, a noted pediatrician with National Taiwan
University Hospital, warned on Thursday that the disease would
intensify in the northern part of the island.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, a one-year-old baby girl believed to be infected
with the enterovirus died in a Taipei hospital.</P>
      <P>"The outbreak will gradually reach its peak in northern Taiwan,"
Lee warned, adding that there is an urgent need to develop a vaccine
to curb the further spread of the disease.</P>
      <P>Quoting extensive tests at major hospitals in Taipei, Taichung,
Tainan and Changhua, Lee said there are at least two types of
enterovirus that are attacking children here and that the type 71 is
the most virulent.</P>
      <P>Lee said the virus might have spread from Malaysia to Taiwan as
an enterovirus epidemic outbroke in that country last year. "Now the
virus may spread from Taiwan to Hong Kong, mainland China, and
Southeast Asia," he forecast.</P>
      <P>Concerned about the virus, Japan has decided to send two experts
to Taiwan to inspect and learn more about the epidemic. The Japanese
experts are scheduled to arrive in a few days, according to DOH
sources.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the three American epidemiologists from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention invited by the DOH to help in the
investigation of the viral outbreak suggested that the DOH set up a
diagnostic center to centralize viral tests.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus usually attacks children below five years old.
The virus breaks down immunity and can leave infants susceptible to
encephalitis, meningitis, and acute inflamation of the heart muscle.
Early symptoms are similar to the flu, including fever, headache and
vomiting. The death rate of the viral infection is low if the
patients are offered timely and proper medical treatment.</P>
      <P>Doctors urged local parents to take precautions, such as
avoiding crowded places and observing a high standard of hygiene,
to protect their children from contracting the virus.</P>

(By Mike Chang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A large-scale trade delegation composed of
170 representatives from 99 Taiwan electronics and machinery
companies has chalked up at least US$300 million-worth of new
business after concluding the first two days of a promotion campaign
in Tokyo and Osaka.</P>
      <P>The promotion activity held on Thursday in Tokyo at a local hotel
drew more than 1,200 Japanese businessmen, who brokered around US$200
million-worth of business on the spot with their Taiwan counterparts.</P>
      <P>An earlier promotion fair held on Tuesday in Osaka attracted some
700 representatives from Japanese companies, who reached agreements
on US$100 million-worth of business with the Taiwan delegation.</P>
      <P>Liu Wei-te, chairman of the Taiwan-Japan Economic and Trade
Foundation and leader of the trade mission, told the CNA that he is
very satisfied with the results of the campaign so far.</P>
      <P>The large number of Japanese visitors is an indication that
Taiwan-made electronics and machinery products are popular in Japan,
he said, predicting that Japan's investment in Taiwan this year is
expected to exceed the record high level of US$850 million posted
last year.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that business conditions in Japan are sluggish at
the moment, S.C. Lee, secretary-general of the delegation, expressed
surprise at the US$300 million-worth of business and the some 80
joint cooperative ventures they have arranged with Japanese firms.</P>
      <P>He said the delegation's current visit to Japan, the 11th of its
kind, has helped the two countries establish a solid channel of
communication and exchange for the future.</P>

(By Chang Hung-kuang &amp; Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Alex Mitrofanov, chairman of the Committee
of Geopolitics of the Russian State Duma, said on Wednesday that he
will continue his efforts to promote a Taiwan Relations Bill in the
next session of parliament.</P>
      <P>He made the remarks while receiving a Republic of China National
Assembly mission led by Chen Chuan, secretary-general of the National
Assembly.</P>
      <P>In addition, Mitrofanov said he and his colleagues will work
through the Moscow City Council to draft investment laws to protect
businessmen from Taiwan and to promote bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Chen expressed his appreciation for Mitrofanov and his
colleagues' efforts to promote the Taiwan Relations Bill. However, he
reminded his Russian friends that when promoting the related bills,
they should keep in mind the principles of fairness and reciprocity.</P>
      <P>Mitrofanov said that since April, 1997, he and his fellow
parliamentarians have pushed for a reading of the bill in the State
Duma, in the hope that its enactment will lay a legal framework to
facilitate Taiwan-Russian exchanges.</P>
      <P>In a surprise move, Gennady Seleznev, speaker of the Russian
State Duma, decided arbitrarily on June 2 to remove the bill from the
agenda for the parliament's June 3 plenary session.</P>
      <P>According to Mitrofanov, although Valdimir Zhirinovsky, chairman
of the Liberal Democratic Party, suggested on June 3 the bill be
reentered into the agenda, a suggestion which gained 77 supporting
votes, it still failed to achieve a majority.</P>
      <P>Mitrofanov told Chen that he and other Russian parliamentarians
will submit a revised bill at the next parliamentary plenary session
to be held in September. In addition, he pointed out that the Moscow
City Council also plans to draft an investment law to attract more
Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>Chang Wen-chung of the Representative Office in Moscow for the
Taipei-Moscow Economic &amp; Cultural Coordination Commission, hosted a
dinner party in honor of the Russian and ROC parliamentarians on

passengers, took off from the Kaohsiung International Airport on
Thursday night for Los Angeles, becoming the first trans-Pacific

Taiwan passengers to the United States and help create business
opportunities in Kaohsiung, the largest city in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Wu, who has served as the mayor of Kaohsiung for almost eight
years, said the city has witnessed a rapid increase in its
international air traffic in recent years. Eight years ago, Kaohsiung
had only two international routes, but this number has grown to 18
today, he pointed out. He suggested that Lin should improve
facilities at all the island's domestic airports to provide travelers
with more convenient flight arrangements.</P>
      <P>EVA AIR, Taiwan's second-largest carrier, said it will use only
brand-new Boeing 747-400s to operate the new route.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The launch of a single European currency,
the euro, on Jan. 1, 1999, will serve to further integrate the
European markets and provide an extra opportunity for local
businessman to explore business opportunities there, local scholars
said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>In a symposium organized by the local Euro-Asia Trade
Organization on Thursday to prime local businessmen for the
introduction of the euro, Shen Hsuan-chih, a researcher at Academia
Sinica, said the introduction of the euro is favorable to
Taiwan-manufactured goods which are competitive in Europe because it
will reduce the losses and inconvenience incurred by having to
repeatedly exchange various European national currencies and thus
will lower business operational costs.</P>
      <P>Exploring the new European market will also lessen the island's
dependence on the markets of the United States and mainland China for
its exports, said Shen.</P>
      <P>However, he said he regretted that Taiwan's investment in the 11
European Union member states currently totals only US$133 million,
and focuses on wholesale\retail and international trade, which don't
take full advantage of the benefits of a single currency.</P>
      <P>He urged local businessmen who trade with or invest in European
states to conduct market surveys and beef up their collection of
commercial information to weather the fierce competition which is
expected after the inauguration of the single European currency.</P>
      <P>Huang Teh-feng, an associate professor at Tamkang University,
predicted that the emergence of the euro will challenge the dominance
of the US dollar in international trade and change the foreign
exchange portfolio of governments around the world.</P>
      <P>He called on both the authorities and private businessmen to
watch closely the interaction between the US dollar and the euro and
to be prepared for possible impact on the greenback.</P>

      <P>US President Bill Clinton said Thursday
he plans to ask mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin to continue
cross-strait talks with Taiwan when he visits mainland China later
this month.</P>
      <P>"I will encourage President Jiang to pursue the cross-strait

      <P>Clinton, in a speech made at the National Geographic Society, was
defending his China policy and his planned visit.</P>
      <P>He said he would participate in welcoming ceremonies at the Great
Hall of the People across from Tiananmen Square according to
Beijing's arrangements because "that is where the Chinese government
receives visiting heads of state and government."</P>
      <P>"Protocol and honoring a nation's traditional practices should
not be confused with principle," Clinton said.</P>
      <P>"A stable, open, prosperous China that assumes its
responsibilities for building a more peaceful world is clearly and
profoundly in our interests," the president added.</P>
      <P>He described his administration's choice to take this course of
action in dealing with communist China as "both principled and
pragmatic."</P>
      <P>Discounting opinions that the US should try to isolate and
contain China because of its undemocratic system and human rights
violations, Clinton said "seeking to isolate China is clearly
unworkable .... We would succeed instead in isolating ourselves and
our own policy."</P>
      <P>"Working with China is the best way to advance our interests,"
he noted.</P>
      <P>Clinton is scheduled to visit mainland China between June 25 and
July 3, making him the first American president to visit Beijing

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday
expressed optimism over US President Bill Clinton's latest speech on

"We feel positive about it."</P>
      <P>Noting that the Republic of China has advocated the resolution of

      <P>The Asian economic meltdown has dealt a
serious blow to Australia's tourism industry with the number of
visitors expected to drop by 345,000 and revenue losses estimated at
A$1.4 billion (US$830 million) in 1998, according to the Australian
Tourism Commission (ATC).</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to the CNA Friday, the ATC said the
fallout from the crisis in Australia's tourism industry has occurred
quicker than expected. Many would-be tourists in cash-strapped
countries are tightening their belts by staying at home.</P>
      <P>Australia suffered its first decline in tourist arrivals between
April 1997 and March 1998 with numbers totaling 4.21 million, down
0.4 percent from the same period in the previous year, ATC figures
showed.</P>
      <P>Tourists from Asia, excluding Japan, dropped by 7.7 percent to
1.2 million for the year ending March 1998, according to the ATC.</P>
      <P>Between April 1997 and March 1998, tourists from Singapore to
Australia rose 8.6 percent to 242,597; the figure for the Philippines
rose 6.7 percent to 38,976; mainland China was up 22.7 percent to
70,361; and Indian tourist arrivals rose 15.6 percent to 26,500, all
compared to the previous year.</P>
      <P>Australia's largest market for tourism is Japan, and the number
of tourists dropped 10 percent, or 795,725, between April 1997 and
March 1998.</P>
      <P>Tourists from Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Thailand, Indonesia
and Malaysia all registered declines ranging from one to 32 percent,
the ATC report indicated.</P>
      <P>ATC officials believe Australia could only attract 3.97 million
foreign tourists in calendar 1998, down eight percent from the 1997
level.</P>
      <P>Both domestic and inbound tourism contributed about A$63 billion
(US$48 billion) to the Australian economy in 1995-96. This amounted
to 7.4 percent of Australia's gross domestic product, the ATC said.</P>
      <P>In 1995-96, the tourism industry employed about 694,000 people, 
which accounted for 8.4 percent of Australia's total workforce, the
ATC said.</P>
      <P>Tourism is Australia's single largest export industry.
It generates A$16.5 billion (US$12.7 billion) of earnings,
representing 13.2 percent of Australia's total export earnings and
66.1 percent of its service exports in fiscal 1995-96. Figures for
1997 were not available.</P>
      <P>Tourism promoters said Australia's tourism industry would
experience a serious blow in 1998.</P>
      <P>They added that tourism is expected to grow in 1999 with an
estimated increase of 5.4 percent and total tourist numbers expected
to rise to 4.6 million by the year 2000 as Sydney hosts the Olympic
Summer Games. However, the newly revised figure of 4.6 million is far
below the original target of more than seven million.</P>

      <P>The Australian stock market is expected
to fall further in coming days following eight consecutive days of
losses which have so far wiped out about A$52 billion (US$31 billion)
from the market capitalization, brokers said Friday.</P>

on Thursday. It fell another 18 points in morning trade today,
brokers said.</P>
      <P>The stock market is expected to continue to fall in coming days
because of the lingering impact on major stock markets in Asia and
the speculation that the Reserve Bank of Australia could raise
official interest rates, analysts said.</P>
      <P>In addition, the unemployment rate in Australia could rise
slightly as more people may lose their jobs as a result of a drop in
exports to Asian countries.</P>
      <P>Yesterday's decline was also caused by a 78 point fall on Wall

    <HEADLINE>CBC INTERVENES IN CURRENCY TRADING; NT DOLLAR UP</HEADLINE>

(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan currency took a roller coaster
ride in morning foreign exchange trading Friday caused by the
Japanese yen's unstoppable decline and intervention by the Central
Bank of China (CBC).</P>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar plunged to its 35 resistance level to the
US dollar soon after opening at the previous close of 34.867.</P>
      <P>The setback led to intervention by the CBC which dumped some
US$250 million into the market, trying to reverse the falling trend
of the currency, dealers said.</P>
      <P>The CBC's efforts seemed to pay off as the NT dollar rose 0.001
to close at 34.866 in morning trading.</P>
      <P>However, a prestigious professor in banking in National Chengchi
University said the CBC's intervention was not necessary.</P>
      <P>Yin Nai-ping said during a national conference on currency issues
in Taipei Friday morning that the CBC should not intervene during
such a strong market trend which is like going against a stream's
current.</P>
      <P>He agreed that the CBC should intervene, but he warned that
intervention at an improper time could cost a great deal. Yin added
under present conditions, it is difficult to predict how much the NT
dollar should be valued against the greenback.</P>
      <P>CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan personally ordered the bank to defend
the NT dollar.</P>
      <P>Deputy Governor Shea Jia-dong reiterated that the CBC would take
action against "unreasonable" foreign exchange trade. "Now it is the

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Political uncertainty and economic
instability have heightened, although slightly, the Republic of China
on Taiwan's overall national risks, the Political and Economic Risk
Consultancy Ltd. (PERC) reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>In its most recent assessment of national risk among economies in
the Asia-Pacific region, the PERC assigned Taiwan a score of 4.52
points, on a scale in which 0 is the best and 10 the worst.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's June score was up slightly from its March score of 4.43.
The score is still significantly lower, however, than the 5.6 rating
it received in February 1996, at which time mainland China was
conducting missile tests off the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In its assessment, the Hong Kong-based economic and political
think tank based its ratings of economies in the Asia-Pacific region
on their perceived levels of various types of risk, including
internal political, social unrest and external.</P>
      <P>The PERC attributes Taiwan's higher score to three factors:
political uncertainty, resulting from the growing strength of
Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party; economic
instability, the result of region-wide turmoil that has hurt Taiwan's
exports; and a worrisome US policy toward mainland China that could
compromise Taiwan's national interests.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AIRLINES CUT FLIGHTS, PRICES TO FIGHT RECESSION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major airlines have taken steps to cope
with a travel market slowdown resulting from the recent sharp
depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar against the greenback and a
worldwide economic downturn, industry sources said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Quoting flight ticket reservation records, the sources said the
travel market really has been hit hard by the lingering Asian
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, the sources said, several carriers have
reduced the number of flights on some routes while many others have
offered unprecedented low prices to attract travelers.</P>
      <P>For instance, a dramatic fall in the number of Taiwan tourists
to the Subic Bay has prompted Far East Air Transport Corp. to cut its
flights to the new Philippine commercial hub. The airline now
operates only four flights between Taiwan and the Subic Bay per week,
with two each from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in northern
Taiwan and the Kaoshiung airport in the south.</P>
      <P>Far East has also decided to postpone indefinitely the
inauguration of direct flights to Guam in view of continued
stagnation in the travel market. The company originally planned to
open the new service in late June.</P>
      <P>Canadian Airlines International Ltd. is offering especially low
prices for its Taipei-Vancouver-US West Coast flights to lure
customers. This is the first time in many years that a carrier has
offered discount prices on such a hot route during the summer
vacation boom season.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China Airlines said it's not bad that the Civil
Aeronautics Administration had rejected its applications for opening
Taipei-Hanoi and Hsinchu-Kaohsiung routes, which were filed last
year. In view of the recent market slowdown, the airlines said it is
not interested in inaugurating such new services at the moment.</P>
      <P>Airline sources said although an economic recession will
discourage overseas pleasure trips, the number of business travelers
is not expected to be affected. Major carriers said they now focus
their promotional efforts on courting business travelers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING HOPES TO MAKE PROGRESS ON TAIWAN ISSUE IN CLINTON-JIANG TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June 11 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan issue and the lifting of US
sanctions are two areas where Beijing hopes to make progress when US
President Bill Clinton and mainland President Jiang Zemin meet later
this month, a scholar said here Thursday.</P>
      <P>But Harry Harding of the George Washington University, speaking
in a seminar sponsored by Heritage Foundation, said Beijing already
knows it will not have its wishes fulfilled on several requests
concerning Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Concerning the lifting of remaining sanctions the US imposed on
the mainland after the 1989 crackdown of pro-democracy demonstrators
in Tiananmen Square, Harding predicted that progress would be
limited.</P>
      <P>He said Beijing could expect some symbolic gains from the
Clinton-Jiang meeting, the establishment of a framework for strategic
relations and progress in substantive issues.</P>
      <P>Beijing had originally wanted the US to explicitly state that
China must be unified, stop providing arms to Taiwan, not provide
missile defense protection, and to bar all Taiwan leaders from
visiting the US, Harding said.</P>
      <P>The scholar, who briefed Clinton prior to Jiang's visit to the US
last October, said he did not believe mainland China will have its
wishes fulfilled, and equally important, mainland leaders also know
this.</P>
      <P>Harding said Beijing will instead persuade the US to officially
state the three "no's," meaning that the US will not support Taiwan
independence, not support "one Taiwan, one China" or "two Chinas,"
and not support Taiwan's efforts to join international organizations
which require statehood as a prerequisite for membership.</P>
      <P>He noted that the level of US officials who have stated the
"three no's" are increasingly higher, citing an examples remarks by
Susan Shirk, deputy assistant secretary for East Asia and Pacific
Affairs, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright recently.</P>
      <P>The question now is whether President Clinton will openly state
such position during his visit to the mainalnd and whether it will be
mentioned in a statement after Clinton-Jiang meeting, Harding said.</P>
      <P>Beijing's wish for the US to lift remaining sanctions against it
is "impractical," Harding said, because the effects of the tragedy
are not fully gone.</P>
      <P>However, the US may agree to measures such as the resumption of
guarantee for export financing to the mainland to facilitate trade
and investment, he said.</P>
      <P>The US is also unlikely to lift an arms embargo against Beijing.</P>
      <P>Harding said Beijing will reap its biggest gains on a symbolic
level. He noted that Beijing is satisfied that President Clinton is
willing to go to the mainland now instead of waiting until November
when he will attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum summit meeting in Malaysia.</P>
      <P>Beijing may think the first visit of a US president after the
1989 tragedy signifies official relations between Beijing and
Washington are "back on track," Harding stated. But he said Beijing's
belief that the summit will diminish the Tiananmen tragedy is
obviously mistaken and "impractical.</P>
      <P>On the framework of strategic relations between Beijing and
Washington, Beijing would like to listen to US views on such
relations, including US opinion on the issue of China unification,
and how such views could be integrated into bilateral strategic
relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPINION DIVIDED OVER WHETHER CBC INTERVENTION IS WISE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 12 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economists and investors are divided as to
whether the Central Bank of China's aggressive defense of the New
Taiwan Dollar on Thursday and Friday was wise.</P>
      <P>Strong intervention by the CBC demonstrated its seriousness in
defending the NT dollar, said Wang Heh-song, senior vice president
and chief economist of the International Commercial Bank of China.</P>
      <P>With the support of its board of directors, the CBC sold US$200
million in foreign reserves on Thursday and another US$250 million on
Friday to shore up the NT dollar, which has been chasing after a
falling Japanese yen.</P>
      <P>As of noon Friday, the local currency held at NT$34.866 to the
greenback, compared to Thursday's close of NT$34.867.</P>
      <P>Yin Nai-ping, a professor of banking at National Chengchi
University, said the CBC should follow the market and intervene
through currency trading rather than swim "against the current."</P>
      <P>The CBC will have to pay a heavy price if its intervention is
improperly executed, Yin said, citing last year's "agonizing"
experience when the CBC finally allowed the NT dollar to depreciate
on October 17 after spending huge amounts of its foreign reserves to
prop up the currency.</P>
      <P>Investor Liu Tsung-sheng said that a government's policy to
defend its currency is no match for international market forces,
citing as an example Thailand's failed attempts to defend the baht
last year at the onset of the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Liu said government intervention aimed at stabilizing exchange
rates will be a wasted effort. The markets alone should determine a
currency's exchange rate, he said.</P>
      <P>Chiu Yi, a researcher at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic
Research, disagreed, saying Taiwan's government should defend the NT
dollar.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, one of Chiu's colleagues, Guo Wen-cheng, said
investors should not be overly pessimistic about the market since
Taiwan's fundamentals are in good shape. However, he said the
government should still pursue reasonable economic policies to direct
market trends.</P>
      <P>Luo Ping-chang, chairman of the National Development Cultural
Foundation, noted that both foreign financial reports and domestic
financial statistics indicate Taiwan's economy is still strongly
competitive.</P>
      <P>He urged investors not to "scare themselves" into underestimating
the strength of the local economy, thereby weakening the currency and
the market.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) on
Friday urged communist China to attach importance to a newly passed
US congressional resolution pushing President Bill Clinton to demand
Beijing renounce the use of force against Taiwan during his upcoming
mainland visit.</P>
      <P>The US House of Representatives passed a concurrent resolution
with a unanimous 411-0 vote on Tuesday asking Clinton to secure a
"public renunciation by the People's Republic of China of any use of
force, or threat to use force, against Taiwan" when he meets mainland
President Jiang Zemin in Beijing later this month.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Sheu Ke-sheng said the rare unanimous vote
indicates that the Americans hope to see the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait peacefully resolve their problems or disputes.</P>
      <P>"While non-binding to the executive branch, the resolution is
expected to exert some pressure on the the Clinton administration
because it has the unanimous backing of the Democratic and Republic
parties," Sheu said, adding that Clinton may convey the
congressional opinion to Beijing leaders during his June 25-July 3
mainalnd visit.</P>
      <P>Sheu went on to say it is the Republic of China's established
policy to resolve cross-strait issues through peaceful, rational
consultations. "We already made a public renunciation of the use of
force against mainland China by terminating the Period of National
Mobilization for Suppression of the Communist Rebellion in May
1991," he noted.</P>
      <P>Sheu also hailed Clinton's major China policy speech delivered on
Thursday, saying it complies with the ROC's basic position.</P>
      <P>Clinton said when he travels to the mainland, he will encourage
Jiang to "pursue the cross-strait discussion the PRC recently
resumed with Taiwan, and where we have already seen a reduction in
tensions."</P>
      <P>Sheu said exchanges and consultations form the cornerstone of
Taiwan's current policy toward the mainland. "We have never stopped
promoting cross-strait exchanges and look forward to resuming
regular dialogue with the mainland as soon as possible."</P>
      <P>The MAC spokesman also expressed the hope that a long-stalled
second Koo-Wang meeting can be held in the near future. The first
meeting between C. F. Koo, chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange
Foundation, and Wang Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), was held
in Singapore in April 1993, during which time the two sides agreed
to hold regular meetings to discuss matters of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>However, Beijing unilaterally put a halt on a planned second
Koo-Wang meeting in mid-1995.</P>
      <P>The SEF and ARATS are semi-official bodies authorized by their
respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties.</P>

that turbulence in one economy can affect others. This makes it
difficult to maintain a currency at a certain level, Shieh said.</P>

Moreover, the bank should make investors aware that the currency's
value should be expected to change as it follows international market

    <HEADLINE>INDONESIAN SITUATION MAY AFFECT GREATER CHINA ECONOMIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The three economies of the "greater
China economic sphere" -- Taiwan, Hong Kong, and mainland China, will
be affected if the situation in Indonesia continues to deteriorate,
the United States-based consulting firm Morgan Stanley said in its
latest analysis.</P>
      <P>But the report stressed that the impact on the three economies
will be limited. Taiwan and Hong Kong have invested about US$3.4
billion and US$6.6 billion, respectively, in Indonesia.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the report forecast that Taiwan's economic growth rate
will reach 5.7 percent for 1998.</P>
      <P>Although Taiwan's exports fell in April and there is concern in
some quarters that Taiwan's economy will grow by just 5.7 percent
this year, lower than the 6.8 percent recorded in 1997, Morgan
Stanley said Taiwan's "terms of trade" have actually increased by 6
percent.</P>
      <P>Comparing the island's import and export sectors, prices for the
former have contracted more than for the latter, the report pointed
out, adding that this will benefit a country's economy.</P>
      <P>According to the report, Taiwan's export sector is now facing
strong competition from South Korean firms which have slashed prices
to boost export volume.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that Taiwan exports to the United States have
dropped in recent months, the report praised Taiwan's export sector
as demonstrating responsibility for not engaging in a price war with
South Korean firms, saying that this approach will help Taiwan
companies to chalk up greater profits.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TRADE DEFICIT WITH JAPAN EXPANDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 12 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang
said on Friday that Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan is expanding as
exports to Japan dwindle amid the ongoing depreciation of the
Japanese yen.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan totaled 17.3
billion last year, adding that this year's figure is expected to
widen further, as exports to Japan slumped 23 percent for the first
three months of the year.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the economic slowdown in Japan triggered by
the Asian financial turmoil has cut the purchasing ability of the
Japanese. In addition, the depreciation of Taiwan's currency has been
relatively moderate compared to the Japanese yen, which has raised
the price of imported raw materials, causing Taiwan to lose its
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>To improve the trade imbalance with Japan, Wang said that his
ministry has been carrying out action programs regarding Japan,
including upgrading product quality, enhancing research and
development capabilities, and introducing Japanese capital and
technology into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan at the same time should promote its trade
with Europe and the United States, since exports to Japan and other
Asian countries have declined more than 20 percent since the breakout
of the financial crisis last June.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) said that a
number of other countries have also fared poorly in trade with Japan,
pointing out that US exports to Japan between January and March
dropped 5 percent, German exports to Japan tumbled 22.5 percent,
British exports slipped 11 percent, Hong Kong exports fell 18
percent, and mainland Chinese exports moved down 1.7 percent.</P>

93.63 points to close at 7117.11.</P>
      <P>The setback was caused mainly by the weakness against the US

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia will allow Republic of China
Premier Vincent Siew to make a transit stopover when he travels to
ROC allies in the South Pacific, Australia's Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade said on Friday.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA, a spokesman for Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said the Australian government has no reason to
refuse an ordinary transit to Siew if he and his delegation stop over
in Australia on their way to the South Pacific.</P>
      <P>He said the department had acknowledged a news report by
Australian media on Siew's possible transit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan and Australia have no diplomatic relations since Canberra
switched its recognition to Beijing from Taipei in 1972, but both
countries have maintained close economic and trade ties, and two-way
trade was worth well over US$4.5 billion in 1997.</P>
      <P>The media report said Australia's ties with mainland China will
come under pressure if Siew goes ahead with his plans to stop over in
Australia next month on his way to a South Pacific tour.</P>
      <P>The report said Beijing is almost certain to object to the Siew
visit because Taipei can be expected to extract maximum diplomatic
mileage from his presence on Australian soil.</P>
      <P>If Siew stops over in Australia, he will become the most senior
official from Taiwan to visit. Siew was the first senior official
from Taiwan to visit Australia when he was economics minister in the
early 1990s. He visited Australia at least twice before becoming
premier.</P>
      <P>The Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Taiwan authorities are
looking at a number of options for a transit stop en route to the
South Pacific, but added that no final details have been conveyed by
Taiwan to Australia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT MAYORAL HOPEFULS UNITED AGAINST PARTY FAVORITE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,   June  12  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three contenders for the ruling
Kuomintang's (KMT's) nomination as candidate in the election of
Kaohsiung City Mayor united on Friday against the party's intended
nominee, incumbent Mayor Wu Den-yi.</P>
      <P>In a joint press conference on Friday afternoon, Legislator Wang
Chih-hsiung, National Assembly Deputy Su Nan-cheng, and City
Councilman Chang Jui-teh, denied that they had agreed to withdrew
from the party primary and declared their opposition to Wu's
candidacy.</P>
      <P>Although Vice President Lien Chan, who also serves as the deputy
chairman of the KMT, met with them separately early Friday, they
angrily denied that they had backed away from their intentions to
run.</P>
      <P>Claiming that Wu's candidacy will ruin the party's chances of
winning the year-end mayoral election, the three vowed to stay in the
race even if denied the opportunity to represent the party.</P>
      <P>However, if any one of them is chosen as the party's standard
bearer, the other two will throw their weight behind him, they
promised at the press conference.</P>
      <P>Wang, whose family exercises great political influence in
Kaohsiung, said that he and his father, Wang Yu-yun , National Policy
Adviser to the President , drummed up more than 20,000 votes for Wu
four years ago, but Wu never expressed thanks to them after winning
the election.</P>
      <P>Saying they agreed with the party's decision to halt the primary
and choose the candidate through inner-party consultations instead,
Wang said that this does not mean they will automatically support
anyone picked by the party.</P>
      <P>Four people had registered to enter the party primary in
Kaohsiung before the widely perceived favorite Wu declared at the
last minute his willingness to run for reelection, prompting the
party to halt the primary.</P>
      <P>The decision angered the three would-be mayors, who vowed to
boycott Wu's candidacy despite attempts by the party old guard,
including Lien Chan, to persuade them to back down.</P>
      <P>They lambasted Chen Chiung-tsan, the KMT director for
organizational affairs, for allegedly leaning on the local court to
dismiss their motion to have Wu's registration for the primary
revoked, and warned the KMT to gear up for all the negative
consequences if it sticks to its decision to have Wu run on the party
ticket.</P>
      <P>Privately, Su and Chang said they would fall in behind Wang, who
is the most serious of the three contenders, to avoid splitting the
anti-Wu camp, which they claimed outnumbers Wu's supporters.</P>
      <P>Although political analysts do not believe any of the three
contestants is a match for Wu, they could spoil Wu's chances of
reelection by dividing KMT supporters, thus playing into the hands of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING CALLS FOR EARLY WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China's trade officials are
calling on the international community to let Beijing join the
Geneva-based World Trade Organization (WTO) "as soon as possible,"
according to reports from the WTO on Friday.</P>
      <P>Addressing a seminar on the Asian financial crisis in Beijing,
Vice Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Sun Zhenyu
said the crisis has posed a serious challenge to mainland China's
foreign trade, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>However, he added, to stabilize the Southeast Asian economy and
global economy, the mainland Chinese government has solemnly
committed itself to maintaining a stable renminbi and has paid a high
price for it.</P>
      <P>"The responsible behavior of China has met with high acclaim from
the international community, and the best return of the international
community to China is to let China join the WTO as soon as possible,"
the WTO report quoted Sun as saying.</P>
      <P>"Without the participation of China, the WTO will not be
complete, he noted. It's early entry into the WTO would benefit the
country's opening and reform process and its long-term development,
and would also help China contribute more to the world in the
future," Sun was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The negative impact of the Southeast Asian financial crisis
cannot be underestimated, and the delayed consequences on mainland
China's foreign trade sector will continue to show for some time to
come, he said.</P>
      <P>"China needs two critical conditions to meet these challenges:
one is domestic stability, the other is international sympathy and
support."</P>
      <P>Mainland China's Central Bank Governor Dai Xianlong vowed
recently to keep the renminbi stable despite the sharp weakening of
the Japanese yen which has worsened the knock-on effects of the Asian
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The Japanese yen has fallen below 141 to the dollar for the first
time in seven years, and currency dealers cautioned that the drop has
put more pressure on the renminbi in "gray-market" forward trading.</P>
      <P>Concern is growing that mainland China's export-driven economy
won't be able to meet government targets of 8 percent growth unless
it devalues its currency to gain competitiveness against Japan and
other nations such as Malaysia and Thailand, whose currencies have
depreciated sharply.</P>

      <P>Taiwan holds its grassroots election on
Saturday, with 19,602 candidates vying for 8,755 precinct chief
positions in Taiwan Province, and Taipei and Kaohsiung cities.</P>
      <P>An additional 6,901 candidates are competing for 3,727 council
seats in rural and urban townships, as well as in cities throughout
Taiwan Province.</P>
      <P>This year's election campaign appears to be particularly fierce,
with colorful campaign flags prominently displayed in streets and
alleys, and vote-buying described as rampant by local newspapers.</P>
      <P>The election is also seen as an important indicator of the
strength of the various parties on the island and is thus widely
believed to be a litmus test for the year-end legislative election
and the Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>A record high number of candidates are competing in Taipei City
-- 1,231 hopefuls for 435 city precincts. The NT$45,000 monthly
stipend which the post carries is seen as the main reason so many
people are running.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung City, 1,136 people are in competition for 664
precincts, while 17,235 are vying for 7,656 precincts in Taiwan
Province.</P>
      <P>The Central Election Committee of Taiwan Province on Friday
issued a statement to show the provincial government's determination
to host a fair, open, and just grassroots election. It also called
for all parties, candidates, and the public to support a clean,
non-violent and non-corrupt election.</P>
      <P>The KMT on Friday predicted that the KMT and pro-KMT candidates
will grab 70-80 percent of the seats contested islandwide, a support
rate similar to that of the last such election four years ago.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER STRESSES MARKET SYSTEM AND ORDER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  12  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Friday that
while liberalization and globalization are the approaches taken by
the government in its pursuit of economic growth, they should not
take precedence over market system and order.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks at a luncheon meeting with reporters after
making an inspection tour of the Tainan Industrial Park in southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Speaking of the recent slides in the local stock and foreign
exchange markets, Siew said liberalization and globalization are the
course the country must follow. But he pointed out that they are just
the approaches adopted by the government and that they should not be
allowed to destroy the market's system and order.</P>
      <P>Regarding the dispute over whether or not the government should
intervene in the stock and currency markets, the premier said no
country in the world, including the United States, can afford to
totally open its markets and allow completely free flow of foreign
capital without any restrictions.</P>
      <P>Although liberalization and globalization are the world trends
and policies formally adopted by the government, Siew noted that the
situation in each country is different and that each government will
draw up a policy which most benefits its country.</P>
      <P>Citing the recent Asian financial storm which has hit several
Southeast Asian countries, Siew described it as the result of too
much liberty. In his view, those affected countries forgot to
maintain market regulations and a system, in their pursuit of market
liberalization and globalization.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in a self-penned press release, Central Bank of China
(CBC) Deputy Governor Jia-dong Shea attributed the recent plummets in
the local bourse and the value of the new Taiwan dollar to a lack of
public confidence.</P>
      <P>Responding to questions from reporters on whether foreign
speculators are targeting Taiwan, Shea admitted that some of them
have been active, but pointed out that a lack of public confidence is
far more dangerous than international speculators.</P>
      <P>The CBC deputy governor called on the public to have confidence
in the government, because "the central bank alone cannot win the
battle against international speculators without public support." At
the same time, he said the CBC will fight the foreign speculators
should they ever return.</P>
      <P>Compared to neighboring countries, Taiwan's fundamentals are
healthy and sound, Shea said, although he admitted that the local
unit has depreciated well below a reasonable level against the US
dollar, and urged the public to stop panic purchases of the
greenback, in order to help prop up the local currency.</P>
      <P>Turning to the local stock market, the ranking CBC official said
foreign capital accounts for only 3 percent in the local bourse and
that the market should soon stabilize if public confidence is
restored.</P>

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials of the Ministry of Economic
Affairs (MOEA) met on Friday to discuss measures to narrow the
nation's increasing trade deficit with Japan.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the MOEA, the Republic of
China's trade deficit with Japan totaled US$17.32 billion in 1997, an
increase of 25.2 percent compared with the previous year.</P>
      <P>Of the country's exports to Japan, electric and electronic
components for automatic data processors and monitors comprised the
bulk, but these exports have been decreasing due to a drop in demand
from Japan and the weakness of the Japanese yen.</P>
      <P>Major items imported from Japan included electric equipment,
machinery, precision optical instruments, chemicals, steel and iron.
However, due to the restructuring of certain industries, imports from
Japan of electrical equipment for labor-intensive industries have
decreased.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the MOEA's preliminary analysis indicates, the
restructuring of many of the nation's industries from labor-intensive
to technology-and-capital-intensive, and the implementation of major
investment projects, has generated an urgent need for crucial
component imports.</P>
      <P>Taking advantage of its geographical proximity to the ROC and its
current competitiveness, Japan has therefore become the main source
of these components.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A campaign to persuade Thai laborers to cut
down on alcohol intake is currently underway in a bid to spruce up
their image in the eyes of their Taiwan employers.</P>
      <P>The campaign was launched after some local employers complained
that they are tired of having to deal with rowdy Thai laborers who
have had too much to drink.</P>
      <P>Local human resource agencies pointed out that the laborers, with
their mild temperaments and willingness to accommodate the wishes of
their employers, have long been favored by local employers. But the
employers often later find them difficult to manage when they have
had a few too many.</P>
      <P>The problem is so prevalent that many employers have now
turned to other countries for the laborers they need, the agencies
added.</P>
      <P>Officials at the Thailand Trade &amp; Economic Office in Taipei also
have voiced concern about the trend.</P>
      <P>They said that at a time when the jobless rate in Thailand has
hit 2 million, and the Thai government is actively seeking overseas
job opportunities for their nationals, the number of Thai laborers
here has declined.</P>
      <P>Only about 130,000 Thai laborers are currently working in Taiwan,
down 25,000 from the peak period in 1996.</P>
      <P>The officials said that in order to spruce up the image of the
laborers, the office has been working with Taiwan's human resources
agencies and several broadcasting stations that carry Thai-language
programs to sponsor a campaign to persuade them to cut down on
drinking.</P>
      <P>Thai laborers are welcome to either mail letters or call to give
their opinions on resolving the drinking problem, or they can
promise to refrain from drinking during their working period
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The officials said that the office will broadcast messages during
Thai-language programs to remind the Thais to think about their own
health and their families at home, and ask them to prepare for a
better life when they return to Thailand.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Time Magazine will carry a special
report on the Republic of China's basic stance and attitude toward
relations across the Taiwan Strait, about 10 days before US President
Bill Clinton makes a state visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The report, which features interviews with President Lee Teng-hui
and other senior ROC officials, appears in the latest issue of the
magazine's American and Asian editions, which will hit newsstands
next Monday.</P>
      <P>The prestigious weekly sent a team of journalists to Taipei
earlier this month in an effort to give balanced coverage of the
Taiwan Strait issue ahead of Clinton's arrival in Beijing, which will
undoubtedly bring mainland China into the international limelight.</P>
      <P>Senior mainland officials have said on many occasions that the
Taiwan Strait issue will be high on the agenda of Clinton's summit
meeting with mainland President Jiang Zemin later this month.</P>
      <P>The team was headed by Bruce Nelan, Time's senior editorial
writer based in Washington, D.C., and its members included the
magazine's Asia managing editor Donald Morrison, Hong Kong bureau
chief Terry McCarthy, Asia correspondent Sandra Burton and reporter
in Taipei Donald Shapiro.</P>
      <P>Nelan is one of Time's most senior editorial writers. He has
covered news in Hong Kong, Bonn and Moscow, and often traveled to
Taipei for news coverage when he worked in Hong Kong some 10 years
ago.</P>
      <P>Nelan told the CNA that he was impressed by Taiwan's progress in
economic development and political democratization in recent years.
After learning that Clinton will visit mainland China from June 25
through July 3, Nelan said he had taken the initiative to make a
report on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He then contacted Yao Shuang, the information division chief at
the ROC's representative office in Washington, asking him th
help arrange for the team to interview several senior ROC leaders.</P>
      <P>Yao said it is rare for Time to simultaneously carry in-depth
reports on Taiwan in both its Asian and American domestic editions.

    <HEADLINE>ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS REAFFIRM OPPOSITION TO PINGNAN PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The biggest problem posed by the proposed
development of a new industrial zone in southern Taiwan lies in its
potentially excessive water consumption, an alliance composed of
various environmental groups said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the alliance, National Taiwan University
Professor Hsieh Chih-cheng, said that the development of Pingnan
Industrial Zone, to be located in southern Taiwan's Tainan County, is
expected to use an estimated 300,000 tons of water per day, which is
roughly equivalent to the daily requirements of 1 million people.</P>
      <P>The proposed NT$400 billion (US$11.62 billion) zone, which would
be the island's largest single investment project, will house the
island's 7th naphtha cracker, a steel mill, and its own harbor, if
construction goes ahead.</P>
      <P>The staunch environmentalist said that the two reservoirs near
the zone, Nanhua and Wushantou, could supply 810,000 tons of water
per day, but pointed out that even the Water Resources Bureau under
the Ministry of Economic Affairs now has mixed views about the
Pingnan Industrial Zone's estimated heavy consumption.</P>
      <P>He noted that the bureau originally said that the water supply
would pose few problems, but later changed its stance, announcing
instead that a new reservoir would be built to meet the demand after
questions from environmentalists about the water supply for the zone.</P>
      <P>At the same time, Hsieh said, water consumption problems in the
agricultural sector have long been overlooked.</P>
      <P>Some argue that cultivated land is expected to decrease after
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO), leading to a
decline in demand for water from this sector.</P>
      <P>But he pointed out that in fact, water for farmland has already
been decreasing in the past few years, mainly because of draughts,
and because of farmers allowing their land to lie fallow in order to
plant more profitable crops in the future. In addition, irrigation
water has long been diverted for non-agricultural uses.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that if construction of the Pingnan Industrial Zone
takes place as scheduled, it could compound the water shortage
problem in southern Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kao Cheng-yen, convener of the Green Party, described the
industrial zone as a high energy-consumption project, and said that
the government should immediately call a halt to its development in
order to protect the environment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, alliance officials said that they will mobilize people
from southern Taiwan on Monday to stage a protest in front of the
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) headquarters in Taipei.</P>
      <P>The EPA is responsible for the assessment of water consumption
and its effect at the Tainan Science-based Industrial Zone, another
large infrastructure project in southern Taiwan which is already
under construction.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHANGHAI DISSIDENTS HOPING TO MEET CLINTON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  June  12  (CNA)
(By David Wang &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Six mainland Chinese dissidents from
Shanghai on Thursday entrusted the Hong Kong-based Information Center
for Human Rights and the Democratic Movement in China with an open
letter to US President Bill Clinton, in which they express their
desire to meet with him during his upcoming visit to the city of
Shanghai and to exchange views with him about human rights.</P>
      <P>The letter discloses that during Clinton's Shanghai visit, the
six dissidents will try their best to greet the US president, and
that if they are prevented from doing so and detained by the public
security authorities, they will stage a hunger strike in protest,
according to a news release faxed to New York news media by the
information center on Friday.</P>
      <P>The dissidents said that while Clinton is concerned about trade
and economic relations between Washington and Beijing, about the
functions Beijing could provide in Asia, and about the Taiwan and
Tibet issues, he should be even more concerned about the democratic
movement and human rights in mainland China, as well as the thousands
of prisoners of conscience still being deprived of their basic human
rights by the Beijing regime.</P>
      <P>The letter expresses the dissidents' hope that Clinton will
listen to different points of view regarding the situation in
mainland China, and make more effort to address the human rights
issue there.</P>
      <P>Although Shanghai's economic growth has enjoyed great success in
recent years, the human rights situation has deteriorated more than
in most of the other provinces and cities of the mainland, with many
dissidents arrested and sentenced to "re-education through labor,"
the information center's press release stressed, adding that human
rights in mainland China as a whole have also started to regress.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEATH TOLL OF ENTEROVIRAL EPIDEMIC REACHES 36</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An enteroviral outbreak has claimed the
lives of 36 babies and toddlers in Taiwan over the past four months,
the Department of Health (DOH) reported on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The department has finished an extensive study of the medical
history of 200 patients who were suspected of contracting enterovirus
71 and hospitalized at 23 large teaching hospitals around the island
from Feb. 15 through June 12.</P>
      <P>"Among the cases, 36 patients have died," said Hsu Kuo-hsiung,
acting director of the DOH's Bureau of Communicable Disease Control.</P>
      <P>Quoting the study, Hsu said the viral epidemic peaked at the end
of May and has since started to decline.</P>
      <P>"Suspected cases of enterovirus infections began to surface
sporadically in mid-February, and the situation gradually aggravated
and climaxed in late May," Hsu reported.</P>
      <P>Some 20 cases of the disease were reported during the week of May
10, with 30 new cases reported the following week and an additional 50
cases reported during the week of May 24.</P>
      <P>The number of new cases then started to decline with 40 cases
reported during the week of May 31 and a single-digit figure reported
for the first four days of the following week, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The northern part of the island accounted for the largest number
of cases of enteroviral infections, Hsu said, followed by
Taiwan's central, southern and eastern parts, in that order.</P>
      <P>"As of Friday, 38 confirmed enteroviral cases had been reported
in metropolitan Taipei, 32 in Taipei County, 21 in Taichung County,
and 19 each in Taoyuan and Changhua counties," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The study also found that 94 percent of the 36 deceased patients
had developed a high fever and 89 percent had suffered breathing
difficulties, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, more than 90 percent of patients who have already been
discharged from the hospital or are still being hospitalized suffered
from fever.</P>
      <P>Hsu said further study is required to determine which symptoms
are most dangerous. "The result is expected to come out next week,
when a detailed report on mutated hybrid forms of the virus detected
in the bodies of the victims will also be available."</P>
      <P>Hsu also stressed that no dults have so far been infected
with the enterovirus-caused hand-mouth-foot disease.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the China Medical College Hospital in Taichung
said it has discovered evidence of enterovirus attacking brain stem
of the patients.</P>
      <P>"The finding will help doctors to more effectively treat or
control the disease," said Shen Wu-chung, director of the hospital's
X-ray examination department.</P>
      <P>To date, doctors still did not know for sure whether the
enterovirus-related deaths were caused by heart failures or
brain death.</P>
      <P>"MRI tests clearly show that the medulla, mid-brain
and pons cerebelli of several seriously ailing patients were all
infected and became swollen," Shen noted.</P>
      <P>Shen said the hospital has treated more than 1,690 babies and
young children infected with the enterovirus since May. Most of them
have recovered after receiving treatment. Only three of them who have
developed meningitis are still staying in the intensive care
ward.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus usually attacks children below five years old.
It breaks down immunity and can leave infants susceptible to
encephalitis, meningitis and acute inflamation of the heart
muscle. Early symptoms are similar to the flu, including
fever, headache and vomiting. The death rate is low if the
patients are offered timely and proper treatment.</P>
      <P>Parents are advised not to take young children out in
crowded places, and be sure children changed clothes and washed
their hands frequently.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy has weathered Asia's
economic crisis better than many other economies in the region,
reports the Germany daily Handelsblatt.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's first-quarter economic growth amounted to 5.9 percent,
lower than the government's projection of 6.9 percent, but still
significantly higher than that of Hong Kong or Japan. Taiwan is
predicting gross domestic product growth of between 5.5 percent and 6
percent for 1998.</P>
      <P>As have most Asian currencies, however, the New Taiwan dollar has
fallen since the onset of the crisis. Currently the NT dollar is
trading at an 11-year low. Taiwan is finally feeling the impact of
the crisis, although it withstood the first wave better than its
Asian neighbors, the report said.</P>
      <P>The report lauds Taiwan's private sector for strong investments
that have lessened the effects of a drop in exports. Praise is also
given for Taiwan's emphasis on promoting high-tech industries and for
its investments in education, training and management.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's economy, which comprises a large number of small- and
medium-sized companies, has proven more durable than the economies of
South Korea or Japan, both of which contain many conglomerates,

    <HEADLINE>NT NEED NOT FLUCTUATE WITH JAPANESE YEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar does not need to
fluctuate with the Japanese yen because the two countries' economic
fundamentals are different, a senior official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Minister-without-Portfolio Shirley Kuo, who once served as
finance minister and deputy governor of the Central Bank of China,
made the remarks at an international seminar on monetary policy.</P>
      <P>Kuo said it is erroneous to think the NT dollar's exchange rate
against the yen should be maintained at a 1-to-4 ratio.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Kuo said, Taiwan's economic fundamentals are
healthier than Japan's.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Kuo said, the government has pegged its currency
exchange rate policy mainly to the value of the US greenback, not the
yen.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Kuo said, the NT dollar does not need to
depreciate in tandem with the yen.</P>
      <P>The NT dollar has depreciated by nearly 50 cents against the
greenback over the past five days mainly because of a weakening
Japanese currency.</P>
      <P>Many local and foreign scholars present at Saturday's seminar
echoed Kuo's views, saying the NT dollar should not fluctuate with
the yen.</P>
      <P>They said the NT dollar's recent depreciation was triggered
primarily by psychological factors.</P>
      <P>Philip Turner, a senior banker from Switzerland, said
Taiwan people seem to have forgetten that their country's economy is
in a far better shape than many other Asian economies, including
Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>"When many Asian countries raise their interest rates, Taiwan is
the only one that has not done so. This indicates that the NT dollar
remains stronger than many other Asian currencies," Turner noted.</P>
      <P>Ronald W. Anderson, a university professor from Belgium, said
the Japanese yen's steep fall should be a temporary phenomenon as
the Japanese government is unlikely to sit idle and let its
financial crisis deteriorate further.</P>
      <P>"I'm convinced that Japan will adjust its monetary policy soon
to tackle its economic woes," Anderson said.</P>
      <P>The seminar was co-sponsored by the central bank and Academia
Sinica, Taiwan's highest academic body.</P>

    <HEADLINE>COMMUNIST PARTIES OF JAPAN, CHINA NEEDS EACH OTHER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June  13 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The normalization of relations between the
Japan Communist Party (JCP) and the Communist Party of China (CPC)
after 31 years of estrangement was prompted by their need for each
other, observers here said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Nishiguchi Hikaru, chief of the International Affairs Division
of JCP, and his Chinese counterpart Dai Bingguo, head of the
International Liaison Department of the CPC Central Committee,
announced the normalization of relations between the two parties
Thursday in Beijing. JCP Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa is scheduled to hold
talks with CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin next month in Beijing.</P>
      <P>The relations between the two communist parties began to
deteriorate in 1966, when they had bitter ideological disputes.
CPC Chairman Mao Zedong said in July 1966 that the United States, the
Soviet Union, the then ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, and
the JCP were four "major enemies of the Cultural Revolution."</P>
      <P>The relations were severed in August 1966, when Red Guards
roughed up a JCP official in the Beijing Airport at the height of the
Cultural Revolution. Representatives of the two communist parties
held talks in 1985 over the possibility of resuming relations, but
produced no results.</P>
      <P>The relations began to warm up suddenly in December 1997, when
Dai said in an article published in the People's Daily that it was
possible for the two parties to resume formal relations. JCP's organ
newspaper Akahata, or Red Flag, established a branch office in
Beijing in February.</P>
      <P>Observers in Tokyo said the two communist parties chose to
normalize their relations now, because they found they need to
reconcile with each other for mutual benefits.</P>
      <P>In recent years Japan's major opposition Social Democratic Party
and Democratic Party have been falling in strength, while the JCP has
been growing steadily. The JCP now controls 26 seats in the House of
Representatives and 14 seats in the House of Councilors.</P>
      <P>The observers said it is apparent that the CPC needs the help of
JCP at a time when Beijing is very concerned about the new guidelines
for US-Japan defense cooperation and about Japan's position on the
issue of whether Taiwan is included in the sphere of the defense
cooperation.</P>
      <P>The JCP is known for its long-standing opposition to US-Japan
defense cooperation.</P>
      <P>Fuwa said at a press conference earlier this week that he will
exchange views with Jiang on a wide range of issues, including the
problems concerning the sphere of US-Japan defense cooperation, when
he visits Beijing next month.</P>
      <P>There is a strong correlation between the reconciliation of the
two parties and the changing political situations in Japan, the
observers said, adding that the CPC wants to use the JCP as a
"diplomatic channel" in Japan and as a leverage against the Japanese
government.</P>
      <P>The reconciliation is also in the interest of the JCP, the
observers said, because it can improve its image as an "open party"
and thus make it more popular with a large number of "independent"
voters.</P>
      <P>The normalization of relations with the CPC may not only help the
JCP's policy of increasing its visibility in the international arena,
but also help Fuwa's hope to build up his prestige as the new leader
of the party, the observers said.

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY CALLS FOR CHANGE OF PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  13  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The right-wing opposition New Party on
Saturday urged the Legislative Yuan to immediately call an
extraordinary meeting to decide whether Premier Vincent Siew should
step down in the wake of a recent series of natural and man-made
disasters.</P>
      <P>New Party Secretary-General Yok Mu-ming, himself a legislator,
said he hopes Taiwan Governor James Soong will replace Siew as the
premier with a view to reducing frictions between the central and
provincial governments.</P>
      <P>Yok said Soong recently lasked out at the central government for
failing to financially support anti-flooding construction projects in
several counties, which Soong said was the culprit for recent
flooding in central and southern Taiwan. Soong's criticism drew
immediate denial by Siew's Cabinet, dismissing Soong's
accusations as "irrational" and "unacceptable."</P>
      <P>Caliming that the incident indicated Siew can neither control
floods nor clarify the responsibility of recent flooding, Yok said
he thinks Siew should step down and let a more compentent person
take up the post to lead the country to a brighter future.</P>
      <P>Yok further said the recent domestic fianncial turmoil has
promoted several senior advisers to President Lee Teng-hui to
criticize the government's monetary and stock market
policies. "This is another indication of Siew's inability to address
many challenges and problems faced by our country."</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Yok said, Siew should show his
political wisdom by leaving his post.</P>
      <P>Chen Yi-hsin, New Party whip in the Legislative Yuan, said he
will meet with the speaker and deputy speaker of the legislature
and heavyweights of other major political parties in the next
few days to seek their support for convening a special legislative
meeting to discuss the proposal.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party's legislative caucus said he doesn't think the New Party's
proposal can win the majority support in the legislature. "Even if
Siew steps down, I don't think President Lee would name Soong to
succeed him," the spokesman added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, none of Soong's close aides would comment on
the New Party's proposal.</P>

and candidates of other minor opposition parties garnered a total of
1,872 seats, or 50.26 percent.</P>
      <P>In the contests of neighborhood chiefs, the KMT won 3,520 seats,

      <P>The successful candidates will swear in for a four-year term on

      <P>The KMT, DPP, and other political parties campaigned vigorously

    <HEADLINE>MAJOR PARTIES SATISFIED WITH OUTCOME OF GRASSROOTS ELECTIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 14 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>All three major political parties expressed
satisfaction with their performances in Saturday's island-wide
grassroots elections.</P>
      <P>Although the ruling Kuomintang's grip on this level of politics
appears to be diminishing somewhat after decreasing its share of
seats by about 4 percent to 45 percent, Chen Chiung-tsan,
Director-General of the KMT Organization Affairs Department said it
was "a natural reflection of the current political reality."</P>
      <P>That figure is well above the major opposition Democratic
Progressive Party's share of 1.5 percent, and with support from its
allies among independent members -- which grabbed the lion's share of
seats with 53 percent -- the KMT is still confident in its dominance
in the island's grassroots politics, Chen said.</P>
      <P>He was especially satisfied with the performance of party
candidates in Taipei City, where the number of KMT precinct chiefs
was trimmed by only 6 percent despite the fact the city is ruled by
DPP's Mayor Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>The DPP's 1.5 percent share in the elections does not compare to
over half of the island's seats for city or county heads, nor is the
figure close to the nearly 30 percent of legislative seats the party
holds. However, Kao Hsing-hsuei, acting director of the DPP
Organization Department, still takes comfort in the party's slight
gain of 0.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Kao attributed the party's gain to voters being fed up with the
KMT's corruptive ways at the grassroots level. He said the DPP is
beginning to expand its power base to the level of community.</P>
      <P>New Party candidates won 26 of the 99 seats they were contending,
a performance party Convenor Chou Yang-sun called not good enough,
but acceptable.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN WOMEN FACE DIFFICULTY IN REENTERING WORKFORCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>About one-third of Taiwan women must leave
their jobs after becoming pregnant and they invariably face
difficulty when they try to reenter the workforce, participants in a
seminar said here on Sunday.</P>
      <P>They made the remarks at a two-day seminar on women employment
and labor policy sponsored by the Council of Labor Affairs.</P>
      <P>Professor Hsieh Hsiu-feng of Soochow University said the
traditional role of women calls for them to stay home to take care of
the family. When work runs counter to their role as a mother, many
women give their top priority to their family.</P>
      <P>Hsieh cited statistics released by the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting &amp; Statistics which showed about one-third of women
in Taiwan leave their jobs after becoming pregnant.</P>
      <P>She said the statistics showed household chores and child rearing
were the primary issues which affected women's willingness to
participate in the workforce.</P>
      <P>When their children grew older, women often found their chances
of finding jobs were limited either because of age restrictions or
because they found the work schedule difficult to accommodate.</P>
      <P>Hsieh conducted a survey which showed that as many as 86.4
percent of women interviewed said it was hard for them to find a job
which took into consideration their interests, specialty and the
needs of their families.</P>
      <P>Some women surveyed said it was difficult to find appropriate
work because a long hiatus from the job market diminished their
competitiveness, she said.</P>
      <P>Only the establishment of more nurseries and a sound social
security system will help solve the problem, she said.</P>
      <P>Chen Ma-li, director for a women's employment promotion center in
Taipei, said there is a huge gap between the supply and demand for
women seeking second employment.</P>
      <P>She said short-term job opportunities supplied by businesses
usually attaches no strings to age, education level or specialty, but
they tend to offer lower wages and are less attractive to women.</P>
      <P>Those jobs that are more attractive to women will almost
invariably require certain qualifications, the most common being good
computer and language skills.</P>
      <P>Chen also said for women seeking to reenter the workforce, they
will have to address the problem of taking care of the young and old
of the family.</P>
      <P>She suggested that the government and private sector work
together to establish more nurseries and retirement homes so women,
like men, will not have to worry about their families when they
accept work.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MOEA TARGETS EUROPE TO PROMOTE TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 14 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Worried about Taiwan's declining exports in
recent months, economic officials are scheduled to visit Europe to
promote trade, the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang will lead a
delegation to Belgium next month to hold meetings with the European
Union on trade and economic cooperation, officials said.</P>
      <P>Bilateral trade between Taiwan and Europe has continued to rise
since 1986, registering an annual increase of 7.9 percent. Europe has
now become Taiwan's third largest trading partner, next only to the
United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>In view of Taiwan's declining exports following Asia's financial
turmoil, officials said promotional efforts in Europe will center on
increased exports or a cut in the trade imbalance.</P>
      <P>With the economic situation in Japan spiraling down, it would not
be a surprise if Taiwan's trade imbalance with Japan hit US$20
billion this year, officials noted. In comparison, the economic
situation in Europe will continue to be strong, especially after the
introduction of Europe's single currency next year.</P>
      <P>The MOEA is urging Taiwan manufacturers to take the opportunity
to step up promotional efforts to cut the trade deficit with Europe.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to Europe totaled US$18.4 billion while imports
from Europe recorded US$21.6 billion last year. Taiwan suffered a
trade deficit of US$3.2 billion.</P>
      <P>To promote trade, Wang will meet with leaders of the EU in
Brussels, Belgium in July to discuss trade and investment problems in
electronics, machinery, aeronautics, automobile, and biochemical
sectors, as well as proposals on industrial cooperation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen Juei-lung, director general of the Bureau of
Foreign Trade, will also lead a delegation to visit Latvia, Lithuania
and Russia in September.</P>
      <P>Chen will call on trade officials and meet with businessmen in
the three countries to help promote substantial economic relations
with them.</P>
      <P>He said the depreciation in the Taiwan dollar against European
currencies in recent months has made Taiwan's information technology
and other industrial products more competitive.</P>
      <P>The EU's scrapping of preferential tariffs on products from Hong
Kong, South Korea, and Singapore will also benefit the export of
Taiwan's products.</P>
      <P>Central and East European countries have adopted more open
markets and liberal trade rules to facilitate their bids to enter the
EU, a trend which Chen said will help Taiwan in promoting trade.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THREE DEFENSE CONTRACTORS DETAINED IN MILITARY SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three defense contractors were recently
detained by prosecutors on suspicion of defrauding the air forces in
a NT$300 million (US$8.82 million) construction project, a local
daily reported on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Tung Liang, the husband of Kaohsiung City Councilor Yang Se-yu
and owner of the Huatsou Construction Company, was accused of
allowing Ou Wei-liang and Wang Kuang-han to illegally bid and win a
public contest for the contract under the company name of Huatsou.
All three were detained by Kaohsiung District Court prosecutors,
according to the China Times.</P>
      <P>Investigators from the Ministry of Justice's Investigation Bureau
said the alleged scandal took place between 1992 and 1993. Ou and
Wang not only took part in the public bidding under the name of
Huatsou, but also arranged for another six firms controlled by Tung's
father-in-law, Yang Jui-tung, to also put in bids to make the bid
appear above board.</P>
      <P>The men reportedly bribed air force officers to turn a blind eye
to their illegal maneuvering and conspired with them to alter the
contract specifications to favor the contractor's profits, the China
Times reported.</P>
      <P>Tung, Yang and Ou were summoned by investigators on June 8 for
interrogation. Tung admitted lending the company's name and
credentials to Ou and Wang and distanced himself from the alleged
bribery.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Yang said he was the silent owner of the six
companies, and he did not have a hand at running the daily
operations. He was released after questioning.</P>
      <P>Tung and Ou also denied any wrongdoing. They were referred to the
prosecutors and put in custody after questioning.</P>
      <P>Wang, accompanied by a legislator from Kaohsiung, surrendered
himself on June 11, and was arrested.</P>
      <P>A former colonel who retired after the bidding was completed is
also reportedly involved in the scandal. Investigators refused to
identify him, but said they have a subpoena issued against him.</P>
      <P>The construction project targeted in the probe is part of the air
force's Chiashan project which is aimed at stationing the country's
valuable jet-fighters in a base in Hualien, eastern Taiwan. It is
considered less vulnerable to a possible air attack by Beijing than
western Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The scandal was exposed when investigators delved into another
scandal last year involving the armed force's contract for
jet-fighter's anti-bombing bunkers.</P>
      <P>Several military officers, including a lieutenant general and a
major general as well as contractors were detained in that case
pending prosecution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO PROGRESS IN TAIWAN ISSUE EXPECTED IN SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  14  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although Taiwan is a sensitive core
issue between the United States and mainland China, the two sides are
not expected to achieve a major breakthrough on the issue when the
leaders from both countries meet, political observers said.</P>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton is scheduled to meet with mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin during his visit to the mainland from
June 25 to July 3.</P>
      <P>As relations among Washington, Taipei, and Beijing are
complicated and sensitive, political analysts said Clinton would not
want to spend much time discussing Taiwan. However, Jiang will
undoubtedly raise the issue during their second meeting.</P>
      <P>US State Department officials recently said discussions will
touch on weaponry proliferation, human rights, political and security
talks, military exchanges, legal and law enforcement cooperation,
economic growth, energy and environmental protection and technology
development.</P>
      <P>The White House declared in official documents following the
first Clinton-Jiang meeting last October that the United States and
mainland China had made noticeable progress in the above mentioned
issues.</P>
      <P>Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, said in May during testimony to the Senate that
Washington will not sign any new communique on Taiwan with Beijing
and that Taiwan interests will not be sacrificed in the June
Clinton-Jiang meeting.</P>
      <P>Stephen Chen, representative of the Republic of China to the
Untied States, also said the US has reassured the ROC representative
office that "there will no surprise regarding the Taiwan issue during
the coming summit."</P>
      <P>Most important, Chen said, is that Washington has realized
Beijing would exercise far greater pressure on it regarding the
Taiwan problem if Clinton were to sign a formal agreement committing
to the "three no's."</P>
      <P>As Clinton will be the first US president to visit mainland China
since the 1989 military crackdown on democratic demonstrators at the
Tiananmen Square, his mainland trip carries a great deal of symbolic
importance in the international community, US China experts said.</P>
      <P>Beijing will achieve the last step in its efforts to return to
international society, even though Clinton is just to shake hands
with Beijing leaders at the airport and immediately return to the
United States, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>Although Clinton's China policy and visit to the mainland have
been widely criticized in the United States and little progress is
expected to be made, some analysts urge Taipei to closely monitor the
situation.</P>
      <P>Richard D. Fisher, a senior China expert with the
conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, has warned Taiwan not to
let down its guard because there will always be another summit in the
future.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN-BORN CANDIDATES LOSES IN QUEENSLAND ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  14  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan-born Steven Huang, the youngest
candidate in Queensland's polls on Saturday, lost in his first
Legislative Assembly election mainly because of strategic mistakes by
his own Liberal Party.</P>
      <P>Another ethnic Chinese candidate, Dr. Anthony Lee, also lost in
the election. Lee, a migrant from Hong Kong, represented the
Democrats Party in Southbank, Brisbane. He was not available for
comment.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the CNA Sunday, Huang said the strategy to
put the One Nation Party first ahead of the Australian Labor Party
was "a terrible mistake for the Liberal Party."</P>
      <P>In addition, this year's elections focused not on good policies,
but more on sensational issues propagated by the One Nation Party,
which dominated Australian media during the elections, he said.</P>
      <P>"This year's elections were much different from the previous
ones," Huang noted.</P>
      <P>In the Sunnybank electorate, four candidates from four parties --
Labor, One Nation, Liberal and Democrats -- competed but the Labor
Party candidate emerged as a winner, Huang said.</P>
      <P>He said he finished second, but could not get the precise figure
because it would take a day or two to finalize the official counting
of the ballots.</P>
      <P>"This year's election will offer a valuable experience for me and
I hope to have another chance to take part in the next election three
years from now," he said.</P>
      <P>Huang noted preliminary figures showed he lost only about 7
percent of the ballots to his opponents in his electorate compared to
an average loss of about 18 percent by his Liberal Party colleagues
in other electorates in Brisbane, other cities and towns throughout
Queensland.</P>
      <P>"I failed to get elected this time, but I had tried my best to
give a good fight during the election. This will serve a good lesson
for me in future elections," he said.</P>
      <P>The 22-year-old Huang was the youngest candidate among over 300
candidates from different parties competing for 89 seats at the
Queensland Legislative Assembly.</P>
      <P>Huang said he was still young and could afford to take the time
to gain more experience and become a better, more skilled opponent
in future elections.</P>
      <P>He plans to finish his post-graduate study at the University of
Queensland as he has spent much time and effort to launch his
election campaign in the past months.</P>
      <P>"I will return and hope to succeed in future elections," he said.

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN PM SEEN CHANGING STRATEGY AFTER ONE NATION'S STUNNING WIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  14 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The sweeping political debut of the One
Nation Party in Saturday's Queensland Legislative Assembly elections
may lead a stunned Prime Minister John Howard to change his federal
election strategy, analysts predicted.</P>
      <P>Howard's plans to announce the double dissolution election in
August may be put on hold after the massive show of support for
Independent Member of Federal Parliament Pauline Hanson and her party
candidates in the Queensland elections.</P>
      <P>He was expected to make the announcement to his Cabinet on Monday
in Melbourne.</P>
      <P>The strong showing by the One Nation Party in Saturday's
elections, unprecedented for a new party, virtually guarantees it
will win seats in the Senate in the next federal election, analysts
said.</P>
      <P>According to preliminary estimates, the One Nation Party is
expected to win up to 10 seats from Saturday's elections. The figure
is much higher than the earlier forecast of two to four seats for the
One Nation Party.</P>
      <P>Official counting of the total ballots is expected to be
finalized in a day or two.</P>
      <P>Analysts predicted One Nation candidates would win at least two
Senate seats in Queensland if Howard were to announce a double
dissolution soon, and two to four more seats in Western Australian
and New South Wales.</P>
      <P>They believe Howard and his senior ministers are expected to
discuss shelving the original plan for a federal election in August.
Instead, the date may be postponed to October, November or even early
next year.</P>
      <P>They said One Nation's unexpectedly high voter support across
Queensland will pose a dilemma of massive proportions for Howard and
his Liberal Party in the next federal election.</P>
      <P>Howard must now decide whether to risk losing further control of
the Senate in a double dissolution election triggered by the failed
native title land bill or lose credibility in the National Party's
heartland by holding a half-Senate election and further delaying a
resolution of the native title issue.</P>
      <P>Analysts said minor parties such as the One Nation Party have a
greater chance of winning with a double dissolution because all the
78 Senate seats are up for grabs, reducing the quota of votes needed
for each.</P>
      <P>They said the One Nation Party could cash in on the victory of
the Queensland election to score wins for Senate seats.</P>
      <P>Observers believe the Cabinet's moderate ministers are expected
to further pressure Howard to re-think his earlier refusal to direct
the Liberal Party's state branches to place the Labor Party below the
One Nation Party on their federal how-to-vote cards.</P>
      <P>These ministers would argue that the success of the One Nation
Party in Queensland elections came off the back of the National and
Liberal Party preferences to Hanson's party.</P>
      <P>The One Nation's success came at the expense of an unprecedented
collapse in the National Party vote in regional Queensland. The
National Party is the only party that forms the coalition government
with the Liberal Party in Canberra.</P>
      <P>Analysts believe the Queensland elections would send the Labor
Party back to power because initial figures show the Labor Party
winning 46 seats out of the 89 seats at the Legislative Assembly,
accounting for more than 50 percent of the total seats needed to form
the state government.

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE TO FURTHER WIDEN ITS INDUSTRIAL SECTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  14  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore will further widen its
industrial sector by strengthening manufacturing services under an
"Industry 21" program, a trade minister said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The program, mapped out by the Singapore Economic Development
Board (EDB), was announced by Singapore's Second Minister for Trade
and Industry Yeo Yong Bon.</P>
      <P>The program aims to push Singapore up the value chain, to ensure
that the manufacturing sector remains a key pillar of the Singapore
economy. Planners hope it will create more highly-skilled jobs and
workers, making Singapore a global hub for knowledge-driven
activities.</P>
      <P>The manufacturing services to be added to Singapore's industrial
sector include: research and development, product design, product
development, process engineering, testing services and market
research.</P>
      <P>"Our focus must widen from manufacturing alone to manufacturing
as part of the value added in an industry," Yeo said. He was speaking
at the official opening of the new Siemens Matsushita Components
plant in Singapore.</P>
      <P>The plant is the firm's only surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter
manufacturing plant outside Germany. SAW devices are key components in
such machines as television sets, video recorders and mobile phones.</P>
      <P>Yeo, who is also minister for information and the arts, pointed
out that Singapore's commitment to manufacturing had enabled the
economy to diversify internationally.</P>
      <P>It also prevented the country from being hit as hard by the
regional financial crisis "as it would have if we were predominantly
a service economy," he added.</P>
      <P>Industry 21 program will encompass both manufacturing and
manufacturing services, and other exportable services like health
care and education, Yeo said.</P>
      <P>The program will make sure that manufacturing's share of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) remains at 25 percent, as targeted by
the previous EDB program M2000, which was mapped out in 1993. And it
aims to double the share of manufacturing services in the GDP from 3
percent in 1997 to 6 percent by 2010.</P>
      <P>About 15,000 jobs are expected to be created each year under the
Industry 21 program, and at least two-thirds of them should be for
knowledge and skilled workers, Yeo added.</P>
      <P>The targets of M2000 -- that the manufacturing sector contributed
at least 25 percent to the GDP and maintained an employment share of
20 percent -- have been largely met. Manufacturing now contributes
about 23 percent to the GDP and it has an employment share of around
23 percent.</P>
      <P>To position Singapore for the future, Industry 21 has been drawn
up to replace M2000.</P>
      <P>"For Industry 21 to succeed, Singapore cannot be an island. We
have to treat the whole world as our market place and talent pool.
Our instinct must be to scour the world for capital, knowledge,
ideas, talents and inspiration," Yeo said.

Taiwan's aborigines, Chan said.</P>
      <P>Additional foreign laborers, however, may be brought in for major
investment or construction projects that exceed NT$200 million
(US$5.7 million) in value. Applications to bring in additional
foreign laborers will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, Chan
added.</P>
      <P>Addressing claims that foreign laborers steal jobs from the
island's aborigines, Chan admitted the unemployment rate among
aborigines is 6 percent, higher than Taiwan's overall average of 3
percent.</P>
      <P>Chan said the relatively high jobless rate among aborigines is
not simply due to the government's introduction of foreign laborers
into Taiwan. Traditional, cultural and educational factors also
contribute to the group's high unemployment, he added.</P>
      <P>Of Taiwan's estimated 340,000 aborigines, some 140,000 are either
too young or too old to work. Of the remaining 200,000 people, some
12,000 are currently jobless, Chan said.</P>
      <P>To help alleviate the aborigines' long-standing unemployment
problems, the CLA has put into effect regulations that require
construction companies to employ a certain number of aborigines,
relative to the number of foreign laborers that are hired, Chan said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CLA has recently begun to survey aboriginal
people's willingness to receive vocational training and be employed,
Chan said. The government should raise the living standards of
Taiwan's native inhabitants by "giving them a fishing net rather than
fish," he added.</P>
      <P>For several years, foreign workers have outnumbered aborigines in
Taiwan, according to unconfirmed reports.</P>
      <P>Since the government opened up the labor market to foreign
workers eight years ago, some 360,000 foreign laborers have worked in
Taiwan. If illegal foreign and mainland laborers are factored in,
that figure could be closer to 450,000, according to the reports.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates will help
promote Taiwan-made, high-end products, the semi-official China
External Trade Development Council reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>"Gates has agreed to appear in a videotape promoting high-end
Taiwan products when he makes a whirlwind visit to Taipei later this
week," said a CETRA spokesperson.</P>
      <P>This will be the first time the world-renowned computer software
titan has ever spoken on behalf of products from any single country,
the spokesperson said.</P>
      <P>Gates is scheduled to arrive in Taipei this Friday and will
deliver a speech on the competitive niche for the 21st century --
digital nerve system -- at the Taipei International Convention
Center.</P>
      <P>As Gates will stay in Taiwan for only about eight hours, CETRA
will set up a makeshift studio at the convention center to facilitate
the shooting of Gates' video presentation.</P>
      <P>The CETRA spokesperson said Stan Shih, chairman of Acer Group,
Taiwan's leading personal computer maker, helped persuade Gates to
star in the film to promote Taiwan products.</P>
      <P>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang will oversee the film's
production and present a gift to Gates to express his gratitude for
the American tycoon's assistance in promoting locally made products
in world markets.</P>
      <P>"The video will be shown in future overseas trade fairs and other
similar occasions," the spokesperson said.</P>
      <P>This is the second time CETRA has invited an internationally

      <P>The United States must bear its share of
responsibility for the "cruel refusal" of the World Trade
Organization to admit mainland China, Zhou Shijian, vice-chairman of
mainland China's Chamber of Commerce, was quoted as saying in a
report by the Geneva-based World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's protracted bid for entry to the WTO will
dominate the summit between the United States and mainland China in
late June.</P>
      <P>"The United States must shoulder part of the blame for the
organization's cruel refusal over the past 10 years to mainland
China's repeated requests for membership," Zhou was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The US government has exaggerated its trade deficit with
mainland China by underestimating its exports while inflating
imports, the report quoted Zhou as saying. Zhou noted that last year,
the US government recorded a US$49.7 billion deficit with mainland
China, while the mainland's tally of the deficit amounted to only

      <P>Republic of China lawmaker Rau Yin-chi of
the ruling Kuomintang said on Sunday that the ROC government
and people are strongly opposed to any talks or agreements between
Washington and Beijing that could hurt Taiwan's interests and
security.</P>
      <P>Rau, who is heading a 19-member, non-partisan legislative

after arriving on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The major aim of the delegation's visit to the United States
before US President Bill Clinton's upcoming trip to mainland China,
Rau said, is to make known the Taiwan people's unanimous opposition
to any pact regarding Taiwan that may be made between Washington and
Beijing. He stressed that the Republic of China is an independent
sovereignty and that its future cannot be decided by other countries.</P>
      <P>Clinton is scheduled to meet with mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin during a visit to mainland China from June 25 to July 3.</P>
      <P>Rau urged the United States not to sign any accord with Beijing
committing it to the so-called "three noes" -- no support for a "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" policy, no support for an
independent Taiwan and no support for Taiwan's bid to join the United
Nations. He also called on the United States to continue to sell
defensive weapons to Taiwan and help Taiwan join international
organizations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer has condemned support for Independent Member of Parliament
Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party because it means isolation for
Australia from the rest of the world, especially Asia.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation,
Downer, who is currently visiting the Egyptian capital of Cairo,
strongly condemned support for Hanson's party because the party is
anti-Asian immigration, anti-aboriginal people, anti-native land
titles and anti-multiculturalism, he said.</P>
      <P>Downer also said the party opposes the privatization of
government enterprises and advocates protectionist measures for the
country's farming and industrial sectors. It is also against foreign
investment.</P>
      <P>The One Nation Party is expected to win between nine and 12 seats
in the Queensland Legislative Assembly, which may give the party the
balance of power in the state government.</P>
      <P>Final counting of Saturday's ballots will take a few more days,
according to the Electorate Commission in Queensland.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The plight of the Australian dollar and
stock market will continue after the stunning election victory of the
One Nation Party, which is regarded by foreign investors as
protectionist and against foreign investment and Asian immigration.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar dropped to 58.79 US cents in early morning
trade on Monday from last Friday's close of 58.88 US cents, market
economists said.</P>
      <P>The All Ordinaries Index also fell 3.9 points in early trade
Monday from last Friday's close of 2,571.7.</P>
      <P>Economists said the One Nation Party, established in April 1997
by Independent Member of Parliament Pauline Hanson, has negatively
affected both Australia's currency and stock markets with its
impressive showing in Saturday's state elections.</P>
      <P>The markets have been battered recently by a weakening Japanese
yen and a drop in the prices of Australia's commodities and gold,
economists said. The Hanson effect is only fueling the fire.</P>
      <P>Economist said many investors were now taking a wait-and-see
attitude toward investing in Australia.</P>
      <P>Citibank said One Nation's economic platform of greater industry
protection, subsidies, foreign aid cuts, import bans and curtailing
foreign investment and immigration would drive international
investors away.</P>
      <P>"If support for One Nation in Queensland is matched in other
states, concerns about the shape of the Federal Parliament after the
next election will warrant bearishness for the A$, bonds and stocks,"
said Stephen Koukoulas, Citibank's chief economist.</P>
      <P>"I think this will cause some short-term pain for the dollar as
international investors start to get very nervous about the
(Australian) politics," Bankers Trust's economist Dirk Morris said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, National Australia Bank's chief economist Alan Oster
said, "I think certainly if I was sitting offshore, I'd start to
wonder what actually is going on and it would be another uncertainty

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE MEETS JAPANESE DIETMAN YAMANAKA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui on Monday met with
Sadanori Yamanaka, a member of the House of Representatives of
Japan's Diet, or parliament, and praised Yamanaka for the
long-standing support and friendship he has shown the Republic of
China in the past.</P>
      <P>Yamanaka is currently president of the non-partisan Alliance for
Japan-ROC Friendship in the Japanese Diet, which was instrumental in
bringing about Tokyo's resumption of 72-hour visa-free travel
privileges for ROC nationals.</P>
      <P>Another change under Japan's revised visa regulations, Japan now
recognizes the validity of ROC passports and has authorized its
representative office in Taipei to print visa stamps directly into
the passports of ROC applicants.</P>
      <P>Since switching diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing in
1972, Japan had been issuing separate entry permits to prospective
ROC visitors instead of printing visa stamps directly into their
passports, a move considered unfriendly to Taiwan visitors.</P>
      <P>This increased the workload for the Taipei office of the Japanese
Interchange Association (JIA), which represents Japanese interests in
Taiwan in the absence of formal ties between the two countries.</P>
      <P>With the rapid increase in the number of Taiwan visitors to Japan
in recent years, the increased workload became intolerable, JIA
officials have said.</P>
      <P>The association reported that more than 800,000 ROC nationals
visited Japan in 1997, up nearly 10 percent from the previous year.</P>
      <P>Yamanaka, a long-time friend to the Republic Of China, once
taught at a primary school in Taiwan's southern-most county of
Pingtung. A veteran politician, he has been elected 15 times to the
Diet's lower house, also known as the House of Representatives.</P>
      <P>Yamanaka has also held important government positions, including
that of minister of international trade and industry, and has headed
the Defense Agency and the Environment Agency.</P>
      <P>During his audience with Lee, Yamanaka was accompanied by Lin
Chin-ching, former ROC representative to Japan, and president of
Taipei's Association of East Asian Relations, a quasi-official
organization authorized to handle civilian exchanges between Taiwan
and Japan in the absence of diplomatic ties between the two
countries.</P>
      <P>Yamanaka presented President Lee a calligraphic work by Lee
Hung-chang (1823-1901), a prime minister in the late Ching Dynasty,
as a token of respect.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Taiwan, Yamanaka will also receive an honorary
doctorate in economics from Chinese Culture University, located in
the Taipei suburb of Yangmingshan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FALLEN NT DOLLAR CUTS DOWN TAIWAN TOURISM TO US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Francisco, June 15 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The depreciated New Taiwan dollar is
being blamed for the lower number of Taiwan tourists heading to the
United States, dealing a heavy blow to tourism and related businesses
in San Francisco, a favorite spot among the island's tour groups.</P>
      <P>Since February this year, when the NT dollar fell to a then low
of NT$32 to the US dollar, the number of Taiwan tour groups bound for
the westcoast of the United States was cut by half, tourism sources
in San Francisco reported.</P>
      <P>As the Taiwan currency fell further to an 11-year low of NT$35 at
the middle of June, tourism sources said the westcoast should brace
for a cold summer this year with much fewer Taiwan holiday makers. The
number of Taiwan tourists usually reaches its height during summer
vacation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan tourists appear to have turned to Southeast Asia and East
Asia where costs were comparatively much lower for leisure
travel, the sources noted.</P>
      <P>High-end restaurants in the San Francisco Bay area which had in
the past seen many Japanese and Chinese customers, are experiencing a
slowdown in business as a result of the greenback's slaughter of the
Japanese yen and NT dollar in recent months.</P>
      <P>The problem that most worries the US' westcoast tourism sector is
that they don't have a clue as to how long this Asian slump will
last, the sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT SHOULD HIRE, PROMOTE MORE WOMEN TO HIGHER RANKS: SIEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To better serve the people of Taiwan, the
government should understand and satisfy the needs of 10 million
women and facilitate their entry into core decision-making ranks
through various channels, Premier Vincent Siew said Monday.</P>
      <P>Addressing the first Women Leaders Workshop, Siew pointed out
that traditional patriarchal societies mainly rely on men while
neglecting women.</P>
      <P>From an economic standpoint, a 10-million-strong workforce is
being overlooked. From a national development standpoint, the
resulting loss is immense, Siew said, adding that more women should
be cultivated to join the ranks of the island's decision-makers.</P>
      <P>In recent years, the government began employing more women than
men, but at the mid- to high-level ranks, female government employees
are still noticeably outnumbered by their male counterparts, Siew
said.</P>
      <P>Fifty-nine percent of those who passed Taiwan's national civil
service examination last year were women, according to government
statistics. However, of the 138 political appointees in the Executive
Yuan, only 15 are female, and women comprise only 10.59 percent of
the total number of high-ranking civil servants.</P>
      <P>An American group seeking to protect a merit-based system in the
hiring and promotion of employees conducted a recent study. The
findings suggested that the "invisible barriers" to the advancement
of women in government departments should be overcome by policy
tools.</P>
      <P>These findings prompted the inception of the Women Leaders
Workshop, which is aimed at cultivating female leaders with vision,
Siew said.</P>
      <P>Workshop director Wei Chi-lin expressed high hopes and
aspirations for this "first class in history." Wei, who is also the
director general of the Central Personnel Administration, pointed out
that the workshop is only the beginning of Siew's plan to instruct
the government to cultivate more female senior-level officials.</P>
      <P>Wei said his administration will carry out the task of promoting
outstanding talented women and develop more channels to cultivate
such individuals.</P>
      <P>The Women Leaders Workshop is open to high-ranking female
employees, aged 50 or younger, working for the central, provincial or
municipal governments, or other state-affiliated organizations. Each
class has 40 openings, with 14 reserved for women in the academia,
enterprise sector and television stations for the inaugurating class.</P>
      <P>Four weeks of classes will include national development policies,
cross-strait relations, matters related to Taiwan's bid to enter the
World Trade Organization, the establishment of Taiwan as a culture
and technology island, gender equality policies and seminars such as
"how to use female leadership charisma."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese dissidents have asked to
meet US President Bill Clinton when he visits mainland China from
June 27 to July 3, a Hong Kong-based human rights organization
revealed on Sunday.</P>
      <P>According to a news release by the "China Human Rights Message
Center" in Hong Kong, a Shanghai-based dissident sent a letter on
June 10 asking the city's public security bureau to allow him to meet
Clinton when the president visits Shanghai.</P>
      <P>Han Lifa was released by mainland security authorities in April
after serving a three-year sentence in a labor camp.</P>
      <P>In his letter, he wrote the freedom of assembly is a right
guaranteed by the constitution of the people. He said his application
to the bureau, in accordance with the constitution and relevant
regulations, was for a permit to organize a welcome ceremony for
Clinton.</P>
      <P>According to the human rights group, Han will provide the bureau
with a specific date and location for the gathering and the letter is
simply aimed at learning the bureau's intent. However, Han has not
yet received a response from the bureau.</P>
      <P>Han, in conjunction with five other dissidents based in Shanghai,
also wrote a letter to Clinton on June 11, asking to meet him during
his visit to Shanghai for discussions on human rights, the group
said. The group added that the dissidents threatened to stage a
hunger strike if authorities were to detain them again.</P>
      <P>Authorities are not only closely monitoring dissidents and
pro-democracy activists in Shanghai, but also in other provinces, the
group pointed out.</P>
      <P>Citing Liu Lianjun in Shandong Province as an example, it said
Liu has already been questioned three times and dissidents in Xian
say their telephones both at home and work were eavesdropped.</P>
      <P>Some mainland activists have complained that Clinton's upcoming
visit has not improved their situation, but has instead led to
increased scrutiny and a great deal of inconvenience to their work
and lives, the rights group said.</P>

pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989, Albright said Clinton will make
clear to Beijing authorities that "they are on the wrong side of
history" as far as the human rights issue is concerned.</P>
      <P>"President Clinton will not mince words," said Albright, adding
that the president will explain precisely Washington's human rights
policy, and will express his hope to see an improvement of human
rights conditions in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The only way to convince mainland China to improve its human
rights record is through trade and diplomatic ties with the Beijing
authorities, said the Secretary of State.</P>
      <P>"We believe that by engaging with mainland China, that we have a
better chance of really pushing them on the human rights policy," she
said.</P>
      <P>Albright repeated comments Clinton made in his speech last week
titled "US-China Relations in the 21st Century," saying that
"protocol is not policy," and that Tiananmen Square is where the
Beijing authorities greet their visitors. What really matters is what
President Clinton says when he gets there, she added.</P>
      <P>Clinton is scheduled to arrive at Xian City, Shaanxi Province, on
June 25, as the first leg of his trip. He will leave for Beijing in
the afternoon of June 26; and will attend a military welcoming
ceremony in the morning next day. Clinton will not give an address
during the welcoming ceremony, according to Beijing's tradition.</P>
      <P>"He plans to make very clear that our relationship with China
will never be totally normal until they improve their human rights
policy and until they get on the right side of history," pointed out
Albright.</P>
      <P>President Clinton's mainland China policy, his decision to move
up his mainland China journey and to receive a welcoming ceremony in
Tiananmen Square, all invited harsh censure from human rights groups
and US lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Utah Senator Oaring Hatch, who is also chairman of Senate
Judiciary Committee, strongly rebuffed arguments made by Clinton and
the White House officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CLINTON'S MAINLAND VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, June 14 (CNA)
(By J. J. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
has expressed optimism over US President Bill Clinton's upcoming
visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>In an interview carried in the latest issue of Time
magazine, Lee said Taiwan is too important to US interests in Asia
for Washington to weaken its support for the island.</P>
      <P>"Although Beijing will surely try to bargain very hard, I don't
believe the United States will make any concessions with regard to
Taiwan because it is so important to the US," Lee said in the
interview with a group of Time journalists earlier this month.</P>
      <P>For one thing, Lee said, the US is trying to maintain
international order in East Asia. In addition, the US wants to see
economic development sustained in the region while trying to enlarge
democracy and human rights.</P>
      <P>"Our efforts are consistent with US interests in maintaining
civility in this part of the world, and also with American values
and ideals," Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Asked whether he is concerned that Washington might pressure
Taiwan to move from talks with Beijing on technical issues to
political issues like unification, Lee said it is impossible to
distinguish between political issues and functional issues.</P>
      <P>"It is not necessary to make that distinction. Our attitude
toward dialogue is quite open," Lee stressed, adding he hopes
Beijing would show the same type of pragmatism on its relations with
Taiwan as it has exercised on its economic reform policy.</P>
      <P>"Today their economic policy is based more on pragmatism than
before. Unfortunately, this has not extended to cross-strait
relations," the president said.</P>
      <P>Asked what he thinks Beijing will do if Taiwan's pro-independence
opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) gains power, Lee said
he has noticed that Beijing is paying close attention to this issue.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said, mainland China is wrong in its approach.
"Its leaders' focus should be directed not to the DPP, but to the
people in Taiwan. If they keep trying to intimidate us and equate
everything we do with so-called Taiwan independence -- including
foreign travel by our leadership and our participation in
international relations -- then our people will be alienated. That
will lead to a great desire for independence."</P>
      <P>Lee went on to say mainland China will find it very difficult
in 25 years to maintain the nationalism and hegemonism that it relies
on now for its rule.</P>
      <P>"Society on the mainland will become more pluralized. In that
case, cross-strait relations will grow closer than at present," the
president predicted optimistically.</P>
      <P>Three weeks before Clinton leaves for mainland China for a
state visit, Time magazine sent a team of journalists to Taipei
to interview President Lee and other senior ROC officials in an
effort to give more balanced coverage of the Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>The team was headed by Time's senior editorial writer Bruce W.
Nelan.</P>
      <P>Nelan said in an article, carried in Time's June 22 issue,
that Clinton is expected to reaffirm his support for the concept
of "one China" during his June 25-July 3 mainland visit.</P>
      <P>"But he will probably refuse to put that in writing, and he will
not agree to stop selling modern weaponry to the Republic of China
on Taiwan," Nelan wrote.</P>
      <P>In his article titled "Will We Have To Go To War for Taiwan?"
Nelan also said that in many ways, Taiwan has been America's star
pupil. Under US tutelage Taiwan has has modernized its economy, built
a thriving democracy and opened up a free press.</P>
      <P>"It is one of the world's leading trading nations and one of the
most prosperous. And yet, by succeeding, Taiwan has become a problem
for Washington," Nelan observed. "Taipei's dynamic de facto
independence may one day trigger a Chinese ultimatum: blockade or
attack. It will then be up to the US to decide whether Taiwan's
status quo has a future."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 100 people gathered in Taipei
Monday to protest against the proposed development of an industrial
zone project in southern Taiwan in front of the Environmental
Protection Administration (EPA).</P>
      <P>The protesters, traveling from Kaohsiung, Tainan and Pintung in
southern Taiwan, wanted to express their strenuous opposition to the
development of Pinnan Industrial Zone in Tainan County.</P>
      <P>Some 150 police were on hand to maintain order. No clashes were
reported as the protest was generally peaceful.</P>
      <P>The EPA was conducting its first meeting to review reports on
projected water consumption, water sewage plans of the Pinnan
Industrial Zone and its effect on the Tainan Science-based Industrial
Park, which is already under construction.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Professor Hsieh Chih-cheng of the National
Taiwan University said developers of the project have turned a deaf
ear to requests that they submit additional documents to back up
their claim that they meet environmental requirements.</P>
      <P>The EPA should reject the application for development outright,
Hsieh said.</P>
      <P>He added that water shortage has been a long-standing problem in
southern Taiwan, adding that the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park
has already consumed a portion of water originally designated for
farmland.</P>
      <P>Legislator Su Huan-chih said developers have only submitted a
water consumption scheme, but failed to mention its water supply
plan. If they are given a green light for the development and later
find it difficult to get water, they will be able to ask for national
compensation.</P>
      <P>The NT$400 billion (US$11.52 billion) development project, to be
developed by Yieh Loong Group and Tuntex Group, will be the largest
investment project in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The project will house the island's seventh naphtha cracker, a
steel mill, and its own harbor, if construction goes ahead.</P>
      <P>The EPA will have to hold at least two more meetings on the
project before a decision is made.</P>

      <P>Through cultural exchanges, both sides of
the Taiwan Strait have an increased understanding of each other,
Chang King-yuh, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) chairman,said Monday.
The MAC is in charge of formulating Taipei's mainland China policy.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar, Chang said since the start of cultural
exchanges in 1989, Taiwan travelers have made more than 12 million
visits to the mainland while mainland travelers made 32,846 visits to
Taiwan. Among those visitors, academic figures accounted for 16,078
visits and performers 8,016 visits.</P>
      <P>In terms of groups, 243 mainland cultural and educational groups
visited Taiwan as of the end of last year. Among them, performing
groups accounted for 146, or about 60 percent of the groups, followed
by 41 student groups, and 29 athletic groups.</P>
      <P>Cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Strait have helped narrow
the gap of understanding between the two sides, Chang said.</P>
      <P>He cited surveys saying that half of those polled believed
cultural exchanges have boosted bilateral understanding. Meanwhile,

    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 15 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong's Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa
pledged Sunday that Hong Kong would be the first to rebound from the
economic turmoil now affecting the region as Hong Kong continues to
peg its currency to the US dollar.</P>
      <P>Tung also said competitiveness was the key to recovery. He was
speaking while on his first visit to Australia since he assumed the
executive post last July.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong's economic growth dropped two percent in the first
quarter of this year, which shocked the Special Administrative
Region's business sector and community.</P>
      <P>Tung said Hong Kong must prove to itself, to China, East Asia and
the world that the new phase of its history which began last July
with the handover to China marks rejuvenation, not a decline.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with the mass circulation newspaper The
Australian Sunday, Tung said, "The outlook is for a difficult and
painful adjustment."</P>
      <P>He admitted that Hong Kong's economy was overheated and
overpriced. He blamed "the very high cost of doing business in Hong
Kong (on) property values, high inflation and high wages."</P>
      <P>A series of measures designed to stimulate the economy and
property market have been announced, he said, adding that the Hong
Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the US dollar despite
higher interest rates.</P>
      <P>Tung said he believes "China wants (the) 'one country, two
systems' (formula) to work and that long-term interests of Hong Kong
and China are the same."</P>
      <P>However, he said he would not accelerate the timetable for the
implementation of a full democracy for Hong Kong even though 60
percent of the popular vote went to pro-democracy candidates in
recent elections.</P>
      <P>During his one-week visit, Tung is expected to meet Prime

    <HEADLINE>NOBEL LAUREATE DR. ROBERT MERTON ARRIVES FOR VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Dr. Robert C. Merton, 1997 Nobel laureate
in economics, said Monday if Taiwan can successfully handle both the
economic and non-economic factors affecting the fluctuating foreign
exchange rates, rates will go down and the impact on investors will
be reduced.</P>
      <P>Merton, who arrived on Monday, was invited by the National Sun
Yat-sen University. He called on Perng Fai-nan, governor of the
Central Bank of China (CBC) in the morning and paid a courtesy call
on President Lee Teng-hui in the afternoon.</P>
      <P>The Japanese yen's decline to 145 to the US dollar on Monday has
put very heavy pressure on the exchange rate for the New Taiwan
dollar.</P>
      <P>The Harvard professor refused to comment on the future trend of
the Japanese yen or the NT dollar, claiming that his expertise is
risk management, not exchange rates. He added that as this was his
first tour of Asia, he was not very clear about Taiwan exchange
rates.</P>
      <P>However, he said in principle there are many ways which Taiwan
businessmen can avoid the risk of foreign exchange rate fluctuation.
If the government can control both economic and non-economic factors,
the fluctuation will decrease, reducing the impact on investors.</P>
      <P>Commenting on risk management, Merton said Taiwan has put too
much emphasis on trade and has ignored the importance of risk
management. He suggested that Taiwan establish a risk management
system as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Merton also suggested that Taiwan, through international
exchanges, cooperate with other countries on such industries as
electronics and automobiles, to turn the risk abroad.</P>
      <P>At present, he said, there are quite a few such risk exchange
plans in the United States, and Taiwan should follow the move as soon
as possible. His idea has won support from the CBC governor.</P>

      <P>Lin said political motives are not behind the ministry's refusal

    <HEADLINE>DISCONTENT RUNNING HIGH IN POLICE FORCE: POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 80 percent of Taiwan's police
officers would like to change their jobs, according to the results of
an opinion poll released on Monday to mark the nation's 20th Police
Day.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the newly formed Republic of China
Police Association with a view to understanding grassroots
policemen's opinions about their profession and the general social
order here.</P>
      <P>The association sent out more than 10,000 questionnaires between
April 1 and June 10 to low- and middle-ranking police officers around
the island, and collected 6,155 valid responses.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 78 percent of the respondents would
switch to other jobs if given the opportunity.</P>
      <P>Only 46 percent said they feel proud or honored to be a police
officer, while 24 percent said they are afraid to divulge their
profession to other people.</P>
      <P>Ironically, more than 30 percent said they are dissatisfied with
the current state of domestic public order. Moreover, 34 percent said
they feel law and order on the island is deteriorating.</P>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent attributed the worsening social order to the
fact that police officers are required to do too many "side jobs," or
official duties unrelated to police work, while 20 percent blamed
either improper policies or unhealthy systems for administering the
police force.</P>
      <P>More than 80 percent complained about the current reward and
discipline systems, saying that rewards usually come too slow, while
punishments come too fast and are often too severe. They also said
the number of promotion channels is disproportionate to the workload.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that many respondents hope the National
Police Administration will adopt a more humane personnel
administrative system, improve the work review system, open more
channels for filing complaints or appeals, rennovate all
crime-fighting equipment, standardize welfare services in all
counties and cities, and build additional dormitories for police
families.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a telephone poll of 1,039 adult residents
around the island, conducted by the Modern Women's Foundation on
June 9-11, found that local people are most concerned about the work
ethics, discipline and service attitude of the country's police
force.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, breaking of criminal cases is not the
most urgent work to improve the image of police force.</P>
      <P>The majority of respondents also attributed worsening social
order primarily to family and social factors, not police's
inability to fulfill their duties.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER VOWS TO SPEED UP REFORM OF POLICE ADMINISTRATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 15 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Monday singled out
police administrative reform as the priority task for upgrading the
morale of the country's police force and improve social
order.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a ceremony marking the nation's 20th Police Day at
the Central Police College in Taipei, Siew said the government will
offer a variety of counseling services to help grassroots police
officers cope with work-related stress and improve their work
ethic.</P>
      <P>"We must also establish a comprehensive crime-fighting system
and continue cracking down on organized cirme to meet the public
expectaitons for a safe, harmonious and peaceful living
environment," Siew added.</P>
      <P>Noting that the government has felt the urgency to overhaul
police administration, Siew said he has ordered the Ministry of the
Interior to refer to the police personnel management systems adopted
by Japan, Germany and other countries known for their low-crime
rates.</P>
      <P>Siew also encouraged police authorities to cooperate more
closely with other law enforcement agencies and joinforces with
private social groups in establishing an effective crime-fighting
network.</P>
      <P>After the ceremony, Siew went to a hospital in Panchiao,
Taipei County to express his concern for a police officer who
has been partially paralyzed after sustaining gunwounds in a
shootout with several drug traffickers last October.</P>
      <P>Interior Minister Huang Chu-wen paid visits to the bereaved
families of several police officers who were killed last year while
performing their official duties.</P>
      <P>According to a study by professor Huang Fu-yuan at the Central
Police College, the number of police officers who committed suicide
in the past five years was twice that who lost their lives while
performing official duties.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the result of an opinion poll released on Monday
shows that discontent runs high in the island's police force.</P>
      <P>Nearly 80 percent of police officers surveyed said they would
like to change their jobs, and few of them take pride in their
profession.</P>
      <P>The survey was conducted by the newly formed Republic of China
Police Association with a view to understanding grassroots
policemen's opinions about their profession and the general social
order here.</P>
      <P>The association sent out more than 10,000 questionnaires between
April 1 and June 10 to low- and middle-ranking police officers around
the island, and collected 6,155 valid responses.</P>
      <P>The survey results show that 78 percent of the respondents would
switch to other jobs if given the opportunity.</P>
      <P>Only 46 percent said they feel proud or honored to be a police
officer, while 24 percent said they are afraid to divulge their
profession to other people.</P>
      <P>Ironically, more than 30 percent said they are dissatisfied with
the current state of domestic public order. Moreover, 34 percent said
they feel law and order on the island is deteriorating.</P>
      <P>Nearly 60 percent attributed the worsening social order to the
fact that police officers are required to do too many "side jobs," or
official duties unrelated to police work, while 20 percent blamed
either improper policies or unhealthy systems for administering the
police force.</P>
      <P>More than 80 percent complained about the current reward and
discipline systems, saying that rewards usually come too slow, while
punishments come too fast and are often too severe. They also said
the number of promotion channels is disproportionate to the workload.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that many respondents hope the National
Police Administration will adopt a more humane personnel
administrative system, improve the work review system, open more
channels for filing complaints or appeals, rennovate all
crime-fighting equipment, standardize welfare services in all
counties and cities, and build additional dormitories for police
families.</P>
      <P>A telephone poll of 1,039 adult residents around the island,
conducted by the Modern Women's Foundation on June 9-11, found that
local people are most concerned about the work ethics, discipline and
service attitude of the country's police force.</P>
      <P>According to the survey, breaking of criminal cases is not the
most urgent work to improve the image of police force.</P>

      <P>The salary adjustment will cover more than one million public

      <P>He noted that the president's salary will remain at its current
level of NT$822,000 (about US$23,573) per month, while that of the
vice president will stay at NT$616,500.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in light of the fact that military personnel, teachers
in public primary and high schools will be deprived of their tax-free
privileges next year, resulting in income reductions, they will enjoy
an additional compensatory 0.3 percent salary raise, Wei added.</P>
      <P>The adjustment will cost the government approximately NT$20.27
billion (US$581.3 million), he pointed out.</P>

about 4,000 rounds of ammunition, 20 kilograms of heroin and more

      <P>Stemming the influx of contraband at sea is easier than tracking

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The falling value of the new Taiwan dollar
is biting into the island's economy, with exports falling behind its
"Asian dragon" counterparts, according to statistics released on
Monday.</P>
      <P>The figures prepared by the Ministry of Economic Affairs show
that Taiwan's exports declined by 6.7 percent in the first quarter of
this year, compared to a 6.5 percent gain for Singapore, 8.2 percent
growth for South Korea, and a 3 percent decline for Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Economic officials attributed the decline to the devaluation of
the local currency which has driven up the cost of raw material
imports and blunted the island's competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Many of the island's exports are manufactured from imported raw
materials or components, and the rising price of these imports has
seriously damaged the competitiveness of the country's exports on
international markets, the officials said.</P>
      <P>The new Taiwan dollar depreciated from 28 against the US dollar
last year to more than 34 against the greenback in early June, much
less than the devaluation of the South Korean but more than the Hong
Kong and Singapore currencies.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  15  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Exports to Japan have dwindled in recent
months because of the ongoing depreciation of the Japanese yen,
leading to a larger trade deficit between Taiwan and Japan, the
Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said on Monday.</P>
      <P>According to statistics released by the China External Trade and
Development Council (CETRA), the export items to Japan that have
suffered the most significant drops are computers and component
parts, Integrated Circuits (ICs), frozen fish, furniture, sporting
goods, and transistors.</P>
      <P>Officials from the Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) under the MOEA
attributed the decline of exports mainly to Japan's economic slowdown
and the depreciation of the yen. They pointed out that the economic
sluggishness triggered by the Asian financial turmoil has cut the
purchasing ability of many Japanese, while the yen's heavy
depreciation, compared to the modest slide of the new Taiwan dollar,
has made Taiwan's products lose the competitiveness they used to
enjoy.</P>
      <P>In order to promote Taiwan's exports to Japan, the BOFT has
scheduled 26 promotion missions to attend a variety of exhibitions in
Japan in the second half of the year and the beginning of next year.
In addition, the BOFT is also pushing for a number of strategic
cooperation alliances in various fields between the industries of the
two countries.</P>
      <P>Faced with a 23 percent plunge in exports to Japan for the first
three months of the year, BOFT officials said that Taiwan must
continue to upgrade product quality, enhance research and development
capabilities, and make efforts to usher in Japanese capital and
technology.</P>

      <P>The ministry's Institute of Transportation has been instructed to

      <P>Ministry officials noted that after Taipei designated separate
lanes for buses, the traffic situation showed a marked improvement.
The success of this program has led other cities and counties to
consider following suit.</P>
      <P>However, the right to set up exclusive lanes for motorcycles lie
with the local city government, officials said, adding the ministry
can only help establish exclusive lanes and parking lots if required.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on

of US arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chas W. Freeman Jr., a former diplomat who served as deputy chief
of the US Embassy in Beijing from 1981 to 1984, said in an article in
the latest issue of Foreign Affairs bimonthly that the United States
should reevaluate its arms sales policy to Taiwan in accordance with
the 1982 Washington-Beijing joint communique.</P>
      <P>Freeman said US arms sales to Taiwan no longer boost the island's
confidence that it can work out its differences with Beijing.
Instead, he claimed such sales would only enhance pro-independence
sentiments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In response to press inquiries, MOFA officials said they would
not respond to Freeman's comments now that he is a private citizen

      <P>Freeman, who also once served as an assistant secretary of

China Policy Foundation, asserted in his article that the US sale of
150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan in 1992 and some subsequent deals do not
comply with the 1982 communique.</P>
      <P>In that communique, Beijing pledged to "strive for a peaceful

      <P>In signing the agreement, Sir Tim Lankester, director of the
SOAS, said the study of Taiwan has long been a feature of SOAS
academic activities and an increasingly important one in its China
programs.</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom, he said, there has been a strong interest
in Taiwan's democratic process, its impressive economic achievements,
its relations with mainland China and its role in the Asia Pacific
region.</P>
      <P>Companies from Taiwan are major investors in the UK and their
growing presence is having a greater impact on the communities in
which they are active, added Sir Tim.</P>
      <P>It is with this understanding that despite its fine existing body
of China scholars, an enhancement of academic staff in contemporary
Taiwan studies is required to address this growing interest, he
stated.</P>
      <P>According to the agreement signed by Sir Tim and Louis Tzen,
representative of the Taipei Representative Office in the UK, Taipei
is to set up a fund of 300,000 pounds sterling in three years. The
project will focus on subjects ranging from economic development in
Taiwan and the status of Taiwan in international law to relations
between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Tzen said the agreement opens up a new chapter of academic
cooperation between the two sides.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the SOAS will add its rich resources
and insight to Taiwan studies.</P>
      <P>The chair for Taiwan studies at the SOAS is a continuation of
the long friendship between the institution and the people of
Taiwan. Currently, there are more than two dozen Taiwan students
in SOAS, and it has more than 100 alumni from Taiwan, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TUNG CHEE-HWA TALKS ABOUT AUSSIE SUCCESS IN ASIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  16  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Tung Chee-Hwa, chief executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, talked about Australia's
success in Asia Monday in Canberra.</P>
      <P>When asked about the impact of the strong electoral showing of
the One Nation Party, Tung on Monday said he could only comment
within diplomatic constraints because he was a guest in Australia.</P>
      <P>In a clear reference to the One Nation's advocacy of economic and
social isolationism, he said: "I know many of you in Australia are
having a debate about what you are and who you are. From the Hong
Kong perspective, you are a very important member of the Asia-Pacific
region."</P>
      <P>"You have a unique position. You understand the cultures and
religions of your neighbors and you are able to understand them even
when they are very different to your own. Because of that, you have
been very effective facilitators in the region.</P>
      <P>"Let me say this. Australia has been successful because it has
been very tolerant and multicultural. Your strength is here and I
can't imagine Australia moving away from that," he said</P>
      <P>About the One Nation's impact on Hong Kong students, Tung said, 
"I understand the One Nation Party had 23 percent of the vote; so the
other 77 percent must be saying something else."</P>
      <P>He praised the 30,000 Australian citizens currently residing in
Hong Kong, and said the relationship between those residents and the
Hong Kong population would not likely change.</P>
      <P>He added that there was a tremendous two-way traffic of
investment, trade and people between Australia and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Tung, who is making his first visit to Australia since taking his
present job in July 1997, is expected to give another speech in
Melbourne Tuesday and meet Victoria Premier Jeff Kennett and other
officials.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 16 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The unprecedented election victory of the
One Nation Party has contributed to the worry that Asian tourists
will avoid visiting Australia, tourism sources said.</P>
      <P>Tourism officials and promoters have asked the federal government
to reject what they called racist policies of the One Nation Party in
a bid to prevent further damage to Australia's tourism, which has
already suffered a substantial decline in the number of arrivals and
revenue.</P>
      <P>Earlier forecasts show the number of tourist arrivals in
Australia in 1998 will fall about 8 percent to more than 3.97 million
from the 1997 level.</P>
      <P>Tourism promoters said they expect the earlier forecast will be
revised to a lower figure as a result of the strong showing of the
One Nation Party in Queensland elections on June 13.</P>
      <P>In the past two years, the tourism industry has experienced a 25
percent drop in tourist arrivals from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore,
and Malaysia, which accounted for about 10 percent of tourism's
annual foreign earnings of A$16 billion (US$10 billion).</P>
      <P>"There will be some impact on tourism numbers on top of what we
have already suffered. It does not fill us with a lot of hope," Len

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SIEW URGES TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS, IMPROVED MANAGEMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To maintain its national competitiveness,
Taiwan should continue to develop technology-intensive industries and
efficient resource management techniques as it makes its way to being
a wealthy and powerful "technology island," Premier Vincent Siew
said.</P>
      <P>Addressing a seminar on industrial technology research and
development management, Siew said Taiwan should develop its
electronic, information and biotechnology industries in coordination
with plans to develop the island as an Asia Pacific regional
operations center.</P>
      <P>He expressed hope that by 2010, technology-intensive industries
will make up 50 percent of all Taiwan industries, and research and
development budgets will make up 3 percent of the gross domestic
product.</P>
      <P>Due to the island's limited natural and human resources, Siew
stressed it is particularly important that Taiwan be more efficient.
Therefore, in addition to continued innovations in technology, it is
vital that R&amp;D strategic, structural and procedural management
produce the maximum results, he said.</P>
      <P>Improper management is worse than the lack of investment, Siew
said, noting only effective management and commercialization can
produce market value for technology -- the modern source of national
competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Siew urged local enterprises to improve their overall technology
base and management abilities, vowing that the government will carry
out its duty of providing them with an excellent development
environment.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that industrial technology is the driving force
behind economic development, the premier said the Ministry of
Economic Affairs allocates a sizable budget to promote it every year,
and the gradual effects can now be seen.</P>
      <P>Siew expressed his satisfaction over the results of a 1998 Swiss
report on global competitiveness where Taiwan's ranking surged to
16th place from last year's 23rd, and a World Economic Forum rating
of 6th, up from last year's 8th ranking.</P>
      <P>He noted, however, that the domestic industrial structure is
facing major adjustments. Whereas economic developments in the past
were largely credited to labor-intensive industries, their difficulty
in adapting to new competitive situations necessitates the
development of technology-intensive, high value-added industries.</P>
      <P>The best alternative for Taiwan, which lacks natural resources
and sufficient domestic demands, is to concentrate on the
electronics, semi-conductor, information and biotechnology
industries, Siew said.</P>
      <P>Nurturing talent needed by medium and small enterprises and
developing new technological innovations through effective R&amp;D
management are both important tasks ahead, Siew concluded.</P>

      <P>Taiwan, described as a modest freighter,
is sailing ahead of its Titanic neighbors -- mainland China and Hong
Kong -- in the Asian crisis storm, according to a leading Australian
business newspaper.</P>
      <P>Australian Financial Review correspondent Rowan Callick wrote a
story on Tuesday from Taipei headlined "Taiwan steams ahead of its
Titanic neighbors."</P>
      <P>He said if Hong Kong is considered a first class cabin on the
Titanic and mainland China is a vast container vessel whose captain
is still grappling with its massive steering wheel to turn it around,
then Taiwan is a modest freighter steaming toward its destination.</P>
      <P>Callick wrote that Taiwan's future is not in the hands of
party-owned property magnates, but in those of the 5,000 high-tech
companies that have settled in Asia's version of Silicon Valley

      <P>According to the report, Taiwan's performance can be attributed
to three elements: the plurality of decision-making centers with its
flexible economic core comprising small- and medium-sized businesses;
its greater margin for monetary maneuvering, free from the defenses of
the Chinese and Hong Kong currencies which will probably meet their
doom next year; and Taiwan's diversified trading relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TALKING DOWN US DOLLAR IS RISKY: LEE KUAN YEW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  16  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States and Japan must work
together to prevent the Japanese yen from further tumbling while at
the same time avoid a sudden slide in the value of the US dollar,
said Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew.</P>
      <P>Attempts to talk down the US dollar might affect the New York
stock exchange and lead to even greater problems, he cautioned in an
interview with Newsweek last week. The interview was published in the
latest issue of the American news magazine.</P>
      <P>Describing this as a "very difficult situation," Lee said, "The
opposite side of the coin to a weak yen is a strong US dollar.</P>
      <P>"The US dollar is appreciating against all currencies. How do you
bring it down? If you talk the US dollar down, you might bring the
New York stock market down, and that would lead to great troubles for
everyone.</P>
      <P>"Somehow this has to be unwound but without causing a sudden
slide," he added.</P>
      <P>In the wide-ranging interview on the economic and political
changes sweeping the region, Lee was also asked if the recent
financial crisis had changed the political landscape.</P>
      <P>"The political landscape has changed and will continue to change,
but it is not going to be a straightforward line to democracy," he
said.</P>
      <P>Lee did not see for example, the Indonesian people voting
directly for a president because they remembered too well the chaotic
1950s when there were many political parties and weak coalition
governments that each lasted only a few months.</P>
      <P>Instead, he said, the country would have to decide on the number
of parties that would enter elections for national assembly members,
who would then choose a president.</P>
      <P>Lee also rejected the notion that President Suharto's stepping
down was the result of a "people-power revolution."</P>
      <P>"This was a controlled exercise. Right up until the shooting of
the six students, the government, army and police were in complete
control.</P>
      <P>"They allowed the demonstrations to carry on in a controlled way.</P>
      <P>"Then somebody did something not in the script, and that
triggered it off," he said.</P>
      <P>The student demonstrations, he added, were calling not for
democracy but for an end to corruption, cronyism and nepotism.</P>
      <P>Lee was also asked if he agreed with Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's view that Asians might have to fight a guerrilla
war against westerners for control of their economies in the wake of
the present economic turmoil.</P>
      <P>"A leader who sends out such signals must expect foreign
investors to be stout-hearted enough to engage in counter insurgency
actions before they invest in local companies," he responded</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT FISHERY MEETING OPENS IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior mainland Chinese fishery official
suggested here on Tuesday that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
commission private insurance companies or maritime appraisal firms to
help resolve frequent cross-strait fishing disputes.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi, a department chief at the Taiwan Affairs Office of the
mainland China's State Council, made the overture during a seminar on
sustainable use of fishery resources in the Taiwan Strait, which
separate Taiwan from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Lin said there are currently no propoer channels to
handle nagging cross-strait fishing disputes, leading to
deterioration of such issues.</P>
      <P>"I think the two sides of the strait can commission private
insurance or maritime accidents appraisal firms to help settle those
problems," said Lin.</P>
      <P>Zhuo Youzhan, director of the Administration of Fishery and
Ports under mainland China's Ministry of Agriculture, also
underscored the urgency of addressing cross-strait fishing disputes.</P>
      <P>Zhuo said the two sides should jointly work out a mutually
acceptable format to enable those who have suffered losses or
damage in cross-strait fishing incidents to acquire reasonable
compensation.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, professor Lee Kuo-tien of
National Taiwan Ocean University, called attention to rapid
dwindling of fishery resources in the continental shelves beneath
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Lee said waters surrounding Taiwan, including the Taiwan Strait,
the southern part of the East China Sea and the northern part of the
South China Sea, used to be a rich fishing ground, with abundant
benthic fish.</P>
      <P>"Such fishery resources, however, have gradually declined
because of sloppy management and decades of exploitation by Taiwan
and mainland fishermen," Lee said.</P>
      <P>According to Lee, Taiwan fishermen could caught 180
kilograms of fish per hour in the 1970s. The hourly fish catach
dropped to 150 kgs in the early 1980s, and by the end of the decade,
the catch slid to 80 kgs.</P>
      <P>Noting that maritime fishing resources can be reproduced, Lee
said Taiwan and mainland China should attach importance to the
issue and craft out a joint management system to ensure
sustainable use of those resources.</P>
      <P>The seminar was sponsored by the ROC Marine Industry Association,
with the participation of fishery officials and scholars from both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The mainland delegation is composed of scores of department
chiefs and deputy chiefs from the Ministry of Agriculture and the
Taiwan Affairs Office. Mainland delegates also include Qin Zhilin,
president of the Academy of Marine Science, and Chen Xuyezhang,
president of the East China Sea Research Institute.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan delegation comprises officials from the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture and the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  June  16  (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing may cut interest rates to
relieve pressure on the mainland Chinese renminbi in the wake of a
sinking Japanese yen, said the Hong Kong Economic Times on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Economic Times cited informed sources as saying that People's
Bank of China will soon announce the cut, the fifth such cut since
1996. The cut would be aimed at stimulating domestic demand to help
mainland China achieve its target economic growth rate of 8 percent
this year.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese exports, as well as its currency, have been
badly affected by Asia's financial crisis, said the sources. Experts
from the research department of People's Bank of China and the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences have been examining the
possibility of devaluing the renminbi, or yuan, as well as the impact
of a falling yen on the mainland's economy.</P>
      <P>High-ranking mainland Chinese economic officials believe that,
given the current situation, a devaluation of the renminbi will not
offset the negative impact of the region's economic turmoil. It would
instead trigger another round of currency devaluations throughout the
region, the officials said.</P>

      <P>In the run-up to the meeting between US

Zemin, slated for later this month, local pro-independence forces
attending a Tuesday seminar urged Washington to help forge peace
across the Taiwan Strait a la its role in Northern Ireland's peace

      <P>The Taiwan Independence Alliance, sponsor of the symposium,
issued a statement welcoming Clinton to play the role of mediator
between Taiwan and mainland China and suggested he might win the
Nobel peace prize for such efforts.</P>
      <P>The group suggested Beijing take a page from the Northern Ireland
peace agreement and demonstrate greater flexibility in its position
toward Taiwan. Mainland China should treat Taiwan, which maintains
close cultural, language and ethnic links with the mainland, with
greater open-mindedness, the group said.</P>
      <P>Huang Erh-hsuan, a lawmaker with the pro-independence Democratic

      <P>A senior official with the alliance said the United States would

West Pacific. That means the United States should insist mainland
China not resort to force in its dealings with Taiwan, while the

      <P>Taiwan should pay more attention to US efforts to build a

      <P>Effective adjustments to the government's
agricultural policies are one of the main reasons Taiwan's
agricultural development has been so successful, President Lee
Teng-hui said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee, while meeting a group of foreign experts and scholars who
were in Taipei for a symposium on agricultural policies, explained
that over the past 100 years of agricultural development in Taiwan,
the government has pursued policies appropriate to the situation.</P>
      <P>From the earliest construction of irrigation facilities and
improvements to rice strains to land reform and the current opening
of Taiwan's agricultural market to internationalization and
liberalization, Taiwan's policies have led to its agricultural
success, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Compared to farmers elsewhere, Taiwan's farmers are well-versed
in the business aspects of agricultural production and are able to
concentrate on different crops to meet changing market needs. This
has allowed Taiwan's agricultural production to maintain flexibility
and competitiveness, Lee added.</P>
      <P>To help domestic farmers who may suffer losses from market
internationalization and liberalization, Lee said the government has
established a NT$100 billion (US$2.9 billion) agricultural relief
fund to help them through the transition.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Government health officials on Tuesday
confirmed that enterovirus type-71 is behind a viral epidemic that
has claimed the lives of 38 infants and children in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-hsiung, acting director of Bureau of Communicable Disease
Control under the Department of Health, said that the confirmation
was based on an autopsy performed at Linkuo Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital on an 8-year-old female who had a viral infection. The
autopsy revealed the presence of enterovirus type-71 in the girl's
spinal cord and medulla.</P>
      <P>That discovery has led officials to believe that enterovirus
type-71 first attacks a person's central nervous system, causing a
rise in blood pressure and cerebral pressure, Hsu said. As the
infection worsens, the victim falls into coma and dies from
complications of the infection, such as edema pulmonary, meningitis
or encephalitis.</P>
      <P>Children under the age of 5 are most at risk of being infected,
and common symptoms of an infection include a fever and rash with
ulcers on the hands, feet and mouth, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Hsu said news of the discovery has been passed on to three
experts from the US Centers for Disease Control who are currently in
Taiwan studying the outbreak, adding that the Department of Heath
will invite the doctors to recommend appropriate treatment for those
infected.</P>
      <P>As there is no vaccine for the virus, Hsu repeated the suggestion
that parents keep their children away from public places and make
sure that children wash their hands often to reduce the risk of
infection.</P>

      <P>The One Nation Party, buoyed by its
stunning success in the June 13 Queensland elections, has vowed to
field candidates for each of the 148 lower house seats that will be
contested in the next federal election, while Prime Minister John
Howard is expected to go ahead with plans for early elections.</P>
      <P>Howard is expected to follow his original game plan, despite the
unprecedented beating his Liberal Party and the National Party took
in the Queensland state elections last Saturday.</P>
      <P>Howard will announce his tax program in July and call for federal
elections either in August or September, as earlier planned,
political analysts said.</P>
      <P>The prime minister is worried that a delay in calling elections
would generate friction between the Liberal and National parties,
which form the country's coalition government, they said.</P>
      <P>A number of National Party members of Parliament have asked
Howard to abandon plans for a goods and services tax and not to
complete the privatization of Australia's telecommunications giant
Telstra, to increase the party's chances of winning in the next
federal election.</P>
      <P>But Howard is said to be unwilling to alter his plans, despite
the possible election-day consequences for the Liberal and National
parties.</P>
      <P>State branches of the One Nation Party in New South Wales,
Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Tasmania and Northern
Territory are expected to draw strength from the party's victory in
Queensland and achieve even greater success by winning seats in the
lower house.</P>
      <P>Branch directors of the party said inquiries on how to become
party members have increased since the Queensland election, from
which the party is expected to grab between nine and 12 seats in the
state assembly.</P>
      <P>The final tally is not expected until later this week.</P>
      <P>By calling the federal elections earlier than required, Howard
must announce a double-dissolution, which will dissolve both the

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton is facing pressure
over his upcoming trip to mainland China from within the United
States, from mainland China and from the media, reported the German
daily "Die Welt" on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The report cites the controversy surrounding Clinton's welcoming
ceremony, which will take place in front of the Great Hall of the
People in Tiananmen Square, the site of a bloody crackdown against
pro-democracy protests in 1989.</P>
      <P>The intensity of the criticism within the United States of
Clinton's trip and of mainland China was not expected by the Beijing
leadership. The report quotes an informed source in Beijing as saying
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin believed he had impressed the
US public during his state visit last October.</P>
      <P>Starting Monday Beijing will begin showing a 60-minute propaganda
film entitled "Over the Pacific," which depicts Jiang's US visit,
according the report. Neither the demonstrations that dogged Jiang
throughout his trip nor questions put to him at press conferences and
at US universities where he spoke will be included in the film.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LARGE COUNTERFEITING RING BUSTED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau (MJIB) announced on Tuesday it has busted a large
counterfeiting ring in the central county of Taichung and confiscated
more than 12,000 pieces of counterfeit brand-named fashion goods,
ranging from Chanel leatherware to Versace ready-to-wear collection.</P>
      <P>This was the fourth time that the MJIB's Taichung outpost has
successfully seized spurious fashion goods over the past three
months.</P>
      <P>MJIB investigators said the newly seized products were
all exquisitely made, including handbags, belts, garments and
accessories, and sunglasses. The products had been sold throughout
the island. "If they were genuine goods, they could fetch more than
NT$200 million (US$5.75 million)," said an investigator.</P>
      <P>He further said the MJIB had tracked a wholesaler of the fake
goods for two years. "But we had been unable to locate his
supply source until early this month."</P>
      <P>On June 12, investigators raided a retail outlet in the southern
port city of Kaohsiung, a distribution center in Taichung City and a
production facility in Shalu, Taichung County.</P>
      <P>In addition to confiscate large quantities of counterfeit goods
and production equipment at the three places, the investigators also
managed to nab the wholesaler, identified only by his family name
Hung, and several of his accomplices.</P>
      <P>Investigators said they will continue to probe the case in order
to check whether there are other accomplices at large.</P>
      <P>The MJIB has launched a new crackdown on commercial piracy since
the beginning of this year, with an aim to eradicate such illegal
business practices and rid Taiwan of the infamous name of "island of
counterfeiting."</P>
      <P>On April 15, the MJIB Taichung outpost seized more than 300
pieces of counterfeit Rolex watches and Chanel handbags at a retail
shop in Taichung City, worth about NT$16 million in market value.</P>
      <P>It again confiscated 160 Rolex watches in Taiping, Taichung
County on May 8 and raided a factory specializing in counterfeiting
brand-named goods in Tainan on June 8 and seized more than 8,600
bogus fashion goods.</P>
      <P>MJIB officials said Chanel Co. of France sent a letter to the
MJIB headquarters in Taipei recently to express its gratitude for
Taiwan's anti-counterfeiting efforts.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan gravel boat docked at the port of
Keelung, northern Taiwan, sank after being rammed by a
Malaysian-registered tanker filled with chemicals on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The accident also resulted in an oil slick. Keelung port

      <P>The 18,000-ton Malaysian tanker Tan-Jung was approaching the
Keelung port when it rammed the Yi Fang No. 1, tearing a hole into
the Yi Fang's hull. The 2,948-ton Yi Fang took on water and sank with
full gravel and a crane still on board. No casualties were reported.</P>
      <P>A member of the gravel boat's crew told port police that the
tanker was approaching so quickly that, even with the two anchors it
has cast, it could not help but ram the boat, adding that with 4,000
tons of gravel on board, the boat sank quickly. A dock worker also
said the Malaysian tanker was speeding at the time of the accident.</P>

reported Tuesday that, if workers laid off by state-run enterprises
are included, the jobless rate of the urban areas in mainland China
has risen above the warning line of eight percent to 9.36 percent.</P>
      <P>Quoting a survey report by the Development Research Center of

      <P>In order to keep the jobless rate under eight percent, the

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Eleven days after her arrival in Taiwan,
an Australian teenager of Taiwanese origin was finally reunited with
her birth mother on Tuesday after DNA testing established their
relationship.</P>
      <P>Kartya Wunderle of Melbourne said at a news conference she felt
"more at ease" to meet face to face with her biological mother and
older sister, whose identities were withheld at their request.</P>
      <P>Kartya, who was sold as an infant and adopted into an Australian
family 17 years ago, met her long lost natural mother at 4 a.m. at
the Chungho branch office of the Taipei County Police Bureau.</P>
      <P>One police officer who witnessed the event told the press that
the reunion was "heart-rending."</P>
      <P>"They hugged each other, cried and asked about each other's
life," said the officer with the Criminal Investigation Bureau,
which had helped arrange the reunion.</P>
      <P>Kartya later said at a press conference that she didn't call her
natural mother "Mama", but she added: "Hopefully I can build a
relationship with my biological mother in the future. I'll stay here
for two months."</P>
      <P>The 17-year-old further said she doesn't hate her birth father
who, according to police authorities, sold his baby daughter to an
adoption broker for NT$36,000 (about US$1,035).</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Nola Wunderle, Kartya's adoptive
mother, said discovery of her daughter's birth mother is an
"overwhelming emotional experience," ending an eight-year search.</P>
      <P>"We knew straight away by looking at them that they are Kartya's
family," Wunderle said.</P>
      <P>Kartya's adoptive father is scheduled to arrive in Taipei on
Wednesday to meet his daughter's birth mother, identified as "Mrs.
Chin."</P>
      <P>According to police authorities, Kartya's natural father never
married her mother, and already died several years ago.</P>
      <P>Kartya was adopted by the Wunderles in 1981. The adoption was
arranged by a white slavery ring headed by Chu Li-ching, also known
as Julie Chu, who was convicted in 1982 for selling 64 babies to

    <HEADLINE>CAA DRAFTS GUIDELINES ON FLIGHT DELAYS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration
(CAA) has drafted a set of guidelines relating to the handling of
flight delays, but civil airlines cannot seem to agree on the
sections concerning their responsibilities regarding compensation to
inconvenienced passengers.</P>
      <P>CAA mapped out the guidelines following a spate of sit-in
protests by Taiwan passengers in recent years over flight delays.</P>
      <P>Under the draft guidelines, if the airlines know that their
planes will be delayed by more than 15 minutes on domestic routes or
by over 30 minutes on international routes, they will have to inform
passengers immediately of the reason, and of measures being taken to
deal with the delay.</P>
      <P>Any changes in flight routes or of take-off points or
destinations will have to follow the same procedures.</P>
      <P>If a flight delay affects the rights and interests of passengers,
airlines will have to provide complimentary telecommunication
services, meals and accommodation, and any transportation to transfer
points which may be necessary.</P>
      <P>If there are practical reasons as to why airlines cannot provide
these services, they are required to fully explain the situation to
the passengers.</P>
      <P>CAA officials said that the gist of the guidelines is to push the
airlines into paying closer attention to flight punctuality.</P>
      <P>But the airlines have different views on the proposed guidelines,
pointing out that the most controversial parts lie in the CAA's
proposal to list the responsibilities of the airlines and set the
standards for judging the inconvenience to passengers.</P>
      <P>The Board of Airline Representatives (BOAR), comprised of local
and foreign airlines operating international routes, said that the
CAA has overstepped its bounds to an unacceptable extent, claiming
that the proposed guidelines stipulate that airlines will be obliged
to compensate passengers for any delays, even those caused by
circumstances outwith the airlines' control.</P>
      <P>The board pointed out that delays are often caused by poor
weather conditions, or problems on the part of the airports, citing
as an example a previous incident involving a breakdown of ground
operations at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport caused by a
power blackout.</P>
      <P>The BOAR officials said that European and American airliners have
questioned CAA guidelines through the American Chamber of Commerce in
Taipei and through the European Council of Commerce and Trade.</P>
      <P>They also said that if the CAA succeeds in making the airlines
take all the blame for delays, disputes between airlines and
passengers will probably increase, and operational costs will also
rise, leading to higher ticket prices.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Army is striving to
streamline its hierarchy while beefing up its combat strength,
military spokesman Gen. Kung Fan-ding said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Under a sweeping troop reduction plan, Kung said, army divisions
will be trimmed to brigades in an effort to develop a stripped-down
but elite fighting force.</P>
      <P>By the time the plan is complete, the Army force will have been
trimmed by 15 percent, but combat capability will have been raised by
13 percent, Kung noted.</P>
      <P>The plan, to be implemented in three stages between July 1997 and
June 2001, calls for a general restructuring, including streamlining
of the chain of command, consolidation of basic structures,
acquisition of sophisticated weaponry, reduction of the number of men
in uniform, and raising of combat readiness, according to Army
planning chief Gen. Pang Yu-tung.</P>
      <P>The plan will see the slashing of up to 1,700 higher-ranked
personnel, including generals and other officers.</P>
      <P>To beef up the Army's contingency command capabilities, a
"Warfare Headquarters" has been established to monitor potential
threats and the readiness of the various levels of the army, Pang
noted.</P>
      <P>Under the Warfare Headquarters, there is also a procurement
department, which has so far carried out 1,441 procurement projects
worth about NT$2 billion (US$57 million).</P>
      <P>The streamlining of the basic Army structures will result in
smaller brigades, including infantry, motorized infantry, armored
infantry and air cavalry, to replace the existing army divisions.
Brigade strength ranges from 2,000 to 4,000 men, compared with over
10,000 in a division.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Army is to establish a "combined battalion
system," in which soldiers from the above-mentioned brigades will be
mobilized to enhance the army's overall combat capability.</P>

      <P>The Taipei-based China External Trade
Development Council (CETRA) is building a "virtual trade market" on
the Internet, an executive from Taiwan's foremost non-profit trade
promotion organization revealed on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The market is to be located on the planned "Cetra Net" website
that CETRA is setting up to expand its online trade-related services
for domestic and foreign business communities, said Chan Fu-hsiung,
CETRA's chief of information services.</P>
      <P>The "virtual market" is expected to become one of CETRA's most
innovative and powerful services for creating trade opportunities.
"Approximately 4,500 items of product-related data provided by 3,000
businesses will be recorded in the planned market, making it the
world's largest online trading site," Chan said.</P>
      <P>He indicated that from July 8, local and foreign businesses from
around the world will be able to point their browsers at
"http://www.cetra.org.tw" to enter the "market," where they can look
for buyers or sellers.</P>
      <P>In addition to the "virtual trade market," Chan noted that the
planned website will also provide information resources via an
extensive databank, up-to-date news reporting, and an on-line
library, which will be available for a fee.</P>
      <P>The CETRA official estimated that at least 3 million people
around the globe are expected to visit Cetra Net when it goes online.
In order to take full advantage of the Internet's limitless power in
communication, CETRA is also planning to cooperate with the Yahoo!
search engine to expand its online services, he noted.</P>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chan Hou-sheng, chairman of the
Cabinet-level Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) under the Executive
Yuan, said on Tuesday that from 1965, the government has implemented
a series of four-year plans for human resource training.</P>
      <P>Chan made the remarks at the 18th Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum working group meeting on human resource
development which was held in Taipei on Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>He said the Asian financial crisis has created a heavy impact on
some APEC economies in Southeast Asia, resulting not only in the
depreciation of their currencies, but also in the closing of many
businesses and factories, creating large-scale unemployment. These
job losses have in turn caused social unrest, as well as economic
recession.</P>
      <P>However, Chan said, Taiwan has managed to come out of the
financial crisis relatively unscathed due to its excellent human
resource development policy. He pointed out that Taiwan has long
placed emphasis on human resource education and training.</P>
      <P>According to Chan, the series of four-year development projects
on human resources have helped build Taiwan into a prosperous
society. He noted that Taiwan's current goal is to raise education
levels in order to meet the needs of the high-technology sector and
the development of the service industry.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chan said, Taiwan also places great emphasis on
retraining and lifelong study projects. He also expressed his hope
that Taiwan's experience in human resource development can be used to
help the APEC economies.</P>
      <P>The APEC human resource working group meeting, the second of its
kind to be held this year, has set up an ad hoc committee on crisis
management to discuss ways and means of coping with the Asian
financial firestorm.</P>

Americans in that country, according to a recent report.</P>
      <P>The report, titled "Asian Americans: Diverse and Growing,"
indicates that in 1997, of the total 9,568,000 Asian Americans, 24
percent are of Chinese origin, followed by Filipinos at 21 percent.</P>
      <P>The estimated total of Asian Americans, about 4 percent of the US
population, is expected to double by 2010, the report said.</P>
      <P>"This rapid expansion has been characterized by a similarly rapid

    <HEADLINE>FORMER US DIPLOMAT'S REMARKS ABSURD, SAYS FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu on
Tuesday ridiculed former US diplomat Chas Freeman's recent remarks
that US arms sales to Taiwan no longer boost the island's confidence
that it can work out its differences with Beijing as "extremely
absurd."</P>
      <P>Although Hu admitted that he had not yet read the full context of
Freeman's article, carried in the latest issue of Foreign Affairs, a
bimonthly journal, he said it is not the first time he has heard such
nonsense. Such allegations are in complete contradiction to the
facts, he added.</P>
      <P>Freeman, a former diplomat who served as deputy chief of the US
embassy in Beijing between 1981 and 1984, said in the article that US
arms sales to Taiwan no longer boost the island's confidence that it
can work out its differences with Beijing. Instead, he asserted, such
sales only enhance pro-independence sentiments in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The United States should reevaluate its arms sales policy to
Taiwan in accordance with the 1982 joint communique," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Freeman also asserted in his article that the US sale of 150 F-16
fighters to Taiwan in 1992, and certain subsequent deals, do not
comply with the 1982 communique that Washington and Beijing forged
primarily to limit US arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Beijing is now wavering in its determination to stick with a
policy of peaceful resolution of its differences with Taipei. How
much of this wavering is due to US noncompliance with the 1982
communique, and how much is Taipei's new opposition to reunification,
is unclear," he added.</P>
      <P>Hu said that today, the cause of Taiwan people's deep repugnance
toward mainland China is Beijing's persistent and unceasing attempts
to isolate Taiwan in the international community.</P>
      <P>Discounting Freeman's remarks about the arms sales, Hu said
Taiwan's strenuous arms acquisition efforts and America's arms sales
to Taiwan serve only one purpose -- to safeguard peace.</P>
      <P>"Our acquisition of defensive arms is only for defending peace,
and has nothing to do with whether or not we want independence," he
said.</P>
      <P>Hu stressed that Freeman's remarks represent only the isolated
views of a few people. "We don't think such views, which are
definitely not the mainstream views of the American academic sector,
but relatively close to the views of the Beijing authorities, will
spread throughout America," he said.</P>
      <P>Hu also said he does not think Freeman's remarks are relevant to
the upcoming Clinton-Jiang summit, or that they will have any impact
on the meeting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC DEFENDS `NO HASTE, BE PATIENT' MAINLAND CHINA INVESTMENT POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  16  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC)
said on Tuesday that it is necessary for the government to continue
following its "no haste, be patient" mainland China investment
strategy.</P>
      <P>This is because political motives have always been behind
Beijing's move to conduct trade and economic exchanges with Taiwan,
according to an MAC report on the policy initiated by President Lee
Teng-hui.</P>
      <P>The report claimed that as Beijing's hostility toward Taiwan
remains, an unlimited increase in Taiwan investment in the mainland
will eventually undermine national security, citing remarks made by
ranking Beijing officials on several occasions to support its
conclusion.</P>
      <P>Former mainland Chinese President Yang Shangkun, for example,
said in 1987 that "Taiwan would not be able to run away (from the
mainland) if we can control its lifeline by persuading the island's
top 20 enterprises (to invest in the mainland)."</P>
      <P>More recently, according to the report, the director of the
Taiwan Affairs Office of Beijing's State Council, Chen Yunlin, said:
"Warmer cross-strait trade and economic relations will be in the
greater interest of China's unification."</P>
      <P>The report said that the Beijing leadership has gradually come to
understand that resorting to force would not be a good way of
pursuing China's unification, and that the best course of action
would be by way of trade and economic exchanges.</P>
      <P>The report also said that critics of the cautious policy, who
claim that "politics should be separate from economic affairs," are
being impractical, as Beijing has always regarded cross-strait trade
and economic exchanges as political issues.</P>
      <P>It is also impossible that the mainland will be able to maintain
its high annual economic growth of around 10 percent, the report went
on, and once its economic growth slows down, political and social
crises are likely to be triggered, putting Taiwan's mainland
investments at great risk.</P>
      <P>In fact, the report said, the results of several public polls
have shown that only a minority of the general public are against the
strategy, compared to the nearly 50 percent of the people who favor
even stricter limits on mainland investment.</P>

      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) is likely to
nominate incumbent Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih as its candidate for
the year-end mayoral election in Kaohsiung, KMT party sources
reported on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>In a meeting that day presided over by Vice President and KMT Vice
Chairman Lien Chan, the nine-member KMT Nomination Screening Task
Force suggested that during a Wednesday meeting of the KMT Central
Standing Committee, Wu be nominated as the KMT candidate to seek
reelection in the southern metropolis of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The task force, which includes KMT Vice Chairman Li Yuan-zu and
such other party heavyweights as Premier Vincent Siew, President of
the Examination Yuan Hsu Shui-teh and Presidential Secretary-General
Huang Kun-huei, also suggested that the party make special efforts to
soothe the anger of three other KMT hopefuls who have vowed to run
for the Kaohsiung mayorship.</P>
      <P>One of the three contenders, Su Nan-cheng, a National Assembly
member and former Kaohsiung mayor, claimed that he will never back
down from his intention to run.</P>
      <P>Su later added that he may even join Chang Jui-teh, deputy
speaker of the Kaohsiung City Council, who also announced his
intention to run, in support of Legislator Wang Chih-hsiung, the
third of the three contenders, in a potentially vote-splitting race
with Wu for the mayorship.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ANTI-CRIME CZAR QUESTIONED OVER MOLESTATION ALLEGATIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 16 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Acting Director of the Investigation Bureau
Cheng Chuan turned up at the Ministry of Justice on Tuesday to answer
questions before a special panel over allegations that he molested
the daughter of a friend two years ago in a Paris hotel room.</P>
      <P>At a hastily called press conference after one-and-a-half hours
of questioning, Cheng denied any wrongdoing and offered to undertake
a polygraph test to clear his name.</P>
      <P>Cheng said that the French authorities would never have let him
leave France if he had really done what his accusers complained of,
which was that he raped a friend's daughter during a private trip to
Paris between Sept. 8 and 13, 1996.</P>
      <P>Opposition Democratic Progressive Party National Assemblyman Lai
Ching-lin, a personal friend of the girl's family, said he was asked
by the girl's father, Yang Wan-shou, to expose Cheng's crime after
Taipei authorities stonewalled over Yang's calls for a probe. He
urged the Ministry of Justice to investigate the case thoroughly.</P>
      <P>Cheng did not immediately respond to Lai's allegations, but his
office denied the accusations, claiming that his three-day schedule
in Paris did not include any meeting with Yang. His aides dismissed
the rumor as a plot to block Cheng's chances of taking the helm at
the Investigation Bureau.</P>
      <P>However, Cheng confessed to the bureau's internal investigators
on Sept. 11 that he had seen Yang and his daughter in Paris and had
applied Chikung, a Chinese martial art with medical effects, on the
daughter.</P>
      <P>Three days later, a local newspaper published a telephone
interview with Yang's wife Chou Pai-lien, in which she claimed that
Cheng molested her daughter under the pretext of administering
Chikung in Cheng's Paris hotel room.</P>
      <P>Chou said in the interview that she and her daughter called on
Cheng on Sept. 13 at his hotel room, where Cheng touched her
daughter's breast and private parts under the excuse of curing her
with Chikung, after Chou left the room for about 40 minutes.</P>
      <P>Cheng told reporters on Tuesday that Yang's daughter, then 19,
suffered from anorexia nervosa and that he tried to cure her with
Chikung on Sept. 12 in the presence of her parents.</P>
      <P>The next day, Chou and her daughter called on Cheng at his hotel
and asked him to perform the treatment again because the daughter
felt better after the treatment of the previous day.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Chou left the hotel room during the treatment but he
denied touching Chou's daughter indecently, saying that he only asked
her to take off her outer coat and touched her back.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he would not step down now that a special panel has
been set up by the Ministry of Justice to probe the case, for fear
that his quitting would be interpreted as an admission of guilt.</P>
      <P>He said he kept silent when the allegations surfaced because he
believed the investigation would clear his name.</P>
      <P>Cheng said Yang and he are old friends who met in Paris many
years ago when Cheng was studying there, that he cares for Yang's
daughter as an elder, and that he did nothing wrong.</P>

      <P>The presidents of the Republic of China

jointly reiterated that their two nations will promote the welfare of
the people of their countries, based on a common stance of mutual
trust and benefit.</P>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui and his Sao Tome and Principe counterpart
Miguel Trovoada made the remarks during a state banquet hosted by Lee

Trovoada the Order of Brilliant Jade, the ROC's highest civil award,
to mark his remarkable contributions to promoting friendly ties and
cooperation between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Trovoada described the award as not only the highest honor he has

    <HEADLINE>NEW ZEALAND SEEKS WTO 'DOWN PAYMENT' FROM TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 17 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Zealand has sent its top trade official
to Taiwan in a bid to further crack open the island's agricultural
markets.</P>
      <P>Lockwood Smith, New Zealand's minister of international trade who
is also minister of agriculture and forestry, met with ROC Economic
Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Smith hopes to convince Taiwan to partially open its agricultural
market as a "down payment" for entry to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) following a similar agreement Taiwan made with the United
States.</P>
      <P>Smith's visit to the island represents the first time Wellington
has sent a ministerial-level official to Taiwan for WTO-related
talks.</P>
      <P>As part of the agreement Smith is seeking to strike with Taiwan,
he asked that the island open its meat market to New Zealand exports
to the tune of 5,000 tons of beef chops and offal annually.</P>
      <P>He is also asking Taiwan to increase its annual apple quota for
New Zealand by 4,000 tons, and allow imports of pear, persimmon and
citrus fruits from New Zealand. Taiwan now permits the import of
8,000 tons of apple from New Zealand annually.</P>
      <P>Wang, meanwhile, stressed that the trade, investment, immigration
and education ties between the two sides are increasing. However,
Wang kept mum on Taiwan's promises of "down payment" to New Zealand.
He only said he and Smith exchanged views on the issue.</P>
      <P>In February this year, Taiwan agreed to partially open its
agricultural market to US imports as a "down payment" for entry to
the Geneva-based WTO. Taiwan agreed to open its pork market to US
exports to the tune of 12,500 tons of pork products immediately upon
WTO accession.</P>

    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June 16 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Due to declining exports to Japan since the
beginning of this year, Taiwan may post a record-high trade deficit
of US$20 billion with Japan for 1998, a trade promotion official
predicted Tuesday.</P>
      <P>If the downward trend continues, Taiwan's trade imbalance with
Japan may exceed the US$20 billion mark for the whole of 1998, said
Ricky Y.S. Kao, secretary-general of the quasi-official China
External Trade Development Council (CETRA).</P>
      <P>Taiwan exports to Japan plummeted by 22.5 percent in the first
five months of 1998 compared to the same period last year, while its
combined trade surplus from January to May only reached US$750
million, a decrease of 77 percent.</P>
      <P>As the Asian financial storm takes its toll on Taiwan's economy,
Kao said relevant government agencies have taken measures to explore
outbound shipments.</P>
      <P>Of the government's 106 packages aimed to boost export, 26 are
targeted at the Japanese market, Kao said. He added that CETRA is
considering a name change for its Tokyo office -- the Far East Trade
Service Center in Tokyo -- to further enhance its operations and
services.</P>
      <P>He urged Japan to take more efficient steps to stabilize its
financial sector and stimulate its economy to help prevent another
bout of turmoil in Asia's financial markets.</P>
      <P>Kao, who arrived in Tokyo for a six-day visit Monday from the
United States, was speaking at a meeting with reporters</P>
      <P>In addition to visiting Japanese trade promotion organizations
for discussions on bilateral cooperation, Kao will also meet with
CETRA personnel stationed in Japan and hold seminars with investors
and representatives of banking institutions from Taiwan.</P>

      <P>The strike-hit Philippine Airlines (PAL)
suffered another setback as union rank-and-file members said they
would observe a work slowdown which began at noon on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The management dismissed the effects of the threat and said the

percent of its employees which number 14,000.</P>
      <P>An official of the Philippine Airlines Employees Association
(PALEA) said, "Starting at noon (Tuesday), we will reduce terminal

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore is revising its full-year
growth forecast of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent and may announce other
new figures within two weeks, a senior official from the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The revised gross domestic product (GDP) growth numbers for 1998
will be at the lower end of the official forecasts, said Khor Hoe Ee,
director of MAS' economics department.</P>
      <P>Off-budget measures to alleviate conditions for businesses are
also likely to be announced once an inter-agency review involving the
Ministry of Trade and Industry and the MAS is completed, he added.</P>
      <P>Khor declined to specify the measures the government would take
but said they would be aimed at helping industries adjust to
difficulties straight away.</P>
      <P>"The effect of these measures on the Singapore economy should be
fairly immediate," he said.</P>
      <P>Off-budget measures are tools governments use to tackle economic
emergencies that may arise after an annual budget has been announced.
They could include tax rebates, infrastructure spending or tax cuts.</P>
      <P>Deputy Prime Minister Tan Keng Yam said last month that
off-budget measures could be introduced by the end of June if
second-quarter growth figures show a further slowdown.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Hu Tsu Dow also told Parliament this month that
the government could initiate off-budget measures if preliminary
second-quarter data point to an economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>He said Singapore's non-oil domestic exports fell 6 percent in
May, after a 1.6 percent decline in April.</P>
      <P>The Singapore economy grew 5.6 percent in the first quarter of

    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should abide by the
Taiwan Relations Act and continue to sell arms to Taiwan, US
Congressman Robert Smith (R-OR) said in the House of Representatives
Tuesday. He added that Beijing should declare it will not use force
against Taiwan "now or in the future."</P>
      <P>Smith was speaking in a statement welcoming the visit of 19 ROC
legislators to Capitol Hill.</P>
      <P>The delegation, led by KMT Legislator Rau Yin-chi, is visiting
the US voice Taipei's concerns as US President Bill Clinton prepares
to meet with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin during his visit
to mainland China from June 25 to July 3.</P>
      <P>Smith said while the PRC is vital to US interests, "it is equally
important that we not ignore the interests of our ally and trading
partner: the Republic of China on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Smith, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, told his
colleagues that the legislators represent all major political parties
in Taiwan: the ruling Kuomintang, the Democratic Progressive Party,
the New Party and non-aligned parties. This delegation fully
demonstrates how democracy has worked in the ROC, he said.</P>
      <P>In 10 years, Taiwan has evolved from a one-party state to
multi-political parties of different ideologies. The growth of
elective politics has been very healthy for Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is setting a good example of elective democracy for other
developing nations, especially China," the congressman noted.</P>
      <P>For years, Taiwan has been buying American agricultural products
worth billions of dollars and cooperating with the US on all major
issues affecting the two countries, he said.</P>
      <P>"I therefore share the many concerns of our Taiwan friends who
are visiting us here on the hill today," said Smith.</P>
      <P>"Let us abide by the Taiwan Relations Act and continue our arms
sales to Taiwan. It is also my hope that both Taiwan and the People's
Republic of China will work toward eventual reunification when both
sides reach similar levels of freedom and democracy," he added.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, both sides across the Taiwan Strait should
communicate on all issues "as equal partners." Moreover, Smith
stressed, the PRC should declare that it will not use force against
Taiwan now or in the future.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT) officially
nominated incumbent Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih as its candidate for
the year-end Kaohsiung mayoral election at Wednesday's KMT Central
Standing Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>As words of support flooded in, the three other KMT hopefuls who
angrily vowed to continue with their bids for the Kaohsiung mayorship
following Wu's last-minute decision to seek reelection, all said they
would have to wait and see before making further decisions regarding
their part in the race.</P>
      <P>Following his official nomination, Wu said that he will "boldly
step forward and spare no effort" in his bid for reelection.</P>
      <P>He also said he would speak with those in the party who held
different opinions of him with sincerity. However, the mayor did not
say he plans to meet with the three other KMT mayoral hopefuls in the
near future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, as the KMT's mayoral candidates for both Taipei and
Kaohsiung became official, a delighted President and KMT Chairman Lee
Teng-hui said he felt "as if the dark clouds in the sky have
scattered, leaving pleasant feelings inside."</P>
      <P>Lee lauded Wu as an outstanding senior member of the KMT with
abundant administrative experience and incorruptible integrity, and
described him as a most fitting and difficult-to-find candidate for
Kaohsiung mayor.</P>
      <P>During his eight years as mayor, Wu planned numerous major
infrastructure projects and laid down a solid foundation for
Kaohsiung's future development, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Wu also visited all levels of his administration diligently,
greatly raising the standard and effectiveness of the city
government's service for the people, bringing about prosperity and
progress for the city, Lee added.</P>
      <P>Vice President and KMT Vice Chairman Lien Chan also noted Wu's
outstanding qualifications. In addition, he urged the party to
express more concern for the other three KMT contenders. He said he
hoped these members can also support the party's decision.</P>
      <P>President of the Examination Yuan Hsu Shui-teh, a former
Kaohsiung city mayor, said he believed Wu would win the support of
Kaohsiung residents because of his numerous contributions.</P>
      <P>C.K. Wu, director of Kaohsiung's Department of Information, said
the nomination is a major benefit to the citizens of the southern
metropolis.</P>
      <P>Wu Den-yih is a capable candidate with integrity who has sought
out several major construction projects from the central government
for the long-term development of his city, C.K. Wu said.</P>

affairs at critical moments in the future, he can accomplish even
more to improve the welfare of the residents of Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Thursday will mark Wu's eighth anniversary in office. He was
appointed to the Kaohsiung mayorship on June 18, 1990 and was
popularly elected at the end of 1994 in the first Kaohsiung municipal

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI COURT IMPOUNDS AIRPORT MRT LINE DOCUMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei District Court has impounded
large quantities of documents concerning a bid for building a mass
rapid transit system (MRT) linking Chiang Kai-shek International
Airport in Taoyuan County to metropolitan Taipei.</P>
      <P>Judge Lai Ying-hua led a team of court officials to the
Engineering Office of the Highspeed Rail under the Ministry of
Transportation and Communications (MOTC) on Tuesday evening and took
away all related documents.</P>
      <P>Lai told the press on Wednesday that the court action was taken
in response to an application by BES Engineering Corp. to have the
documents impounded to use as evidence.</P>
      <P>Noting that the move is only one stage of civil court procedures
aimed at the perpetuation of evidence, Lai said the impoundment is
unbiased and does not imply any moral or legal judgment on any party
involved.</P>
      <P>BES, which lost to Chang Sheng International Development Co. in
bidding for priority rights to negotiate a contract for building the
new 34.5-km MRT line, said it had applied for the perpetuation of
evidence because it might sue the MOTC for what it called mishandling
of the bidding.</P>
      <P>"In case we finally decide to file a lawsuit, we'll need all
these documents to back our claims," a BES spokesman said, adding
that the company is afraid the documents may be destroyed, lost, or
otherwise made difficult to be produced for use in court.</P>
      <P>He further said the company will apply for the right to read the
impounded documents to ascertain whether there were any
irregularities in the bidding process.</P>
      <P>"Our action is a legal remedy and is not expected to hinder
normal operations of the Engineering Office of Highspeed Rail because
all the documents impounded are duplicated copies," the spokesman
added.</P>
      <P>The documents taken by the court include the winning contractor's
full investment plan, reports detailing opinions of all relevant
government agencies, a comprehensive evaluation report on all
competing bids, reports concerning all technical problems, minutes of
all screening meetings, and many other related data.</P>
      <P>The BES action has drawn concern from President Lee Teng-hui
and stern criticism from senior MOTC officials. President Lee
summoned MOTC Minister Lin Feng-cheng Wednesday morning for
questioning about the MRT line bidding process. During their
half-hour talks, Lin briefed the president on details about the
incident.</P>
      <P>Lin later told the press that the impoundment is unnecessary and
nonsensical. "The ministry had handled the bidding in an open, fair
and just manner. The process was impeccable. I feel regret over BES'
actions and allegations," he stated.</P>
      <P>Stressing that preserving official documents is an unshirkable
duty for public functionaries, Lin further said it is unlikely that
any of the airport MRT line-related documents will be destroyed or
lost.</P>
      <P>Liao Ching-lung, director of the Engineering Office of Highspeed
Rail, said the BES action has seriously undermined the government's
reputation and credibility, and has even dealt a severe blow to the
morale of all civil servants.</P>
      <P>Liao also denied any irregularities or defects in the bidding for
construction of the new MRT line under a BOT
(build-operate-transfer) formula. The system is expected to become
operational by 2003.</P>
      <P>A total of five business groups tendered bids for the NT$50
billion project. Chang Sheng International Development Co., an
affiliate of the Taichung-based Ever Fortune Group, won the priority
right to negotiate a contract with the highspeed rail office within
45 days.</P>
      <P>BES and Shang Ching MRT Co. were named as second and third
alternatives in case Chang Sheng fails to strike a deal with the
highspeed rail office during the specified period of time.</P>
      <P>Since the MOTC announced the results of the bidding on May 26,
the four losing bidders have lodged protests with relevant government
agencies and have appealed to the watchdog Control Yuan over alleged
irregularities and unfairness in the bidding process. One of them,
the Tailien consortium, already filed a lawsuit with the Taipei
District Court on May 28.</P>
      <P>The airport MRT line is Taiwan's second infrastructure project to
be built under the BOT scheme. The first such project is a
high-speed railway which will stretch from Taipei in the north to
Kaohsiung in the south.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEMENTIA DOESN'T ALWAYS AFFECT DRIVING SKILLS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  June  16  (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Although previous studies have shown
people suffering from Alzheimer's disease have an increased risk of
getting into an automobile accident, not all individuals with mild
dementia exhibit poor driving skills.</P>
      <P>Investigators at Washington University School of Medicine in St.
Louis have identified specific aspects of attention that may help in
determining whether a demented individual can drive safely.</P>
      <P>"A demented older adult's attention capacity can sometimes be
quite reduced, which makes it much more difficult for that person to
deal with the complex environment that driving creates," said Janet
Duchek, assistant professor of occupational therapy and lead author
of a paper published in the latest issue of Journal of Gerontology.</P>
      <P>John C. Morris, the Harvey A. and Dorismai Friedman Professor of
Neurology, headed the research team while the National Institute on
Aging funded the study.</P>
      <P>Alzheimer's affects about 4 million Americans, many of whom
continue to drive throughout the early stages of the disease.</P>
      <P>A 1997 study of Alzheimer's affects on driving skills conducted
by the same research team showed that 59 percent of individuals with
mild dementia and 81 percent with very mild dementia passed their
driving tests and appeared to retain relatively safe driving skills.</P>
      <P>In the recent study, researchers investigated aspects of
attention to predict which individuals with Alzheimer's were still
safe on the road.</P>
      <P>The study involved 136 participants recruited from the Washington
University Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, which Morris
co-directs.</P>
      <P>These individuals were still driving at the time of the study,
had a valid driver's license, at least 10 years of driving experience
and corrected visual acuity of at least 20/50.</P>
      <P>Each participant was screened and rated according to the Clinical
Dementia Rating scale. Some participants were healthy controls, while
others had very mild or mild dementia.</P>
      <P>Morris said although Alzheimer's patients may drive safely for a
while, every person with the disease eventually will become an unsafe
driver.</P>
      <P>"We do not wish to limit driving -- and hence an individual's
independence -- too soon," he said. "The trick is to identify
problems and intervene before a dangerous situation or actual crash
occurs."</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN'S SOVEREIGN RISK RATING REMAINS STABLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  June  16 (CNA)
(By Huang Kwang-chun)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thomson Bankwatch, the world's largest
bank rating agency, maintains its current Sovereign Risk Rating
outlook for Japan at AAA stable.</P>
      <P>Betty Starkey, director of sovereign risk at Thomson Bankwatch,
said in a report to be released Wednesday that although the economic
outlook continues to worsen in Asia, as the world's largest creditor
nation, Japan has foreign exchange reserves of around US$200 billion,
a substantial current account surplus, and deep institutionalized
savings.</P>
      <P>These resources should be more than sufficient to preserve the
country's overall credit-worthiness, she said.</P>
      <P>However, recently released economic data indicated that Japan's
economy is in worse shape than previously anticipated, Starkey
pointed out.</P>
      <P>According to Japan's economic planning agency, the country's
economy contracted by 1.3 percent in the first quarter of this year,
or by an annualized rate of 5.3 percent.</P>
      <P>Since a 0.4 percent contraction was reported in the fourth
quarter of the last year, Japan is now technically in a recession,
Starkey noted.</P>
      <P>The recessive environment makes it highly unlikely that interest
rates will be raised to defend the Japanese yen which has fallen
sharply in recent days, the report said.</P>
      <P>Japanese policy makers said they may intervene in the markets to
stem the yen's decline. The effectiveness of government intervention
is likely to be limited given market perceptions of continuing
divergence between the sluggishness in Japan and the strength of the
US economy, it continued.</P>
      <P>The icy wind blowing out of Japan will dampen prospects for the
rest of Asia, the report indicated, adding that currency and stock
markets continue to tumble across the region over concerns that the
yen's slide is turning out to be more rapid than expected.</P>
      <P>As a result, Starkey concluded, the timetable for recovery in the
rest of Asia has now been pushed back even further.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUMMIT SAID NOT TO HURT TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has repeatedly assured
the Republic of China that the upcoming meeting between US President
Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin will not hurt
Taiwan's interests, and so far there have been no signs to indicate
any such possibility, Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu said on
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hu said that from a personal point of view, he would like to
trust the US promises made during recent US-ROC exchanges of opinion
on the summit. The US side has repeatedly vowed that no surprise
developments regarding Taiwan will be produced at the summit, slated
for later this month in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Speculating on the possible agenda of the Clinton-Jiang summit,
the foreign minister forecast that trade and financial issues might
take precedence because of the recent sharp depreciation of the
Japanese yen and the impact of the Asian financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks in a keynote speech to a meeting sponsored by
a journalists' club.</P>
      <P>Although Clinton may make a gesture to show US support for the
"three noes," -- no Taiwan independence, no "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan," and no United Nations membership for Taiwan -- at
the summit, Hu said he does not believe that Washington will shift
its basic stance toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>On the post-summit relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait, the foreign minister said his ministry would be delighted to
see any improvement in bilateral ties.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council has been actively
pushing for a resumption of regular cross-strait talks, arranging a
meeting between Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the semi-official Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), and his mainland Chinese counterpart, Wang
Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), by the end of this year, Hu pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Koo and Wang are the top negotiators representing Taipei and
Beijing, respectively, to deal with two-way exchanges in the absence
of formal contacts between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Regular SEF and ARATS talks were suspended unilaterally by
Beijing in 1995 after President Lee Teng-hui paid a landmark visit to
the US that same year. Beijing viewed the trip as a covert move to
promote Taiwan independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS CONFIDENCE HITS SEVEN-YEAR LOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June 17 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Business confidence in Australia has hit
a seven-year low as a result of the lingering Asian crisis and the
latest financial slump in Japan, Australia's largest trading partner.</P>
      <P>In its latest joint survey by the Australian Chamber of Commerce
and Industry (ACCI) and Westpac Banking Corporation, one of
Australia's four leading banks, the country's gross domestic product
in fiscal 1998-99 will only grow at 2.25 percent, lower than the
government's forecast of 3 percent.</P>
      <P>In fiscal 1997-98, Australia GDP is expected to grow at 3.75
percent.</P>
      <P>Westpac now believes the Australian dollar, which has been
battered by the weaker Japanese yen, the Asian crisis and falling
commodity prices, will further drop to 55 US cents in the near term.</P>
      <P>The currency closed Tuesday at 58.68 US cents.</P>
      <P>Westpac's general manager for economics, Bill Evans, said
Australia's inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index, is
expected to increase to about 3 percent from the current rate of
below 2 percent.</P>
      <P>"The results of the latest survey highlight clearly the dangers
of raising interest rates in the current environment," he said.</P>
      <P>He said many Australian businessmen have now either stopped new
investment plans or have put them on hold.</P>
      <P>Evans said Westpac has downgraded its forecast for GDP growth in
1998-99 from 2.5 percent to 2.25 percent. This is well below the
federal government's forecast of 3 percent economic growth for
1998-99.</P>
      <P>He said the Westpac-ACCI survey showed production and new orders
have fallen dramatically over the past three months with capacity
utilization also down sharply over the same period. He did not give
figures.</P>
      <P>"The drag in growth from falling exports has clearly grown and is
now more than negating any strength in domestic sales," Evans said.</P>
      <P>ACCI chief executive Mark Paterson said the disappointing survey
results confirmed the need for more reform despite the backlash
against change being exploited by Independent Member of Parliament
Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, which scored a stunning victory in
the Queensland state election on June 13.</P>
      <P>Shadow Treasurer Gareth Evans said the survey finally dispelled
the myth that the coalition government under Prime Minister John
Howard had "fireproofed" the Australian economy from the Asian
crisis.</P>
      <P>"Australians now face an economic horror story: falling exports,
falling output, falling business investment, a falling dollar,
falling employment -- but rising home mortgage rates and rising
unemployment," Gareth Evans told reporters yesterday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN IS CALIFORNIA'S FOURTH-LARGEST EXPORT OUTLET</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles, June 16 (CNA)
(By Chu Lusheng &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is California's fourth-largest
export market, while Hong Kong is the 10th-largest and mainland
China, the 14th, according to the latest tallies from the US state's
Trade and Commerce Agency (TCA).</P>
      <P>Taiwan imported US$1.68 billion-worth of goods from California in
the first quarter of this year, up 18 percent from the year-earlier
level, making it the golden state's fourth-largest export outlet.</P>
      <P>In 1996, Taiwan was California's sixth-largest overseas market,
behind Japan, Canada, South Korea, Mexico and Singapore.</P>
      <P>John C. Lungren Jr., international marketing director for the
TCA, said it is amazing that an island as small as Taiwan has turned
out to be the fourth-largest market for Californian goods, especially
when compared to mainland China's 14th position, with its population
58 times that of Taiwan's, and its area 250 times larger than Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The TCA's trade figures in the first quarter of this year show
Japan still to be California's largest overseas market.</P>
      <P>This position, however, is threatened by the so-called "Chinese
communities" -- Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China -- whose
combined trade volume with California approached that of Japan's in
the first three months of the year.</P>
      <P>TCA officials estimated that Japan may soon be outperformed by
the three "Chinese communities," as the Japanese government has
declared that its economy has entered a recession.</P>
      <P>California, the hub of America's computer, aerospace,
biochemical, environmental protection and technology industries, has
seen increased exports to Taiwan in recent years, and an increased
number of companies in the above-mentioned sectors have invested in
Taiwan, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>In a visit to Taipei in February this year, Los Angeles Mayor
Richard Riordan struck cooperation agreements with Evergreen Marine
Corp. and Yangming Marine Transport, two leading Taiwan shipping
companies. These agreements are expected to further help expand
business cooperation between Taiwan and California.</P>
      <P>Describing California as the US in miniature, the officials said
that in 1996, Taiwan was the US' sixth-largest import source, the
seventh-largest export market, and the eighth-largest trading
partner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN SUGAR TO SHIFT AUSSIE OFFICE DUE TO 'ONE NATION' WIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Sugar Corp. of Taiwan will move
its regional head office to New South Wales (NSW) from Queensland as
a result of the One Nation Party victory in state elections on June
13, according to the Taiwan-Australia Business Association (TABA) in
Brisbane.</P>
      <P>Chinese business authorities in Shanghai have also raised
concerns over the investment climate in Queensland due to the
anti-Asian policies advocated by the One Nation Party.</P>
      <P>TABA President Jim Sheu told The Australian newspaper Tuesday
that Taiwan Sugar would base itself in NSW because Queensland would
not be an appropriate place for its regional office after the One
Nation Party won an unprecedented victory.</P>
      <P>The party, often called racist, anti-Asian and
anti-multiculturalism, is expected to win between nine and 12 seats at
the Queensland Legislative Assembly. The victory could put the One
Nation Party, set up by Independent Member of Parliament Pauline
Hanson, in the balance of power in the Queensland government.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan Sugar is looking for multiple investment opportunities,
and A$20 million (US$12.5 million) is just small potatoes," he added.</P>
      <P>In an interview with business authorities in Shanghai, the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation's correspondent Jane Hutcheon
reported that Chinese investment in Queensland is likely to change
following the victory of the One Nation Party.</P>
      <P>The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) said the
victory for the One Nation Party resulted in major concern among
foreign businessmen and their investments in Australia.</P>
      <P>"Clearly it is a major concern not just from Taiwan not to invest
in Australia, but any investment from overseas is certain to have the
same view," ACCI chief executive Mark Paterson said.</P>
      <P>At a news conference Wednesday morning, Prime Minister John
Howard said foreign investors are looking for a stable environment
when they make their investment overseas.</P>
      <P>"If we don't welcome them to invest in Australia, they will
certainly go elsewhere," he warned.</P>
      <P>Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson said the One Nation's
parliamentary team had a "big cannon" aimed at Queensland's A$8
billion (US$5 billion) tourism industry and the state must now
reassure skittish Asian markets.</P>
      <P>He warned of potential havoc from the new political force as
tangible signs of damage to Queensland business began flowing from
the One Nation's popularity.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's investment in Australia, mainly in shopping malls, a
steel mill and a joint venture in salt, eels and prawn cultivation,
is estimated at well over A$1 billion (US$625 million) in recent
years.</P>
      <P>Trade officials from both Taiwan and Australia believe Taiwanese
investment in Australia is expected to increase in coming years.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between the two countries rose 12 percent in 1997
to A$6.7 billion (US$4.5 billion) from the 1996 level.</P>
      <P>They said there is more room for both countries to increase trade
and investment because Australia and Taiwan are complimentary.
Australia has rich natural resources while Taiwan is awash with
capital, good in marketing and strong in the manufacturing sector.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) on

effort at price fixing.</P>
      <P>In April, prices from 223 related businesses in Taipei, Taichung

      <P>The study revealed that cable channel fees registered the highest

copyright royalties, which increased average broadcasting costs by
31.44 percent.</P>
      <P>Computer software cost 15.2 percent more than last year, mainly
because of major fluctuations in the new Taiwan dollar and subsequent
price adjustments by traders.</P>
      <P>Magazine prices also went up by 12.06 percent, because of changes
in the currency exchange rate coupled with an increased cost of pulp
in the international market.</P>
      <P>Compact discs went up in price by 10.74 percent, while video game
cartridges registered a price drop of 15.34 percent and laser discs
fell 5.36 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AN OVERVIEW OF IMPACT OF FINANCIAL TURMOIL ON HONG KONG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  June  17  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian regional financial turmoil
which began last summer is still exerting an impact on Hong Kong,
with no end in sight.</P>
      <P>Its impact on Hong Kong's economy was first reflected on the
stock market and the slump in real estate prices. Speculators carried
out successful hit and run operations in South East Asian money
markets before making an onslaught on Hong Kong's currency in August,
1997. In order to counter this speculation and in defense of its
exchange system pegging the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar, the
Hong Kong government chose a high interest rate policy at that time.</P>
      <P>Although the policy defeated the speculators and kept the HK
dollar stable, the measure delivered a serious blow to Hong Kong's
stock market, resulting in a plummet in securities which saw the Hang
Seng equity index falling to the 10,000 level by the end of 1997 from
16,800 last August.</P>
      <P>In addition to the fall in the stock market, the price of real
estate also dropped drastically. In response to the inflationary
spiral of real estate at the end of l997, the Hong Kong government
announced measures to curtail the trend. One of the important
measures was to build 85,000 housing units in the hope of keeping a
reasonable balance between demand and supply.</P>
      <P>However, just as the Asian financial crisis began to bite, the
well-intentioned housing policy was censured acrimoniously as a
negative factor which was accelerating the fall of Hong Kong's real
estate prices.</P>
      <P>At the end of May, the government announced negative growth of 2
percent for first-quarter 1998 exports, while unemployment rose to
3.9 percent in February through April. In mid-June, unemployment rose
further to 4.2 percent in the period from March to May, the highest
rate in 15 years.</P>
      <P>All in all, economic prospects for Hong Kong are bleak.</P>
      <P>Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, has admitted that the economy is going down,
and anticipated recently that Hong Kong's economy will deteriorate
even more in the next few quarters.</P>
      <P>These factors leave us in no doubt that Hong Kong's economy is
entering into a recession.</P>

      <P>Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui
said on Tuesday that his government will be glad to see US engagement
with mainland China as long as it is helpful in maintaining peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in a meeting with visiting scholars from the
US at the Presidential Office in Taipei. The scholars, most of whom
are China experts, were attending the two-day "27th Sino-American
Conference on Contemporary China" which opened here on Monday.</P>
      <P>They were accompanied on their visit to the Presidential Office
by Shaw Yu-ming, director of the Institute of International Relations
under National Chengchi University, which sponsored the conference.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lee told his visitors that his government has
been pursuing a mainland China policy based on the spirit of "peace,
equality, rationality and goodness," which will eventually establish
a China under freedom, democracy and equal distribution of wealth.</P>
      <P>The policy includes promoting mutual understanding by means of
exchanges, and trying to eliminate hostility between Taiwan and
mainland China by forming mutually beneficial relations, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The president also said that the ROC expects interaction between
Washington and Beijing to be beneficial to the peace and stability of
the Asia-Pacific region, and expressed his optimism toward ROC-US
ties.</P>
      <P>Lee said he believes US President Bill Clinton, who is due to
take a mainland China trip in late June, should be aware of the ROC's
stance on the China issue.</P>
      <P>As to the trilateral interaction among Taiwan, mainland China and
the United States, Lee expressed the hope of developing peaceful and
mutually beneficial relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORD LIO HO CONSIDERS PRICE INCREASE ON IMPORTED CARS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 17 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Ford Lio Ho Motor Company Ltd. may
increase prices for its imported cars in July due to the increased
differential between Taiwan's falling currency exchange rate and
Ford's reported import exchange rate, Ford Lio Ho spokesman Hsu
Guo-Cheng said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hsu pointed out that a major round of devaluation in the local
currency in the second half of last year caused Ford Lio Ho to adjust
its reported import exchange rate from NT$27 to NT$31 to the
greenback to reflect the differential, which led to an upward
adjustment in its prices for imported cars.</P>
      <P>Now that that NT dollar has further devalued to NT$34 to the
greenback, the pressure on Ford Lio Ho has increased again, but the
company is worried that adjusting the price will only give consumers
cold feet and adversely affect sales, Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the major car importers are currently observing the
situation, with none wanting to be the first to raise prices, Hsu
said, adding that Ford Lio Ho will not be the first.</P>
      <P>The US Ford Group takes care of all maneuvers related to
shielding its global dealerships from exchange rate risk, Hsu said.
This gives Ford Lio Ho strong support so that it can afford to take
the pressure of the exchange rate differential better than others in
the industry.</P>

    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  June  17 (CNA)
(By Sherman Wu and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese dissidents have been
warned by public security officials not to go to the cities of
Beijing, Shanghai or Xian during the visit to mainland China by US
President Bill Clinton from June 27 to July 3, a Hong Kong-based
human rights organization said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the organization said the warning came after a
dissident from Qingdao in northern Shandong Province was sent back to
Qingdao on Wednesday morning after being detained for a night in the
capital by Beijing public security officials.</P>
      <P>Mou Chuanheng, who went to Beijing last week to visit friends,
was taken from his hotel on Monday night by local public security
forces, the spokesman said, adding that Mou was told that ranking
authorities had ordered that "sensitive elements" like him are not
allowed to stay in Beijing because of Clinton's upcoming visit to the
capital.</P>
      <P>As speculation is mounting that Clinton plans to talk to people
on the street while visiting Beijing, the spokesman pleaded with the
US president not to do so, saying that such action could bring
mainland dissidents under even heavier state scrutiny and control.</P>
      <P>Although it would be a well-intentioned gesture on the part of
the US president, the spokesman said, it could deprive the dissidents
of the freedom to visit friends or travel during the period of

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taoyuan County Magistrate Annette Lu said
on Wednesday that she has asked US President Bill Clinton not to
impair Taiwan's interests during his upcoming visit to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Lu, a former legislator from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), told the press that she met Clinton during
an evening party in San Francisco last Friday.</P>
      <P>"I took advantage of the occasion to present to Clinton a letter
signed by 10 Taiwan city mayors and county magistrates, which urged
Clinton not to make Taiwan a sacrifice of his summit meeting with
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin," Lu said.</P>
      <P>"After reading the letter, Clinton assured me that he fully
understands Taiwan's stance and will not do anything harmful to its
interests or dangerous to its security," the outspoken former
political prisoner added.</P>
      <P>The 10 local government chiefs, including Lu herself, said in
the letter that they are basic levels of elected officials and are
in constant touch with grassroots public opinion.</P>
      <P>"All of our people appreciate your sending two aircraft carrier
battle groups to help maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait in
March 1996 when communist China were conducting missile tests and
live-fire war games in the strait to intimidate us in the
run-up to Taiwan's first direct presidential election," the letter
said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, it added, the majority of Taiwan people think that
the US "one China" policy, which acknowledges there is only one China
and that Taiwan is part of China, is erroneous and dangerous. "We
hope the United States will revise its position based on the
reality."</P>
      <P>The letter further said all Taiwan people are concerned about
the forthcoming Clinton-Jiang summit meeting in Beijing, whose
agenda is certain to include the Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>It reminded Clinton not to throw his support behind Beijing's
overture to use a "one country, two systems" scheme to unify
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Although Beijing has used the formula to take over Hong Kong
from Britain, the format is not applicable to Taiwan. Taiwan is not
Hong Kong, which used to be a colony," the letter stressed.</P>
      <P>It went on to say Taiwan is more than willing to maintain
friendly, reciprocal relations with mainland China and all other
countries around the world on an equal footing.</P>
      <P>The letter called on Clinton to help push for peaceful
co-existence of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. "And you are
welcome to visit Taiwan at your pleasure."</P>
      <P>Except Lu, the nine other local government chiefs who signed
the letter were Hsinchu County Magistrate Lin Kuang-hua,
Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yu Cheng-hsien, Taichung County
Magistrate Liao Yung-lai, Ilan County Magistrate Liu Shou-cheng,
Hsinchu City Mayor Tsai Jen-chien, Pingtung County Magistrate Su
Chia-chuan, Tainan County Magistrate Chen Tang-shan, Chiayi City
Mayor Chang Po-ya and Nantou County Magistrate Peng Pai-hsien.</P>
      <P>Because of her busy schedule, Lu said she couldn't have asked
other mayors and county chiefs to sign the letter.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  16  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A delegation of 19 Republic of China
legislators told a Washington press conference on Tuesday that they
were in the US to state the position of the 21 million people of
Taiwan that the rights and interests of Taiwan should not be affected
by President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to mainland China and his
summit talks with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Legislator Rau Yin-chi, the delegation leader, noted in a joint
statement that the basic consensus and position of the people of
Taiwan are:</P>
      <P>-- "The Republic of China on Taiwan is a sovereign state. The
destiny of the 21 million citizens of Taiwan should be decided by
themselves. We believe that the US will not harm Taiwan's interests;
however, we are worried that during the Clinton-Jiang summit, the PRC
will pressure the US to advocate positions that may be detrimental to
Taiwan;</P>
      <P>-- "We firmly oppose any bilateral negotiations between the US
and the PRC regarding our country's affairs, and under no
circumstances will we accept any stipulations and/or agreements
concerning Taiwan reached by the US and the PRC;</P>
      <P>-- "Since peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is not only of
critical importance to Taiwan's future but also affects vital
American strategic interests, we hope that the US will urge the PRC
to renounce the use of force against the ROC on Taiwan;</P>
      <P>-- "With Taiwan's strong economic power, it should be able to
contribute even more to the international community. We therefore
would like to join more international organizations and play a more
active role in them; and</P>
      <P>-- "We hope the US will exercise its influence to prevent the
Asian financial crisis from spreading to other parts of the region
and affecting the stability, prosperity, and order of the world
economy."</P>
      <P>Yao added their hopes that the summit will help build stability
in the Taiwan Strait and the Asia-Pacific region as a whole. However,
he added: "It is imperative that any improvement in the relationship
between the United States and the PRC should not be made at the cost
of Taiwan's interests, nor should it negatively affect our relations
with the United States.</P>
      <P>"The ROC Legislative Yuan appreciates the long-term support and
assistance from the United States and especially House Resolution
270, which the House of Representatives passed by an overwhelming
majority of 411 votes to zero, suggesting that President Clinton urge
Beijing to publicly renounce the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This resolution shows that the people of both the US and the ROC
agree that problems between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
be resolved in a peaceful manner," the ROC legislator noted.</P>

      <P>It is possible that current ROC President
Lee Teng-hui and Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian will run together in the
2000 presidential election, said Jaw Shau-kong, general campaign
manager of the opposition New Party, on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Jaw made the remarks in a press conference at the Legislative
Yuan Wednesday morning. He suggested that Lee, chairman of the ruling
Kuomintang, and Chen, a member of the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party, could forge an alliance.</P>
      <P>"Politics is an art of possibility, and there is nothing
impossible," said Jaw, a former legislator who once headed the
Environmental Protection Administration and ran for Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>Jaw predicted President Lee will seek re-election and said that
even if Chen is re-elected mayor of Taipei, no law prohibits a vice
president of the Republic of China from serving concurrently as a
mayor of a municipality under the central government.</P>
      <P>Although Lee and Chen belong to different political parties, both
wield considerable influence. A Lee-Chen ticket stands a good chance
of winning the election, Jaw said.</P>
      <P>Jaw said both men are friendly toward each other. Moreover, he
said he doubts Lee's support for Ma Ying-jeou's bid for Taipei mayor.</P>
      <P>If Lee and Chen were to run together in the next election and
Chen were elected vice president, the next step for Chen would be a
presidential bid in the 2004 election, Jaw said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Richard Delgaudio, chairman of
the Center of National Security of the United States has confirmed
that the US is concerned about the presence of the Chinese communists
in Panama.</P>
      <P>Delgaudio, who headed a delegation on a week-long visit to
Panama, told a news conference on Monday that Washington is worried
about the transition of the Panama Canal. As the United States
prepares to pull out of Panama, it appears that Chinese communists
are beginning to infiltrate the country, he added.</P>
      <P>"This event has not only (caused worry among) Americans but also
Panamanians. The economics and the security of both (the US and
Panama) are tied to the correct administration and the security of
the Panama Canal," he said.</P>
      <P>After he and his delegation conducted investigations, Delgaudio
confirmed that the Chinese communists have been attempting to control
the Panama Canal through the Hong Kong-based Hutchison group. Panama
conceded the administration of the Balboa and Cristobal ports to
Hutchison for 22 years with a 10-year option.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese communists are infiltrating Panama by means of
Hutchison while the US interests are pulling out," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>Delgaudio, the author of book entitled "The Death Knell of the
Panama Canal," said American interests in the Panama Canal have not
only not been protected but also been sold to the Chinese communists
by Perez Balladares' administration.</P>
      <P>"Only the presence of the United States in military bases and
ports of the Panama Canal can guarantee a promising future which
complete all expectations.</P>
      <P>"The transition of the canal, the presence of Chinese communists
and stability of workers had been demonstrated to both Americans and
Panamanians as a great uncertainty," he concluded.</P>

      <P>Japan's Mazda Co. on Wednesday announced
that it is transferring the Taiwan dealership for Mazda automobiles,
with the exception of its T-series of vans, from Taiwan Mazda to Ford
Lio Ho Motor Company, one of the largest car traders on the island.</P>
      <P>Bunzo Suzuki, senior project manager for the overseas sales

Taipei, accompanied by representatives from all three companies.</P>
      <P>He explained that the decision for the move which will go into

business competition in Taiwan, and this competition is expected to
increase even more once the island enters the World Trade
Organization.</P>
      <P>More importantly, Suzuki said, his company wishes to increase its
market share by taking advantage of Ford Lio Ho's complete sales

    <HEADLINE>CHENG HOLDS ONTO HIS JOB -- FOR NOW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan is not considering a job
transfer for Cheng Chuan, acting director of the Investigation
Bureau, despite the fact that he is currently in hot water over a
rape allegation, an Executive Yuan official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Chang You-hui, secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, said that
Cheng will remain in his job pending the result of an independent
investigation into the allegation.</P>
      <P>However, he added that if the investigation substantiates the
accusation that Cheng sexually molested a friend's daughter in Paris,
then the Executive Yuan will begin to consider whether to keep Cheng,
and who to appoint as his likely successor if he steps down.</P>
      <P>Cheng openly gave his side of the story when he finally appeared
on Tuesday before a four-member team, headed by Vice Justice Minister
Chiang Hao, which was formed to get to the bottom of the matter.</P>
      <P>He defended his reputation, saying that he was only trying to
cure the daughter of his friend Yang Wan-shou with Chikung, a
traditional martial art which is believed to have curative powers.</P>
      <P>He denied categorically any wrongdoing with the girl, then 19 and
suffering from anorexia nervosa, countering claims by her parents
that he touched her breast and private parts under the pretext of
helping to cure her in his Paris hotel room.</P>
      <P>Cheng said he will step down after the investigation is closed,
pointing out that if he leaves now, it might be seen as a tacit
admission of guilt.</P>
      <P>But many questions remain unanswered as the drama develops into a
"Rashomon-style" scenario, with the accuser and the accused each
giving their own conflicting accounts of the events surrounding the
case, as in the famous movie of that name by Japanese director Akira
Kurosawa.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Justice has even considered sending officials to
Paris to collect information relating to the case in order to help
find answers to the outstanding questions.</P>
      <P>Although speculation has been rampant about the removal of Cheng
from his post, and about his likely successor, the Executive Yuan has
been cautious about commenting on the case.</P>
      <P>The case first surfaced when Lai Ching-lin, a National
Assemblyman of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, accused
Cheng of molesting the daughter of a friend during a trip to the
French capital between Sept. 9 and 13, 1996.</P>
      <P>Lai claimed that he was asked to come forward to expose Cheng
after the government allegedly failed to respond to Yang's repeated
demands for an investigation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VIRAL OUTBREAK CLAIMS ANOTHER LIFE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The enterovirus epidemic that has swept
Taiwan since mid-February claimed the life of another young child on
Wednesday, bringing the death toll to 41 babies and toddlers around
the island, health officials said.</P>
      <P>The latest victim was a three-year-old girl who died at the
Changhua Christian Hospital in central Taiwan early in the morning.
Doctors said the girl first received treatment for high fever at the
hospital four days ago and was hospitalized again on Tuesday
evening. Despite intensive care, the girl still failed to regain
consciousness and died at 2 a.m. Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a pediatrician at the Chung Shan Medical and Dental
College Hospital said immunoglobulin has proved to be an effective
pharmaceutical to treat enteroviral infection.</P>
      <P>Shen Ke-huan, director of the Chung Shan hospital's pediatrics
department, said the conditions of seven seriously ill enteroviral
patients have imrpoved significantly after receiving injections of
immunoglobulin.</P>
      <P>Parents of those children, however, said the drug is too
expensive. The current National Health Insurance Program does not
offer coverage to immunoglobulin. Some city and county
health offices offer financial subsidies to newborn babies who have
to receive injections of the drug. Nevertheless, the privilege is
only extended to babies younger than one month.</P>
      <P>Chan Chi-hsien, director of the Department of Health (DOH),
made an inspection tour of the Bureau of Health under the Taipei City
Government on Wednesday to show his concern about the city's
measures to cope with the enteroviral outbreak.</P>
      <P>Chan said the DOH will encourage all local hospitals to help
monitor the outbreak of any epidemic. "Reports on major epidemics
will be listed as one of factors to measure the performance of local
hospitals in the future," he added.</P>
      <P>The country's top health official further said the DOH is
considering developing a vaccine to help curb the spread of
the epidemic now that a complete pathological autopsy has confirmed
that enterovirus type-71 is the culprit of the recent wave of
contagion.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chan said there are still many problems to be
addressed before making a decision on whether to develop such a
vaccine.</P>
      <P>"First and foremost, we must consider the safety of the vaccine.
Secondly, we must further study the tendency of the enteroviral
outbreak," Chan noted.</P>
      <P>Tu Hsin-tze, director of the Taipei municipal Bureau of Health,
said a total of 2,641 cases of entervirus infections were discovered
in the city from June 5 through June 16. Among those patients, 267
were hospitalized. "About half of these patients were Taipei
residents, while the remaining half came from other cities or
counties to receive treatment," he said, adding that the death toll
in Taipei stood at four so far.</P>
      <P>Tu further said the peak of the epidemic was already over
in Taipei. "The number of patients has gradually declined
in recent days," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, some medical doctors predicted that the current viral
epidemic probably will continue until August or September.</P>
      <P>Children under five years of age are most susceptible to
enterovirus, and common symptoms of an infection include a fever and
rash with ulcers on the hands, feet and mouth.</P>
      <P>The death rate of the infection is not high if patients receive
timely proper treatment. To protect their children from
infection, parents are advised to keep their children away from
crowded public places, and make sure that children change clothes and
wash hands frequently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRADE AND INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OPPOSE NATIONAL PENSION SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  17 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Local trade and industry organizations on
Wednesday issued a joint statement, protesting a possible increase in
the business tax rate to support a proposed national pension system.</P>
      <P>By increasing the business tax rate from 5 percent to 6 percent,
the consumer price index will rise 0.65 percent, while economic
growth will be reduced by 0.2 percent, according to the statement.
The increase will seriously affect the island's industrial
development, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The General Chamber of Commerce of the Republic Of China, the
Chinese National Federation of Industries and the Chinese National
Association of Industry and Commerce suggested in the statement that
the government reduce spending, impose additional taxes on tobacco
and wine or create a national lottery to generate funds for the
pension plan, slated to go into effect by the end of 1999.</P>
      <P>The statement further criticized the government for ushering in
the plan fast on the heels of the national health insurance program,
which was introduced in 1995. The experience of developed countries
shows the introduction of such systems should be spaced at least 10
years apart, according to the statement. Moreover, people do not have
a clear enough picture of the contents of the pension plan, similar
to some countries' social security programs.</P>
      <P>The system will apply to people who are not covered by existing
pension programs for servicemen, government employees and the
workforce, according to the Executive Yuan task force in charge of
devising the plan. Ultimately, all current pension plans will be
absorbed into the proposed national plan after such a plan is
approved by the Legislative Yuan. The bill stipulates regulations
governing the national pension system will be sent to the legislators
for approval in the first half of next year.</P>
      <P>If the system takes effect in 1999 as proposed, monthly premiums
for that year will be NT$910 per person. The government will provide
subsidies of NT$182 for workers, NT$655 for government employees and
NT$364 for people who are unemployed. Employers will be required to
contribute NT$582 for each employee, while workers must pay NT$146
each. Government employee, meanwhile, must pay NT$255.</P>
      <P>The government must come up with nearly NT$44 billion in its 1999
budget to fund the plan, although the proposed increase in the
business tax rate would generate an estimated NT$32.5 billion of that
amount.</P>
      <P>Monthly pension payments will amount to NT$9,100 per person,
provided that person has contributed to the fund for a period of 40
years. Others will be paid amounts relative to the amount of time
they have been paying into the fund.</P>
      <P>Under the plan people begin contributing to the fund at the age
of 25 and cannot withdraw a pension until they reach 65. However,
they can, at that point, continue paying into the fund and receive
larger payments at a later date.</P>
      <P>Anyone seriously injured or killed during the time he is
contributing to the fund or receiving pension payments from it is
entitled to a compensation payment. In the case of death, the payment
will be made to the family of the deceased.</P>
      <P>Once the plan is introduced, anyone over 65 years old who has
never received a pension payment under another system will be
entitled to a monthly stipend of some NT$2,000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FISHERMEN OPPOSE CUTTING TARIFFS FOR FISHERY PRODUCTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 17 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Scores of representatives from the fishery
industry went to the Ministry of Economic Affairs Wednesday to
express their discontent over possible reductions in tariffs on
fishery products.</P>
      <P>The representatives, led by Legislator Shih Tai-sheng of the
ruling Kuomintang, met with Board of Foreign Trade Director-General
Chen Juei-lung Wednesday. The group said they will call a press
conference soon to highlight their opposition to the possible
reductions.</P>
      <P>The protest comes before a trade ministerial meeting of Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuching, Malaysia from June 21
to 23. A Taiwan delegation, led by Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang,
will leave Saturday to attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>The meeting will center on voluntary liberalization measures in
nine areas: environmental protection, energy, forestry, toys,
jewelry, medical equipment, telecommunications, chemicals and fishery
products.</P>
      <P>APEC members will discuss a goal of cutting tariffs on more than
3,000 products in the aforementioned categories to zero or nearly
zero by 2005.</P>
      <P>BOFT officials have said Taiwan supports the liberalization
measures in principle, though it is less committed to an early
tariff reductions in the sensitive area of fishery products.</P>
      <P>The Council of Agriculture, meanwhile, has said Taiwan will cut
the average tariffs on fishery products from the current level of
27.9 percent to 20.5 percent within the first year of Taiwan's entry
to the World Trade Organization, with further annual reductions to
follow.</P>

      <P>Vice President Lien Chan welcomed on
Wednesday last year's Nobel winner in economics, Dr. Robert C.
Merton, at Lien's office.</P>
      <P>Lien told the visiting Nobel laureate that in line with a
worldwide trend toward economic liberalization and globalization,
Taiwan has been building the island into a regional operations hub
that includes manufacturing, ocean transportation, air freight,
financial, telecommunications and mass media centers.</P>
      <P>The vice president said Taiwan's efforts to join the World Trade
Organization have made great progress, as Taiwan has reached
agreements on entry terms with almost all of the WTO members that
requested trade talks with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lin stressed that Taiwan aims to make itself into a unique
financial center in Asia-Pacific region, saying it will not

(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singaporeans spent a record S$5.5
billion (about US$3.4 billion) on gambling and sweepstakes in the
last fiscal year, and regional economic turmoil has not dampened
their enthusiasm for gambling so far this year.</P>
      <P>Both Singapore Pools Co. and the Singapore Turf Club reported
strong first quarter earnings. The Turf Club had one of its strongest
quarters ever in the first three months of this year, with
horse racing and the 4-D lottery taking in a combined S$626 million.</P>
      <P>The last fiscal year has been the best to date for legal
gambling in Singapore. Figures did not include bets placed with
illegal gambling syndicates and in casinos around the region.</P>
      <P>Singapore's favorite game of chance is still 4-D, which drew in
more than S$3 billion in the last fiscal year. Horse racing came in
second with S$1.37 billion, up from $1.26 billion in 1996.</P>
      <P>Next came slot machines, which collected S$561 million, about

    <HEADLINE>TIMES URGES BEIJING NOT TO DEVALUE ITS CURRENCY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, June 17 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The latest threat to the currencies of Asia
comes not from a political crisis or a faltering International
Monetary Fund program but from Japan.</P>
      <P>"The fall of the yen against the dollar is prompting speculation
that China, which so far has been firm against the crisis, may
devalue the renminbi," an influential European newspaper said.</P>
      <P>Recent statements by mainland Chinese officials have fueled this
fear by appearing to soften the country's no-devaluation line. But
mainland China is well aware of the dangers of devaluing its
currency, the Financial Times said.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is suffering from the fallout of the Asian
crisis. Exports dropped by 1.5 percent year-on-year in May,
threatening the government's economic growth target of 8 percent.</P>
      <P>"But a devaluation now could be economically and politically
disastrous. With markets still in a fragile state, it could easily
knock the Hong Kong dollar from its peg, and spark a new round of
devaluations," the Financial Times said.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese Premier Zhou Rongji has called currency
stability a main pillar of his economic policy; a devaluation would
undermine his authority and hold up the reform process. Also at risk
would be the enhanced international influence that mainland China's
currency policy has generated.</P>
      <P>A devaluation may not even be necessary, though. Mainland China
remains the second-cheapest place to manufacture in Asia. The
weakness of the yen may deter investment from Japan into mainland
China. But its effects on trade should be limited, as the countries
have very different export patterns, the Financial Times said.</P>
      <P>"China's policy has so far helped to prevent a serious worsening
of the crisis, and has brought the country further into the
international fold. A devaluation would reverse this, and would
damage the long-term stability of the region," according to The
Times.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAISUGAR NOT SHIFTING AUSTRALIAN OPERATIONS DUE TO 'ONE NATION' WIN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar) has never
considered relocating its investment in Australia from one province
to another because of possible victory by the One Nation Party,
Taisugar Chairman Chien Ping-tsai said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chien said there is no reason for Taisugar to move its
investments in Queensland to New South Wales (NSW) even if the One
Nation Party wins in the Australian state elections in August.</P>
      <P>The One Nation Party, often called racist, anti-Asian and
anti-multiculturalism, is expected to win between nine and 12 seats
at the Queensland Legislative Assembly. The victory could give the
party, headed by independent member of Parliament Pauline Hanson, the
balance of power in Queensland, political observers said.</P>
      <P>Chien said Taisugar maintains its investment operations in both
Queensland and NSW, and new investment projects are underway in the
two provinces.</P>
      <P>Investment in NSW consists mainly of a beef company, with joint
investment from Taisugar, Taiwan Pineapple Corp., and a number of
Australian corporations. Taisugar holds 45 percent of the company
shares, according to Chien.</P>
      <P>Investments in Queensland include a hog farm, slaughterhouse and
a feed and pharmaceutical plant, he added.</P>
      <P>Chien's remarks come amid reports from Australia that a possible
victory by the One Nation Party may affect investments and businesses
financed by people from Taiwan, Hong Kong and mainland China.</P>
      <P>"Clearly it is a major concern not just from Taiwan not to invest
in Australia, but any investment from overseas is certain to have the
same view," Mark Peterson, chief executive of the Australian Chamber
of Commerce and Industry recently said in Australia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC CONCERNED ABOUT RISE OF ONE NATION PARTY IN AUSTRALIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is concerned about
the rise of the anti-Asian One Nation Party in Australia, a senior
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>"We are concerned about the success of the anti-immigration,
protectionist One Nation Party in last Saturday's Queensland state
parliamentary election," MOFA spokesman Roy Wu told the press.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ministry is paying close attention to the
developments in Australia, Wu said the ROC would not like to see
Australian local politics, national policy or platforms of any of its
political parties affect the interests and safety of Taiwan nationals
who have traveled Down Under for business, investment, sightseeing or
study.</P>
      <P>Wu said the ROC has maintained close, mutually beneficial
relations with Australia despite the absence of formal diplomatic
ties. The ROC is currently Australia's seventh largest trading
partner. In 1997, two-way trade between the two countries reached
US$5 billion, with Australia posting a more than US$1.3 billion trade
surplus.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu said, there are some 20,000 ROC expatriates in
Australia, including more than 2,100 youths studying there. Direct
Taiwan investment in Australia well exceeds US$300 million.</P>
      <P>The One Nation Party's showing sent shock waves through
Australian politics after it won a quarter of the seats in the
89-member Queensland state parliament, much of it taken from Prime
Minister John Howard's conservative coalition parties.</P>
      <P>The maverick party opposes immigration and special welfare
benefits for aborigines, and advocates protectionist economic
policies.</P>
      <P>Wu said although the One Nation Party's positions reflect views
of some Queensland residents, they neither represent Australia's
general public opinion nor its government policy.</P>
      <P>"In our view, the party's platform violates the prevailing world
trend," Wu said, adding that in the post-Cold War era, the
internationally accepted norms are democracy, freedom and human
rights.</P>
      <P>"Nowadays, nearly all countries are pursuing multicultural,
pluralistic developments and working hard to promote harmony and
cooperation among different racial groups," Wu noted.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on Thursday released a position paper to reiterate the Republic
of China's opposition to Beijing's "one country, two system" proposal
on reunification.</P>
      <P>The MAC, Taiwan's top agency in charge of formulating policies on
mainland China, said in the paper the "one country, two systems"
formula imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong cannot be applied to Taiwan
because the ROC on Taiwan is a sovereign state, not a former colony
like Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>The ROC government maintains sovereign diplomacy in the
international community and its own national defensive systems at
home, while Hong Kong did not, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The ROC is a democratic nation, with its people deciding the
future of the country. Comparatively, the Hong Kong people cannot
decide their own future, the position paper said.</P>
      <P>It said China should be reunified under a democratic system in
the future. Only under a democratic system can both sides of the
Taiwan Strait strictly adhere to the agreements of reunification
reached between them, it stressed.</P>
      <P>Only under a democratic system can Taiwan, Macao, Hong Kong and
mainland China peacefully reunify avoiding the formation of an
alliance which could threaten security and peace in Asia, it said.</P>

      <P>US President Bill Clinton has decided
not to meet with dissidents or their families during his upcoming

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An increasing number of local businesses
are investing in countries which impose no or relatively low taxes on
foreign investments, a survey released Thursday by the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MOEA) showed.</P>
      <P>A total of 333 overseas investment applications were approved by
the authorities in the first five months of this year, with the total
value of investments reaching US$1.24 billion, up 45 percent from the
same period last year, the survey results indicate.</P>
      <P>Almost 66 percent of investments went to the Central America's
British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands, while 14.53 percent went
to the United States.</P>
      <P>The survey results confirm that under a global trend of financial
liberalization, local capital tends to flow out toward areas where
tax privileges are granted to investors, as is the case in Central
America, the survey said.</P>
      <P>According to the tallies, 84.76 percent of the approved overseas
investments were launched in the following sectors: financial
assurance, electric and electronic applications, basic metal
manufacturing, retail and wholesale business, as well as foreign
trade.</P>
      <P>In addition to the previously mentioned areas, Vietnam and
Thailand are also attracting Taiwan investments, the survey showed.</P>
      <P>As to other Southeast Asian countries, such as Indonesia, the
Philippines and Malaysia, which had been ideal investing spots of
Taiwanese businesses, the figures indicate these countries have lost
their appeal for investors because of the regional financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Registered investments in those three nations from Taiwan plunged
by over 70 percent in the first five months of 1998.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in May, the MOEA approved 73 applications for overseas
investments valued at over US$261 million, the statistics indicated.</P>
      <P>Tycoons Group Enterprise has applied to invest some US$67 million

    <HEADLINE>NT DOLLAR TO APPRECIATE WITH STABLE YEN: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The New Taiwan dollar will likely continue
its rebound to between NT$32 and NT$33 to the greenback following
Wednesday's Japan-US joint intervention to shore up the yen, said Yin
Nai-ping, a professor of banking at National Chengchi University.</P>
      <P>The intervention does not imply that Japan's economic problems
are over, however. Yin said the move can only buy more time for Japan
to reform its financial and economic systems and temporarily prevent
the economic situation in other Southeast Asian countries from
worsening.</P>
      <P>Wire services reported that the joint intervention agreement
between US President Bill Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto helped boost the yen to the 137-level. The NT dollar
reacted favorably to the news and continued its rebound.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank of China's intervention in the Taiwan currency
exchange market in the past few days has helped stabilize the NT
dollar to around the NT$35 psychological support level, Yin said. He
predicted this combined with the Japan-US joint intervention in the
yen would give the NT dollar a lift.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Yin noted that if the CBC takes the opportunity to
give the NT dollar another boost, the local currency may quickly
return to between NT$32 and NT$33.</P>
      <P>Yin explained that the continued devaluation of the yen is a
major threat to the United States in the world market. The United
States has been relying on its strong domestic economy while it waits
for Tokyo to come up with effective measures to reinvigorate the
Japanese economy.</P>
      <P>Washington had taken the opportunity to urge Tokyo to accelerate
its pace in opening up its markets, Yin said. Now that Japan has made
some concessions, the Japan-US joint intervention was made possible,
he added.</P>
      <P>Yin estimated the US government spent approximately US$2 billion
to US$3 billion in the intervention, noting that the United States is
waiting for Japan to carry out further economic reforms.</P>
      <P>Substantial effects of any Japanese economic reform packages will
not be obvious for another six months, and whether signs of recovery
will continue to appear in the short term remains to be seen, Yin
said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's third-largest maker of integrated
circuits, Winbond Electronics Corp., on Thursday marked the opening
of its fourth silicon wafer manufacturing plant in Hsinchu's
Science-based Industrial Park.</P>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan visited the facility and congratulated
Winbond on the plant's opening. Chan said he is pleased to see that
cooperation between Winbond and Japan's Toshiba has contributed to
Taiwan's technological advancement.</P>
      <P>The factory cost Winbond more than NT$25 billion (US$735 million)
and will be used to produce 64-megabyte Dynamic Random Access Memory
modules as small as 0.35 and 0.25 microns. A single micron is about
one-one hundredth the width of an average human hair.</P>
      <P>Initially the plant will turn out 8,000 0.25 micron wafers per
month, said a Winbond spokesperson. By year's end, the facility's
production capacity is expected to more than double to 15,000 wafers
per month.</P>
      <P>The spokesperson added that Winbond will develop at its new plant
advanced wafers measuring only 0.2 microns. Silicon wafers increase
in efficiency as they shrink in size.</P>
      <P>Winbond, which first partnered itself with Toshiba several years

      <P>Winbond's 1997 revenue totaled NT$12.7 billion (US$374 million),

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER CALLS FOR CONTROL OF DEADLY INTESTINAL VIRUS EPIDEMIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday ordered
health officials to step up efforts to contain the spread of a
deadly intestinal viral epidemic that has claimed the lives of 43
young children throughout the island in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>Siew gave the directive after hearing a report on the
enterovirus outbreak by Chan Chi-hsien, director-general of the
Department of Health (DOH), at a weekly Cabinet meeting.</P>
      <P>Noting that the killer epidemic has caused great suffering for
parents whose children had died from enterovirus-triggered
complications, Siew urged health agnecies at central and local
levels to join forces and mobilize all medical resources to
control the contagion and minimize its damage.</P>
      <P>"Thanks to concerted efforts of the DOH and the medical
community, we have managed to detect the culprit of the contagion.
As the epidemic has not yet been controlled, we must continue
keeping high alert and studying the root cause of the outbreak,"
Siew said.</P>
      <P>The premier further said health authorities should develop an
effective epidemic reporting, prevention and treatment system in
order to allay fears of the general public and create a hygienic,
wholesome living environment.</P>
      <P>Siew also urged the DOH to launch a publicity campaign in
cooperation the Government Information Office and the Ministry of
Education to remind local parents to take precautionary measures to
protect their children from being infected by the intestinal virus.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Shieh Wun-ju, a Chinese-American epidemiologist with
the US Center for Disease Control (CDC), said the viral epidemic
is not over since casualties are still rising.</P>
      <P>Shieh further said the probability for the current epidemic to
infect adults is very low because most adults have been exposed to
the virus and have developed antibodies.</P>
      <P>Shieh also suggested that all local hospitals be required
to report any finding of viral outbreaks to the DOH instead
of disclosing related information to the press on their own to
avoid causing unnecessary panic or misunderstanding among the
general public.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-hsiung, acting director of the DOH's Bureau of
Communicable Disease Control, said the latest enterovirus-related
deaths involved girls aged nine and 12, indicating that the virus
could also attack older children. All other deaths involved
children younger than six.</P>
      <P>Among those afflicted, Hsu said, 174 children had developed
serious complications but had recovered or are recovering.</P>
      <P>A pathological autopsy on an eight-year-old girl has confirmed
that enterovirus type-71 was the culprit of her death. "Autopsies on
five other children suspected to have died of similar intestinal
viral infections have also been completed. One of them was
apparently not killed by the deadly virus. We are still examining
whether the virus had anything to do with the death of the remaining
four," Hsu reported.</P>
      <P>He further said no case of enterovirus infection has so far been
reported in several Taiwan-held offshore islands. Unconfirm reports
said a child suspected to contract the intestinal virus was
sent from the frontline island of Matsu to Taiwan for medical
treatment on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Infants and young children are most susceptible to enterovirus.
Early symptoms of the infection resemble the flu, with fever,
headache and vomiting. Ulcers or blisters in the mouth and a rash on
the palms and feet can also develop. Later, possible deadly
complications include encephalitis, meningitis and acute
inflammation of the hear muscle. Parents are advised to keep their
children away from public places, and make sure that their children
change clothes and wash hands frequently.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,   June   18  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Beijing-based "Economic Daily"
reported Thursday that the state-run enterprises of mainland China
suffered a total loss of 41.7 billion renminbi (yuan) in the first
four months of this year.</P>
      <P>Large and medium-sized state enterprises lost 32 billion yuan
during the period, or 77 percent of the total loss. One US dollar is
equal to 8.280 yuan.</P>
      <P>The loss of state-run industrial enterprises in the four-month
period amounted to 8.87 billion yuan, a jump of 31.6 percent over a
year earlier, the report said.</P>
      <P>The increase of their loss is attributable to the Asian financial
crisis, which has weakened the ability of many Asian countries to
import from mainland China, and to the devaluation of many Asian
currencies, which has sharpened the competition edge of these
countries in the mainland Chinese market.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Hong Kong-based Ming Pao Daily News Thursday
quoted a mainland Chinese financial official as predicting that the
interest rates of renminbi bank deposits will soon be lowered in
order to reduce the financial burden of enterprises in the country,
and to stimulate the economy.</P>
      <P>The interest rate of American dollar deposits in mainland China
has just been lowered to 4.875 percent as a prelude, the official

      <P>President Lee Teng-hui hosted an annual tea

promote environmental protection in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The group was accompanied to the party by Interior Minister Huang
Chu-wen, Vice Education Minister Lee Chien-shin and Tsai
Hsung-hsiung, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Administration under the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>The world's rapid population growth and economic development have
quickly depleted natural resources and caused substantial
environmental damage, Lee said, adding that the resource depletion
and environmental degradation are affecting people's quality of life.</P>
      <P>This had made environmental protection an important topic for the
international community, Lee said. Multinational cooperation has
resulted in concrete measures being taken to protect the environment,
he said.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has not only included environmental
protection as a basic national policy in its constitution but has
also drafted a "State Environmental Protection Plan" that will bring 
Taiwan into the 21st century.</P>
      <P>Lee expressed his respect and admiration to the party's
honorees, including school teachers, community representatives,
volunteer workers, members of government ageincies and activists, 
for their efforts to promote environmental protection. They serve as
an example to society, he said.</P>
      <P>Effective environmental protection is an indication of a nation's
efforts to modernize itself, Lee said. Government agencies, however,
cannot do the work alone; public support and participation is
required as well, he said.</P>

      <P>The Republic of China would like to see
Hong Kong remain stable and prosperous, an official of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman Lin Chung-ping made the remarks to coincide
with the first anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese
sovereignty under the "one country, two systems" formula.</P>
      <P>Lin said that not only is Hong Kong an important trade partner of
Taiwan, it has also played a major role as an intermediary in
cross-Taiwan Strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the mainland authorities will make
good on their promises to allow Hong Kong people to run Hong Kong,
and to give the people of Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy.</P>
      <P>He stressed that a politically democratic, economically liberal
and legally sound Hong Kong, will not only help promote the
development of Hong Kong and the welfare of the Hong Kong people, it
will also help the growth and stability of the entire region,
including Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that although Hong Kong has in general fared well
over the past year, some problems have surfaced, including a slight
decline in government efficiency, especially as it relates to crisis
management.</P>
      <P>Economically, he said that as a result of the financial turmoil
in the region, Hong Kong has seen its stock market and real estate
market slump. Trade and investment, as well as tourism, have also
been hit severely.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong suffered negative economic growth in the first quarter
of this year, for the first time in 13 years.</P>
      <P>The international community has given generally favorable reviews
of Hong Kong since its reversion to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997, but
there is a perceived potential risk regarding the maintenance of
freedom, democracy and rule of law.</P>
      <P>Lin said it remains to be seen whether Beijing will go through
with its "one country, two systems" policy, and whether it will keep
its promise to allow Hong Kong to retain its status unchanged for
fifty years.</P>

the world's largest insurance market, with total premiums in the
region surpassing those of North America and the European Union.
Taiwan was the 14th-largest insurance market in the world, Siew
pointed out, adding that despite the Asian financial crisis, the

      <P>The premier said that for the government, maintaining discipline

      <P>China Airlines, Taiwan's largest carrier,
is expected to recover from a period of sluggish business, as the
airline, hard hit by a major crash in February, is quickly wooing
back customers, according to a report carried by the Economic Daily
News in its Thursday edition.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics made public by the Civil Aeronautics
Administration, the daily reported that of the 685,700 departures
from Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in May, 195,100
passengers, or 28.5 percent of the total, were traveling aboard CAL
flights.</P>
      <P>The ratio, which is very near the pre-February level of about 30
percent, is the highest level for the carrier since the mid-February
CAL crash which killed a total of 202 people, according to the
report. The tragedy was Taiwan's worst-ever air disaster.</P>
      <P>Industry sources attributed the noticeable surge in the company's
passenger load to the carrier's strategy of cutting prices. In March,
CAL round-trip tickets for destinations in Northeast and Southeast
Asian countries were selling at just NT$6,000 (about US$180),
prompting other aviation companies to follow suit.</P>

performance in the July-August high season, thus greatly boosting its

      <P>Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
told a press conference on Thursday that he will do his best to

    <DATELINE>Hong Kong, June 18 (CNA)
(By Stanley Cheung and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Most of Hong Kong's citizens hope for an
institutionalized relationship between Taiwan and the former British
colony, a recent survey has found.</P>
      <P>According to the survey carried out by the Hong Kong Center for
Studies on Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, 79 percent of the
respondents agreed that Taiwan and Hong Kong should exchange
representative offices. Only 8.7 percent voiced opposition to the
idea.</P>
      <P>The poll found that Hong Kong people are extremely vague on
Beijing's policy regarding Hong Kong-Taiwan ties, with 85 percent
saying they do not know of the "seven-point statement" released by
former mainland Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on the subject.</P>
      <P>Around 35 percent of Hong Kong residents said they think current
Hong Kong-Taiwan ties are looser than they were before the
territory's return to Beijing rule last July, while 32 percent said
they have seen few changes in bilateral relations, according to the
survey.</P>
      <P>However, nearly 50 percent said they remain optimistic about
future prospects of two-way exchanges with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Regarding Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula, 57
percent of the respondents said the scheme should also be implemented
in Taiwan if the practice works well in the territory, in contrast to
19 percent who do not think so, the survey pointed out.</P>
      <P>Some 35 percent opined that Taiwan and mainland China should
maintain the status-quo before the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
achieve eventual unification, while 12 percent expressed the wish for
an immediate unification of the two sides. A mere 1.9 percent said
they support Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Citing the results of the survey, the center said most of the

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING ACTS TO SUSTAIN EXPORTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fresh signs that Beijing's export growth
may slow sharply later this year are prompting the authorities to
consider measures to reinvigorate one of the main growth engines in
the national economy.</P>
      <P>One ominous sign, according to reports from the Geneva-based
World Trade Organization (WTO) on Thursday, is that new export
contracts rose by only 1.18 percent in the first four months of this
year, compared with the same period of a year ago.</P>
      <P>This is significantly lower than the 11.6 percent climb in total
exports, which itself was 15.3 percentage points lower than during
the first four months of 1997.</P>
      <P>Statistics on new contracts are not as faithful an indicator as
actual orders, but they nevertheless serve as a guide to future
demand. It takes several months for contracts to be translated into
export sales.</P>
      <P>The slowing growth in contracts was partly the result of keen
competition from Asian exporters who are starting to capitalize on
the sharp devaluation in their currencies, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>Devaluation of mainland China's renminbi has been ruled out by
Beijing's senior leadership, so authorities are intensifying efforts
to find other ways to stimulate exports, which last year contributed
about 20 percent of gross domestic product.</P>
      <P>Mainland China appears in need of a robust export performance as
the wider economy slows. Gross domestic product growth was 7.2
percent in the first quarter, down from 8.8 percent for the whole of
1997.</P>
      <P>The government's greatest fear is that slowing growth will
trigger social unrest as unemployment surges and pensions are
withheld from millions of retired people. Recent official statistics
show that by the end of March, 2.8 million pensioners were owed a
total US$562 million in pensions. Many have not received any welfare
for six months, the WTO report added.</P>

appeared in public with her long lost biological mother at the
Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB) on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Kartya Wunderle of Melbourne was accompanied by her adoptive
parents when she met with her birth mother, identified as Mrs.
Hsu, and older sister at the office of CIB Director Yang Tzu-ching.</P>
      <P>Kartya, who was adopted into the Wunderle family 17 years ago,
met her birth mother and sister for the first time on Tuesday after
DNA testing established their relationship.</P>
      <P>Their first meeting was shrouded in secrecy at Mrs. Hsu's

appear in public with her long lost second daughter.</P>
      <P>Both Mrs. Hsu and Kartya's adoptive parents thanked the CIB for
its assistance in making the happy reunion possible.</P>
      <P>Kartya was sold as an infant to an adoption broker by her
birth father for NT$36,000. Her biological parents were not married
and already had another daughter. Her birth father already died
several years ago.</P>
      <P>The baby girl was adopted by Orthma and Nola Wunderle in
Melbourne in 1981 through a Taiwanese agency, which was later
found to be an illegal ring selling young children abroad.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by her adoptive mother, Kartya arrived in Taiwan
earlier this month to seek her roots because she has long suffered
an "identity crisis."</P>
      <P>Her adoptive father, who arrived in Taipei on Wednesday to meet
Kartya's Taiwanese family, said he is delighted to see his daughter's

    <HEADLINE>NEW  TARIFF SYSTEM TO TAKE  EFFECT ON FRIDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 18 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A new list of lower duties on imports will
take effect on Friday, which will lighten the government coffers by
about NT$4.4 billion (US$129.41 million) per year, according to
Taiwan customs officials.</P>
      <P>However, the new tariff system will boost the development of
local industry and raise people's income, which will more than
compensate for the decrease in revenue, the officials pointed out.</P>
      <P>The new list is the result of two amendments to the current
tariff system, one in 1996, the other in 1997. Although presented to
the legislature one year apart, the two amendments were ratified
together in May.</P>
      <P>The 1996 amendment, which resulted from negotiations with
Australia, Norway, and New Zealand on Taiwan's bid to enter the World
Trade Organization (WTO), proposed to cut duty on 350 agricultural
products and 780 industrial products, reducing the average nominal
tariffs from 17.18 percent to 14.64 percent.</P>
      <P>The 1997 amendment, worked out in line with the WTO declaration
on the free flow of information industry products, lowers tariffs on
289 computer-related products with the aim of cutting duty in this
sector from the current 4.69 percent to zero under a four-phase
program.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance estimates that the 1996 proposal will
prune the government's income from tariffs by NT$2.67 billion
(US$78.52 million), while the 1997 proposal will scale it down by
about NT$1.8 billion (US$52.94 million).</P>
      <P>However, the officials noted that since the two amendments
overlap each other in some respects, the actual amount of revenue
reduction will be less than the two estimates combined.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan is opposed to the elimination of
tariffs on TV sets, video cameras, coaxial cables and printed circuit
boards (PCBs) by 2002, which, along with another 178 items, have been
targeted by the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the next round of
market liberalization, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Information Technology Agreement (ITA) committee under the
WTO will conduct a meeting in which ITA signatories will discuss the
elimination of tariffs on consumer electronic items and other
products, following its success in achieving tariff reductions by
2000 on 289 other information technology (IT) items.</P>
      <P>Taiwan was admitted as the 39th signatory of the ITA committee
last March, when the ROC government agreed to gradually cut tariffs
on 274 IT items to zero in four stages by 2000, beginning from July
1, 1998. Tariffs on another 15 items will not be completely removed
until 2002.</P>
      <P>As the ITA members hope to further promote the free flow of
information, electronics and other related products, a total of 15
signatories have proposed 400 more products to the ITA committee that
they wish to be declared tariff-free. Taiwan has suggested 13 items
to be included in the next round of tariff eliminations.</P>
      <P>The ITA committee has conducted a number of technology meetings
between February and June, during which they reached consensus that
tariffs on 182 items, including chemical products, consumer
electronics products, communications products, and PCB manufacturing
equipment, will be eliminated by 2002. The list will be presented for
further discussion by the ITA signatories at a meeting in late June.</P>
      <P>Liu Rong-chu, director of the Customs Administration Department
under the MOF, said that Taiwan will demand at the upcoming meeting
that TV sets, video cameras, coaxial cables and PCBs be excluded from
the proposed list, or at least that the timetable for the four items
should be extended to 2007.</P>
      <P>Liu said that in general, Taiwan supports the proposal that
tariffs on the rest of the items on the list be gradually cut to zero
by Jan. 1, 2002 in four stages, beginning from Jan. 1, 1999.</P>
      <P>According to Liu, the ITA members have differing opinions
regarding the elimination of tariffs on consumer electronic products.
The European Union and many developing countries are opposed, while
the attitude of the United States is still unknown.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington, June 18 (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis has not only
deflated US exports this year but also raised US deficits with the
four "Asian tigers" by a factor of 20, results of the latest Commerce
Department tallies showed.</P>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis, which began to loom large in the
second half of last year, has pushed down US sales to the region by
10.5 percent for the first four months of this year. With most Asian
currencies depreciating, the United States overall trade deficit shot
up to US$48.7 billion for the period, 38.4 percent higher than its
year-earlier level.</P>
      <P>Deficits with Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea
totaled a whopping US$6.39 billion, 20.8 times the combined deficits'
year-earlier levels, according to the Commerce Department report.</P>
      <P>Among the four tigers, the United States witnessed a
roller-coaster rise and fall in trade with South Korea -- its US$1.9
billion surplus during the first fourth months of 1997 turning into a
deficit of US$2.6 billion during the same period one year later.</P>
      <P>The United States deficit with Singapore, meanwhile, soared 78
percent, while its deficit with Taiwan rose 10.2 percent. Deficits
with Japan and mainland China, the United States' two largest deficit
sources, rose 13.3 percent and 19.8 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>In April alone, the United States' goods and services deficit
posted a single-month record high of US$14.5 billion, mainly because
of sluggish exports to Asia.</P>
      <P>The Clinton administration has grown concerned that consumer
confidence could be rattled if the Asian crisis spreads outside the

      <P>In an effort to contain the crisis, President Bill Clinton has
recently authorized the sale of dollars in currency markets to stem a
free-fall in the value of the Japanese yen, a slide that threatened
to prompt a second round of currency devaluations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC REITERATES ROC SHOULD NOT BE PUT AT RISK</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 19 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council reiterated on
Friday Taiwan's opposition to any deals that might be made during the
upcoming meeting between US President Bill Clinton and mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin that could put the Republic of China at
risk.</P>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, spokesman and vice chairman of the Cabinet-level
MAC, which formulates Taiwan's policies on mainland China, said
Clinton and Jiang should not discuss the so-called "three noes," --
no Taiwan independence, no "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan"
and no United Nations membership for Taiwan -- at the summit, nor
should they produce any written agreements or understandings on the
matter.</P>
      <P>Responding to speculation that Beijing may ask the United States
to cease arms sales to Taiwan, Sheu said Washington has repeatedly
assured Taipei that the summit will not produce any surprises to
Taiwan or changes in US policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The ROC's termination of the Period of National Mobilization for
Suppression of the Communist Rebellion in 1991 signifies the ROC
government's determination not to use force to settle differences
across the Taiwan Strait, Sheu said.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, Sheu added, the Beijing authorities have not
likewise renounced the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is entitled to defensive weapons to safeguard its
security, Sheu said, since mainland China continues to pose a
military threat to the island and because it has stepped up efforts
to isolate Taiwan diplomatically.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FORMER EBRD PRESIDENT DE LAROSIERE HONORED BY ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  June  18 (CNA)
(By Mark Ou)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Jacques de Larosiere, former president of
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, received the
ROC's Order of Brilliant Star with Grand Cordon on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The award was conferred upon de Larosiere by Louis Wen-hua Tzen,
Taipei's representative to the United Kingdom, on behalf of the ROC
government.</P>
      <P>De Larosiere served as EBRD president from September 1993 to
January 1998 and has also served as managing director of the
International Monetary Fund.</P>
      <P>Tzen said de Larosiere's friendship to the Republic of China was
unfailing during his tenure as IMF director and during his EBRD
presidency. As EBRD president, de Larosiere enabled Taipei to enter
into meaningful cooperation with the London-based bank, Tzen said.</P>
      <P>Tzen reaffirmed Taipei's commitment to the bank, saying it will
continue to play a positive role through EBRD's programs for the
development of countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.</P>
      <P>As part of its commitment, the ROC recently agreed to contribute
an additional US$5 million to a joint Taipei-EBRD technical
assistance fund to which Taipei had already contributed US$15
million. The agreement was signed during EBRD's annual conference
this year in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.</P>
      <P>Taipei has also contributed another US$20 million to a fund
designed for small- and medium-sized enterprises in Belorussia and to
a special investment fund.</P>
      <P>Although Taipei attended the annual EBRD conference as an
observer, de Larosiere called Taiwan the bank's best non-member. The
bank was established in 1991 to help Eastern European and Central
Asian countries transform their economies from planned to market
ones.</P>
      <P>Taipei has been extremely helpful in contributing to the joint
technical assistance fund, de Larosiere said. In fact, Taipei has
helped EBRD more than EBRD has helped Taipei, de Larosiere said after
receiving the ROC honor.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,   June   19  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Danish designer of Sydney's
best-known international landmark, its opera house, has urged the
Australian government to place his masterpiece on the list of World
Heritage-protected buildings.</P>
      <P>Joern Utzon, who designed the Sydney Opera House, made the plea
to an Australian documentary film team at his home in Hellebaek,
Denmark. The government must act quickly to meet the June 30 deadline
for listing the building with World Heritage, Utzon said.</P>
      <P>"Please listen to me, Canberra," Utzon was quoted as saying in a
story in the mass-circulation The Australian on Friday.</P>
      <P>"This is an Australian building that should be cared for, at this
important time in Australian history when your country is at the end
of the colony of Australia and at the beginning of the Republic of
Australia," he said.</P>
      <P>"The spirit of this building is independent of anything anywhere.
It is 100 percent Australian. This (the listing) and the year 2000
fit beautifully together. Then you can hear beautiful music all the
time in the future from a clean, beautifully kept building," he said,
adding "Please tell them in Canberra -- help."</P>
      <P>Utzon was being filmed for a documentary titled "The Edge of the
Possible," in which he tells the story behind the opera house's
design and construction, as well as his departure from the project in
1966, years before the building was completed.</P>
      <P>The documentary will be screened by the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation in October.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Opera House is popular not only among residents of
Sydney, New South Wales and other Australian states but also among
foreign guests and travelers who have visited Sydney.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BANGKOK  WORRIES  OVER  A DEVALUED RENMINBI'S IMPACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thailand is deeply worried that a
devaluation of the Chinese renminbi would inevitably lead to a
slowdown in Thai exports, an article released by the public relations
department of the Prime Ministry of Thailand said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Major Thai and Chinese export markets include the United States,
Japan, the European Union, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan and
Singapore," the department said in its June 18 "Thailand News
Bulletin." Some 70 percent of Thai exports go to these seven markets,
the government said.</P>
      <P>"China is Thailand's major competitor in these markets," a Thai
official is quoted in the article as saying. Thai and mainland
Chinese exports to the markets include garments, fabrics, electrical
circuit boards, electrical appliances, iron and steel, footwear and
children's toys.</P>
      <P>There is concern in Thailand that a falling Japanese yen could
force mainland China to devalue its renminbi to keep exports
competitive, according to the bulletin.</P>
      <P>The report marks the Thai government's first official comments on
the prospect of a devalued renminbi.</P>
      <P>"China has several strong factors that boost its competitiveness
in export," according to the report, which noted that the efficiency
of mainland Chinese industrial production has risen 20 percent
annually from 1993 to 1997.</P>
      <P>"China enjoys lower production and labor costs than Thailand,
moreover, China has received trade privileges for its textile and
garment exports to the USA and the EU markets," the Thai government
complained.</P>
      <P>It also indicated that the devaluation of the yuan would cause
Thailand to suffer a trade deficit with Beijing, despite the fact
that Thailand enjoyed a trade surplus with the country during the
first quarter of this year, its first surplus in the past 11 years of
trade relations.</P>
      <P>The devaluation of the yuan would discourage Chinese investors
from investing in Thailand despite strong efforts by Thailand to
attract more foreign investment, the report said, adding that
arrivals from mainland Chinese tourists, which dropped 3.7 percent
last year, could fall further.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN'S  ATTENTION  CENTERED ON UPPER HOUSE ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Following the end of the 142nd ordinary
session of the Diet on Thursday, Japan is focusing its attention on
the 18th election of the House of Councilors in July, where 126
seats, or half of the 252 seats in the Upper House, will be up for
grabs.</P>
      <P>Economic recovery will be the major issue in the election, held
once every three years.</P>
      <P>Attention will also be focused on whether the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party can win all its 61 seats being contested and an
additional eight seats, giving it a total of 127. It would be the
first time in nine years the party controlled Japan's upper house.
The LDP currently has a total of 119 seats.</P>
      <P>Voting is scheduled to take place July 12, and balloting will be
extended two hours this year to 8 p.m. The move is aimed at boosting
voter turnout, which stood at only 44.52 percent in 1995.</P>
      <P>If the LDP fails to win back at least 61 seats, Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, also LDP president, is expected to be held
responsible for the party's performance. A dismal showing could
imperil his political career.</P>
      <P>Owing to the weakness of the opposition, however, the LDP stands
a good chance of winning more than 61 seats, though it is uncertain
whether the party can capture a majority in the upper house.</P>
      <P>Of the 126 seats being contested, 76 will be filled by votes cast
in electoral districts, while the remaining 50 will be filled on the
basis of proportional representation. In all more than 400 candidates
will compete in the elections.</P>
      <P>The total number of seats, as well as the number being contested,
of Japan's major political parties in the Upper House are as follows:
LDP, 119 (61 being contested); Democratic Party, 38 (18); Komei, 24
(11); Social Democratic Party, 20 (12); Communist Party, 14 (6);
Liberal Party, 11 (5).</P>
      <P>The LDP regained its majority in Japan's lower house, the House
of Representatives, last summer, capturing 261 of 500 seats.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROTH REAFFIRMS US COMMITMENT TO TAIWAN'S SECURITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior US official reaffirmed on
Thursday that the Clinton administration remains steadfast in its
commitment to meet Taiwan's defense needs.</P>
      <P>Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, made the statment while testifying before a Senate
subcommittee on President Bill Clinton's upcoming state visit to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>"The administration remains firmly committed to filling the
security and arms trasfer provisions of the TRA, Taiwan Relations
Act," Roth told the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs under
the Senate's Committee on Foreign Relations.</P>
      <P>Noting that the commitment is not a matter of rhetoric, Roth said
the Clinton administration has demonstrated it through the transfer
of F-16s, Knox-class frigates, helicopters and tanks, as well as a
variety of other equipment.</P>
      <P>"And we will continue to assist Taiwan in meeting its defense
needs," Roth pledged.</P>
      <P>Consistent with its obligations under the TRA, Roth said, the US
regularly consults with Taiwan as to how it can best address a broad
range of security threats, including posed by ballistic missiles.</P>
      <P>For instance, Roth said, the Clinton administration has
briefed Taiwan on the concept of theater missile defense, or TMD.</P>
      <P>"Officials in Taiwan are currently assessing their own
capabilities and needs. They have not to date indicated interest in
acquiring TMD," Roth noted.</P>
      <P>At this moment, Roth said, "requiring a study of this kind thus
gets ahead of the situation on the ground in Taiwan, and may not even
be consistent with the approach Taiwan officials will ultimately want
to take."</P>
      <P>Against this background, Roth said, the Clinton administration
is opposed to the legislation of a bill passed by the House of
Representatives last November demanding the Department of Defense to
produce a study of the architecture requirement for the
establishment and operation of a theater ballistic missile defense
system for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The House passed the bill with a vote of 301-116 on Nov. 6, 1997
sortly after mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin made a
high-profile state visit to the United States. The bill has been
referred to the Senate for deliberation and approval.</P>
      <P>Roth went on to say while making it possible for Taiwan to
acquire the wherewithal to defend itself, Taiwan's long-term
security relies on more than military factors.</P>
      <P>"In the end, stability in the Taiwan Strait will be contingent on
the ability of the two sides of the strait to come to terms with each
other on a political basis," Roth observed.</P>
      <P>For this reason, Roth said, the Clinton administration has
encouraged both Taiwan and Beijing to reopen dialogue, making clear
to both sides that dialogue is the most promising way to defuse
tensions and build confidence.</P>
      <P>Touching on the possible impact on Taiwan of Clinton's June
25-July 3 mainland visit, Roth said he has stated publicly on
numerous occasions as well as privately to Taiwan officials that
there will not be a fourth communique on any subject affecting
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We will not be doing anything to undermine their interests,"
Roth said in response to an inquiry by Sen. Craig Thomas, chairman
of the Senate Subcommittee on Asia and Pacific Affairs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FACES DIFFICULTY CUTTING TARIFFS IN FISHERY SECTOR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 19 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will face difficulty cutting tariffs
in the fishery sector, Vice Economic Minister Lin Yi-fu said on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Lin made the remarks in advance of a three-day ministerial
meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum which
opens on June 21 in Malaysia. Top of the agenda at the meeting will
be "early voluntary sectoral liberalization (EVSL)."</P>
      <P>Lin said that other countries will also face similar difficulties
in achieving a target of zero tariffs by 2005 in the fishery sector.</P>
      <P>APEC leaders launched the EVSL plan in a previous meeting in
Vancouver, with the aim of lowering trade barriers in nine sectors --
environmental goods and services, medical equipment, chemicals,
energy, forestry products, fishery products, gems and jewelry, toys,
and electronic commerce.</P>
      <P>Trade ministers this year will review the progress made regarding
the nine sectors during the June 21-23 meeting in Kuching, Malaysia.</P>
      <P>However, Lin pointed out that although it will be difficult for
Taiwan to lower tariffs on fishery products, it will have fewer
problems with the other sectors.</P>
      <P>He noted that according to the results of talks with World Trade
Organization members on Taiwan's terms for joining the world trade
regulatory body, tariffs on fishery products should be cut to 20.9
percent by 2004. The APEC cuts are so much lower than this target
that Taiwan cannot possibly agree to them, he added.</P>
      <P>He said that Japan, South Korea, Association for Southeast Asian
nations, and mainland China, will also face similar difficulties in
meeting the goal of zero tariffs by 2005.</P>

      <P>In a declaration opposing damage to the island's sovereignty by

      <P>They stressed that Taiwan needs to express this view before US
President Bill Clinton's trip to mainland China next week, because
his summit meeting with mainland President Jiang Zemin will have a

    <HEADLINE>US TRADE DEFICIT WITH MAINLAND CHINA TO HIT US$60 BILLION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  18  (CNA)
(By Herman Pan &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US trade deficit with mainland
China is expected to soar to a record US$60 billion in 1998, up from
last year's figure of US$49.7 billion in Beijing's favor, according
to US Department of Commerce statistics.</P>
      <P>Since Washington and Beijing established diplomatic relations 19
years ago, the US has suffered 15 consecutive years of deficit in
bilateral trade with the mainland, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>The US suffered a cumulative deficit of US$15.778 billion in
trade with mainland China in the first four months of 1998, a record
high and an increase of 19.8 percent over the corresponding period of
last year, the statistics indicate.</P>
      <P>If Washington's trade deficit with Beijing continues at the
current level, it will reach some US$59.6 billion by the end of 1998,
which would surpass Washington's 1997 trade deficit with Japan by
US$5 billion. Japan has long enjoyed the largest trade deficit with
the US.</P>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton is scheduled to visit mainland China
next week, when he will have a summit meeting with his mainland
counterpart Jiang Zemin. Issues such as the serious trade deficit
imbalance and Beijing's bid for entry into the World Trade
Organization will be high on the summit agenda, said US Secretary of
Commerce William M. Daley.</P>
      <P>However, the recent drastic depreciation of the Japanese yen, and
the deteriorating financial situation in the rest of Asia, are likely
to be factors in Beijing's favor at the summit.</P>
      <P>Beijing has maintained the value of the renminbi and has not
tried to take advantage of the exchange rate to promote exports,
which the Beijing authorities are sure to point out when they face
Washington's censure over the huge trade deficit.</P>

Overseas Chinese Academics Association in the Eastern US, noted at

    <HEADLINE>6 TAIWAN LEADERS MAKE BUSINESS WEEK'S 'STARS OF ASIA' LIST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  June 18 (CNA)
(By K. C. Huang and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Six prominent Taiwan personalities have
made the "Stars of Asia" list featured by the US-based BusinessWeek
in its June 29 Asian edition, which will hit newsstands on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The weekly features a total of 50 Asian leaders who the
magazine says are taking significant steps to help Asia emerge from
its worst crisis in a half century. They include policymakers,
managers, entrepreneurs, financiers and opinion leaders.</P>
      <P>The six Taiwan "stars" are:</P>
      <P>-- Yuan T. Lee, 61, president of Academia Sinica, Taiwan's
highest research institute. Noting that Lee is the first Taiwan-born
Nobel Prize laureate and a devoted education reformer, BusinessWeek
said the new thinking introduced by Lee is like a gentle breeze
sweeping through Taiwan's rigid, conservative education system.</P>
      <P>The weekly further said Lee worries that Taiwan -- famous for
its bright engineers who have built a thriving and globally
competitive electronics industry -- will miss the next step up the
technology ladder if it doesn't train more creative thinkers and
invest more in research.</P>
      <P>-- Chen Shui-bian, 47, mayor of Taipei. BusinessWeek said Chen,
the first non-KMT mayor of Taipei, has dismantled the Kuomintang's
patronage machine in the city and tackled long neglected problems
that fueled the citizens' rage.</P>
      <P>-- Morris Chang, 66, CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Corp. "Chang's
long career in the US -- he worked at Texas Instruments Inc. and
General Instrument Corp. -- taught him to value the emphasis Western
business places on employee welfare, innovation and strong links to
customers. He thinks Asia's beleaguered companies must adopt those
values," the weekly said.</P>
      <P>-- Steve Chang, 43, CEO of Trend Micro. BusinessWeek praised
Chang as a powerful force in the global market for anti-hacker
software, a field dominated by the US. It quoted Chang as saying that
there is no reason that more software companies can't be big
successes in Asia.</P>
      <P>-- Jonney Shih, 45, chairman of Asustek Computer. "By hiring
top-caliber engineers, Shih has ensured that his company is a key
link in the worldwide supply chains of top computer makers," the
weekly said.</P>
      <P>-- Hsu Ta-lin, 54, chairman of Hambrecht &amp; Quist Asia Pacific.
BusinessWeek said Hsu is helping restructure Corporate Asia. "Hsu
wants to clean up the traditional Asian management practices -- and
the balance sheet -- of acquired companies. And he rewards executives
the Silicon Valley way: with stock options."</P>
      <P>Also among the 50 "Star of Asia" are South Korean President Kim
Dae-jung, 76; mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, 69; Singaporean
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 46; Hong Kong Legislator
Martin Lee, 60.</P>
      <P>The weekly said few of the 50 are saints. "But all of them show,
in one way or another, how Asia must move forward ... Some of these
stars may not succeed in their ambitions. But what is important is
that they are changing the way Asians think about themselves, their
problems, and the economies and societies in which they work and
live... BuisnessWeek's stars are hoping and working for something
different."</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE, BILL GATES SHARE COMMON VISION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui received visiting
Microsoft Corp. CEO Bill Gates on Friday at the Presidential Office,
where they discussed their common vision of Taiwan's future success
in the global market.</P>
      <P>The president said that in an information society, information
must be fully grasped and rapidly processed in order for a country
and its enterprises to maintain a competitive advantage.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the successful development of "digital
nervous systems" will be a big step forward for information
technology, and that it will help the government and local industries
to sharpen their competitive edge.</P>
      <P>Gates agreed with Lee's concept of the importance of digital
nervous systems, and later on Friday, at a symposium organized by the
Executive Yuan's National Information Infrastructure task force, he
shared his own ideas with the 2,000 attendees.</P>
      <P>Gates explained that the basic concept behind a digital nervous
system is the use of efficiently networked personal computers,
reliable electronic mail, and software capable of processing huge
amounts of data, to incorporate the best ideas and information from
all levels of an organization to achieve a "group intelligence."</P>
      <P>The digital nervous system relies on the constantly improving
technology which has seen the advent of ever more powerful high-speed
personal computers, Gates added.</P>
      <P>By allowing all members of an organization to have access to a
common digital nervous system, they can receive the newest, most
accurate and most useful information at the fastest possible speed,
Gates said, pointing out that this will be a major factor in
improving a company's overall competitive edge.</P>
      <P>With improved efficiency throughout the organization and the
ability to react quickly to information, a company can make the best
policy decisions and close the communication gap between the company
and the client, he said.</P>
      <P>Gates urged Taiwan to place greater importance on the development
of digital technology and to build a global network, pointing out
that Taiwan is better equipped than most other countries to respond
quickly to market and technological changes.</P>
      <P>He also noted that Taiwan has close relationships with many
companies worldwide and is already making increasingly widespread use
of networks. Coupled with the increasingly powerful capabilities of
personal computers, Gates said that Taiwan should immediately focus
on digital nervous system technology in order to maintain its global
market position.</P>
      <P>Gates arrived in Taiwan on Thursday evening, his seventh visit to
the island since Microsoft established an office here nine years ago.</P>
      <P>He is also scheduled to star in a ten-minute video commercial
aimed at promoting the quality of Taiwan goods to consumers
worldwide.</P>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of Environmental Protection
under the Taipei City Government is planning to collect garbage fees
from city residents through the sale of garbage bags.</P>
      <P>The bureau revealed at a press conference on Friday that if the
plan receives the support of the Taipei City Council, it is expected
to be formally implemented in Taipei City from July 1999.</P>
      <P>Recent complaints of excessive garbage fees lodged by Wang
Tso-yung, president of the Control Yuan, have drawn widespread public
attention. Garbage fees in Taipei City are currently levied along
with water fees.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Environmental Protection responded to the
complaints by implementing a pilot scheme in April this year to
collect garbage fees through the sale of garbage bags in seven Taipei
City precincts.</P>
      <P>A subsequent survey has revealed that each family in the
experimental area has been spending an average of NT$167 per month
for the special garbage bags, as opposed to the NT$214 garbage fees
incurred by families not using the new system.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that 59 percent of the householders in the
pilot scheme are in favor of the new system, while 27 percent are
against its continuation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the bureau said, the new plan is helping to achieve
vast improvements in the city's garbage recycling measures.</P>
      <P>The pilot scheme, which is expected to conclude at the end of
June, will be carried on and expanded to cover more city precincts in
September, after which it will be submitted for approval by the city
council. If approved, the plan will then be implemented formally
throughout the whole city in July of next year.</P>

      <P>Fifty-five mainland Chinese dissidents
Friday sent an open letter to US President Bill Clinton, urging him
to meet with leading dissident Xu Wenli during his upcoming visit to
mainland China.</P>
      <P>In the letter made public through the Hong Kong-based

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 19 (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Microsoft Corp. Chairman and CEO Bill Gates
on Friday announced the establishment of his company's Asian-Pacific
Dedicated System Solution Center in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Gates, who is in Taipei on a whirlwind 24-hour visit, said at a
news conference that the center will help Taiwan's information
industry exploit advanced platform devices for Windows CE and Windows
NT.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's excellent enterprise development environment and
its outstanding capability in designing and mass production are the
reasons why Microsoft chose the island as the site for its regional
center.</P>
      <P>Fan Cheng-chu, president of Microsoft Taiwan Co., said the center
is expected to help the local information industry boost its design
capability and expand its market share.</P>
      <P>Gates said Internet connection and a non-paper environment will
be the trend of future development of personal computers.</P>
      <P>He said that with the popularization of PC's, government agencies
and enterprises are now able to establish a high-speed Internet
connection system to improve the flow of information.</P>
      <P>For example, he said, several US business giants including GE and
Boeing, have moved toward "non-paper offices," which are expected to
sharpen their competitive edge by reducing production cost and
increasing added-value to their products.</P>
      <P>Asked to pinpoint the weakness of Taiwan in software development,
Gates said that the island is facing a shortage of software R&amp;D
personnel, making it difficult for the island to attract investment
from multinational software companies.</P>
      <P>But Gates said that Microsoft is willing to come to Taiwan's aid
in this field.</P>
      <P>As a gesture to show Microsoft's support for both the ROC
government and its private sector's efforts to develop software, Fan
said his company will join forces with the Institute for Information
Industry (III) to train local software talent.</P>
      <P>Under the program, teachers and trainers will first be cultivated
in local universities and colleges, and they in turn will train
20,000 to 25,000 software engineers in three years for the island,
Fan added.</P>
      <P>In addition, Software and III will jointly set up Windows DNA
Application Development Lab and Distributed Internet Applications
Architecture in Taiwan, which are expected to help businesses improve
operations through the application of computer technology.</P>
      <P>Gates arrived in Taiwan Thursday evening. It is his seventh visit
to the island since Microsoft opened its Taipei office nine years
ago.</P>
      <P>Gates called on President Lee Teng-hui Friday morning and
presented him with Window 98, which is scheduled to hit the stores
next month.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Gates, who is considered the richest man in the
world with an estimated fortune of US$40 billion, starred in a

    <TEXT>
      <P>New Party Taipei mayoral candidate Wang
Chien-shien said on Friday he has no particular comment on the
possibility of a Lee Teng-hui-Chen Shui-bian ticket in the 2000
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Wang said people can have different views on whether such a
ticket involving the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) is possible, but there is no need to devalue
other people's point of views.</P>
      <P>He was referring to the bold remarks made Wednesday by another
party heavyweight Jaw Shau-kong, which prompted criticism from the
KMT leadership and Chen.</P>
      <P>Jaw, the New Party's campaign manager for the year-end
legislative, mayoral and city council deputy elections, on Friday
repeated his prediction that the friendly engagement between
President Lee and Taipei Mayor Chen as well as their common belief in
Taiwan independence might lead the two to run together in the next
presidential election.</P>
      <P>Speaking on another issue, Wang said he does not agree with
Premier Vincent Siew's decision to suspend the future operation of
the Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) system.</P>
      <P>Saying the BOT system was designed to encourage private
investment in large-scale transportation projects, the former finance
minister stressed that BOT is a vital strategy in the development of
the country and should not be abolished.</P>
      <P>Responding to disputes resulting from the bidding of Chiang
Kai-shek Airport Rapid Transit Systems project, a BOT case, Siew on
Thursday instructed the Council for Economic Planning and Development
to work out a complete set of rules governing the operation of the
BOT system. He said before such rules are set, all other proposed
cases based on BOT should be put temporarily on hold.</P>
      <P>Wang also said he would not drop of out the mayoral election even
though his support rate in several recent surveys showed him lagging
far behind incumbent Taipei Mayor Chen and KMT candidate Ma
Ying-jeou. He vowed to fight a clean battle without any disreputable
or sensational tactics.</P>

      <P>Kosuke Setsude contracted a fatal liver-related disease caused by
biliary aresia, a kind of congenital bile duct defect, 63 days after
birth. His only hope for survival was to receive a liver transplant.</P>
      <P>In January 1995, Setsude, accompanied by his ethnic Chinese
mother, was transferred to the Kaohsiung-based Chang Gung Hospital in
southern Taiwan to await a liver transplant after undergoing several
urgent medical treatment in Japan.</P>
      <P>The wait for a transplant took three years. On Jan. 20, a
6-year-old boy living in Ilan, northeastern Taiwan, died in an
accident. His parents donated the boy's liver and other organs to
those who were on waiting lists.</P>
      <P>Setsude was one of the lucky ones on that list and the next day,
Setsude received a successful liver transplant. He was released from
the hospital on March 5.</P>
      <P>During his long-term stay on the island, Setsude learned how to
speak Mandarin. Before leaving for Japan on Friday, Setsude said in
his second tongue that his biggest wish was to visit Tokyo Disneyland
with his father.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LACK OF DOMESTIC DEMAND BLAMED FOR JAPAN'S SLUMP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, June 19 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Japanese yen will likely remain soft in
the near foreseeable future, the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC)
predicted Friday.</P>
      <P>The yen has lost about 20 percent of its value against the US
dollar in the last year, and the current trend in Japan's fundamental
economic data indicates the country is in for more of the same.</P>
      <P>Japan's current slump is due to a lack of domestic demand, the
SCB said. The weak economic outlook and the political reluctance to
introduce needed reforms have dealt an additional blow to consumer
confidence.</P>
      <P>Recent economic indicators paint a gloomy portrait of Japan even
as the outlook for the United States and Europe continues to be
upbeat.</P>
      <P>For the first time since 1991, the Japanese yen broke through the
140 barrier against the US dollar. Growing concerns about the
Japanese economy, and the economies in East Asia which have close
ties to Japan, have caused the latest worries.</P>
      <P>The divergence in the economic trends shows that the Japanese yen
is not merely suffering from the vagaries of the market, but that the
drop in the currency is due to a deterioration in the country's
economy.</P>
      <P>The bank said it does not expect the government's fiscal
packages, including an income tax cut, to provide much of a spark to
the economy. The current crisis has unleashed a lot of insecurity
about the future, so that the Japanese have been stashing away
disposable income instead of spending it.</P>
      <P>Under these circumstances, the Bank of Japan's expensive monetary
policy has not had any impact, it continued. Japanese monetary
authorities have been pumping liquidity into the economy to prop up
the financial sectors, and will continue to do so for the time being,
the SBC said.</P>
      <P>"The economic crisis, in our opinion, is far from over. We expect
the Bank of Japan to maintain its expansive policy, which means the
Japanese yen is likely to drop further. A stronger Japanese currency
will come about only when the economy begins to recover, which will
not happen until next year at the earliest," the SBC concluded.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FREEMAN UNDERESTIMATES TAIWAN'S POLITICAL WISDOM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
official said on Friday that former US Assistant Secretary of Defense
Chas W. Freeman has underestimated Taiwan people's political wisdom
by calling on the US to review its policy on arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shen Lyu-shun, head of the MOFA's North American Affairs
Department, said that Freeman has also misconstrued the joint
communique signed by Washington and Beijing on Aug. 17, 1982.</P>
      <P>Freeman made the call in an article titled "Preventing War in the
Taiwan Strait" which was published in the August, 1998 edition of
Foreign Affairs bimonthly.</P>
      <P>In his personal view, Shen said Freeman committed three serious
errors in the article.</P>
      <P>First, US arms sales to Taiwan have never boosted independence
sentiments in Taiwan as Freeman claimed. "Many pro-independence
advocates have become more cautious regarding the issue," he noted.</P>
      <P>Secondly, Taiwan is not as "childish" as Freeman described.
Freeman said Taiwan would rather listen to voices in the US Congress
than take notice of advice from the US administration.</P>
      <P>"Actually, we understand and respect the interrelations between
US Congress and the US administrative branch," Shen said.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, Freeman misunderstood the 1982 communique. Beijing, not
Taipei, is to blame for the changes in cross-strait relations, he
continued.</P>
      <P>Freeman wrote that "the United States cannot hold Beijing to its
word if Americans do not keep theirs. The sales of 150 F-16 fighters
to Taiwan in 1992 and some subsequent deals do not square with the
1982 agreement."</P>
      <P>In response, Shen said it is Beijing which is attempting to
change the situation across the Taiwan Strait by blocking Taiwan in
the international community and by resorting to military threat by
launching missiles off Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Washington should blame Beijing if it wanted the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait to maintain the status-quo, because Beijing pledged "to
strive for a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question" in the
communique, while Washington promised to "cap the quantity and
sophistication of its arms sales to Taiwan," Shen argued.</P>
      <P>Although the US promised to sell arms to Taiwan in the 1982
communique, he stressed, it is linked to a condition which requires
Beijing to stick with a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SHEN EXPLAINS ROC'S CONCERN ABOUT CLINTON-JIANG SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's conern about US
President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to mainland China lies in
Washington's stance on the Beijing-proposed "new three no's," a
senior official said on Friday.</P>
      <P>Shen Lyu-shun, director of the North American Affairs
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), said the ROC
would not like to see the United States discuss with Beijing any
subject related to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"This is a matter of principle," Shen said. "If the US has any
opinion about issues involving Taiwan, it should directly consult
with us, not mainalnd China. More important, the US should not make
any promise to Beijing on any ROC-related subject."</P>
      <P>Mainland leaders have made it clear that they will bring up the
so-called "Taiwan issue" when Clinton visits the mainland from
June 25 through July 3.</P>
      <P>Beijing is expected to ask Clinton to reaffirm the US
commitment to the "one China" policy, which Beijing says is against
the creation of "two Chinas or one China, one Taiwan," and opposes
Taiwan independence and its entry to international organizations
involving sovereign states.</P>
      <P>Shen said it remains unclear how Clinton will respond to
mainland President Jiang Zemin's demand for US promise on the
above-mentioned "three no's."</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC has neither pursued "two Chinas, or one
China, one Taiwan" nor Taiwan independence, Shen said what the ROC
cares is not the content of the Clinton-Jiang talks.</P>
      <P>"What we care most is that the US should not discuss ROC-related
issues with Beijing," Shen explained, adding such move implies that
mainland China is entitled to interfere with US relations with the
ROC.</P>
      <P>Recalling that the 1982 US-mainland China join communique, in
which the US promised to gradually reduce arms sales to Taiwan, has
greatly hurt Taiwan, Shen said the ROC would not like to see
recurrence of such an event during Clinton's forthcoming mainland
visit.</P>
      <P>Shen also reminded the US that in its 1994 policy review, it once
promised to support Taiwan's entry to international organizations
whose memberships are not confined to sovereign states.</P>

      <P>Taiwan on Friday urged mainland China to
take action in organizing a visit by Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top
negotiator with the mainland, to Beijing this autumn.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on Friday wrote a
letter to its mainland counterpart, the Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), suggesting that SEF Chairman Koo
visit the mainland in the fall.</P>
      <P>The visit is expected to lead to a resumption of the highest-
level cross-strait talks between Koo and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are semi-official intermediary bodies formed to
handle civilian exchanges in the absence of official contacts between
two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The letter said a visit by Koo in the fall would comply with a
consensus reached in late April between the deputy secretary-generals
of the two semi-official bodies that Koo would visit the mainland by
the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The letter also suggested that to pave the way for Koo's visit,
SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng visit the mainland in
mid-July at the head of a delegation comprised of legal experts, and
that SEF Vice Chairman Shi Hwei-yow make a separate visit in
mid-August at the head of a delegation made up of SEF board members.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, SEF said it also welcomes ARATS deputy secretary-

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN VISITORS TO AUSTRALIA SEEN FALLING SHARPLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  19 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of Taiwan tourists traveling
to Australia is expected to drop dramatically in 1998 after the One
Nation Party's big showing in recent Queensland state elections,
tourist promoters said.</P>
      <P>The One Nation Party advocates racist policies and is considered
anti-aboriginal, anti-Asian immigration and anti-multiculturalism.
Due to the perception that many people in Queensland support the same
racist views, visitors from Asia may feel it is unsafe to travel down
under, they said.</P>
      <P>To make things worse is the new levy of A$50 (US$32) on visitors
from various countries including Taiwan. There are 27 countries
exempt from the levy, they include the United States and Britain.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Visitors Association (TVA) in Sydney has been flooded
with inquiries from Taiwan and Sydney among other major cities since
the One Nation Party stunned political observers with its
unprecedented victory in the June 13 elections.</P>
      <P>The common question is whether it is safe to travel in Australia,
especially in Queensland, according to TVA representative Joseph Ru.</P>
      <P>"The rise of the One Nation Party and the new visa levy will have
a considerable impact on Taiwanese tourists in Australia," he told
CNA Friday.</P>
      <P>Tourism from Taiwan is expected to fall by 30 percent this year
due to the One Nation Party's popularity, travel agents said.</P>
      <P>They said Taiwanese tourists are among the biggest spenders in
Australia with an average expenditure of almost A$2,000 (US$1,250)
per person. Taiwan is a major tourist market for Australia.</P>
      <P>"One Nation is definitely affecting tourism from Asia," said
Jason Huong, managing director of Victoria Teleworld Travel in
Sydney. "(Asian tourists) see there is a race problem in Australia
and they are worried about traveling here."</P>
      <P>Travel promoters said the Australian government is making the
situation worse with its new levy on visitors visas. The levy is
aimed at deterring travelers from overstaying their visas.</P>
      <P>The Department of Immigration recently released figures showing
tourists from mainland China, Britain and the United States and
eastern Europe had overstayed their visas for various reasons, but
very few tourists from Taiwan overstayed their visas, travel
promoters said.</P>
      <P>The Australian government said the levy on Taiwanese tourists was
due to the fact that the island country is not included in the
Electronic Travel Authority (ETA).</P>
      <P>The United States, Britain and 25 other countries are members of
the ETA. However, the irony is many Americans and British are among
those who overstayed their visas in Australia.</P>
      <P>"This new visa levy makes Australia a country that does not
welcome tourists from Taiwan or has some kind of discrimination
(against) Taiwanese tourists," said one promoter, who declined to be
named.</P>
      <P>In 1997, about 153,000 tourists from Taiwan visited Australia and
one of their favorite destinations was Queensland, TVA statistics
showed.</P>
      <P>In March alone, the total number of foreign tourists to Australia
dropped by 13.4 percent from 1997 to 338,557. The number of tourists
from Taiwan plunged 31.3 percent to only 10,196 in the same month.</P>
      <P>The decline of tourist arrivals has forced Australia to revise
its forecast for total visitors in 1998 down eight percent from last
year's 4.3 million.</P>
      <P>In their efforts to reverse the trend, tourism leaders in
Australia are calling on the Australian government to counter the
damaging fallout from One Nation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN FINANCIAL CRISIS DRAGS DOWN HK-TAIWAN TRADE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong, June 20 (CNA)
(By Wang Man-nah &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Asian financial crisis has battered
the financial markets of Taiwan and Hong Kong, and has also deflated
trade between the two areas, a Republic of China official based in
the former British colony said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Two-way trade between Taiwan and Hong Kong declined 7.5 percent
in the first five months of this year, mainly as a result of the
regional financial turmoil which began to bite in the second half of
last year, according to Wu Chieh-min, director of the Hong Kong
branch office of the Far East Trade Service Inc., which represents
the ROC Ministry of Economic Affairs in the absence of official
contact between Taiwan and Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to Hong Kong amounted to US$10.3 billion in the
first five months of the year, down 5.4 percent from the same period
of a year ago. In May alone, Hong Kong-bound Taiwan exports totaled
US$2.23 billion, down 8.5 percent from the corresponding month of
1997.</P>
      <P>In comparison, Wu said, Hong Kong's exports to Taiwan posted
increases for both the five-month period and for May alone, US$812
million for the first five months, up 5.8 percent, and US$164 million
for May alone, up 8.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Wu attributed Taiwan's declining Hong Kong exports to the fall in
exports to mainland China. About 80 percent of Taiwan-Hong Kong trade
is transit trade between Taiwan and mainland China, since direct
Taiwan-mainland China trade is prohibited, he added.</P>
      <P>Since the mainland Chinese authorities seem dead set on
maintaining the value of the renminbi despite the regional financial
meltdown, the mainland's domestic economy has slowed, pushing down
commodity demands from Taiwan, Wu noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu attributed Hong Kong's increased exports to Taiwan
in the January-May period mainly to Taiwan's increasing need for
parts and components made by Taiwan-financed factories in mainland
China, which are then re-exported to other countries.</P>
      <P>Despite the Asian financial morass, Wu said, Hong Kong remains
Taiwan's second-largest overseas market and its third-largest trading
partner.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A swim team from the Republic of China on
Friday completed a successful crossing of Italy's Circeo Channel.</P>
      <P>Team leader Wang Han said the five-member team was elated after
reaching land at 8:31 p.m., 12 hours and 56 minutes after starting
their swim across the 45-kilometer channel, located about 100
kilometers south of Rome.</P>
      <P>Wang said the water temperature was about 20 degrees Celsius, and
that the sea was quiet most of the time, making the team optimistic
that it might arrive earlier than scheduled. However, the sea became
rougher in the final four kilometers, which made the final leg of the
trip a challenging three-and-a-half-hour battle for the swimmers.</P>
      <P>Wang gave special thanks to the Italian military, port
authorities, and several of his friends, for helping the team
complete its preparations for the channel crossing.</P>
      <P>The team was forced to suspend an earlier attempt on Wednesday
after the Italian military decided that the adverse conditions at the
time could endanger the safety of the swimmers.</P>
      <P>Sources familiar with the Circeo Channel said that the average
swimmer would take eight to 12 hours to cross the channel in perfect
sea conditions, and expressed admiration that Wang's team was able to
complete the crossing in less than 13 hours while swimming against
strong seasonal currents.</P>
      <P>Wang is the first swimmer from the ROC to have swum the Strait of
Gibraltar. Since then, he has also crossed the English Channel, the
Bosporus, Hawaii's Maui Channel, Canada's Juan de Fuca Channel,
Japan's Tsugaru Channel, Australia's Platypus Channel, New Zealand's
Cook Strait, and the San Pedro Channel in the United States, as well
as rounding the Cape of Good Hope at Africa's southernmost tip.</P>
      <P>His next goal is to take on the Taiwan Strait by 2000.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC LAUNCHES NEW CRACKDOWN ON COMMERCIAL PIRACY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government launched a
new crackdown on commercial piracy on Saturday as part of its efforts
to eradicate this type of illegal trade practice from the island.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) said it will cooperate
closely with law enforcement authorities in carrying out the massive
"Anti-counterfeiting Operation."</P>
      <P>"The operation will focus on raiding upper-stream computer
software counterfeiting plants and underground factories," an MOEA
official said.</P>
      <P>The crackdown will last through the end of August, as the summer
vacation is usually a boom season for sales of pirated software, the
official said, adding: "Hopefully, the operation will let commercial
pirates understand there are no vacations in the fight against
crime."</P>
      <P>The official further said the Ministry of Justice Investigation
Bureau (MJIB) has managed to gather detailed information about
several software counterfeiting plants. "Our inspectors will work
hand-in-hand with MJIB agents, police and prosecution authorities to
bring to justice all those involved in commercial piracy."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the National Police Administration (NPA) said it has
directed all police offices around the island to make "probes of
commercial piracy" part of their routine weekly spot checks.</P>
      <P>The MOEA's anti-counterfeiting task force also said it will
assign personnel to visit major computer exporters to gain a better
understanding of production and sale of microchips, particularly
those for video game use, as well as printed circuit boards with
built-in software.</P>
      <P>The MOEA inspectors are also expected to remind computer
exporters not to counterfeit any brand-name goods or produce any
copyrighted items without legal authorization.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ministry has decided to ban any local company
which has a criminal record of counterfeiting from making investments
in mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INVESTIGATORS TO VISIT FRANCE TO PROBE ALLEGED RAPE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Investigators will travel to France on
Wednesday at the latest to probe an alleged rape carried out by Cheng
Chuan, acting director of the Investigation Bureau, the convener of a
special investigative task force said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Vice Justice Minister Chiang Hao said that although Taiwan has
contacted French authorities regarding the alleged rape, the
information gathering has not proceeded as smoothly as expected, as
the task force is finding it difficult to collect information from
French police and hospital records.</P>
      <P>The acting Investigation Bureau chief claims he was only trying
to cure the daughter of his former friend Yang Wan-Ching with
Chihkung, a traditional Chinese martial art believed to have curative
powers during a trip to Paris between Sept. 9 and 13, 1996.</P>
      <P>Cheng refuted allegations by Yang's wife that he had touched the
girl's breast and private parts under the pretext of administering
treatment to her in his Paris hotel room, causing the girl great
distress.</P>
      <P>Although Cheng has categorically denied any wrongdoing, many
questions surrounding the case remain unanswered, prompting the
Ministry of Justice to finally decide to send a team to France to
collect related information first-hand.</P>
      <P>Chiang said the task force will continue to communicate with
Yang, who is now a French citizen, despite that fact that he has not
shown much intention of working with the task force on the case.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MEXICAN `WOLF MAN' TO RECEIVE DIPLOMA FROM LOCAL PRIMARY SCHOOL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung,  central Taiwan, June 20 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mexico's "wolf man," who
has received only three years of formal education, will be awarded an
honorary diploma from Taichung's Wen Hsin Primary School next week.</P>
      <P>Jesus Manuel Fajardo Aceves, a 24-year-old Mexican man whose face
is shrouded in thick, dark hair as a result of a genetic disorder,
and who has been called "wolf man" since childhood, will receive the
honorary diploma on Tuesday to reward his diligence in academic
pursuits and his warm-heartedness toward children, a Wen Hsin
spokesperson said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>It will be the first time that the central Taiwan primary school
has ever bestowed an honorary diploma on an adult.</P>
      <P>Fajardo, who arrived in Taiwan in April, is currently on a
six-month goodwill visit to Taiwan at the invitation of the Guinness
Museum of World Records in Taichung City.</P>
      <P>According to the spokesperson, Wen Hsin decided to confer the
honorary diploma after children from the school visited the museum
and developed a friendship with Fajardo.</P>
      <P>Despite his extraordinary appearance, Fajardo said he is
virtually a normal man who yearns to make friends with other people.</P>
      <P>A victim of hirsutism, a genetically inherited disorder which was
passed down by his great grandmother, Fajardo said he was generally
shunned by society as a youth.</P>
      <P>He became a circus performer shortly after leaving a primary
school in Mexico at the age of 13, but his scant income meant he was
unable to continue his formal education. "One of my dreams is to
receive higher-level education," he said.</P>
      <P>Fajardo, who stands 160 cm tall and is very shy, said he is
satisfied with his current way of life and has no intention of
seeking to change his appearance.</P>
      <P>Fajardo got married during his years as a circus performer, but
the marriage did not last, and before coming to Taiwan, he had been
living with his mother and his five-year-old daughter in a Mexican
village. His family now makes a living from farming.</P>
      <P>Fajardo said he likes it in Taiwan and is pleased to be part of a
goodwill program. This is the first time he has lived alone for such
a long time abroad, although he has previously enjoyed brief visits
to Japan and Brazil.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEATH TOLL FROM VIRAL OUTBREAK RISES TO 50</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  20  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A killer intestinal virus epidemic has
claimed the lives of four more children in Taiwan, bringing the
official death toll to 50 babies and toddlers in recent months, the
Department of Health (DOH) said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>One of the new fatalities was reported in Taitung County, DOH
officials said, adding it was the first confirmed enterovirus-caused
death in the eastern part of the island.</P>
      <P>Another two casualties were reported at Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital and the remaining case occurred at Mackay Memorial Hospital,
both in Taipei, the officials said.</P>
      <P>According to DOH tallies, one out of every five children admitted
to hospital with the enterovirus infection has died.</P>
      <P>With the death toll rising, the DOH urged all city and county
governments not to sponsor any large-scale activities for children
for the time being to try to prevent the further spread of the virus.</P>
      <P>It also demanded that local health offices intensify
sterilization measures at all swimming pools in their cities or
counties to eradicate the killer virus. Parents have been advised to
discourage their children from swimming in public pools.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, China Medical College Hospital in the central city of
Taichung reported that two young children who died at the hospital
early on Saturday morning were suspected of having been afflicted by
the intestinal virus.</P>
      <P>"Both of them had shown symptoms of the enterovirus infection and
were unconscious when they arrived at the hospital," said Chiu
Hsiu-hui, a pediatrician at the hospital.</P>
      <P>If these two deaths are confirmed to have been caused by the
virus, the epidemic will have claimed the lives of 12 children in the
Taichung area.</P>
      <P>"Five young enterovirus patients are still in our hospital's
intensive care wards, one of whom is in critical condition," Chiu
added.</P>
      <P>As enterovirus-related cases are still emerging here and there,
Chiu said, the epidemic apparently is not yet over. He warned:
"Parents must remain on high alert to protect their children from
being attacked by the killer virus."</P>
      <P>A pathological autopsy on an eight-year-old girl has confirmed
that enterovirus type-71 was the culprit of her death.
Autopsies on four other children suspected to have died of similar
infections have also been completed, but it remains unclear whether
their deaths were also caused by the same type of virus.</P>
      <P>Infants and young children are most susceptible to enterovirus.
Early symptoms of the infection resemble the fle, with fever,
headache and vomiting. Ulcers or blisters in the mouth and a rash on
the palms and feet can also develop. Later, possible deadly
complications include encephalitis, meningitis and acute
inflammation of the heart muscle.</P>
      <P>Parents are advised to keep their kids away from public places,
and make sure that their children change clothes and wash hands
frequently.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TO USE TAIWAN ISSUE AS BARGAINING CHIP WITH US: ROC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 20 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland China will use the Taiwan issue as
a bargaining chip at the upcoming summit between mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and US President Bill Clinton, a high-ranking
ROC official said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>Vice Secretary-General of the President's Office Su Chi made the
remarks while he was attending a seminar sponsored by the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC).</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing will certainly put the Taiwan issue on the
agenda during the Clinton-Jiang talks, because Beijing has always
believed that this is one of its "aces" in its engagement with the
US.</P>
      <P>Su said that mainland China has always stressed that the Taiwan
issue is the most sensitive problem and the crux issue relating to
improved relations with the US, and that it is sure to use it as a
bargaining chip.</P>
      <P>But he stressed that there is no need to worry too much, saying
that the US side does not consider Taiwan to be the most important
issue. It is Beijing who wants to raise the issue as a bargaining
chip, because it really doesn't have much else up its sleeve.</P>
      <P>Su said that while the US can raise the Tibet, human rights, and
trade issues, Beijing will have only the Taiwan issue to raise.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, he said, the US has repeatedly vowed not to damage
the safety and interests of Taiwan during the talks. Taiwan will just
have to wait until after the meeting to see what develops, Su added.</P>
      <P>He reiterated the ROC's basic stance that it will not oppose any
engagement between the US and mainland China as long as the
engagement helps regional stability and peace, helps upgrade Taiwan's
relations with the US, and improves its relations with the mainland.</P>

      <P>The American National Alliance of
Families - POW/MIA on Friday offered a US$2.4 million reward for the
return of any living US serviceman on the official US list of
prisoners of war and missing in action transferred to mainland China
after the Korean War, Cold War, or the Vietnam War.</P>
      <P>The alliance appealed to the Beijing government for assistance in
returning their loved ones, adding that members of public who can
provide photos or other information related to the missing US
servicemen will also be rewarded.</P>
      <P>According to a statement, the alliance decided to join forces
with the American Defense Institute in offering the reward because
"our plea to President Bill Clinton to ask for our live POWs and
information on the missing has fallen on deaf ears. The priorities of
big business, once again, prevail over morality."</P>
      <P>There have been reports over the past decades of American POWs

    <TEXT>
      <P>A leading US think tank has accused
Beijing of almost single-handedly building Pakistan's nuclear program
-- from the blueprint for the bomb to the missiles to launch the bomb.</P>
      <P>"The Economic Times," a New Delhi-based English-language
newspaper, reported from Washington that the Heritage Foundation
said: "China's role in helping Pakistan to acquire nuclear weapons
has raised serious concerns about China's part in fostering
instability in South Asia."</P>
      <P>The foundation said that since the 1970s, mainland China has been
instrumental in Pakistan's nuclear and missile programs and has
provided Islamabad with "highly enriched uranium, ring magnets
necessary for processing the uranium, and education for nuclear
engineers."</P>
      <P>In 1990 and 1992, according to the foundation, mainland
China provided Pakistan with "nuclear-capable M-11 missiles" that
could strike targets within a 360-mile range . It also said that
"China's deep involvement with Pakistan's nuclear program contributed
to the Indian government's decision to test nuclear weapons last

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE MAY SEE NEGATIVE GROWTH BY 3RD QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June 20 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's economic growth is grinding
to a halt and will likely enter negative territory by this year's
third quarter, the Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk
Consultancy (PERC) said in a report released Friday.</P>
      <P>Calling the government's 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent growth
forecast for this year "too optimistic," the report quoted some
analysts as saying the economy might actually contract.</P>
      <P>PERC puts Singapore's economic growth rate at 1.5 percent for
this year and 3 percent next year. Economic contractions in Malaysia
and Indonesia support such scaled-back growth estimates, according to
the report.</P>
      <P>The report's findings come just three days after the Singapore
government said it would revise downward its growth forecast for this
year. The new forecast is expected later this month.</P>
      <P>Singapore's economy grew 5.6 percent in this year's first
quarter. Speaking in Parliament earlier this month, Finance Minister
Hu Tsu Tau said that the government would initiate special measures
if preliminary second-quarter figures point to a "significant
economic slowdown."</P>
      <P>Among the danger signs highlighted in the PERC report were
faltering non-oil domestic exports, falling domestic demand, rising
interest rates, depressed company profits and increased unemployment.</P>
      <P>The report suggests retrenchments by government-linked companies
and financial institutions may be enacted in the coming months. An
overly optimistic outlook and trade union resistance have delayed the
measures' implementation, but with several countries in the region
expecting negative growth, the retrenchments are almost inevitable,
the report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Panamanian President Perez Balladares
said on Friday that relations between Panama and the Republic of
China are cordial and will be long lasting.</P>
      <P>Balladares met with a group of ROC legislators at the
Presidential Office and reassured them that Panama is satisfied with
existing bilateral relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He admitted that Panama encountered great pressure from Beijing
last year when Panama City hosted the World Congress of Panama Canal.
"Despite the pressure, the meeting was convened and we had the guests
we wanted to have," Balladares said.</P>
      <P>Balladares said Panama and Taiwan maintain very close economic
ties. Citing the Fort Davis Export Processing Zone as an example, he
said his government's policy of strengthening economic cooperation
with Taiwan has been fruitful and proved correct. "I don't see any
reason for Panama to alter existing relations with Taiwan, now or in
the future," he said.</P>
      <P>Parris Chang, a legislator representing Taiwan's opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, lauded Balladares' wisdom and courage
in supporting Taiwan. He suggested that Panama and Taiwan further
bolster bilateral relations by forging more accords on economic and
trade cooperation, such as the signing of a free trade zone
agreement.</P>
      <P>The ROC legislators' group, led by Lin Che-fu (Kuomintang),

computers, user-friendly machines designed to perform fewer functions

      <P>In addition to announcing the establishment of a new Microsoft

computer manufacturers during a whirlwind visit to Taiwan Friday.</P>
      <P>"Consensus on cooperation on the XC plan has been reached," said
Acer executive Lin Chien-ming.</P>
      <P>Gates met with 19 Taiwan-based information technology companies,
including Acer, during his visit.</P>
      <P>The XC, or X computer, concept, was introduced by Acer Chairman
and CEO Stan Shih during the 1997 Asia-Pacific Information Technology
Summit last November. He described the XC as an easy-to-use,
single-function computer that will be built according to specific
demands.</P>
      <P>XCs will be designed for people who require simple, small-sized,
and inexpensive computers to run specific programs, such as games or
educational or financial management software. Acer predicts global
demand for XCs will be 10 times current demand for PCs.</P>
      <P>The forthcoming XCs, which will rely on Windows CE operating
system, are expected to be introduced in the second quarter of next
year, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Microsoft's Taiwan technology development center will specialize
in the development and promotion of the CE operating system, designed

    <TEXT>
      <P>Activists from Taiwan, Hong Kong and the
United States will set sail for the disputed Tiaoyutai islands in the
East China Sea next Wednesday in a further attempt to claim them as
Chinese territory, a spokesman said on Saturday.</P>
      <P>"This will be the first time that Taiwan and Hong Kong activists
launch a joint campaign since Hong Kong reverted to mainland Chinese
rule last July," said Chin Chieh-shou, head of the Taiwan Task Force
for Defending the Tiaoyutai Islands.</P>
      <P>Chin, also a Taipei County councilor from the right-wing
opposition New Party, said a 30-member Hong Kong delegation, aboard
the 100-ton vessel Diao Yu Tai, will leave Hong Kong late Sunday.</P>
      <P>The boat is scheduled to arrive at waters near the northern
Taiwan port of Keelung on June 24 to join vessels operated by
activists from Taiwan and Chinese communities in the United States,
Chin said.</P>
      <P>The ships will then set sail for the disputed islands, known as
the Tiaoyutais in Taiwan, the Diaoyus in mainland China and the
Senkakus in Japan. The uninhabited island group is claimed by
Taiwan, mainland China and Japan.</P>
      <P>Chin said group members plan to arm themselves with crossbows and
will dive from their boat into the water before trying to land on the
island to evade any Japanese patrol boats that may attempt to block
their path.</P>
      <P>Noting that crossbows are considered sporting goods, not
firearms, Chin said their action will not violate Taiwan's
anti-firearms law.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, we'll land on the Tiaoyutais and tear down a wooden
Japanese flag installed on one of the islands," Chin said.</P>
      <P>In October 1996, Chin and other Taiwan and Hong Kong activists
made a brief landing on one of the disputed islands and planted two
flags, one each from the Republic of China and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Japanese coast guards, however, forced the activists away from
the islet and removed the flags.</P>
      <P>Last year, a group of Taiwan and Hong Kong activists, also
led by Chin, was prevented from approaching the islands by a large
number of Japanese coast guard patrol ships and military helicopters.</P>
      <P>The annual landing attempts by Taiwan and Hong Kong activists
began after the ultra-rightist Japanese Youth Federation erected a
makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands in July 1996 and Japan
later included the Tiaoyutais in its 200-mile exclusive economic
zone.</P>
      <P>The event will also mark the death of David Chan, a Hong Kong
activist who drowned after jumping into the sea when Japanese coast
guard vessels blocked his ship near the archipelago in September
1996.</P>

      <P>Singapore's trade for the month of May
totaled S$27.31 billion (US$16.55 billion), a 6.1 percent decline
from year-earlier levels, the Singapore Trade Development Board said
Saturday.</P>
      <P>The country exported more than S$14.3 billion in goods, while it
imported nearly S$13 billion.</P>
      <P>Exports increased a marginal 0.1 percent in May on a three-month
moving average basis, with non-oil domestic exports and non-oil
re-exports increasing 1.1 percent and 3 percent, respectively,
according to TDB statistics.</P>
      <P>Domestic oil exports, however, fell 16.4 percent during the same
period.</P>
      <P>Non-oil domestic exports, meanwhile, dropped 4.8 percent in May
after a 1.7 percent decline in April.</P>
      <P>The weak performance reflects the continued oversupply of key
electronic products in the global market, as well as the regional
economic crisis which has affected Singapore's exports, the TDB said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NO NEW INITIATIVES ON TAIWAN IN CLINTON-JIANG SUMMIT: ROTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  19 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior US official reassured Taiwan
on Friday that no new initiatives vis-a-vis Taiwan will come up
during President Bill Clinton's upcoming visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and
Pacific affairs, made the remarks while briefing foreign
correspondents stationed here on Clinton's June 25-July 3 mainalnd
visit.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan-related issues will be discussed during the
trip, Roth said: "Well, of course Taiwan will come up. It always
comes up in every meeting at any senior level with the Chinese. But
the question is, I think, from our perspective simply a reiteration
of policy. We do not expect any new initiatives vis-a-vis Taiwan."</P>
      <P>As for Taiwan's worry that there will be a fourth communique or
a fourth joint statement concerning its future to be issued after a
summit meeting in Bejing between Clinton and mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, Roth said there will not be a fourth
communique at this summit.</P>
      <P>Asked if Clinton will take advantage of the upcoming trip to
urge Beijing to renounce the use of force against Taiwan, Roth said
it's pretty clear that the United States, at every opportunity, has
impressed upon Beijing the need for a peaceful resolution of the
Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>"This is a key element of US policy and one on which Beijing can
have absolutely no doubt. I think the United States demonstrated, in
march of 1996, just how clear it was on its determination to see
that this issue only be resolved peacefully by the actions it took
in response to some destabilizing Chinese missile tests. So the
answer is, of course the United States makes its position clear
about a peaceful resolution," Roth explained.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the "six guarantees" the US gave to Taiwan
following the signing of the 1982 Washington-Beijing joint
communique remain valid, Roth said he has tried his best to make it
clear that the US policy toward Taiwan will not be changed because
of Clinton's upcoming mainland visit.</P>
      <P>The "six guarantees" include that the US will continue to
furnish Taiwan with defensive arms, and will not consult with
Beijing prior to its arms sales to Taipei. The US has also promised
not to mediate cross-strait disputes and not to force Taiwan to
negotiate with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Roth further denied that the US will pressure Taiwan to the
negotiating table with mainland China.</P>
      <P>Noting that the security of Taiwan ultimately depends on its
relations with mainland China, Roth said cross-strait disputes are
not an issue that's going to be resolved militarily.</P>
      <P>"It's going to have to be resolved, I think, by virture of the
relationship between both sides of the strait," Roth said.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that the US has consistently encouraged the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait to embark on peaceful dialogue. And this
move should not be interpreted as pressure to Taiwan, Roth added.</P>

      <P>A leading Taiwan researcher said here
Saturday that Taiwan should be cautious, but not overly worried, about
President Bill Clinton's upcoming summit meeting with President
Jiang Zemin in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Shaw Yu-ming, director of the Institute of International

such meetings will not necessarily be harmful to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shaw pointed out that officials of the Clinton administration
have testified in Congressional hearings that the US will not
improve its relations with mainland China at the expense of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said that Washington, while trying to expand engagement
with Beijing, hopes to change communist China into a democratic

card" in the hand of Washington to achieve that goal, he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite the Asian financial
turmoil, Taiwan's investments to Malaysia jumped by 140 percent in
the first four months of the year compared to the same period in
1997, Taiwan economic officials said here Sunday.</P>
      <P>Officials quoting statistics complied from the Malaysian
Industrial Development Bureau said Taiwan is the third-largest
foreign investor in Malaysia with its investments amounting to
US$148.50 million during the four-month period, behind only the
United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>The United States invested a total of US$669.3 million in
Malaysia between January and April, while investment made by Japan
reached US$348.10 million. Other top investors included Singapore,
Switzerland, Germany, Britain and South Korea.</P>
      <P>Taiwan officials said investment from Taiwan focused on the
textile and chemical industries, which account for 35 percent and 32
percent of the total investments, respectively.</P>
      <P>From 1987 to the present, Taiwan took part in 1,540 investment
projects in the Southeast Asian country with a combined value of
US$8.46 billion. The investment figure in 1997 represented an
increase of 54.82 percent from 1996.</P>
      <P>Currently there are about 1,540 firms or factories in Malaysia
are operated by Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>As most of Taiwan businessmen are engaged in export-oriented
business, the depreciation of the Malay ringgit has helped improve
their competitiveness. However, businessmen who are focused on the
local market for income have suffered substantial losses.</P>
      <P>In the face of the ongoing financial turmoil, Taiwan businessmen
have sought Taiwan's help with loans as Malaysia's tight monetary
policy has forced the increase of lending rates to 15 percent.</P>
      <P>Responding to such requests, Taiwan's central bank has announced
that it will offer US$20 million in deposits to overseas branches of
Taiwan-based banking corporations to offer as loans to Taiwan
businessmen.</P>
      <P>ROC Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Chih-kang is currently in
Kuching to attend an Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
ministerial meeting. At the end of the meeting on June 24, Wang will
visit Kuala Lumpur to meet with Taiwan businessmen to gain a better
understanding of their operation and to learn their opinions on what

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan has made great progress in its
democratic reforms and has been very active in providing its people
with human rights protection, a visiting official from Amnesty
International (AI) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Rory Mungoven, an official in charge of AI's Asian Pacific
affairs, made the remarks in an interview with CNA. He is on his
first trip to Taiwan to attend a seminar on Eastern Asian Culture and
Human Rights, sponsored by Fujen University.</P>
      <P>When asked if the Republic of China could be described as the
nation that most values human rights in Asia, Mungoven said Taiwan's
efforts in pushing for human rights protection have been widely
recognized, but he could not say which country was better than
another with regards to human rights.</P>
      <P>While saying democratic political systems and human rights
protection are highly related, Mungoven stressed that this is not
always strictly the case.</P>
      <P>However, it is only through a democratic system that laws and
constitution to protect human rights can be built on a solid legal
basis, he said. The verbal guarantees to human rights protection are
not enough, he noted.</P>
      <P>Mungoven said this is the reason why it is difficult to find
sufficient human rights protection in a communist country like
mainland China. He pointed out that although people in the mainland
are eager to embrace a democratic system, the Beijing authorities
turn a deaf ear to people's voices.</P>
      <P>As to how Beijing could improve its human rights record, Mungoven
said the mainland authorities should abolish communism and practice
democracy, allow international human rights organizations to monitor
the situation there and sign human rights protection agreements with
international organizations such as the UN and AI.</P>

      <P>A seminar sponsored by the Rising People
Foundation to discuss the impact of the coming summit between US
President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
turned into a debate over the "go west" investment policy Sunday.</P>
      <P>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Hsu Hsing-liang
voiced strong support for Taiwan investment in mainland China , while
Y.M. Shaw, an international relations expert, urged caution on the
issue.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who will step down from the party's top post in July, said
Taiwan should set up the three currently banned direct links with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Taiwan, which has a more advanced economy than mainland China,
should not forswear the vast mainland Chinese market, Hsu said,
calling the government's "no haste, be patient" policy regulating
Taiwan investment in the mainland a "big mistake."</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's economy would progress even further and claimed
that establishing the three links would benefit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Shaw, director of the Institute of International Relations (IIR)
under the National Chengchi University, called for a more reserved
mainland investment policy.</P>
      <P>Shaw said Taiwan must take its security into account before
deciding to establish the direct postal, trade, and transportation
links with the mainland.</P>
      <P>He said a "bold go west" investment policy would only hurt
Taiwan, as it is far from its goal of becoming a high-tech island.</P>
      <P>Describing the relations between mainland China and Taiwan as
that of a "sugar and ant," the IIR director said Taiwan investors
must be very careful not to be swallowed up by the vast mainland
market.</P>
      <P>S.C. Hsu, an associate professor of mainland China affairs at the
Chinese Culture University, also is supportive of establishing the
three direct links across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Amid an international globalization trend, Hsu said Taiwan should
seek to create "multilateral links," more than the just "three
links," with the mainland. He said only such creative moves will help
Taiwan gain an advantage in its globalization efforts.</P>

      <P>Ruggiero said the best way to address the worries is through the
system itself.</P>
      <P>"If people, especially young people, say unemployment is too
high, they are right. If environmentalists say growth must be
sustainable -- and not destroy the planet's essential equilibrium --
they are right.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASIAN CRISIS SENDS US TRADE DEFICIT SOARING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los Angeles, June 19 (CNA)
(By Lu-sheng Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Asia's mounting economic troubles took
another big bite out of US exports to that region in April, sending
the US foreign trade deficit soaring to a record level, the Los
Angeles Times reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Commerce Department figures showed that the United States
imported US$14.5 billion more than it exported over the month, up
from a revised US$13.2 billion deficit in March. The increase was
blamed largely on the hard-hit Asian economies which bought fewer US
exports.</P>
      <P>The figures are further evidence that the Asian financial crisis
and its aftermath are likely to have a larger-than-predicted effect
on the US economy, slowing growth from the robust pace of the past
several months.</P>
      <P>The April figures were compiled well before US President Bill
Clinton's initiative this week to help stem the slide of the Japanese
yen in the foreign exchange markets. The yen's decline against the
dollar aggravates the trade imbalance by making US exports to Japan
more expensive and imports from there cheaper.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
Monday that it will evaluate prospects for a visit to mainland China
by ROC President Lee Teng-hui as it arranges for a trip for Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF) Chairman Koo Chen-fu, to be made this fall.</P>
      <P>President Lee first revealed in his 1996 inaugural speech his
willingness to make a so-called "journey of peace" to mainland China,
said MAC Chairman Chang King-yu.</P>
      <P>Lee reiterated his stance during a recent interview with
Time, Chang said.</P>
      <P>Such a visit, however, would require efforts and agreements from
both the Republic of China and mainland China, Chang said, adding
that it is too early to speculate on when Lee's visit will take
place.</P>
      <P>President Lee, backed by Taiwan's 21 million people, has always
wished to visit the mainland because he hopes there will be genuine
peace across the Taiwan Strait, Chang said.</P>
      <P>The cabinet-level MAC is Taiwan's top government agency in charge
of charting the island's mainland China policy, while the SEF is a
semi-official organization that handles negotiations with the
mainland in the absence of formal relations.</P>

      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard
announced on Monday that he will put the One Nation candidate seeking
election in Howard's constituency of Bennelong in Sydney last on his
voting ticket for the upcoming federal election.</P>
      <P>Under Australia's voting system, all major political parties must

      <P>Federal elections are expected in August or September.</P>
      <P>Howard's decision follows One Nation's stunning victory in recent
state elections in Queensland, in which the party captured 11 seats,
two more than Howard's Liberal Party. Howard said he had decided to

      <P>Howard said he hoped fellow Liberal Party candidates would follow
in his footsteps and put One Nation last in their tickets.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DISCORD OVER US-MAINLAND CHINA TRADE LINGERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With US President Bill Clinton's trip to
Beijing less than a week away, the US and mainland China are trying
to resolve one of their prickliest political problems: how to counter
the United States' trade deficit with mainland China, according to
reports from the Geneva-based World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>Both the United States and mainland China calculate the deficit
differently, leading to starkly divergent views of bilateral trade
relations that are at the heart of persistent tension between the two
countries, the report said.</P>
      <P>The United States claims the deficit reached about US$50 billion
in 1997, second only to its trade deficit with Japan, and argues that
Beijing protects its home markets while exploiting US openness.</P>
      <P>Mainland China says last year's deficit was US$16.4 billion and
charges the United States with fiddling with deficit figures to gain
further advantages in mainland markets.</P>
      <P>"The deficits between the two countries are not as big as what
the US side calculated," mainland Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao said Tuesday. Contrary to US figures, mainland China
claims the United States enjoyed a trade surplus with mainland China
from 1988 to 1992.</P>
      <P>Now experts in the two countries are working together to find a
mutually agreeable method of calculating the deficit, Zhu said. He
did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>But the United States, anticipating a flood of inexpensive
exports from Asia, sees its growing trade deficit -- particularly
with mainland China, where the deficit grew 26 percent in 1997,
according to US figures -- as an ever-increasing threat to its
economic well-being.</P>
      <P>Many of mainland China's US-bound products pass through Hong
Kong, but the mainland does not include all of them when calculating
its trade figures. The United States does count them, although it
does not count US products that pass through Hong Kong en route to
the mainland in determining its trade figures.</P>
      <P>Zhu urged the United States to ease restrictions on
high-technology exports to Communist China and lift trade sanctions
against Beijing before Clinton arrives in the country June 25.</P>
      <P>The sanctions and export restrictions, which include a ban on
financial support for US companies in mainland China from several US
government agencies, date back to mainland China's bloody crackdown
on democracy protesters in June 1989. US officials, including US
ambassador to mainland China James Sasser, hinted that Clinton could
announce an easing of such sanctions during his visit, the WTO report
added.</P>

      <P>Singapore could enter a recession if
government efforts to boost the economy are unsuccessful or if the
country cannot withstand pressure from a regional recession that an
ailing Japanese yen may induce, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong warned
on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Pointing to a Japanese economy in recession and a weakening yen,
Goh said the entire region may be plunged into recession within a
year or two as a result of Japan's economic problems.</P>
      <P>"So ask yourself what will happen to Singapore? What will happen
to you? I think we are going to see slower growth," he said in an
off-the-cuff speech at a local community function.</P>
      <P>Goh's comments came a day after the government announced
Singapore's all-important non-oil domestic exports had fallen 4.8
percent last month, after a drop of 1.6 percent in April.</P>
      <P>On Sunday Goh also reminded Singaporeans of the impact that the
economic crisis that has swept through Asia has had on the region's
currencies.</P>
      <P>The Indonesian rupiah has lost 80 percent of its value, while the
Malaysian ringgit and Thai baht have both fallen 35 percent. The
Singapore dollar, meanwhile, has slipped 17 percent.</P>
      <P>Given that Singaporeans are going "to face much more difficult
times ahead," Goh urged Singapore's Community Development Councils to
help families cope with the crisis.</P>

      <P>The Australian dollar is at the mercy of
the Japanese yen and is facing a renewed attack in financial markets
after emergency talks in Tokyo failed to achieve a clear timetable
for reforming the Japanese economy and financial system, economists
said.</P>
      <P>The Australian dollar was trading at 60.86 US cents early Monday
morning, down from 61.38 US cents at Friday's close.</P>
      <P>Japan is Australia's largest trading partner.</P>
      <P>The All Ordinaries Index dropped 4.5 points in early morning
trade on Monday from Friday's close of 2,588.8.</P>
      <P>Despite US intervention last week and a chorus of criticism over
its economic mismanagement, Japan has been resisting intense pressure
from members of the Group of Seven and other Asian countries to give
details of how and when it will stimulate its economy and reform its
financial structure.</P>
      <P>Japan is not only Australia's biggest trading partner but also a
major investor of Australian currency and bonds. Whenever Japan
encounters economic problems, it tends to sell Australian dollars and
bonds, lowering their prices.</P>
      <P>Economists said Japan's indecisiveness will once again hurt the

      <P>An underground
Japanese gang member who was wanted in Japan on weapons charges was
nabbed Saturday in the southern Taiwan township of Fengshan.</P>
      <P>Masayoshi Ishida, an action chief in Yamaguchi Gumi's branch

the Alien Detention Center under the National Police Administration
(NPA) in Taipei on Monday.</P>
      <P>Ishida, who has not committed any crime in Taiwan, has been
detained and will be repatriated back to Japan for overstaying his
visa, NPA officials said.</P>
      <P>According to Fengshan police, Ishida, 34, was very cooperative
with the police when he was arrested in the residence of his
Taiwanese girl friend. The woman, surnamed Lai, lives in Fengshan
with her six-year-old son.</P>
      <P>Ishida, however, refused to disclose why he was wanted by the
Japanese police, and what he has been doing in Taiwan during the past
three or so months.</P>
      <P>According to NPA investigators, Ishida, a veteran gangster who
has been a member of the Yamaguchi Gumi for 18 years, fled to Taiwan
in March this year after he fired two gun shots at a pub in downtown
Yokohama. No one was hurt in the incident.</P>
      <P>Ishida had loaned about NT$6 million to the Taiwanese-Japanese

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States plans to open a channel
for Taipei-Beijing-Washington dialogue after President Bill Clinton's
upcoming visit to mainland China, a senior official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chanirman of the Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), made the statement in a speech on the possible impact on
relations across the Taiwan Strait of the Clinton's June 25-July 3
mainland visit.</P>
      <P>Quoting retired senior American officials, Lin said the Clinton
administration intends to open a channel for delegates from Taipei,
Washington and Beijing to engage in three-way dialogue on
cross-strait issues after Clinton holds a summit meeting with
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing later this month.</P>
      <P>"Several ex-American officials have told me that such dialogue
can be held either in the United States or in an international
setting," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Following the Clinton-Jiang meeting, Lin said he is convinced
that the US will continue to encourage the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait to conduct peaceful dialogue in addition to pushing Beijing
not to use force against Taiwan. "At the same time, I expects the US
to reinforce engagements with Beijing while developing parallel ties
with Taipei."</P>
      <P>As for Beijing, Lin said he believes Beijing will more actively
pressure Taipei to hold political talks in the wake of the
Clinton-Jiang summit meeting. "Beijing is also expected to become
more nimble in handling cross-strait issues," he added.</P>
      <P>Turning to the agenda of the upcoming Clinton-Jiang summit, Lin
said Beijing looks forward to realizing two goals -- demanding the
US to cease arms sales to Taiwan and to enshrine the "three no's"
in a formal document.</P>
      <P>Judging from the current development, Lin said, Clinton is not
likely to sign a fourth joint communique nor promise to change the US
arms sales policy during his mainland visit.</P>
      <P>As for the "three no's", Lin said it remains unclear whether
Clinton will issue a joint statement with Jiang reaffirming the US
opposition to the creation of "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan," the declaration of Taiwan independence and Taiwan's
participation in international organizations involving sovereign
states.</P>

two systems" model could also apply to Taiwan, Ma said.</P>
      <P>Professor Pan Hsi-tang of the Tamkang University said Taiwan
should not be too optimistic about the Clinton-Jiang meeting. He said
the Taiwan issue is bound to be on the agenda in the meeting, and
mainland China knows the US plays a crucial role in the solution of
cross-strait problem.</P>
      <P>Beijing also knows that only through engagement with the US can
it seek cooperation from Washington and undermine its support of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Pan predicted that Beijing will ask the US to abide by the 1972
communique in which the US promised to gradually reduce arms sales to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The US will find it hard to refuse such a demand, Pan said,
adding that if the US complies, then the quality and quantity of US
arms to Taiwan will be cut. This may be made easier as some in the US
have recently advocated cutting arms sales to Taiwan and have said
arms sales have promoted the sentiment of Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Pan noted that if such views gain momentum in the US, then it
would increase the pressure on the US to reduce its arms sales to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kuo Chang-li of the Chinese Cultural University has different
views about the negative effect of the talks, saying that no new
communique will be signed by the two sides, and the US will not
review its policy regarding arms sales to Taiwan at the present
stage.</P>
      <P>Kuo stressed that the US will not turn its back on Taiwan for
now, and the US will not sacrifice the interests of Taiwan because of
pressure from the mainland.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan does not need to pay attention to the "new three
no's" Beijing seeks to get Washington to agree to. These are no US
support for an independent Taiwan, no US support for two Chinas or
"one China, one Taiwan," and no US support for Taiwan's bid to enter
the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Kuo added that Beijing has already been operating under such a
policy toward Taiwan which has not threatened the safety of Taiwan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE MISSION WARNS OF 'THREE NO'S' TREND IN US</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of ROC legislators who just
returned from the US said on Monday bilateral Taipei-Washington ties
may be affected even if there is no public statement on Beijing's
"three no's" demands.</P>
      <P>The "three no's" refer to no US support for an independent
Taiwan, no US support for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan,"
and no US support for Taiwan's bid to enter the United Nations. US
President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin are
expected to discuss the Taiwan issue when they meet later this week.</P>
      <P>Rau Ying-chi, a ruling Kuomintang lawmaker and leader of the
19-member non-partisan delegation, made the remarks at a news
conference after concluding a four-day visit to the United States.
The delegation traveled to the US to express the ROC's position in
the face of the upcoming Clinton-Jiang summit.</P>
      <P>There have been many assurances by the US that Taiwan's interests
would not be sold out in the Clinton-Jiang summit, there would not be
a fourth communique on Taiwan, and Washington will not change its
policy on arms sales to Taiwan. However, Rau warned Taiwan not to
ease its guard on the issues.</P>
      <P>"Even though Taiwan's interests will not be sacrificed in the
Clinton-Jiang meeting, two-way relations between Taiwan and the US
may be affected," Rau said, as "mainland China is playing an
increased role in the US' strategical deployment."</P>
      <P>"Beijing has been actively lobbying Washington, and we cannot
loosen our efforts," the KMT heavyweight said. "Even though
Washington will not publicly declare a statement on the 'three no's,'
the US administration, Congress and media believe that all issues
concerned will be unavoidable trends."</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Rau, who also doubles as executive director of the
KMT's Policy Coordination Committee, was upbeat about the
delegation's trip which took place from June 14-17.</P>
      <P>"What makes us happy is that the ROC's four stances were fully
reflected to the US side and we have gained widespread praise and
support," he stressed.</P>
      <P>During the trip, Rau said all delegates took advantage of every
occasion to explain the ROC's position regarding the Clinton-Jiang
summit when meeting with US officials, congressmen, think tanks, and
media representatives.</P>
      <P>According to Rau, the following four major stances were conveyed
to the US side:</P>
      <P>I -- The ROC is an independent sovereignty and the future of
Taiwan's 21 million people should be decided by themselves. The ROC
strongly opposes any bilateral negotiations on Taiwan between the US
and mainland China and will never accept any agreement reached
between the two sides regarding Taiwan;</P>
      <P>II -- Peace and security across the Taiwan Strait are not only
crucial to Taiwan's future, but also are of great importance to the
US' strategical interests. Taipei wishes Washington can urge Beijing
to renounce its use of force against Taiwan;</P>
      <P>III -- As a strong economic power, Taiwan hopes to take part in
international activities to make a greater contribution to the
international community;</P>
      <P>IV -- Taiwan hopes the US can play a leadership role in tackling
the Asian financial turmoil to help prevent the crisis from further
damaging world peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>Through comprehensive and sincere discussions and exchanges of
opinions, Rau said he and other delegates all deeply felt strong
support and friendship from the US. They were assured that there will
not be changes in the US' arms sales policy to Taiwan and there will
not be a fourth communique on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Delegates such as KMT Legislator Chen Hung-Chi, New Party
Legislators Kao Hui-yu and Tsai Chen-yang, and Democratic Progressive
Party Legislators Hseng Fu-hsiung and Lee Ying-yuan, all hailed the
trip as "successful," saying that they will continue to promote such
overseas visits by lawmakers in the future to win greater
international support.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON'S CHINA STRATEGY SEEN FALLING SHORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles,  June  21  (CNA)
(By Lu-sheng Chu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Few US presidents have worked the
sound bite or photo opportunity better during an overseas trip than
former President Ronald Reagan or President Bill Clinton, the Los
Angeles Times reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>In a front page story entitled "Failure seen in Clinton's
strategy towards China," writer Tyler Marshall wrote that Reagan
stumbled badly only once when he laid a wreath at a West German war
cemetery in Bitburg where members of Adolf Hitler's notorious SS
units are buried.</P>
      <P>Clinton's equivalent could come Saturday, the Washington-based
writer said. Bowing to Beijing's demands, Clinton has agreed to be
officially welcomed in Tiananmen Square, the site of a bloody
military crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in June 1989.</P>
      <P>But unlike in Reagan's case, Clinton's willingness to go through
with the welcoming ceremony has an added dimension -- it is seen by
many as symbolic of a larger failure.</P>
      <P>To a wide cross-section of US foreign affairs specialists, the
decision stands as a striking example of Clinton's inability to reap
benefits from his policy of "engagement." It has been his strategy to
cooperate with Beijing on issues of common interest without letting
serious differences, particularly those on human rights, get in the
way.</P>
      <P>"I can't think of a single situation with regard to Beijing where
the administration hasn't backed off," said Warren Cohen, director of
the Asia program at Woodrow Wilson Center, a Washington-based think
tank.</P>
      <P>"This isn't a poker game, but if you say an issue is important to
you, then you need to get at least something on that issue," Cohen
said. "This administration has gotten nothing out of the Beijing
regime except promises the regime haven't kept."</P>

    <HEADLINE>EX-LIBERAL PM CALLS FOR REJECTION OF ONE NATION PARTY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm
Fraser called on major parties and voters to reject the One Nation
Party because the right-wing party will hurt Australia's foreign
investment, jobs and exports.</P>
      <P>In an article entitled "This Obscenity Must Be Repulsed"
published in The Australian newspaper Monday, Fraser said, "Liberal
compromise with race has resulted in One Nation emerging as the third
largest party in the Queensland Parliament, with more seats than the
Liberal Party."</P>
      <P>He blamed the Liberal Party in Queensland for giving preference
votes to the One Nation Party, which scored a stunning victory on
June 13 by winning 11 seats at the Queensland Legislative Assembly.</P>
      <P>"No decent community can compromise with racist policies. There
is one honorable option: absolute rejection, refusal to cooperate,
refusal to lend credibility to those promoting the evil of racism,"
he wrote.</P>
      <P>Due to the massive defeat in Queensland, Prime Minister John
Howard bowed to internal party pressure and announced Monday that he
would put the One Nation Party last in his constituency at Bennelong
in New South Wales because Asian-Australians have begun to feel
"unwelcome" in their own country.</P>
      <P>Howard said he believed all state branches except perhaps Western
Australia would also put One Nation last in lower-house seats and in
the Senate.</P>
      <P>Almost all of Howard's senior ministers, including Deputy Prime
Minister Tim Fischer, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, Treasurer
Peter Costello, Health Minister Michael Woodridge and Primary
Industrial Minister John Anderson, will not give any preference votes
to One Nation in the federal election.</P>
      <P>However, Opposition Leader Kim Beazley blasted Howard, saying his
decision is "not enough and too late."</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A three-member team from the Ministry of
Justice (MOJ) is currently in France to probe allegations of sexual
misconduct committed by a senior ministry official, Vice Justice
Minister Chiang Hao reported on Monday.</P>
      <P>"The team, headed by Huang Shyh-ming, chief secretary of the
ministry, left for Paris on Sunday and is scheduled to stay there for
one week," said Chiang, who is serving concurrently as the convener
of a special task force set up to investigate the allegations against
Cheng Chuan, acting director of the ministry's Investigation Bureau.</P>
      <P>"The team will try its best to interview Yang Yu-chen, the victim
of the alleged attack, and obtain her medical records," Chiang said.
"It may not be easy to reach these two goals, but the team will
nevertheless do its utmost to win the trust of the Yang family."</P>
      <P>The investigative task force also includes Wu-Chen Huang, an
adviser to the ministry, and Li Tsui-lien, division chief of the
ministry's Department of Rehabilitation and Social Protection.</P>
      <P>The acting chief of the Investigation Bureau has claimed that he
was only trying to cure the daughter of his former friend Yang
Wan-ching with Chikung, a traditional Chinese martial art believed to
have curative powers, during a trip to Paris on Sept. 9-13, 1996.</P>
      <P>Cheng refuted allegations by Yang's wife that he had touched the
girl's breast and private parts under the excuse of administering
treatment to her in his Paris hotel room, causing great distress to
the girl who was then 19 years old and suffering from anorexia
nervosa.</P>
      <P>Although Cheng has categorically denied any wrongdoing, many
questions surrounding the case remain unanswered, prompting the MOJ
to send the team to France to attempt to collect related information
first-hand.</P>
      <P>Chiang said Huang's mission is to maintain lines of communication
with Yang, who is now a French citizen, despite the fact that he has
not shown much interest in working with the investigative task force
on the case.</P>

      <P>The value of orders received by Taiwan
firms from foreign buyers amounted to US$48.32 billion in the first
five months of this year, a reduction of 3.31 percent from the same
period of last year.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-chung, director general of the Statistics Department

attributable to the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>The export orders received in May totaled US$10.04 billion, down
US$400 million or 3.86 percent from the same month of 1997. The

earlier.</P>
      <P>Lee Kao-chao, vice chairman of the Council for Economic Planning

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A killer intestinal virus outbreak that has
claimed the lives of 50 young children around the island in recent
weeks has caused concern among foreign diplomats stationed here,
Foreign Minister Jason Hu said on Monday.</P>
      <P>"To allay their misgivings, we invited a senior Department
of Health (DOH) official to brief them on the current situation of
the enterovirus epidemic this morning," Hu stated.</P>
      <P>A total of 14 foreign ambassadors and 45 representatives from
countries which do not maintain foreign diplomatic ties with the
Republic of China attended the presentation given by Hsu Kuo-hsiung,
acting director of the DOH's Bureau of Communicable Disease Control,
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA).</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, the presentation will help clarify misunderstanding
or speculation about the viral outbreak," the minister noted.</P>
      <P>MOFA Vice Minister David Lee said although many foreign
diplomats have voiced concern about the enterovirus epidemic, none
of them has advised expatriates from his or her home country to
leave Taiwan simply for the outbreak.</P>
      <P>"They only want to get more information in order to help
their fellow countrymen take precautionary measures to protect
their children from contracting the killer virus," Lee said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DOH again demanded all city and county
governments from sponsoring any large-scale activities for children
for the time being as part of efforts to curb the further spread of
the virus.</P>
      <P>Under current ROC law, the DOH has no legal basis to ban local
governments from sponsoring cultural or recreational programs for
children.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Hsu said, it's risky and unwise for local
governments to ignore the DOH's directive and sponsor large-scale
children's programs at the moment.</P>
      <P>"They run the risk of exposing children to the killer intestinal
virus," Hsu warned.</P>
      <P>Hsu also urged local health authorities to intensify
sterilization measures at all swimming pools in their cities or
counties to eradicate the virus. Parents have been advised to
discourage their kids from swimming in public pools.</P>
      <P>In related developments, the kindergarten affiliated to
Taipei's Chang Chun Elementary School decided to close for a week
starting Monday as two of its pupils were confirmed to have been
infected by the virus last week. It was the first kindergartern in
Taipei to have announced a temporary closure since the epidemic
broke out in May.</P>
      <P>Infants and toddlers are most susceptible to enterovirus. Early
symptoms of the infection resemble the flu, with fever, headache,
and vomiting. Ulcers or blisters in the mouth and a rash on the
palms and feet can also develop. Later, possible deadly
complications include encephalitis, meningitis and acute inflammation
of the hear muscle.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Jason Hu said
on Monday that President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in
June 1995 was not intended to cause any conflict between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks when asked to comment on a Washington Post
report on the Taiwan Strait crisis of March 1996, when mainland China
staged war games, including missile tests, in waters near Taiwan, to
protest against Lee's US visit and the holding of the island's first
direct presidential election in March, 1996.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister said that Lee's visit was private and
low-profile, pointing out that the president met with no federal
officials during his visit, while his meetings with governors and
city mayors were made in a private capacity.</P>
      <P>Hu said that Taiwan had not expected the Beijing authorities to
react in such a radical manner to Lee's visit, but he stressed that
Taiwan had not intended to cause trouble. Instead, he claimed, it was
Beijing that created cross-strait tension by suspending regular
cross-strait talks and conducting controversial war games near Taiwan
in the run-up to the presidential election.</P>
      <P>Describing a peaceful Taiwan Strait as the island's biggest wish,
Hu pointed out that the modernization of Taiwan's defenses is aimed
only at enhancing their deterrent force. He added that should any
tension appear in the Taiwan Strait, it is his hope that all
international peacekeeping forces will contribute to helping maintain
peace in the region.</P>
      <P>He also denied allegations contained in the report that Taiwan
spent US$5 million to lobby the US Congress to support the
president's visit to Cornell University, his alma mater. Hu stressed
that for the past 30 years, the US Congress has given Taiwan its firm
and active support as an affirmation of Taiwan's economic and
political achievements.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kuching,  Malaysia,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Chi Ching-lin and Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Economics Minister Wang
Chih-kang on Monday held bilateral talks with US Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky and exchanged views with her on a range of
issues, in particular the question of fishery tariffs.</P>
      <P>Pacific Rim ministers are attending the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum ministerial meeting which opened in Kuching
on Monday, to discuss accelerated free-trade plans in nine specific
sectors.</P>
      <P>Wang and Barshefsky discussed the so-called Early Voluntary
Sectoral Liberalization (EVSL) process, which was launched at the
November Vancouver APEC meeting in an effort to speed up progress
toward APEC's goal of free trade for all countries by 2020.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the EVSL process, the nine sectors in which
negotiators want to lower trade barriers are: environmental goods and
services; gems and jewelry; fishery products; medical equipment;
energy; chemicals; forestry products; toys; and electronic commerce.</P>
      <P>Negotiators have so far failed in their attempts to finalize
details of accelerated free-trade plans in the nine specific sectors,
especially as regards fishery products.</P>
      <P>Mainland China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea have all expressed
their opposition to lowering tariffs on fishery products to zero by
the year 2005, while the United States, New Zealand, Australia, and
Canada have been insisting on the principles of the EVSL plan, in
which the tariff rate should be lowered to zero by 2005.</P>
      <P>As a result of strong opposition from domestic fishery
organizations, the Council of Agriculture (COA) under the Executive
Yuan has suggested the adoption of a different method of calculation
for fishery products, based on substantive tariff reductions
instead of tariff abolition.</P>
      <P>Wang told Barshefsky that Taiwan faces difficulty in lowering
fishery tariffs to zero by 2005. The island currently imposes a
tariff rate of 8 percent, and the COA hopes this rate can be lowered
to 5 percent by 2019.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, at a Sunday meeting on the sidelines of the APEC
meeting, Linda A. Chaves, director of the Industry and Trade Program
of the United States, and Chen Siu-sien, a fishery industry
representative from the southern Taiwan city of Tainan, also
exchanged views on the issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING NOW ASIA'S SOFTWARE PIRACY KING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The US software industry claims that its
piracy-related losses in mainland China more than doubled last year
to over US$1.4 billion, according to reports from the Geneva-based
World Trade Organization (WTO) on Monday.</P>
      <P>Mainland China also displaced Japan as the largest source of
piracy losses in Asia, despite the fact that there are more installed
software applications in Japan, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>The reason is mainland China's 96 percent piracy rate -- far
higher than the 32 percent rate reported for Japan. The figures are
contained a study released by the US Business Software Alliance and
the Software Publishers Association.</P>
      <P>Japan led Asia as a source of such losses until 1996, when it
accounted for nearly US$1.2 billion in unauthorized software use.
Last year, though, stronger copyright enforcement trimmed piracy
losses to US$752 million. The sheer growth in mainland China's
computer use, without any improvement in copyright observance, has
sent losses in the mainland soaring.</P>
      <P>In mainland China, "the basic problem is that computer sales are
far outpacing software sales," the WTO report quoted Mark Traphagen,
a spokesman of the Software Publishers Association, as saying. The
group attributes much of the industry's losses in mainland China and
elsewhere to "workplace piracy." That typically occurs when a company
obtains a program legitimately but makes numerous unauthorized copies
for its employees.</P>
      <P>Unless these trends are reversed, US Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky will be authorized to impose trade sanctions on
mainland China, the report added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW PARTY MAYORAL CANDIDATE REITERATES DETERMINATION TO RUN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition New Party's candidate for
the Taipei City mayoral election, Wang Chien-shien, on Monday
reiterated his determination to run for office, despite a low support
rate revealed in a number of recent surveys.</P>
      <P>Wang said that Taiwan's social value system is decaying, posing a
serious threat to the country. He claimed that rebuilding a social
value system based on credibility, justice, and love, is in the
nation's best interest.</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks when he opened his campaign office to the
media, to rebut a suggestion made last week by Hsu Li-nung, dubbed
the party's "spiritual leader." Hsu had called on Wang to think of
teaming up with ruling Kuomintang candidate Ma Ying-jeou in a joint
effort to beat incumbent mayor Chen Shui-bian of the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party, saying that the national interest
should be higher than an individual's credibility.</P>
      <P>Wang said that he would take advantage of the mayoral election to
let the people realize the importance of credibility, stressing that
it is more important than whether one runs in or wins an election.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Jaw Shau-kong, the New Party's campaign manager for
year-end legislative, mayoral and city council deputy elections,
stated flatly that if Wang drops out of the election, the party might
as well dissolve, saying: "Who else is willing to be nominated by the
party? Who else is willing to support the party?"</P>
      <P>Jaw went on to say that the party must be represented in the
mayoral election, otherwise it will lose a good chance to promote its
policies. He added that Wang will submit his first administration
paper on Tuesday, in which he will offer a proposal on improving
Taipei City's notorious traffic.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAYORAL CANDIDATE SEEKS COOPERATION WITH KMT YOUTH AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  22 (CNA)
(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang (KMT)'s Taipei City
mayoral candidate Ma Ying-jeou on Monday paid a courtesy call on Lai
Kuo-chou, director-general of the KMT Department of Youth Affairs, to
seek opportunities for cooperation.</P>
      <P>They exchanged views on topics ranging from housing projects for
single young people, youth demographics, and traffic issues.</P>
      <P>Concerning the problem of so-called "snails without shells" --
people unable to afford Taipei's astronomical real estate prices --
Lai suggested that in the future, the city government could adopt the
build-operation-transfer (BOT) method to construct houses for single
young people.</P>
      <P>Ma pointed out that as far back as when he was serving as justice
minister, he noticed that there was not enough affordable housing for
single personnel employed in his ministry. He said that as a result,
fewer and fewer people like working and living in Taipei.</P>
      <P>According to his understanding, Ma said, the city's population is
falling by about 20,000 people each year, but the numbers of
automobiles and motorcycles on the roads have not shown a comparable
downward trend.</P>
      <P>Both men agreed on the difficulties posed by the city's traffic
problems. Ma noted that while Singapore has adopted a "flow volume
control" system to solve the city-state's traffic problem, he and Lai
agreed that people here might not adapt themselves to such a system.</P>
      <P>The mayoral hopeful also expressed special concern for the city's
young voters. According to statistics, young residents in the 20 to
39 age group now account for more than 50 percent of Taipei City's
eligible voters.</P>
      <P>He and Lai exchanged their experiences of serving youngsters in
the past, and discussed possible plans for cooperation in the
year-end elections.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In an unprecedented gesture to businesses

Monday unveiled a package of soft loans worth NT$420 billion
(US$12.35 billion).</P>
      <P>The provincial government, which is facing dissolution at the end

small- and medium-sized enterprises and NT$120 billion (US$3.52
billion) to first-time house buyers.</P>
      <P>The loans will be extended through the seven banks controlled by
the provincial government at a rate which is O.375 percent to 1.25
percent lower than the current one, and is expected to stimulate the
island's stagnating real estate market.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong, who has been criticized

    <TEXT>
      <P>Although it does not anticipate any
surprises from the upcoming Washington-Beijing summit, Taiwan's
Cabinet has set up a special working group to monitor closely the
talks in Beijing which begin on Saturday.</P>
      <P>David Tawei Lee, vice minister of foreign affairs, said after the
first meeting of the working group at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MOFA) that the group, made up of officials from the National
Security Council and the Mainland Affairs Council, as well as MOFA
personnel, will greet the summit results immediately with appropriate
measures and statements.</P>
      <P>Noting that the ROC government is "cautiously optimistic" that
the summit will not result in any harm to the island's interests, Lee
said Taipei will take no chances and will pay close attention to US
President Bill Clinton's talks with his Beijing counterpart Jiang
Zemin. He said the government will keep a variety of responses up its
sleeve to meet any possible scenario.</P>
      <P>Washington has promised to debrief Taipei on the summit after
Clinton winds up his June 25-July 3 trip to mainland China, said Lee,
but he refused to disclose the identity of the US official who will
come to Taipei to conduct the debriefing.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an anonymous ROC official said that the summit will
result in a "fact sheet" listing the agreements reached, rather than
a "communique," which is more formal and therefore has more binding
force.</P>
      <P>This fact sheet will not include the worrisome "three noes,"
policy, which refers to Beijing's desire for US promises not to back
Taiwan independence, not to back the "one China, one Taiwan" or "two
Chinas" formulas, and not to back Taiwan's entry into international
organizations, said the official.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he said, Taiwan is taking nothing for granted, and
will brace for the worst.</P>

years ago when she was just seven months old.</P>
      <P>Kartya's birth mother, identified only as Mrs. Hsu, and Kartya's

the media and the Criminal Investigation Bureau, Kartya was finally

established their relationship.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Hsu said that her gratitude to Mr. and Mrs. Wunderle was

      <P>Mr. Wunderle said that he was impressed by the assistance and
warmth extended by the people of Taiwan to her daughter, adding that
he is delighted by the happy outcome. Mr. Wunderle arrived in Taiwan

      <P>According to Mrs. Hsu, Kartya was sold to an illegal adoption
broker by her biological father for NT$36,000 at a time when she was
unmarried and already had another daughter. Kartya's biological

      <P>US President Bill Clinton will not meet
with dissidents during his state visit to mainland China, hinted US
State Department spokesman James Rubin on Monday,</P>
      <P>Rubin said the president can promote improved human rights

      <P>Stanley Roth, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and

dissidents. However, White House national security advisor Samuel
Berger's response to recent media questions left an impression that
officials may have given the idea a second thought.</P>
      <P>In Monday's State Department news briefing, there were questions
over whether the US government would reconsider the propriety of a
meeting between Clinton and mainland Chinese dissidents or families
of the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre.</P>
      <P>Questions regarding the president's itinerary and its possible
revision must be made through the White House, Rubin said.</P>

that they can achieve their goal of promoting better human rights

    <HEADLINE>GIO HEAD SAYS ROC DESERVES BETTER AND MORE FAIR TREATMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Mark Ou)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A free and democratic Republic of China
deserves better and more fair treatment from the international
community, a government spokesman told an international panel on
Monday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, ROC Government Information Office director
general, said Taiwan should at least be allowed to join non-political
international organizations such as the World Health Organization
(WHO). Beijing recently blocked efforts by Taipei to join the WHO as
an observer.</P>
      <P>Chen made the comments in a discussion of Taiwan's foreign and
security policy held at the Royal United Services Institute for
Defense Studies. In his keynote speech, the government spokesman said
as the ROC is now better off, it wants to be a useful member of the
international community and play a more positive role in the world.</P>
      <P>Being not a member of international organizations, Taiwan has
been excluded from many important global endeavors. Its offer to
provide aid to Rwanda was rejected, as was a donation to UNICEF, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>It has been made clear that Beijing has no intention of changing
its hostile behavior toward Taipei now or in the foreseeable future.
The blocking of Taiwan's entry to WHO is only one recent example,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>"This is certainly most unfortunate at a time when we are trying
to resume the cross-strait dialogue and to improve relations," he
added.</P>
      <P>People in Taiwan "want to be treated fairly, justly and with
dignity and not as second class citizens," he said.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan now enjoys full democracy, the government simply can
not ignore the public's demand for "international status commensurate
with their country's importance in the global economy, and with the
contributions the ROC is making to regional stability and world
peace."</P>
      <P>The diplomat-turned government spokesman said Taipei's foreign
and security policies are "directed at ensuring our continued
survival and development as we consolidate democracy on Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Efforts by the international community to bring Beijing further
into the international order are "fine as long as they do not involve
sacrificing the interests of democratic countries such as mine which
respect human rights," he added.</P>

      <P>Johannesburg has accused a British
newspaper of fabricating a report on a secret deal for weapons and
military parts in return for lower oil prices between South Africa
and Libya.</P>
      <P>In a statement issued Monday, the presidential office said
neither President Nelson Mandela nor the government and its agencies
had entered into any talks -- let alone concluded any deals -- with
Libya on an arms-for-oil agreement as reported by the London Sunday

      <P>If such a decision were ever made, the government would publicly
declare its intentions and fully state its reasons for doing so, the
statement said.</P>
      <P>It added that "what is utterly disgusting about this article is
that it is a pure fabrication, invented by the newspaper and its
unnamed sources .... Besides the other untruths contained in the
article, the references to chemical and biological weapons defy the
imagination."</P>
      <P>The government said it would have expected a newspaper that
claimed a measure of integrity to have at least tried to verify its
information with South African government officials.</P>
      <P>"We are therefore compelled to conclude that those who elected to
peddle these untruths are either part of a massive disinformation
campaign against our new democracy, or they have allowed themselves
to be used in such a campaign," the statement said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton will not sign a
communique with mainland China that relates to Taiwan in his upcoming
visit to the mainland, ROC Vice Foreign Minister David Lee said on
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said US policy-making officials have openly stated or assured
Taiwan in the past month that the US will not sign a fourth
communique. They said the US will not hurt the interests of Taiwan
nor change its arms sales policy toward Taiwan, he added.</P>
      <P>On the likely result of Clinton's meeting with his mainland
counterpart Jiang Zemin, Lee said that he believes that the US would
not sign the fourth communique with the mainland.</P>
      <P>It is also unlikely that the US will commit to any written
statement regarding the "three no's" when Clinton meets with his
mainland counterpart Jiang Zemin, Lee said.</P>
      <P>The "three no's" refer to no US support for Taiwan independence,
no US support for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", and no US
support for Taiwan's bid to enter international organizations that
require sovereign statehood.</P>
      <P>The US would at most issue a "fact sheet," which Lee said is not
as binding as a communique or joint statement.</P>
      <P>He said as the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are poised to
resume talks, any gesture that shows the US is leaning favorably
toward mainland China could affect the prospect of resumed
cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>Lee reiterated the ROC government's position toward the
Clinton-Jiang talks, saying that he hopes the US government will
continue to abide by the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, the six promises
to Taiwan in 1982 and the review of policy toward the ROC in 1994.</P>
      <P>The ROC has no intention of interfering with US efforts to
develop relations with mainland China, he added. In fact, it is
happy to see that the Clinton-Jiang talks will contribute to peace in
the Taiwan Strait, stability in the Asia Pacific region, and
contribute to reforms, democracy and human rights in the mainland.</P>
      <P>But he stressed the engagement between Beijing and Washington
should not be conducted at the expanse of the ROC, and should not
have any negative impact on ROC-US relations.</P>
      <P>Lee urged the US to develop parallel relations with the ROC as it
engages with the mainland, adding that the ROC cherishes the
same ideals of human rights, freedom and democracy as does the US.</P>

missiles into the Taiwan Strait in March 1996 as Taiwan was preparing
for its first popular presidential election, it brought relations
between Beijing and Washington to a nadir.</P>
      <P>At that time, US officials including then US Defense Secretary
William Perry, then US Secretary of State Warren Christopher and then
national Security Advisor Anthony Lake all voiced warnings of "grave
consequences" -- an implied military response -- if Beijing were to
attack Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The report detailed how the US handled the missile crisis and how
the face-off over Taiwan later led to a strategic partnership.</P>
      <P>Yeh Wan-hui, researcher at the Heritage Foundation, said Charles
Freeman, former assistant secretary of defense, who is a major source
in the Washington Post story, affected the views of the report.</P>
      <P>Yeh identified two fallacies in the story. The report states that
the US Congress, after a "US$5 million lobbying campaign by Taiwan,"
voted overwhelmingly to grant President Lee Teng-hui a visa to visit
the US. Yeh said if US lawmakers could be bought, then all bills
could clear through the Congress without hitch.</P>
      <P>The second fallacy was that President Lee's visit to the US alone
led to the missile crisis and the deteriorating relations between the
US and mainland China, Yeh said.</P>
      <P>But he noted that even under Beijing's new "three no's" policy,
the US has not prohibited high-ranking Taiwan officials from visiting
the US.</P>
      <P>The "three no's" refers to no US support for Taiwan independence,
no US support for a "one China, one Taiwan," and no US support for
Taiwan's bid to enter international organizations that require
statehood.</P>
      <P>Clinton was lauded by the American public for his decision to
order a large contingent of US naval ships into the region as
tensions across the strait grew, Yeh said. Freeman is now offering
his opinion which may become more common among US policymakers if it
is not refuted.</P>
      <P>James Przystup, director of Asian Studies Center of the Heritage
Foundation, said that he believes the US Congress and most Americans
do not support the views of Freeman nor those of Joseph Nye, a former
assistant secretary of defense.</P>
      <P>Both have recently written that Washington should review its arms
sales policy to Taiwan. Nye also suggested that the US explicitly
warn Taipei that if the island were to declare independence, the US
would not provide protection.</P>
      <P>John Tai, research associate of the Center for International and
Strategic Studies, said policy-making circles in Washington are not
very clear on the real goals behind President Lee's "pragmatic
diplomacy" and believe the stalled cross-strait talks should be
blamed on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tai said the US government will not likely change its current
policy and it will play a more aggressive role in cross-strait ties,
but Taiwan should not give the impression that it is dragging its
feet to resume talks and should display more sincerity in
cross-strait dialogues.</P>

    <HEADLINE>17 US CONGRESSMEN URGE CLINTON NOT TO CODIFY 'THREE NO'S'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  22  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Seventeen members of the US House of
Representatives have sent a joint letter to President Bill Clinton
urging him to reject Beijing's proposal to codify the so-called
"Three No's" policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The congressmen, led by Rep. Peter Deutsch (D-FL), addressed the
letter to Clinton on June 19, a week before his departure for a
high-profile state visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>"First, we urge you to reject any plans to codify any aspect of
US policy toward Taiwan which would deny Taiwan's existence as a
separate political entity and deny the Taiwanese people their right
to self-determination as defined in Article 1 of the United Nations
charter," the congressmen said in the letter.</P>
      <P>More specifically, they asked Clinton to refrain from a
commitment to formalize the three policy points generally referred to
as the "three noes." These are: no support for the "One China, One
Taiwan" policy, no support for Taiwanese independence, and no support
for Taiwan's membership in international organizations.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the congressmen urged Clinton to call on Beijing to
renounce the use of force against Taiwan and to cease blocking
Taiwan's bids for membership in international organizations such as
the United Nations, the World Health Organization and the World Trade
Organization.</P>
      <P>More important, the congressmen said, Clinton should reaffirm to
Beijing the terms of the Taiwan Relations Act with regard to both the
continuation of arms sales to Taiwan and the peaceful resolution of
disputes across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The other 16 signatories to the letter were Gerald Solomon
(R-NY), chairman of the House Rules Committee, Sherrod Brown (D-OH),
Tom Lantos (D-CA), Peter King (R-NY), Dan Burton (R-IN), Steve Chabot
(R-OH), Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), Bob Wexler (D-FL), Rober Andrews
(D-NJ), Steve Rothman (D-NJ), Donald Payne (D-NJ), Brad Sherman
(R-CA), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Howard
Berman (D-CA) and Pete Sessions (R-TX).</P>
      <P>Twelve influential senators also sent a smiliar letter to
Clinton earlier this month reiterating their opposition to enshrining
the "three noes" in any formal document during Clinton's June 25-July
3 mainland visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CLAIMS FLEXIBILITY IN APEC FISHERY TALKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kuching, Malaysia, June 23 (CNA)
(By  C. L. Chi and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan seems to be demonstrating
greater flexibility in its stance on fishery tariffs in an industry
and trade ministers' meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum, which officially opened Monday.</P>
      <P>Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States proposed the
Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization package at last November's
APEC meeting in Vancouver to promote free trade in 15 sectors among
all member countries by 2020. Nine sectors, including the fishery
industry, were selected as priority targets whose customs duties are
scheduled to be slashed to zero by 2005.</P>
      <P>Following a series of sideline meetings over the past few days,
Taiwan, mainland China and South Korea, which had been opposed to
eliminating the tariffs, seem more flexible, although Japan, in
response to strong domestic pressure, continues to oppose the plan.</P>
      <P>Republic of China Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang left
Kuching to visit Kuala Lumpur Tuesday morning, missing the day's
meeting. Attending in his place were ROC Vice Economic Affairs
Minister Li Yi-fu and Board of Foreign Trade Director-General Chen
Juei-long.</P>
      <P>Fishermen Rights Promotion Association representative Chen
Hsiu-hsien, who took part in a sideline APEC meeting on Sunday,
complained about Wang's absence from Tuesday's meeting. Under APEC
rules, ministers who do not voice objections to the plan are
considered as agreeing to it.</P>
      <P>Wang did discuss the proposal in a sideline meeting with US Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky on Monday. Saying Taiwan remains
flexible toward the issue, Wang told Barshefsky that it is hard for
Taiwan to lower fishery tariffs to zero by 2005. Implementation of
the plan should be carried out only after all member states have
agreed to it.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's softening of its stance has been widely viewed as a
result of US pressure, since the island is close to signing a formal
agreement with the United States on its bid to join the World Trade
Organization.</P>
      <P>The ROC Council of Agriculture arranged for Chen and Barshefsky
to meet on Tuesday to assuage the discontent of the Taiwan's fishery
sector. No agreement, however, was reached during the meeting.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently maintains an average customs duty of 8 percent
on fishery imports. The COA has said that it hopes to lower duties to
5 percent by 2019.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, officials with the ROC Ministry of Economic Affairs
were reluctant to comment on whether Wang will meet with ranking
Malaysian government officials during his stay in Kuala Lumpur,
saying only that the minister will pay a visit to Malaysia's
"multimedia super corridor."</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui met with Madame
Dagmar Havlova, first lady of the Czech Republic, on Tuesday for
wide-ranging talks in an amicable atmosphere.</P>
      <P>During their meeting, President Lee expressed admiration and
respect for Czech President Vaclav Havel for his dedication to
promoting democracy, freedom and human rights both in his writings
and throughout his political career.</P>
      <P>Lee also lauded Madame Havlova for her operatic achievements and
for her charitable work.</P>
      <P>Madame Havlova had been a prima donna at the Theater Vinohrady in
Prague before she married Havel, a playwright-turned-politician.
Havlova now devotes herself to charity work.</P>
      <P>Lee said although one may play different roles at different
stages of life, the basic spirit is consistent. "I think the most
important is to enrich one's mind and spiritual life," he said.</P>
      <P>The president told Madame Havlova that he has initiated numerous
reforms, particularly spiritual reforms, in recent years in hopes of
building Taiwan into a mature democracy in which all people lead
prosperous, peaceful and spiritually enriched lives.</P>
      <P>Madame Havlova arrived in Taipei Monday for an eight-day private
visit in the company of first daughter Nina Veskrnova, her husband
Shalev Ad-EI and a four-member entourage.</P>
      <P>While here, Madame Havlova will visit the National Fu Hsing
Dramatic Arts Academy, the National Palace Museum, a
government-funded Chinese herbal research center and the Buddhist
Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Czech first lady will meet with local business
and industry leaders to solicit Taiwan investment in her home
country.</P>
      <P>The Czech Republic recognizes Beijing but maintains friendly,
substantive ties with the Republic of China. President Havel once
appealed in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly for the
Republic Of China's re-entry to the world body.</P>
      <P>ROC Vice President Lien Chan made a private visit to Prague in
1995. Hualon Textile Co., one of Taiwan's largest textile companies,
has set up a production facility in the central European country, and
the state-run Aerospace Industry Development Corp. has signed a
joint-venture deal with Prague-based Aero Vodochody Co. to produce
small aircraft.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JAPAN SET TO OVERHAUL ITS EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,   June  23  (CNA)
(By Mike Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Japan enters the next century,
large-scale changes are planned for its educational system, with
reductions of nearly one-third to its elementary and junior high
school curriculums.</P>
      <P>The Curriculum Council, an advisory council to the Education
Ministry, made public Monday its revised draft of the government's
guidelines.</P>
      <P>"With the report, Japan's education will make a major turn, as
schools shift from a place for teachers to teach to a place for
students to actively learn," said Shumon Miura, chairman of the
advisory panel, after submitting the report to Education Minister
Nobutaka Machimura Monday afternoon.</P>
      <P>Under the draft, which will be finalized in July, Japan's
educational system will likely become more individualized, empowering
local schools to make many of their own decisions for the first time.
For example, schools will determine for themselves how much classroom
time will be allocated to each subject.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed changes, students graduated from elementary
schools are expected to have mastered only 825 Chinese characters
compared to 1,006 at present. As for senior high schools, the number
of credits required for graduation will be reduced from 80 to 74.</P>
      <P>To help students better cope with the country's push toward
internationalization, the report suggests that a foreign language
course other than English be made mandatory for junior and senior
high school students. It also suggests introducing foreign cultures
and English as part of general studies in elementary schools.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senior diplomatic officials denied reports
on Tuesday that some foreign business people have evacuated their
children from Taiwan because of the outbreak of a killer intestinal
virus.</P>
      <P>"Although the foreign community here has shown concern about the
enterovirus epidemic, we have not been informed that business people
from any foreign country have evacuated their kids simply for that
reason," said a Foreign Ministry official.</P>
      <P>Ann Breiter, acting spokesperson for the Taipei Office of the
American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), or the de facto US embassy in the
Republic of China, told CNA that the office has no plans to evacuate
children of American expatriates despite the viral outbreak.</P>
      <P>Breiter further said the AIT even has not advised US nationals
to evacuate their children from Taiwan. "We have just suggested
them to contact Taiwan's health authorities, particularly the
Department of Health, for detailed information about the epidemic,"
she added.</P>
      <P>The AIT also has not issued any travel warning to discourage
ordinary American people from traveling to Taiwan for the time
being, Breiter noted.</P>
      <P>"We plan to brief US nationals here on the current situation of
the enterovirus epidemic, but the exact briefing date has yet to be
decided," said Breiter, who attended a Foreign Ministry-sponsored
briefing on the epidemic on Monday.</P>
      <P>Among all major countries, the United States has the largest
number of expatriates in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Many other foreign embassies and representative offices also
said they have not advised their nationals to evacuate their
children from Taiwan to shun the epidemic.</P>
      <P>A spokesperson for the Canadian representative office told CNA
that many young foreign students have left Taiwan for their home
countries in recent days simply because the Taipei American School
began summer vacation last week.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Canadian government regulations, the
spokesperson said the Canadian office has informed Canada's Foreign
Ministry and health authorities of the enterovirus outbreak
here. "However, we have not advised Canadian people not to
travel to Taiwan for sightseeing or business," he added.</P>
      <P>Canadians were informed in an official travel bulletin issued on
June 16 that the enterovirus outbreak has been reported in Chile,
the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan. The bulletin also said
children under 12 years of age are susceptible to the virus and that
there are already casualties in Taiwan. The bulletin only provides
information and does not discourage Canadians from traveling to this
island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an official with the Mexico's representative office
in Taipei said he cannot confirms a newspaper report that some
Mexican diplomats stationed here have sent their children back to
their home country to protect them from being infected by the killer
virus.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus outbreak has so far claimed the lives of at
least 50 babies and toddlers in Taiwan. Although the number of
enterovirus infections has declined here, health officials said, it
will take one more month or two before the warning against the
epidemic can be lifted.</P>
      <P>Infants and young children are most susceptible to enterovirus.
Early symptoms of the infection resemble the flu, with fever,
headache and vomiting. Ulcers or blisters in the mouth and a rash on
the palms and feet can also develop. Later, possible deadly
complications include encephalitis, meningitis and acute
inflammation of the heart muscle. Parents are advised to keep their
children away from public places, and make sure that their children
change clothes and wash hands frequently.</P>

      <P>Hong Kong's airport is seen as dangerous because of the number of

    <HEADLINE>NO LINK BETWEEN ENTEROVIRAL INFECTION AND FMD EPIDEMIC: DOH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan health officials on Tuesday denied a
possible link between the enteroviral infection that is affecting
mainly infants, and the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic that
decimated the island's hog population last year.</P>
      <P>Hsu Kuo-hsiung, acting director of the Bureau of Communicable
Disease Control under the Department of Health (DOH), said it is very
clear that the enterovirus that has claimed the lives of at least 50
children is totally different from the FMD virus that swept Taiwan's
pig farms last year.</P>
      <P>Several professors at National Chengkung University Hospital in
Tainan, southern Taiwan, suspect that the enterovirus might be
related to, or a mutant of, the FMD virus. They said that the
inefficient methods used to dispose of nearly 4 million FMD-infected
pig carcasses last March might have contaminated the ground water in
certain areas.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Wen-ju, one of three epidemiologists called in earlier this
month from the US Disease Control and Prevention Center to assist in
tracking down the cause of the outbreak, agreed with Hsu's statement.
Hsieh said that the FMD virus only affects cloven-hoofed animals and
is not communicable to humans.</P>
      <P>Panicked parents have been pressing the authorities to tell them
whether the epidemic has been brought under control. Last Monday, the
DOH announced that the epidemic was abating, evidenced by a
descending curve in the official death toll. However, just four days
after the announcement, seven more children fell victim to
complications caused by the infection, such as pulmonary edema,
meningitis, encephalitis, or inflammation of the heart.</P>
      <P>Alarmed by the new fatalities, which included the first death in
eastern Taiwan's Ilan County, the DOH has suggested that children's
summer camps and festivals be scrapped immediately in an effort to
curb the spread of the epidemic. They also advise parents not to take
children aged under 12 to swimming pools.</P>
      <P>The identity of the virus is of great concern. On June 16, the
DOH said the results of an autopsy on an 8-year-old girl confirmed
that enterovirus type-71 was behind the viral epidemic. The autopsy
revealed the presence of enterovirus type-71 in the girl's spinal
cord and medulla. However, subsequent autopsies failed to isolate the
virus, and DOH officials said more autopsy results will be needed to
confirm the cause of the epidemic for sure.</P>
      <P>Hsu stressed that the fact that no enterovirus type-71 has been
found does not necessarily mean the victims did not succumb to the
virus, pointing out that inefficient sampling or poor cultivation
methods could lead to inaccurate results.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to allay public anxiety, the officials pointed out
that most infected children who develop the common symptoms of fever
and an ulcerated rash on the hands, feet and mouth, will recover,
although they warned that if they develop an unrelieved high fever,
nausea, headache, rapid breathing, and lack of appetite, parents
should take them to see a doctor.</P>
      <P>According to the latest statistics issued by the DOH on Tuesday
afternoon, the virus has so far claimed the lives of 50 children,
with 248 children still hospitalized. Northern Taiwan has reported
126 cases with 18 deaths, the central area has 77 reported cases with
26 deaths, the southern area 42 cases with five deaths and the
western area three cases with one death.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND) said
on Tuesday that the ROC armed forces will temporarily suspend all
large-scale military exercises planned for late June as part of a
trimming program due to start on July 1.</P>
      <P>MND spokesman Kung Fang-ting said at a regular news conference
that the decision has nothing to do with the upcoming summit between
US President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
later this week, and called on the public not to speculate over the
reason behind the move.</P>
      <P>Kung added that the MND informed all concerned parties of the
decision as far back as April, when it ordered all troops to suspend
large-scale military maneuvers and live-fire training drills from the
end of June in order to more efficiently carry out the trimming
program scheduled for the second half of this year.</P>
      <P>The MND spokesman also denied a recent report by the Washington

over Taipei City during the 1996 missile crisis in the Taiwan Strait.
He said it would be impossible for a ballistic missile to pass

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN, HK ACTIVISTS SET SAIL FOR DISPUTED ISLANDS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Braving bad weather, activists from Taiwan,
Hong Kong and the United States set sail for the disputed Tiaoyutai
islands in the East China Sea Tuesday evening in a further attempt to
claim them as Chinese territory.</P>
      <P>The ships operated by activists from Taiwan and Chinese
communities in the US left the Shenao fishing port near Juifang
township on northern Taiwan coast at 8 p.m.</P>
      <P>They were later joined by the 100-ton vessel Diao Yu Tai, with
some 30 Hong Kong activists aboard, in waters near the northern
Taiwan port of Keelung. The Diao Yu Tai left Hong Kong last Sunday.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that Taiwan and Hong Kong activists have
launched a joint camptain after the former British colony reverted
to mainland Chinese rule last July.</P>
      <P>Taipei County Councilor Chin Chieh-shou, also leader of the
Taiwan activists, said prior to his departure for the Taioyutais
that they originally planned to start the voyage on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"After careful considerations, we decided to advance the
departure time in hopes to reach the destination early in Wednesday
morning," said Chin, a member from the right-wing New Party.</P>
      <P>"Hopefully, we can break Japanese coast guard's blockade and land
on one of the uninhabited islands before dawn," Chin said, adding
they intend to remove a wooden Japanese national flag erected there
last year.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Chin led a group of activists to protest
Japan's control of the disputed islands in front of the Japanese
Interchange Association (JIA), which represents Japanese interests
in Taiwan in the absence of formal diplomatic ties.</P>
      <P>A JIA official accepted a protest letter from the demonstrators.
This was the first time that the de facto Japanese embassy here had
given a goodwill response to such protests. "Against this backdrop,
we have decided not to take with us crossbows on our trip to the
Tiaoyutais," Chin said.</P>
      <P>He further said all Taiwan activists agree with a recent
overture by the Japanese consul-general to Hong Kong that the
disputes surrounding the islands be resolved through peaceful,
rational consultations.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, the target Japan intends to negotiate is
apparently mainland China. We must remind the Japanese that the
Tiaoyutais are under the jurisdiction of the Ilan County Government
under the Republic of China," Chin said.</P>
      <P>Chin made the assurances that the activists will declare
Chiense sovereignty over the Tiaoyutais in a peaceful,
rational manner. "We hope Japanese coast guard patrol boats will not
ram our vessels this time. Otherwise, we'll stage a long-term sit-in
in front of the residence of the de facto Japanese ambassador to
Taiwan after we return from the trip."</P>
      <P>In October 1996, Chin and other Taiwan and Hong Kong activists
made a brief landing on one of the disputed islands and planted two
flags, one each from the Republic of China and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Japanese coast guards, however, forced the activists away from
the islet and removed the flags.</P>
      <P>Last year, a group of Taiwan and Hong Kong activists, also
led by Chin, was prevented from approaching the islands by a large
number of Japanese coast guard patrol ships and military helicopters.</P>
      <P>The annual landing attempts by Taiwan and Hong Kong activists
began after the ultra-rightist Japanese Youth Federation erected a
makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands in July 1996 and Japan
later included the Tiaoyutais in its 200-mile exclusive economic
zone.</P>
      <P>The event also marked the death of David Chan, a Hong Kong
activist who drowned after jumping into the sea when Japanese coast
guard vessels blocked his ship near the archipelago in September
1996.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A "wolf man" from Mexico was awarded an
honorary diploma from a primary school in the central Taiwan city of
Taichung on Tuesday for his dedication to public services.</P>
      <P>Jesus Manuel Fajardo Aceves, who has been called "wolf man"
since childhood because his face is shrouded in thick, dark hair as
a result of a genetic disorder, said he was excited by receiving the
first school diploma in his life.</P>
      <P>"It's a dream come true," said an emotional Fajardo when he
received the honorary diploma from Hsu Hsien-chung, president of the
Wen Hsin Elementary School in Taichung. "Only two words --
appreciation and gratitude -- can describe my feelings at the
moment."</P>
      <P>The Spanish-speaking 24-year-old Mexican further said he
highly cherishes the diploma even though he cannot read the Chinese
letters printed on it. "The diploma serves as a stimulant to
encourage me to pursue further study."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Hsu said the school has decided
to present an honorary diploma to the 24-year-old Mexican man in
recognition of his optimism, urge to learn and devotion to public
services.</P>
      <P>"The move is also aimed at calling for government attention
to educational problems surrounding the underprivileged," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>Fajardo has received only three years of formal education
because of proverty and his extraordinary appearance. He arrived in
Taiwan in April for a six-month goodwill visit at the invitation of
the Guinness Museum of World Records in Taichung.</P>
      <P>A victim of hirsutism, a genetically inherited disorder which was
passed down by his great grandmother, Fajardo said he was generally
shunned by society as a youth.</P>
      <P>Fajardo, who stands 160 cm tall, became a circus performer
shortly after leaving a primary school in Mexico at the age of 13.
He said he is satisfied with his current way of life and has no
intention of seeking to change his appearance.</P>
      <P>Fajardo got married during his years as a circus performer, but
the marriage did not last, and before coming to Taiwan, he had been
living with his mother and his five-year-old daughter in a Mexican
village. His family now makes a living from farming.</P>
      <P>This is the first time he has lived alone for such a long time
abroad, although he has previously enjoyed brief visits to Japan and
Brazil.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AI URGES TAIWAN TO ABOLISH CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Amnesty International (AI) on Tuesday urged
Taiwan to abolish capital punishment, while appealing for the lives
of three of the island's death row inmates.</P>
      <P>AI Asia representative Rory Mungoven told a press conference
called by Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Fan Hsun-lu that
various studies by both the United Nations and Taiwan itself show
that execution is not an effective crime deterrent.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan carried out 16 executions in 1995, 22 in 1996,
and 38 in 1997, Mungoven said the island uses capital punishment more
often than many other countries which, he said, does not match the
giant strides the country has made in expanding freedom of speech,
political rights, and the right of free association.</P>
      <P>The much-used capital punishment and "widespread torture" against
suspected criminals underlines the faulty system for human rights
protection in Taiwan, said Mungoven.</P>
      <P>In addition to the abolishment of the death penalty, he
recommended the establishment of an independent human rights
committee to advise the government on human rights-related issues and
to carry out investigations into complaints of human rights abuses
carried out by police, military and other authorities.</P>
      <P>The new measures would not harm the island's social stability, he
said. On the contrary, they would help improve Taiwan's social and
democratic development and earn the country international plaudits.</P>
      <P>At the same press conference, Mungoven also appealed for the
lives of Su Chien-ho, Liu Ping-lang and Chuan Lin-hsun, who were
sentenced to death for robbing, raping and murdering a couple in
Taipei County in 1991.</P>
      <P>Calling their trial "the most unfair ever seen," Mungoven
implored President Lee Teng-hui to order a probe into allegations of
police torture in the case and to commute their sentences.</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton's willingness
to attend a ceremonial welcome in Tiananmen Square and his decision
to prop up the Japanese yen are indications that the leader of the
world's only superpower is kowtowing to mainland China over its
threat to devalue the renminbi, according to a recent story in the
Australian Financial Review.</P>
      <P>"Today, we stern capitalists are placing great faith in the
willingness of the People's Bank to be a 'good international citizen'
and not wreck havoc on the global financial system by devaluing the
yuan," wrote author Brian Toohey.</P>
      <P>He said Mao Zedong's theory of power growing out of the gun
barrel is wrong and the power now resides in the People's Bank of
China, which was amply demonstrated by President Clinton's
willingness to attend the ceremonial welcome in Tiananmen Square on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Earlier Toohey attributed US intervention in currency markets,
aimed at propping up a sagging Japanese yen, to mainland China's
hints that further declines in the yen's value might prompt mainland
China to devalue its currency.</P>
      <P>"Clinton's priorities are clear. Given that it was only nine
years ago that the PLA (People's Liberation Army) crushed the
democracy movement in Tiananmen massacre, the symbolism of his
decision to start his six-day visit to China in the square is
unmistakable," Toohey wrote.</P>
      <P>Jean-Michel Severino, a senior official of the World Bank, urged
mainland China not to devalue its currency while touring Australia
last week, Toohey noted.</P>
      <P>Regardless of Clinton's wishes, however, the markets are now
putting intense pressure on mainland China to devalue to improve its
competitiveness.</P>

that the hotel, one of the city's leading landmarks, will not only
regain its clout as the country's leading hotel, but will also
solicit more visitors from abroad.</P>
      <P>Siew for his part saluted the hotel as unique in the whole world,
and praised its significant contributions to the Republic of China's
diplomatic efforts.</P>
      <P>Its "rebirth" is a shot in the arm to Taiwan's tourism industry,
and is poised to raise the island's international competitiveness in
this sector, Siew noted.</P>
      <P>The Grand Hotel, founded by Mme. Chiang 46 years ago as a state
banquet venue, boasts nine banquet halls, six restaurants and 500
distinguished guest rooms. Its recreational facilities include an
Olympic-sized swimming pool, tennis courts and bowling alleys.</P>
      <P>The hotel, renowned as a "modern architectural delight in a
classical Chinese palace style," is now in the hands of a superb

      <P>Taiwan's unemployment rate stood at 2.37
percent in May, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) under the Executive Yuan announced on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The figure was 0.14 percentage points lower than that of the same
month of last year, but after a seasonal adjustment, the figure rose
slightly to 2.53 percent, about 0.16 percentage points lower than
May, 1997.</P>
      <P>During May, a total of 225,000 people were out of work, 8,000
more than in the previous month. Cheng Suo-liang, a DGBAS official,
attributed the increase to closures or downsizing of businesses, as
well as the end of the seasonal work period.</P>
      <P>The official said the nation's overall workforce hit nearly 9.28
million in May, up about 138,000 from the same month of 1997.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the average period of unemployment in May averaged 21
weeks, a week longer than in April. Among the unemployed, first-time
job seekers remained jobless for 24 weeks, about one week longer than
in the previous month, while other job seekers took an average of 20
weeks to find employment, similar to the previous month's figure.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS statistics also show that Taiwan's labor participation
rate stood at 57.84 percent in May, the lowest level in 14 years. The
May figure was 0.03 percentage points lower than that of April, and a
drop of 0.16 percentage points from the same month in 1997.</P>
      <P>Cheng attributed the continuous decline to earlier retirement
among laborers, as well as longer terms of employment.</P>

      <P>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) would
be happy to arrange a trip to Taiwan for Li Yafei, deputy
secretary-general of Beijing's Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS), an SEF official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>However, any plans for such a visit should be submitted to the
SEF by letter rather than via a telephone call, said Jan Jyh-horng,
SEF deputy secretary-general.</P>
      <P>Jan was responding to news reports that Taiwan had failed to
reply to a request from Li to visit the island.</P>
      <P>Li is said to have telephoned the SEF last week to request
permission to visit in July at the head of an education inspection
delegation from Beijing.</P>
      <P>Jan said he was not in the office when the call was made, adding
that subsequent checks with the Ministry of Education, Ministry of
the Interior, and Bureau of Entry and Exit, failed to confirm the
scheduled arrival of any Beijing education groups in July.</P>
      <P>Since the proposed trip was not on record, Jan said, he was under
no obligation to reply to an unconfirmed telephone request.</P>
      <P>Although the current rules require two or three months to process
applications for visits by groups from mainland China, Jan said the
SEF would be prepared to coordinate the related agencies to speed up
their procedures in order to accommodate Li's July itinerary.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan would welcome a visit by Li, as it

    <HEADLINE>ILLEGAL ARMS SUPPLIER NABBED IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 23 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A man suspected of selling firearms to Chen
Chin-hsing, Taiwan's most notorious criminal, was nabbed on Tuesday,
allowing the police to draw a clearer picture of the series of crimes
committed by Chen and his accomplices.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Tah-lung, 43, was arrested at his Peitou apartment early
Tuesday morning on charges of arms trafficking and dealing, although
the police failed to find any weapons at Hsiao's residence, and Hsiao
denied having sold guns to Chen.</P>
      <P>However, according to Chen, who was arrested some seven months
ago for a spate of crimes ranging from kidnap, rape, and murder, to
the holding hostage of a South African diplomat and his family, Hsiao
sold him weapons on three occasions from 1996 onwards.</P>
      <P>In three separate deals, Chen said, Hsiao had supplied him with a
total of 17 guns at a price of NT$250,000 (US$7,353) apiece, as well
as more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Most of the deals were
conducted at Hsiao's company, an air-conditioning firm in downtown
Taipei, or in the parking lot of the Taipei World Trade Center.</P>
      <P>The police suspect Hsiao of being one of the elements of an arms
smuggling ring in northern Taiwan which is believed to have smuggled
hundreds of guns into the country in a single operation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IT PRODUCT TARIFF TALKS AT KEY JUNCTURE IN WTO</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Geneva, June 23 (CNA)
(By Maurus Young)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Global talks to eliminate all import duties
on more than 400 information technology (IT) products enter their
final crucial phase on June 26 at the World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>The talks face a June 30 deadline to reach agreement on which
products will be included on an extended list that will be attached
to the original 1997 Information Technology Agreement (ITA), a WTO
report said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The US, the world's top exporter and importer of IT products,
stands to reap huge benefits if an accord is reached to extend the
ITA product coverage.</P>
      <P>In 1996, US exports of IT products totaled US$104.6 billion,
while US imports of IT products reached US$140.6 billion.</P>
      <P>Products proposed for possible zero tariffs by 2000 include
machines for making and testing semiconductors, automatic teller
machines, telephone answering machines, fiber optics, and parts for
IT products.</P>
      <P>Expectations are running high that the talks will end on a
successful note following the progress reported in the last round of
talks held in Geneva on June 5. During those talks, mainland China,
which in 1996 exported IT products worth US$17.2 billion and imported
IT products totaling US$13.9 billion, submitted its initial draft
list, the WTO report said.</P>
      <P>The US welcomed the move, but noted that Beijing needs to do
more, as quite a number of products were missing from its list, trade
officials said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of youths from the Aboriginal Bunun
tribe in central Taiwan are preparing to challenge the highest peak
in Southeast Asia in August as a test of their physical strength and
ability.</P>
      <P>The 15 youngsters, aged between 9 and 13, are scheduled to leave
for Malaysia on Aug. 17 and will prepare to scale Mount Kinabalu
which stands 4,100 meters above sea level in the northeast part of
Sarawak and Sabah.</P>
      <P>Most of the members of the group have already scaled Taiwan's and
Northeast Asia's highest peak, Mount Jade. They were selected from 40
youngsters who have received mountain-hiking training since last
November.</P>
      <P>According to team coach Wu Ah-hao, a Bunun tribeswoman in her 40s
and a trained athlete from the Taipei Physical Education College, the
youths are good hikers because of their Bunun blood. The Bunun
people, indigenous to Mount Jade and Taiwan's Central Mountain Range,
are brave people and are born athletes, she said.</P>
      <P>To qualify for the team, each member had to pass a two-week test
in steep hiking conditions in Tatajia, a 2,400-meter range of Mount
Jade. After the Tatajia test, the youths ran up the 2,881-meter Lulin
Mountain. Those who could not sustain the physical challenge failed
to make the team.</P>
      <P>Team leader Wu Hung-sheng, 12, said he wants to challenge Mount
Kinabalu for his father, a Bunun mountain climber who died during a
rescue mission in Hsuehshan, a high-altitude mountain range in
central Taiwan several years ago.</P>
      <P>Other members include Wu Li-wei and Wu Shih-wei, 11-year-old twin
brothers, who come from a mountain climbing family. Their grandfather
carried the bronze statue of Yu You-jen, a former president of the
Control Yuan, the Republic of China's highest watchdog agency, to the
top of Mount Jade where it now sits.</P>
      <P>Among the 15 youths, four are girls. Their gender by no means
makes them physically inferior to their boy peers, coach Wu said.</P>

      <P>Two groups of activists demonstrated in
front of the American Institute in Taiwan's (AIT) Taipei office
Wednesday, urging the US not to sell out Taiwan during President Bill
Clinton's visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>The activists were led by Wang Shih-chien, an adviser to the
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and Taipei City
Councilor Chen Shueh-fen, respectively.</P>
      <P>They demanded the United States not to sacrifice or sell out
Taiwan's interests during Clinton's summit meeting with his mainland
counterpart, Jiang Zemin, in Beijing later this week.</P>
      <P>Wang presented a petition signed by more than 10,000 local
citizens to acting AIT Taipei Office Director Lloyd Neighbors. The
signatures were collected by the Action Alliance against Annexation
in the past few days.</P>
      <P>Chen, a member of the ruling Kuomintang, also gave Neighbors a
petition expressing strong opposition to Beijing's proposed
codification of the so-called "three no's" policy. The "three no's"
refers to no US support for a "One China, One Taiwan," no US support
for Taiwan independence and no US support Taiwan's membership in the
United Nations.</P>
      <P>Neighbors promised to pass on the petitions and convey their
messages to concerned US authorities.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wang invited staff members of the AIT Taipei office to
take part in an all-night, candlelight vigil at the 2-28 Peace
Memorial Park in downtown Taipei starting Wednesday evening.</P>
      <P>"The vigil, to be organized by the Action Alliance against
Annexation, is aimed at reminding Clinton not to impair Taiwan's
interests during his June 25-July 3 mainland visit," said Wang, chief
executive of the alliance.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei would welcome improved ties between
Washington and Beijing if it helped maintain peace and stability in
the Asia-Pacific region, a Republic of China government spokesman
said here Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, head of the ROC Government Information Office,
made the remarks during an interview with the British Broadcasting
Corp.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the planned meeting between US President Bill
Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin later this week in
Beijing, Chen said the ROC welcomes the meeting if it does not hurt
Taiwan's interests and is helpful to the region.</P>
      <P>Although improvement in Washington-Beijing relations does not
mean a retrogress in Washington-Taipei ties, he said, the ROC is very
concerned about the meeting between Clinton and Jiang.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has made noticeable progress in economic
development in recent years, but the international community should
take into account that it still lags far behind in the area of human
rights and democracy, Chen said. He urged Beijing leaders to improve
in these areas and catch up in these world trends.</P>
      <P>The ROC government spokesman also pointed out that the "one
country, two systems" formula implemented in Hong Kong is not suited
to Taiwan and the Taiwan people will never accept such a system.</P>
      <P>Stressing that Taiwan's economy remains strong amid the Asian
financial turmoil, Chen said the ROC is willing to help other
Southeast Asian countries through the crisis to create greater
prosperity in the region.</P>
      <P>Chen will proceed to Spain after concluding his visit here on

      <P>The 1998 Asia-Pacific Regional Conference
of Amnesty International (AI) opened Wednesday in the northern Taiwan
county of Taoyuan, some 30 kilometers south of Taipei.</P>
      <P>Addressing the opening ceremony, Taoyuan County Magistrate
Annette Lu, a political dissident-turned-politician, spoke highly of
AI's contribution to political democratization around the world and
global humanitarian relief work over the past 37 years.</P>
      <P>Lu also credited the organization with giving much needed
assistance to a number of Taiwan's former political dissidents and
prisoners in their fight for the island's transformation from an
autocracy to a full-fledged democracy.</P>
      <P>"Nearly all of jailed Taiwan political dissidents in the martial
law era, including myself, had received AI's assistance or rescue,"
Lu recalled. Taiwan lifted martial law in 1987.</P>
      <P>Lu, a former legislator from the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), said she is delighted to see AI convene its
annual Asia-Pacific regional meeting in her hometown.</P>
      <P>More than 60 representatives from 18 countries, including
Pakistan, Syria, Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, South Korea,
the Philippines, New Zealand, Australia, the United States and the
host Republic of China, are participating in the three-day AI
conference.</P>
      <P>This is the first time the London-based human rights promotional
organization has held its annual regional meeting on the island.</P>
      <P>As a sign of her gratitude for AI's previous assistance, Lu said
she has pooled resources from several private groups to sponsor a
party to give thanks to the group at the Taoyuan County Cultural
Center on Wednesday evening.</P>
      <P>Many former political dissidents, including incumbent DPP
Chairman Hsu Hsin-liang, DPP Chairman-elect Lin Yi-hsiung, will also
attend the party to express their gratitude to AI. Several local
performing arts troupes, including an aboriginal dancing workshop,
will perform folk music and dances to entertain party goers.</P>

      <P>Australia's commodity exports will drop
by over 1 percent in fiscal 1998-99 thanks to the Asian crisis and
Japan's recession, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics (ABARE) said in its updated forecast.</P>
      <P>In its June-quarter outlook, ABARE predicted a 1.2 percent fall
in Australia commodity exports to A$64.5 billion (US$40.3 billion) in
1998-99 following a rise of 7.3 percent in fiscal 1997-98.</P>
      <P>ABARE said the Japanese economy would contract by 0.7 percent in
1998 and grow by just 1 percent next year. It also forecast China's
economic growth at only 6 percent this year, down from the earlier
rate of 7.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The latest ABARE report estimates South Korea's economy will
contract by 3 percent compared to the earlier zero percent.</P>
      <P>The lower than expected growth in these three countries will
definitely affect Australia's commodity exports, ABARE officials
said. Japan is Australia's largest trading partner, South Korea is

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four members of a group of Hong Kong
activists attempting to land on the disputed Tiaoyutai Islands in the
East China Seas were reported missing on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The four men, who joined others from Taiwan to highlight Chinese
sovereignty over the islands, were aboard the 100-ton vessel Diao Yu
Tai along with 26 other Hong Kong activists Wednesday morning.</P>
      <P>The four took off in a rubber boat at around 10 a.m. about 12
miles away from the islands in an attempt to get closer to the
islands so they could swim ashore.</P>
      <P>The Diao Yu Tai lost contact with the four men as chaos ensued as
a group of Japanese coast guard patrol boats circled and rammed the
vessel at about 10:30 a.m., according to Taipei County Councilor Chin
Chieh-shou, leader of the Taiwan activists.</P>
      <P>Fortunately, the vessel did not suffer any leakage from the
damage, Chin said.</P>
      <P>As of noon Wednesday, neither the Diao Yu Tai nor any of the
three Taiwan fishing boats trying to make a landing attempt had heard
from the four -- Chuang Li-kun, Lin chuo-kuang, Ku Ssu-yao from Hong
Kong, and Wu Xiaoming from mainland China, Chin said. All four were
reportedly equipped with diving gear.</P>
      <P>Chin's group aboard the three fishing boats had also failed to
land on the islands as of noon Wednesday. Chin said the four vessels
would not return to Taiwan until the four missing activists were
found.</P>
      <P>The Tiaoyutais are a group of uninhabited islands about 200
kilometers northeast of Taiwan and 300 kilometers west of the
Japanese island of Okinawa. They are claimed by Japan, mainland China
and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chin, along with other Taiwan and Hong Kong activists made a
brief landing on one of the disputed islands in October 1996. During
that landing, Chin and his friends planted two national flags, one
each from the ROC and the PRC. The banners were soon dismantled by
the Japanese, however,</P>
      <P>In September 1996, David Chan, a Hong Kong activist, drowned
after jumping into the sea when Japanese coast guard vessels blocked
his ship from the archipelago.</P>
      <P>Patriotic sentiments in Taiwan and Hong Kong were prompted by the
construction of a makeshift lighthouse on one of the islands in July
1996 by the ultra-rightist Japanese Youth Federation. Japan later
included the Tiaoyutais in its 200-mile territorial zone.</P>
      <P>Japan claims its control of the Tiaoyutais began in 1972 when the
United States, which had administered the islands along with Okinawa
since the end of World War II, passed on the control of the islands.</P>
      <P>The Chinese claim the Tiaoyutais have for centuries been a part
of Chinese sovereignty and were most recently under the jurisdiction

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton's visit to
China this week will weaken the dictatorship and hasten the demise of
Chinese communists, according to British author Robert Elegant.</P>
      <P>In an article headlined "Clinton Scales China's Wall," in
Wednesday's The Australian newspaper, Elegant wrote that US
cooperation with Beijing on the international front will help the two
sides take action against Asia's economic problems, moderate the
nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan, and put pressure on
North Korea to resist increasing tensions in the region.</P>
      <P>"Paradoxically, perhaps, Clinton's visit will also accelerate,
however slightly, the political effect of China's commercial,
financial and technological opening to the outside world: The erosion
of Beijing's power," Elegant wrote.</P>
      <P>"New information and ideas must be permitted entry if industry
and trade are to continue to expand. Thus the Clinton visit, in the
long run, will further weaken the dictatorship it strengthens in the
short run," he said.</P>
      <P>Elegant said as commerce, finance and industry grow in
importance, political factors decline. However, Beijing still rules
the country with harsh authoritarian methods in the provinces and
will continue to do so for as long as it can.</P>
      <P>With this trip, Clinton risks being seen as another humble envoy
obedient to the mainland leadership unless he speaks out forcefully
for more freedom of expression and greater democracy in the
government of China, Elegant wrote.</P>

same period last year, according to figures the Singapore Department
of Statistics released Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Food prices rose by 0.4 percent in May based on higher prices for
leafy vegetables while clothing prices rose by 0.9 percent due to
dearer ready-made garments and footwear. Meanwhile, housing
costs fell by 0.8 percent as a result of lower electricity tariffs,
the department said.</P>
      <P>Transportation and communication costs were 0.4 percent higher in
May over the previous month, but declined by 3.4 percent compared to
May 1997 due to lower prices for vehicles.</P>

    <HEADLINE>QANTAS BANS PAULINE HANSON FROM INFLIGHT NEWS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Qantas Airways plans to censor its
inflight news programs to exclude coverage of Independent Member of
Parliament Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party after receiving a
complaint over "unacceptable" news items.</P>
      <P>The Sydney Morning Herald daily on Wednesday quoted Qantas public
affairs head Bernard Shirley as confirming that an inflight
entertainment office staff had written to Channel Nine's program
manager Michael Healy last Friday, asking the network to eliminate
any reference to Hanson and her party in the news bulletins.</P>
      <P>Shirley said the letter was sent after a Qantas staff member
returning to Australia complained about inflight news items he found
"unacceptable."</P>
      <P>The unnamed staff member, who was returning to Australia from
Indonesia, felt the news items about Hanson and her party were
offensive to Indonesia passengers on the flight.</P>
      <P>Channel Nine initially resisted Qantas' request but later agreed
after receiving a clarification from Shirley, who explained that
Qantas does not want "(Channel Nine) to include reports which contain
material that is offensive to any particular ethnic group."</P>
      <P>"You will appreciate that in providing services to people from
throughout the world, we try to ensure that we do not offend them
through insensitivities in our inflight video programs," Shirley said
in a letter to Channel Nine's news director Paul Fenn.</P>
      <P>Hanson was reportedly angry over the Qantas ban. Her adviser
David Oldfield was quoted by the daily as saying, "It was a
disgraceful, un-Australian activity asking Channel Nine to be
political censors on behalf of Qantas."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE TO UNVEIL OFF-BUDGET MEASURES MONDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore will unveil its package of
off-budget measures aimed at reducing business costs and helping
companies cope with financially difficult times on Monday in
Parliament,</P>
      <P>Singapore's Second Minister for Trade and Industry Yeo Yong Bong
made the announcement Tuesday night.</P>
      <P>The measures will be introduced to help businesses rather than
pump prime the economy or stimulate the country's consumption, he
said.</P>
      <P>"Preliminary figures from the second quarter show that growth
momentum continues to slow down.</P>
      <P>"The expected growth rate for this year will have to be revised
downward, although it is still not likely to be negative," Yeo said,
referring to the government's earlier forecast that economic growth
for this year would be in the 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent range.</P>
      <P>Off-budget measures are tools governments use to tackle
unexpected economic situations that arise after the annual budget has
been approved. They may include tax rebates, infrastructure spending
or tax cuts.</P>
      <P>Singapore's Finance Minister Hu Tsu Tau told the Parliament
earlier this month that the decision to implement comprehensive
off-budget measures would be taken if preliminary second-quarter
figures pointed to a significant economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Last week, a senior official of the Monetary Authority of
Singapore said the growth forecast for the year would be revised
downward to the lower end of the 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent range.</P>
      <P>Private sector analysts have been more pessimistic. Some have
forecast a recession in Singapore's economy later this year.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a dinner at Business Week's 8th Annual Asia
Leadership Forum last night, Yeo said Singapore was exposed to the
regional crisis even though it had no external debt and its banks and
financial institutions were among the strongest in Asia.</P>
      <P>Whatever measures the government takes, "Singapore can not be
fully insulated from the regional crisis", he said.</P>
      <P>"Unlike 1985-86, the causes of this economic downturn are largely
external to us and beyond our control," he added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Two leading liquefied natural gas (LNG)
companies in Darwin, Australia have accelerated their development
plans so they can export to the Chinese mainland, India, Taiwan,
Japan and South Korea a year ahead of scheduled.</P>
      <P>Shell Australia and Woodside Petroleum's development of a A$10
billion (US$6.25 billion) project is expected to be completed in 2004.</P>
      <P>Shell chief executive Roland Williams and Woodside chief
executive John Akehurt will travel to mainland China in July to secure
a long-term contract to supply LNG.</P>
      <P>They said mainland China and India are the major targets for
potential LNG sales because both countries are expected to import LNG
in the next several years as their economies will demand more power
stations to cope with the economic development projects.</P>
      <P>"China and India hold considerable promise for growth in gas/LNG
demand as third generation markets," Williams said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The Australian Financial Review, Australia's leading business
daily, Tuesday quoted Williams as saying that: "By 2010, growth in
markets of Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, India and China could push
annual LNG demand in the region beyond 140 million tons. Of course,
the Asian crisis will affect energy demand in the region in the short
to medium term."</P>
      <P>In addition to promoting sales of their LNG to mainland China and
India, Shell and Woodside also plan to export LNG to Taiwan, which is
interested in diversifying its import sources from Australia.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has long-term contracts now with both Indonesia and
Malaysia and imports millions of tons of LNG. But the island
country is also interested in buying the fuel from Australia.</P>

      <P>A Taiwan high school junior has been
selected as one of three Gold Award winners of the 1998 Discover Card
Tribute Award Scholarships worth US$20,000.</P>
      <P>Susane Ko, a student at the Taipei American School, was one of
over 11,000 students who applied for the Tribune Award Program this
year. This scholarship program honors US high school juniors who
exhibit excellence in many areas of their lives, not just academics.</P>
      <P>Ko, who was born with anchondroplasia, a form of dwarfism, moved
with her family to Taiwan from the United States when she was in
elementary school. She spoke very little Chinese and could read and
write only in English when she arrived in Taiwan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>US Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has reassured congressional leaders that the United States
will not "sell out" Taiwan during President Bill Clinton's visit to
mainland China, an influential congressman said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman (R-NY), chairman of the Committee on
International Relations of the House of Representatives, made the
statement after a breakfast meeting with Albright. Several other
senior House and Senate members were also present at the
meeting.</P>
      <P>Gilman said Albright had briefed them on the agenda of Clinton's
June 25-July 3 mainland visit.</P>
      <P>He also quoted Albright as saying during the meeting that for
mainland China, Taiwan is certainly a major topic in its engagements
with the US.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing hopes the US changes its policy toward Taiwan,
Gilman said: "Albright reiterates that the US policy toward Taiwan
remains unchanged."</P>
      <P>According to Gilman, Albright had assured congressional leaders
that Clinton will reaffirm to Beijing that the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait should resolve their disputes through peaceful
dialogue.</P>
      <P>"Albright also assured us that the US is unlikely to sacrifice
Taiwan's interests during Clinton's summit talks with his mainland
counterpart, Jiang Zemin," the House heavyweight said.</P>
      <P>Gilman further said the Congress will demand the executive branch
abide by its promises to Taiwan. "The people of Taiwan do not need to
worry too much about Clinton's mainland visit. Congress will protect
them," he added.</P>
      <P>The House passed a non-binding concurrent resolution earlier
this month, urging Clinton to take advantage of his upcoming
mainland visit to push Beijing to renounce the use of force against
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Clinton is scheduled to leave Washington on Wednesday and will
arrive Xian, the first leg of his nine-day mainland visit, on

      <P>ROC National Assembly Speaker
Fredrick Chien arrived in the US on Tuesday, where he denied reports
that he will convey messages regarding relations between Taipei and
Washington.</P>
      <P>Chien's visit has aroused much media speculation because it is so
close to US President Bill Clinton's mainland China trip, and in
light of his high official position and background. He is a former
foreign minister.</P>
      <P>Chien strongly rebuffed the speculation when he met the press at
San Francisco airport en route to the annual meeting in Denver of the
World Forum, a convention sponsored by the American Enterprise
Institute.</P>
      <P>He said the meeting, which is designed to help world business
leaders understand issues of worldwide concern, was scheduled a year
ago, and thus has nothing to do with Clinton's trip.</P>
      <P>Since the meeting is not open to outsiders, Chien refused to
disclose what he plans to say during the June 25-28 session. However,
he admitted that Beijing-Washington relations, and relations across
the Taiwan Strait, will certainly be mentioned.</P>
      <P>The World Forum will be presided over by former US President

Minister Margaret Thatcher, former French President Valery Giscard

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 24 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign trade continued to fall in
the first five months of this year as the Asian financial crisis has
continued to grip the region by the throat, the Board of Foreign
Trade (BOFT) reported on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the January-May period, Taiwan's exports amounted to US$45.38
billion, down 6.9 percent from the same period of 1997, while imports
totaled US$44.63 billion, down 2 percent.</P>
      <P>As a result, the island was left with a trade surplus of US$750
million in the five-month period, a record 76.6 percent decline over
the same period of a year ago, BOFT officials said.</P>
      <P>The US remained Taiwan's largest export market in the five
months, absorbing US$11.52 billion-worth of Taiwan goods, up an
insignificant 0.6 percent from the year-earlier level. Meanwhile,
imports from the US declined 5.2 percent to US$8.87 billion, leaving
Taiwan with a surplus of US$2.66 billion in the five-month period.</P>
      <P>Exports to Hong Kong amounted to US$10.31 billion, down 5.4
percent, while imports totaled only US$810 million, up 5.8 percent
from the same period of 1997, giving Taiwan a trade surplus of
US$9.49 billion with Hong Kong, and making the area Taiwan's largest
source of surplus in the world, the officials noted.</P>
      <P>Exports to Japan dropped a worrisome 22.5 percent to US$3.94
billion in the January-May period, while imports grew 1 percent to
US$11.55 billion, leaving the island with a deficit of US$7.62
billion.</P>
      <P>Exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations fell a
whopping 26.3 percent to US$4.86 billion, while imports dropped a
slight 1.8 percent to US$5.28 billion.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's two-way trade with the European Union in the five-month
period was the only sector which proved profitable for both exporters
and importers. Exports to the EU totaled US$7.64 billion, up 6.2
percent, while imports increased 2.1 percent to US$7.23 billion.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taiwan's exports and imports in the first 20 days in
June fell by 3.4 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, from the same
period of 1997, to US$6.5 billion and US$6.2 billion, respectively,
the officials said.</P>

capacity as chairman of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT), on Wednesday
received Ma Ying-jeou and Wu Den-yih, the party's mayoral candidates
for Taipei and Kaohsiung cities, respectively, and pledged full party
support in the year-end elections.</P>
      <P>Lee told the mayoral hopefuls that the whole party will support
them, and that Chen Chien-chih, speaker of the Taipei City Council,
and Wu Poh-hsiung, senior advisor to the president, have already
begun to organize election headquarters, as well as a support system,
for Ma.</P>
      <P>The KMT chairman advised Ma that he should have more contact with
the party grassroots and seek assistance from officials, experts and
his comrades, in order to fully understand Taipei City administrative
affairs. According to Lee's observations, a candidate's high
popularity does not necessarily add up to more votes.</P>
      <P>He also instructed both candidates to join forces with candidates
for the legislative and city council elections, in the hope that
voters will cast their votes evenly for all KMT candidates in all
three elections.</P>
      <P>Ma said after the meeting that Lee was very candid and that his
directives and observations were sincere, to the point, and helpful.
He pledged to do his best to strengthen his advantages and to reduce
his shortcomings.</P>
      <P>For his part, Wu said Lee is quite concerned about both him and
Ma, as evidenced by his inviting them to the meeting. The incumbent
mayor of Kaohsiung expressed his appreciation for Lee's encouragement

      <P>The New Taiwan Alliance issued a strong
public declaration on Wednesday imploring Washington not to sell out
Taiwan's interests during Saturday's Beijing summit between US
President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Legislators Chen Yung-hsing and Hsu Tien-tsai, both from the
pro-independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party, called a
news conference to make public the declaration.</P>
      <P>Chen and Hsu said the New Taiwan Alliance, a political
organization which promotes Taiwan independence, welcomes the meeting
between Clinton and Jiang if it can help boost peace and stability in
the Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>However, the alliance is strongly opposed to the signing of any
joint communique or statement on the "three noes" issue which might
hurt Taiwan's interests, they pointed out.</P>
      <P>The alliance also raised three other points in the declaration:</P>
      <P>-- The US should continue arms sales to Taiwan in compliance with
the "Taiwan Relations Act" to maintain peace in the region;</P>
      <P>-- Taiwan's future and sovereignty must be decided by its 21
million people without any outside interference or control;</P>
      <P>-- The country should be allowed to join the United Nations under
the name of "Taiwan," and the international community should help
Taiwan play a more constructive role on the world stage.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who has just returned from a lobbying trip to the US, said
that although the US has given repeated assurances that there will be
no public statement on Beijing's "three noes" demand, no one can

      <P>US President Bill Clinton's decision to
receive military honors from his communist Chinese hosts at Tiananmen
Square -- site of the bloody 1989 crackdown -- continued to meet with
protests Tuesday from leaders of Congress and various civic groups.</P>
      <P>In a statement to the press, House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., said that he and 61 of his colleagues in the House
of Representatives have called on Clinton to make human rights the
central topic of his nine-day visit to mainland China which starts on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Gephardt also urged Clinton to use all the leverage at his
disposal, including sanctions, to promote American national interests
and values.</P>
      <P>During a Congress press conference Wednesday afternoon, Clinton
was urged to raise the issue of talks with the exiled Tibetan
spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, deliver a speech in remembrance of
the Tiananmen massacre victims, visit some of the victims' families,
and demand that Beijing release political and religious prisoners.</P>
      <P>Xiong Yian, a mainland student leader who was jailed for 19
months for his part in the 1989 pro-democracy protest, also attended
the press conference. He implored Clinton not to forget Beijing's
mass killings and not to embrace the mainland Chinese dictators.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, "Free China Movement" members staged separate protests
in front of the mainland Chinese embassy and the White House, where
an open letter to Clinton was read which contained the following four
appeals:</P>
      <P>-- Pressure Beijing into releasing all prisoners jailed for their
pro-democracy beliefs;</P>
      <P>-- Demand that the mainland authorities recognize their mistake
in conducting the June 4 military oppression at Tiananmen Square and
punish those responsible for the killing;</P>
      <P>-- Ask mainland China to allow freedom of speech, dissemination
and association, and to follow international conventions on human
rights;</P>
      <P>-- Take the previous demands into consideration when planning to
continue mainland China's most-favored nation trade status, when

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves stood at
US$84.446 billion at the end of May, the Central Bank of China (CBC)
announced on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The CBC said that the foreign exchange reserves held by Taiwan
are the third-highest in the world, behind Japan's US$205.76 billion
as of the end of April, and mainland China's US$140.3 billion as of
the end of February.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves in May increased US$414
million from the previous month, the second growth recorded in four
months.</P>
      <P>The CBC attributed the increase to relatively slight intervention
by the CBC in the foreign exchange market during May, as well as
interest on foreign exchange reserves which amounts to almost US$500
million each month.</P>
      <P>However, due to the depreciation of the new Taiwan dollar to
about NT$35 to the US greenback in recent fluctuations, the CBC has
sold a large amount of foreign currency to protect the local currency
from further dropping in value, so that June's growth has attracted
much public attention.

Asian economies through contributions to the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank, which have provided loans and aid.</P>
      <P>The United States has also kept pressure on Japan to follow
through on commitments to economic reform, said Haig, 73, who is in
Singapore as a special guest at a mobile communications conference.</P>
      <P>Delays in US contributions to the IMF are not an attempt to deny
Asia aid, he said. The delays, aimed at bringing about reform in the
organization, came in response to criticism that the IMF was too
bureaucratic and had not been doing its job properly, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTRY REAFFIRMS CLAIM TO TIAOYUTAIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) on
Wednesday reaffirmed the Republic of China's sovereign claim to the
disputed Tiaoyutai Islands in the East China Sea.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu said the Tiaoyutai archipelago is part of
traditional Chinese territory. "Our sovereignty over the island
group is undisputed," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Wu's reiteration came after a group of activists from Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Chinese communities in the United States made a failed
attempt to land on the uninhabited islands on Wednesday morning.</P>
      <P>The activists aboard six ships were blocked by the Japanese coast
guard when they approached the disputed rocky islets, known as the
Tiaoyutais in Taiwan, the Diaoyus in mainland China and the Senkakus
in Japan. They have been administered by Japan since 1972, but also
claimed by Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wu said the ROC has consistently maintained that the
sovereign dispute should be resolved through peaceful, rational
negotiations, not by force or any non-peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Wu further said the ROC will not seek cooperation of mainland
China in resolving disputes over the Tiaoyutais. "Hopefully, Japan
will respect Taiwan fishermen's legitimate rights to operate in their
traditional fishing grounds near the disputed island group," he
stressed, adding that Japan should under no circumstances impair
Taiwan fishermen' vessels or endanger their physical safety.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Wu expressed recognition of patriotism of the Chinese
activists who have made annual landing attemps after the
ultra-rightist Japanese Youth Federation erected a makeshift
lighthouse on one of the islands in July 1996 and Japan later
included the Taioyutais in its 200-mile exclusive economic zone.</P>
      <P>In October 1996, Taiwan and Hong Kong activists made a brief
landing on one of the disputed islands and planted two flags, one
each from the ROC and mainland China. Japanese coast guard, however,
soon forced the activists away from the islet and removed the flags.</P>
      <P>Last year, a group of Taiwan and Hong Kong activists was
prevented from approaching the islands by a large number of Japanese
coast guard patrol ships and military helicopters.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE FOREIGN WORKERS, VISITORS OVERSTAY AUSTRALIAN VISAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia detained more than 11,600
foreign workers and visitors, including people from mainland China,
Vietnam, Syria and Pakistan, for overstaying their visas in fiscal
1997-98, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The detentions are part of an effort to crack down on illegal
foreign workers and visitors in Australia.</P>
      <P>In a statement faxed to CNA Wednesday afternoon, Immigration
Minister Philip Ruddock said: "This reflects the strong record of the
coalition government in ensuring that visitors to Australia abide by
our laws."</P>
      <P>"During our first year in office, locations of overstayers and
illegal workers increased by 30 percent -- from 7,800 in 1995-96 to
10,138 in 1996-97."</P>
      <P>"Locations have further increased to more than 11,600 between
July 1, 1997 and May, 31 1998 as the government continues to take a
strong stand against people who flagrantly abuse immigration laws,"
he said.</P>
      <P>In New South Wales, about 6,400 people overstayed their visas; in
Victoria, more than 1,800; in Queensland, 1,200; in Australia's
Northern Territory, 800; in Western Australia, 780; in the Australian
Capital Territory, more than 360; in South Australia, almost 280; and
in Tasmania, 35.</P>
      <P>"Australia strongly encourages bona fide visitors, students and
business people to travel to Australia, and the vast majority abide
by the conditions of their visas and return home before they expire.
However, a small but persistent number of people overstay their visas
or work without permission," he said.</P>
      <P>The government spends millions of dollars tracking down those who
overstay their visas. Moreover, they are taking jobs away from
Australians, he said.</P>

      <P>Vice Justice Minister Chiang Hao said on
Wednesday that he has asked investigators probing an alleged sexual
assault to make every effort to meet the alleged victim.</P>
      <P>Chiang is the convener of a task force set up to probe the
allegations against Cheng Chuan, acting director of the Investigation
Bureau under the Ministry of Justice.</P>
      <P>Chiang said he has asked the investigators to persuade Yang
Wan-ching to allow them to meet the victim, his daughter Christine.</P>
      <P>She has checked into a hospital in Paris, where the alleged
incident took place.</P>
      <P>Yang, Cheng's former friend, has accused Cheng of attempting to
rape Christine while he was administering Chihkung, a traditional
Chinese martial art believed to have curative powers, in a Paris
hotel room on September 13, 1996.</P>
      <P>Yang said that Christine, then 19, told him that Cheng touched
her breast and private parts during the treatment. But Cheng denied
categorically any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Newspapers here have printed Yang's story, who claims he is in
anguish after seeing his daughter descend into severe mental distress
following the incident.</P>
      <P>However, Chiang said that he has requested the investigators, who
are currently in France to collect information related to the case,
to try to obtain Christine's side of the story.</P>
      <P>He said he does not want to see Yang claiming grievance while at
the same time refusing to let the investigators meet his daughter,
saying that this could lead people to challenge the truth of the
allegations.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Lin Yi-hsiung, the newly-elected chairman of
Taiwan's opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), has said that
the island's future should be decided by a nationwide referendum.</P>
      <P>Such a vote should be conducted with international support, but
not until the people of Taiwan believe a referendum is necessary to
decide whether Taiwan should declare independence or continue seeking
reunification with mainland China, he said.</P>
      <P>The DPP leader made the remarks during an interview in Taipei
with Japan's Mainichi Shimbun which was carried in the newspaper's
Wednesday edition.</P>
      <P>Lin was quoted as saying that Taiwan needs to make the
international community aware that it is a sovereign country. Holding
a referendum would show the international community the true stance
of the Taiwan people regarding independence, which would provide
international safeguards for Taiwan, Lin told Mainichi reporters.</P>
      <P>He explained that Taiwan and mainland China are two different
nations, but pointed out that this fact is not accepted by the
majority of countries, including mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lin also said that friendly relations between Taiwan and the
mainland will not only be conducive to peace across the Taiwan
Strait, it will also help preserve stability in the entire Asian
region.</P>
      <P>He also expressed his hope that Taiwan's interests will not be
sacrificed at the upcoming talks between US President Bill Clinton

    <TEXT>
      <P>The results of a recent survey show that 80
percent of those interviewed believe Taiwan will be unable to reach
the 6 percent economic growth predicted for this year by various
domestic research institutes.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by the mass-circulation China Times among 100
listed and over-the-counter companies, also found that 80 percent of
the respondents feel that Taiwan will need at least one year to
recover from the current Asian financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>While agreeing that modest depreciation of the local currency
will help upgrade the competitiveness of Taiwan's exports, the
respondents said the new Taiwan dollar should be kept at between
32-34 against the US dollar.</P>
      <P>As the Asian financial storm takes its toll on Taiwan's economy,
with the island's exports declining 6.7 percent in the first quarter,
the government has decided to boost the economy by stimulating local
demand.</P>
      <P>However, over half of those polled expressed pessimism over the
success of this policy, on the grounds that a number of large-scale

      <P>Australian Prime Minister John Howard has
announced support for the construction of a A$9 (US$5.6) billion
railway linking Melbourne in Victoria and Darwin in the Northern
Territory, making it Australia's largest infrastructure project.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said Howard's support for the project was an
attempt to woo back disenchanted rural voters following a woeful
performance by Howard's Liberal Party in recent state elections in
Queensland.</P>
      <P>The Liberal Party won a mere nine seats, compared with 11 for
Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party, which has been described as
racist, anti-Asian, anti-Aboriginal people, anti-multiculturalism and
anti-foreign investment.</P>
      <P>Howard, however, denied he was reacting to the rising popularity
of the 1-year-old One Nation Party, whose support has soared to a
record 12.5 percent in nationwide polls, up 5.8 percent in just four
weeks.</P>
      <P>The rail link will run through Victoria, New South Wales and
Queensland.</P>
      <P>"This project has been conceived quite in isolation from many

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON-JIANG SUMMIT NOT TO AFFECT ROC-US TIES: DING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton's visit to
mainland China will neither affect substantive Taipei-Washington
relations nor undermine the Republic of China's national interests,
a senior official said on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ding Mou-shih, secretary-general of the National Security
Council, made the remarks on the eve of Clinton's departure for a
nine-day state visit to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Ding, who made a secret trip to the United States to meet
high-ranking American officials in March 1996 when communist
China was conducting missile tests and live-fire war games
in waters near Taiwan, said local people need not worry too much
about Clinton's June 25-July 3 mainland visit.</P>
      <P>Ding, who once served as the ROC's de facto ambassador to the
US, said American authorities have informed Taipei in detail about
the agenda for a summit meeting between Clinton and his mainland
counterpart, Jiang Zemin, in Beijing later this week.</P>
      <P>The veteran diplomat said senior Clinton administration
officials have on many public occasions, including congressional
hearings, assured Taiwan that Clinton's mainland visit will by no
means affect ROC's national interests nor weaken substantive
Taipei-Washington ties.</P>
      <P>"The American officials have repeatedly explained that Clinton's
mainland trip is mainly aimed at promoting Asia-Pacific regional
stability and incorporating Beijing into international norms and
systems," Ding noted.</P>
      <P>Ding, a former foreign minister, further said there are many
communciations and dialogue channels between Taipei and Washington
at various levels. He, however, would not elaborate.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, C. F. Koo, Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland
China and a senior adviser to President Lee Teng-hui, said the ROC
should focus attention on developments in several issues
expected to come up in the Clinton-Jiang summit.</P>
      <P>Such issues include the so-called new "three no's", the
Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems" unification formula and
US policy on arms sales to Taiwan, Koo explained.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation
(SEF) further said he expects to meet his mainland counterpart, Wang
Daohan, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), this autumn.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies
authorized by their respective governments to handle
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>

      <P>The Taipei City Government on Wednesday
ordered all private and public kindergartens around the city to
suspend operations for the time being to help prevent further spread
of a killer intestinal virus.</P>
      <P>The city government also directed all public and private
elementary schools not to offer any programs during summer vacation
and all swimming classes at various levels of municipal schools
should be closed immediately.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, all public and private elementary schools are
required to close the current semester immediately after the end of
the third periodic academic examination.</P>
      <P>Kuo Sheng-yu, director of the municipal Bureau of Education,
said all these measures are aimed at facilitating cleaning and
sterilization work at all campuses as part of efforts to contain the
spread of enterovirus.</P>
      <P>In case the current epidemic is brought under control during
summer vacation, Kuo said, the bureau will organize special programs
for the participation of students, parents and ordinary citizens.</P>
      <P>As for city government-run day-care centers, the Bureau of
Social Affairs said parents can decide on their own whether or not
to continue sending their kids to the centers. Nevertheless, the
bureau said parents should voluntarily stop sending their kids
suspected of being infected by the virus to the day-care centers to
help curb the spread of the virus.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the municipal Bureau of Health show that
4,387 cases babies and young children suspected of being infected
by the intestinal virus had received medical treatment at hospitals
throughout Taipei as of Tuesday. Among them, 417 had been
hospitalized because they had developed complications. And the
city's enterovirus-related death toll stands at four.</P>
      <P>Municipal health officials said although medical records of
hospitalized patients shows a downturn in the number of enterovirus
infections, it's still too early to announce that the epidemic has
been controlled.</P>
      <P>For one thing, the officials said, there is no vaccine to
prevent its spread in the first place. Moreover, they said, there is
still no effective medicine to treat the enterovirus-caused
complications.</P>
      <P>Following in the footsteps of the Taipei City Government,
the Taipei County Government and several other city and county
governments around the island also decided to advance the closing
date of the current semester by about a week.</P>
      <P>Chan Chi-hsien, director-general of the Department of Health
(DOH), quoted medical reports provided by major local hospitals as
saying that the number of enterovirus infections has declined
steadily. "Nevertheless, all DOH disease control unites will
continue to keep alert on the development of the epidemic."</P>
      <P>Chan further said the DOH will work out a package of measures
and regulations to help various private cram schools or talent
classes take precautionary measures to protect their young students
from contracting the killer virus.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus epidemic has so far claimed the lives of at
least 50 infants and toddlers around the island. Parents are advised
to keep their children away from public places and make sure that
their kids change clothes and wash hands frequently.</P>
      <P>Children under the age of five are most susceptible to the
virus. Early symptoms resemble the flu, inclduing fever, headache
and vomiting. Later, possible deadly complications include
encephalitis, meningitis and acute inflammation of heart muscle.</P>

local travel agencies.</P>
      <P>Most of the 26 countries targeted for fee hikes, effective July
1, are developing nations.</P>
      <P>"The Republic of China should not be put on the list," said
Taipei Association of Travel Agents President Teng Ming-chang. The
measure, he said, is aimed at reducing the number of illegal workers
and visitors in Australia.</P>
      <P>The TATA has sent a letter to Australia's visa-issuing office in
Taipei, requesting that Taiwan be removed from the list. Fees for
Taiwan tourists will rise from NT$900 (US$26) to more than NT$1,000.</P>
      <P>Taiwan currently grants Australian nationals 14-day, visa-free
entry, Teng said, noting that the privilege is not reciprocated.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan is not removed from the list, the TATA will spearhead

      <P>According to Tourism Bureau statistics, 153,000 Taiwan nationals
visited Australia last year, with Taiwan ranking second Asia behind
Singapore among Asian countries.</P>
      <P>A conference on the fee hikes was held Monday. The meeting was

initiative, replied that he is not in a position to make the
decision.</P>
      <P>Tang was quoted as saying he was worried that a green light to
the request would herald hordes of similar requests from other
political parties in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said Tang promised to relay the request to the appropriate

      <P>Calling the semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation nothing

    <HEADLINE>PRIVATE KINDERGARTENS ALLOWED TO REOPEN JULY 1</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Contradicting an earlier ruling, Kuo
Sheng-yu, director of the Taipei City government's Bureau of
Education, said Wednesday that private kindergartens in the city may
re-open on July 1.</P>
      <P>Kuo had previously announced all private kindergarten must suspend
classes indefinitely starting Thursday. The suspensions were designed
to stem the spread of an enterovirus outbreak that has claimed more
than 50 lives, mainly babies and young children, in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kuo's initial decision prompted protests from private
kindergartens, which called the decision rash. They said the
suspensions would cause problems for families with two working
parents. Also, students' families might ask for refunds, which could
result in disputes between parents and schools.</P>
      <P>After hearing the schools' grievances, Kuo admitted the
original policy had not taken into account the fact that private
kindergartens remain open during both summer and winter vacations,
nor had possible inconveniences to parents been considered.</P>
      <P>To avoid inconveniencing families with children in private
kindergartens, Kuo agreed to allow the private kindergarten to
re-open starting July 1.</P>
      <P>Between now and then, however, the bureau hopes the schools will
work to make sure they are cleaned and disinfected, Kuo said.</P>

      <P>Legislator Yeh Chu-lan, who is convenor of the Action Alliance

by the alliance at the 2-28 Peace Memorial Park in downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>She said the "new three noes" are no to mainland China, no to
major powers using Taiwan as a pawn and no to unification with
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Yeh's remarks contrast sharply with the better-known "three noes"
-- no US support for Taiwan independence, no support for a "one
China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas" and no support for Taiwan's bid to
join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>In addition to Yeh, DPP legislators Lin Cho-shui and Chang

    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  24  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
urged US President Clinton to continue to support Taiwan on the eve of
Clinton's departure to mainland China for a nine-day visit.</P>
      <P>The Mississippi Republican wrote in The Washington Times
Wednesday that mainland China's leaders will no doubt attempt to
persuade Clinton to agree to a new joint communique, adding that
Clinton should not be seduced.</P>
      <P>"Our interest is in the peaceful resolution of differences
between Beijing and Taipei, but we are not in the business of
pressuring Taiwan. Strengthening deterrence supports that fundamental
interest," wrote Lott.</P>
      <P>Clinton should support developing and deploying effective missile
defenses in Taiwan and throughout the region -- and not accede to
mainland Chinese hopes for further concessions on Taiwan, noted the
senator.</P>
      <P>President Clinton has argued strongly for engagement with, rather
than the isolation of, mainland China. But Lott said the key issue is
what kind of engagement Clinton pursues at the summit. Engagement can
be passive accommodation or it can be reciprocal advocacy of
interests, he wrote.</P>
      <P>Lott also called on Clinton to keep at the top of his agenda
talks on easing tensions on the Korean peninsula, addressing mainland
China's threats toward India and ending mainland China's
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</P>
      <P>Lott suggested Clinton meet Chinese democrats, visit Japan on his
way back, honor the heroes of Tiananmen Square, highlight religious
freedom, remember Tibet, be serious about national security,
cooperate on investigating campaign contributions and apply US
nonproliferation laws.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GLOBAL LEADERSHIP NEEDED TO TACKLE ASIAN CRISIS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,   June  24  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The world needs decisive global
leadership from the United States, Japan and mainland China now or the
Asian crisis could worsen, Singapore's Information and Arts Minister,
Yeo Yong Bong, warned on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"Like all crises, this Asian crisis will either strengthen or
weaken us," he said at a welcome dinner ahead of Business Week's
eighth annual Asia Leadership Forum.</P>
      <P>"If there is sufficient global leadership, the promise of the
Pacific century will eventually be realized. If not, Asia will still
emerge, but it will be a troubled world."</P>
      <P>Noting that the world is searching for a new equilibrium in times
of change, Yeo, who is also second minister for trade and industry,
likened the global changes to "tectonic shifts on the earth's crust."</P>
      <P>Among these shifts are the evolution of the United States'
relationship with Japan, the rise of mainland China's political and
economic power and the weakening of traditional hierarchies and
government monopolies, which have resulted from an information
technology revolution.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the underlying tension between the United
States and Japan manifested itself in the regional havoc now being
wreaked by the volatility of the dollar-yen exchange rate.</P>
      <P>While Japan is powerful economically and has the ability to pull
Asia out of its crisis, it is unable to do so because of internal
political weaknesses, he said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, he said, the US economy, despite being the
largest in the world, is increasingly debt ridden.</P>
      <P>"We thus have a situation where the greatest power on earth is
also the world's largest debtor nation, while the world's greatest
creditor nation is, for historical reasons, unable to lead. This
creates a dangerous fault-line in world politics and economics."</P>
      <P>Underlining the growing importance of mainland China, Yeo noted
how a hint from its officials about devaluing the renminbi had sent
regional financial markets tumbling.</P>
      <P>"The triangular relationship between the US, Japan and China will
be of decisive importance to peace and prosperity in the region. The
Asian crisis today is partly the result of tensions in that
relationship," he said.</P>
      <P>While the tectonic shifts would send "earthquakes throughout the
region for many years to come," the region's survival strategy was
three-pronged, he said.</P>
      <P>First, individuals and corporations have to return to basics and
recognize the value of good education, hard work, thrift and honesty.</P>
      <P>Second, political systems must meet the test of good leadership,
good government and wider political participation.</P>
      <P>Third, problems of world governance must be tackled.
International institutions created in the post-war era are becoming
less relevant to new needs, he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER VINCENT SIEW TO VISIT SOUTH PACIFIC IN JULY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 25 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew is scheduled to visit
Tonga, Fiji and the Solomon Islands from July 2-9 to further cement
bilateral ties between Taiwan and the South Pacific islands,
according to Foreign Minister Jason Hu.</P>
      <P>In his report to Premier Siew on the upcoming trip on Wednesday,
Hu said relevant arrangements are almost complete as only a number of
details have yet to be confirmed.</P>
      <P>Canberra has agreed to grant transit visas to Siew and his
entourage, which will consist of four Cabinet-level officials and
about a dozen business leaders, allowing them to transit in the
eastern Australian city of Brisbane before heading for Tonga.</P>
      <P>Australia authorities, however, insisted that Siew and his party
conduct no public activities nor meeting the press during their stay
in Brisbane, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The premier may also make a transit stop in Hawaii on his return
trip, he added.</P>
      <P>Siew, in his capacity as a special envoy of President Lee
Teng-hui, will attend celebrations marking the 80th birthday of King
Taufa'ahau Tupou IV of the Kingdom of Tonga, and will attend the 20th
anniversary celebrations of the founding of the Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan aboriginal dance troupe will join Siew's delegation in
Tonga and the Solomon Islands to attend and perform in the
festivities.</P>
      <P>The premier will likely represent Taiwan in the signing of a
fishery cooperation agreement with the Solomon Islands and contracts
to purchase timber and plywood from that South Pacific island
country.</P>
      <P>King Tupou of Tonga, who turns 80 on July 4, paid a four-day
state visit to the Republic of China in August last year.</P>
      <P>Tonga and the Solomon Islands are two of the ROC's four
diplomatic allies in the South Pacific, which also include Nauru and
Tuvalu.</P>
      <P>Fiji, which has no formal diplomatic ties but maintains cordial
relations with the ROC, opened its representative office in Taipei
late last year. President Kamisese Mara traveled to Taipei and
personally presided over the opening of the office on Dec. 15, 1997.</P>

      <P>A large number of Taipei residents
expressed worry that the results of an upcoming summit between US
President Bill Clinton and his mainland counterpart Jiang Zemin would
harm Taiwan's interests, an opinion poll showed.</P>
      <P>The poll, conducted by Taipei City Assemblywoman Chen Hsieh-fen,
found that 43 percent of those surveyed are worried about the
aftermath of the Clinton-Jiang summit, while 42 percent are not.</P>
      <P>It also found that 81 percent of the respondents know of
Clinton's current mainland Chinese trip, which began on Thursday,
while 18 percent do not.</P>
      <P>The survey of more than 600 Taipei residents through online

respondents think Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian should take the
initiative to express Taiwan's stance to the US on the eve of
Clinton's arrival to the mainland.</P>
      <P>Some respondents said since Chen has been active in promoting
"city diplomacy," and has visited the United States several times
during his tenure, he should take the initiative to tell Washington
Taiwan people are opposed to any deals that might be made during the
trip that could put Taiwan at risk.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that as many as 35 percent of respondents
said Mayor Chen does not need to take that initiative as a spokesman
for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Those conducting the poll urged respondents to express their
opinions about Clinton's Beijing trip to the White House and US

    <DATELINE>San  Francisco, June 22 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The relationship between the United
States and mainland China remains an "uncomfortable embrace" despite
a desire on both sides for an improvement in ties, the San Jose
Mercury News said Monday.</P>
      <P>In a dispatch headlined "China, US in awkward new dance" from
Beijing, the Mercury said mainland China hopes a friendly United
States would boost its status and power, and improve China's standard
of living with American investment and technology.</P>
      <P>Beyond seeking US investment and technology, it said, China needs
US cooperation for its goal of reunifying with Taiwan. Beijing would
have a more difficult time convincing Taipei to cooperate if
Washington continues to assure Taiwan of its military protection and
provide arms.</P>
      <P>But to the United States and most Americans, China still appears
menacing. It is a country that has nuclear missiles pointed their
way, one that crushed a democracy movement by killing hundreds and
imprisoning more, and one that may have tried to buy influence in the
1996 elections and the White House itself.</P>
      <P>The Mercury cited enormous opposition to Clinton's visit to
China, the first US presidential trip to the mainland since the
Tiananmen Square massacre. The visit cannot help but reward the
Chinese and help cement Jiang Zemin's power as leader as it restores
international approval of China that was lost in 1989.</P>
      <P>Clinton's visit "will be the final formal step in ending
America's post-Tiananmen diplomatic isolation," wrote Robert Ross, a
research associate at the Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at

    <HEADLINE>ROC SPENDS NT$52 BILLION ANNUALLY TO HANDLE CASH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The cost of handling cash in the
Republic of China amounts to NT$52 billion a year, according to a new
study.</P>
      <P>The study, conducted by the Asian Banker Journal (ABJ), evaluated
the cost of handling cash in the ROC, Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia,
the Philippines, Thailand and Hong Kong, using Singapore as a
benchmark.</P>
      <P>The total amount includes all the interest lost for cash kept in
float, the salaries of staff employed to deal with cash, transport
costs, lost opportunity costs if the money could be more profitably
used elsewhere, and invisible cost items.</P>
      <P>The study showed Singapore's cost of handling cash in a year
amounted to S$656.6 million. This figure is up to 12 times lower than
the cost of handling cash in other Asian countries.</P>
      <P>"The cost in Singapore is lower than other Asian countries
because it is physically smaller than the other countries, and also
because the interest rates here are also lower, resulting in lower
opportunity cost," ABJ's managing director and editor-in-chief
Emmanuel Daniel was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>The study pointed out that while using cash makes sense for the
individual customer as the cost per transaction is insignificant, it
saddles organizations involved in processing cash with high costs, as
total costs over a year accumulate substantially.</P>
      <P>According to the study, the total amount required in handling
cash per year by the eight Asian countries and area are as follows:</P>
      <P>1. Australia A$7.9 billion S$8.1 b.</P>
      <P>2. Hong Kong HK$7.0 b. S$1.5 b.</P>

      <P>US President Bill Clinton must reaffirm
the US' commitment to security in East Asia and Taiwan when he meets
with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing, the Sydney
Morning Herald editorial said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"Australia will wish to see a continuing US commitment to
maintaining security in East Asia through the US-Japan Security
Treaty, which Australia maintains is not directed at China, but is
necessary to underpin stability in the region," the editorial

      <P>"Continuing US support for Taiwan is part of the same exercise in
maintaining an equilibrium essential for peace," it added.</P>
      <P>Clinton is also expected to address concern over China's human
rights record as well as the huge US trade deficit with the mainland.
The former concern has been somewhat muted by the latter due to the
Asian region's economic turmoil, the Herald said.</P>
      <P>"Mr. Clinton should not ignore the importance of human rights in
China. Freedom from human rights abuses is important not just for its
own sake, but also as an essential precondition for China's
transformation as an increasingly free and prosperous nation," the
editorial said.</P>

      <P>Taiwan daredevil Ke Shou-liang is
reportedly preparing to fly across the Taiwan Strait in a hot-air
balloon, sources from mainland China said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Ke, known as "Blackie" to his fans, told friends in Wuhan that
the cross-strait balloon flight is scheduled for August or September
next year when the winds are favorable.</P>
      <P>He said he may invite three other men, one each from Taiwan, Hong

      <P>In preparation for the trip, Ke has trained for six months and

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING TO SHOW LENIENCY TO ALLEGED TAIWAN SPIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese authorities will show
leniency to four alleged Taiwan spies, a quasi-official Beijing-based
intermediary body said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS)
made the statement in a faxed message to its Taiwan counterpart, the
Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).</P>
      <P>The ARATS said it has appealed to relevant mainland agencies for
lenient treatment of the four Taiwan merchants who have been detained
on the mainland since early March on charges of spying for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The association also said the accused -- Ko Chien-ming, Han
Yueh-ting, Chen Shao-yu and Chou Chang-ming -- are being detained in
Beijing and are all in good health.</P>
      <P>According to mainland regulations, the men's families cannot meet
them at the moment. Such meetings may be possible after the trials
begin, mainland sources said.</P>
      <P>The association promised to convey the opinions of the SEF and
the families of the detained to concerned mainland authorities and to
deliver letters or household articles sent by their families.</P>
      <P>"We will also push related agencies to try the case as soon as
possible and to give lenient punishments to those found guilty within
legal limits," it added.</P>
      <P>The ARATS and SEF are semi-official bodies authorized by their
respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the
absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>This was the first time that the ARATS has given a clear
response to SEF's inquiries about the case.</P>
      <P>Upon receiving the ARATS' letter, SEF Vice Chairman and
Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow reiterated Taiwan's basic stance that
mainland China will handle the case based on the principles of
openness and transparency. "This will be the best way to reduce
suspicion and animosity between the two sides," he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing announced on May 28 that it has broken a Taiwan spy ring
and arrested four Taiwan nationals on charges of espionage. It
accused the four men of having been recruited by Taiwan's Military
Intelligence Bureau (MIB) under the Ministry of National Defense to
engage in espionage on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Mainland China's Ministry of State Security alleged that Ko
Chien-ming was recruited by the MIB shortly after he founded the
Chinese Association for the Promotion of Cross-Strait Civil
Exchanges in Taipei in 1991.</P>
      <P>The mainland ministry also accused the MIB of having financially
supported the association in hopes of planting its agents in the
association and using it as a cover for espionage operations in
mainland China. It said the three other alleged spies were recruited
by Ko in 1996 and 1997, respectively.</P>
      <P>According to a May 28 resport by mainland China's
state-run Central TV Station, all the four accused had confessed to
working for the MIB and one of them was found to be in possession of
the MIB's "spy manual."</P>
      <P>Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense has categorically denied
all the mainland allegations, saying it has never had any contacts
or connections with Ko's association.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 25 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew on Thursday apologized
to the public for an enterovirus outbreak as the Department of Health
(DOH) announced new measures to curb the spread of the intestinal
virus.</P>
      <P>Siew said the outbreak of the epidemic has caused great concern
and even panic among the public, and he wished to express his sincere
apology over the outbreak.</P>
      <P>Siew made the remarks after he listening to a report by DOH
Director-General Chang Chi-shean about the latest situation on the
epidemic.</P>
      <P>The official death toll from the enterovirus has increased to 51
after a 15-month-old baby died in Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital
in suburban Taipei Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Siew said health and medical institutions have pulled all the
stops in fighting the disease and the rate of deaths and the number
of those infected have eased since the peak of the outbreak.</P>
      <P>However, he warned that according to collected data, the epidemic
has not yet come under control.</P>
      <P>Siew said the top priority now is to use all medical resources
and facilities to curb the spread of the disease at an earliest
possible date.</P>
      <P>The DOH, noting that the enterovirus is usually spread by
physical contact, mapped out guidelines for nurseries and
kindergartens Thursday following a decision Wednesday by the Taipei
City Government to suspend operations of public and private
kindergartens for the time being.</P>
      <P>According to the guidelines, the number of students in each class
must be less than 30. If two students in the same class have been
infected with the enterovirus, the class must immediately be
suspended and operators must conduct a thorough cleaning and
disinfecting of the premises.</P>
      <P>The enterovirus usually attacks children under 5 years. The virus
breaks down the immune system and can leave infants susceptible to
encephalitis, meningitis and acute inflammation of the heart muscle.</P>
      <P>Early symptoms are similar to the flu, including fever, headache
and vomiting. The rate of death from viral infection is low if
victims are offered timely and proper medical treatment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EXPERT URGES CBC NOT TO REDUCE RESERVE REQUIREMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Elizabeth Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite increasing domestic calls for a
loose currency policy to encourage stock trading, now is not the best
time to lower reserve requirements for banks, a prominent scholar
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Institute of Economic Research director Tung Jui-pin said
a decline in reserve requirements would trigger a further
depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar because released capital is
expected to flow into the foreign exchange market rather than share
investments.</P>
      <P>Tung also pointed out that on Oct. 16, 1997, the Central Bank of
China implemented its largest reserve requirement reduction,
announcing a day later it would let the market decide the NT dollar's
value. The move caused huge losses in the currency.</P>
      <P>The experience showed that improperly releasing funds into the
market does not help resolve financial and economic chaos but
benefits foreign exchange profiteers, Tung said, warning the CBC not
to fall into the trap.</P>
      <P>He said there are currently fewer demands for short-term loans
than long-term fund-lending, he therefore suggested the CBC first
take effective measures, such as release postal deposits to relieve
pressure from long-term fund demands, then it can consider moderate
adjustment of high-leveled reserve requirements for banks.</P>
      <P>The CBC's current reserve requirements averages at 8.3 percent,
and CBC officials have indicated the level will gradually decrease
depending on the island's economic and financial changes.</P>
      <P>Affected by the Asian financial crisis, the NT dollar slid from
28.48 against the greenback last July to 33.989 in May. According to
CBC statistics, the local currency was seen drops in the July-May
period, with the exception of last September and February.</P>
      <P>The largest plunge during that 11-month period was 7.6 percent in
last October, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>As of Wednesday, the NT dollar dropped to 34.351 against the US
dollar. There were no optimistic signs of an upturn as the Japanese
yen continues in its seemingly unstoppable depreciation.</P>
      <P>In the face of the currency fluctuation which has effected local
business trade and economic development, the CBC will hold a board of
directors meeting Thursday afternoon to discuss how to settle
Taiwan's financial problems.</P>
      <P>The top concerns at the meeting will likely be how to maintain
Taiwan's currency and goods-price stability, the topics identified by
CBC Governor Perng Fai-nan in an urgent board of directors meeting
held in early June.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONSUMERS' FOUNDATION  URGES  UNIFORM TRAFFIC ACCIDENT COMPENSATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Consumers' Foundation questioned on
Thursday the standard for compensating families of victims who die in
air and land accidents.</P>
      <P>Jason F. Lee, the foundation's secretary-general, made the
remarks in a foundation-sponsored seminar.</P>
      <P>One person's life is as valuable as another's, he said. Likewise,
compensation should be equal, regardless of whether the victim
died on land or in the air, he said.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials pointed out that the families of victims in
two major air crashes earlier this year each received NT$10 million
(US$289,855) in compensation. Thirteen people died in a Formosa
Airlines crash in March, while 196 died in a China Airlines crash in
February.</P>
      <P>In comparison, they said the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications only recently raised the compensation to up to NT$4.4
million (US$127,536) for families of victims who die in train
accidents. And compensation for victims of families in automobile
accidents remains unchanged at NT$1.2 million (US$34,782).</P>
      <P>In addition to calling for standard compensation amounts, Lee
said adjustments should be made for cost of living increases.</P>
      <P>Foundation officials suggested local traffic accident
compensation should be NT$5 million per person. That amount, they
said, is five times a household's average disposable income in 1996,
plus a tax-free funeral expense.</P>
      <P>That amount will meet the needs of bereaved families and the
demands of social justice, they said.</P>
      <P>But Chang Shun-ching, senior specialist of MOTC's Railways and
Highways Department, said the uniform compensation proposal must be
studied further.</P>
      <P>Chang said it may be inappropriate to set a uniform standard
through an administrative order.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Authorities in Beijing are stepping up
dissident arrests and efforts to control dissidence throughout
mainland China on the eve of US President Bill Clinton's visit.</P>
      <P>Yen Jun, a dissident from Xian City, Shaanxi Province, was taken
from his home Wednesday afternoon. His whereabouts is still unknown
to family and friends, according to a news release from the Hong
Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China. Xian, an ancient mainland Chinese capital, will be
Clinton's first stop.</P>
      <P>Yen was one of 70 people who co-signed an open letter to Clinton
two days ago, urging the US president to meet with Chinese dissidents
during his visit.</P>
      <P>Xu Wenli, a prominent dissident from Beijing who has been
repeatedly interviewed by the media, was recently placed under house
arrest and 24-hour surveillance.</P>
      <P>Four of Xu's middle school classmates who planned to pay Xu a
visit were removed from his doorstep by security police on Wednesday.
The four were released after a four-hour detainment.</P>
      <P>Shanghai dissident Han Lifa applied last week for a permit to
hold a rally to welcome Clinton. Instead Han was placed under police
surveillance, as were his sister and brother.</P>
      <P>Besides arresting and detaining dissidents, authorities are
ridding themselves of other potential nuisances by allowing them to
leave the country. For example, the mother of Bao Ge, a dissident
exiled to the United States, finally received a visa to visit the
United States just a few days before Clinton's trip.</P>
      <P>Clinton's trip, which runs from June 25 to July 3, will include
visits to Xian, Beijing, Shanghai and Gueilin.</P>

    <DATELINE>Chiayi,  southern  Taiwan,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The "Sacred Tree" on
Alishan (Mt. Ali) in southern Taiwan, generally regarded as the
symbol of Taiwan, is slanting to such a degree that it will be pulled
to the ground with a cable in a few days, the Taiwan Forest Bureau
reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>The slanting red hinoki cypress, which is more than 3,000 years
old, drew a group of specialists, including sociologists, botanists
and agricultural and tourism officials, to the site three years ago
to determine how the revered tree should be handled.</P>
      <P>The slant has become so pronounced, especially after torrential
flooding hit the mountain last July, that the tree could collapse. It
will be felled for safety reasons.</P>
      <P>A section of railway on the mountain will be closed to traffic
while the tree is pulled down. A series of activities, including a
retrospective of the tree's history, will be held to mark the
occasion.</P>
      <P>The Sacred Tree was first made known to the world in 1906 when
Taiwan was under its 11th year of Japanese rule. After the Japanese
found the tree within a huge forest, they built a mountain railway to
Mt. Ali and began exploiting the rich source of lumber there.</P>
      <P>The Sacred Tree was twice hit by lightning in the 1950s. It was
badly burned when first struck in 1953. Three years later, another
bolt finished off the tree.</P>
      <P>In 1962, experts from the Yushan Forest Administration planted
hinoki cypress seedlings in the trunk of the Sacred Tree.</P>
      <P>As of last July, the dead tree stood 52.7 meters tall with a
girth of 19.39 meters.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will definitely
adopt countermeasures if the impending summit meeting between the
United States and mainland China impair its interests, a senior
official said on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Wu An-chia, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC), made the statement at a seminar on the possible
impact on Taiwan of US President Bill Clinton's June 25-July 3 state
visit to the mainland.</P>
      <P>"We'll certainly cry out and adopt countermeasures if we feel
insecure or hurt by the results of Clinton's summit meeting with his
mainland counterpart, Jiang Zemin, in Beijing later this week," Wu
said.</P>
      <P>He would not reveal which countermeasures the ROC may adopt.
"It's inappropriate to unveil such measures at the moment," he said,
adding the ROC would not like to see such a scenario emerge becasue
it would mean worsening of relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Reiterating that Taipei has never intended to interfere with
Beijing-Washington engagements, Wu said the ROC will be delighted to
see the Clinton-Jiang summit contribute to peace in the Taiwan
Strait and stability in the entire Asia-Pacific region.</P>
      <P>"We also hope the Clinton-Jiang meeting will contribute to
reform and human rights development in mainland China," Wu
added.</P>
      <P>The senior mainland affairs official recognized the US efforts
to bring mainland China more closely into the international
community.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Wu stressed that the United States should not
sacrifice Taiwan's interests in engaging mainland China. "Hopefully,
the United States will simultaneously reinforce ties with
Taiwan while improving relations with the mainland."</P>
      <P>Wu further said it's unfair to define cross-strait disputes as
 a "Taiwan issue." There is only a "mainland China issue," he
asserted.</P>
      <P>"The competition between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait lies
in systems and way of life," Wu said, adding that as long as the gaps
between political, economic and social systems as well as lifestyles
on both sides are narrowed, cross-strait unification will be
realized easily.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Wu said the ROC hopes the upcoming
Clinton-Jiang meeting will contribute to peace and stability in the
Taiwan Strait and to positive cross-strait interaction. "Hopefully,
long-stalled cross-strait dialogue will resume shortly after
Clinton's mainland visit," he added.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended institutionalized cross-strait
dialogue shortly after ROC President Lee Teng-hui made a landmark
visit to the United States in June 1995.</P>

      <P>A new cold war is looming, this time in
Asia, as the United States ignores mainland China's nuclear
technology transfers to Pakistan while criticizing Russia for similar
transfers to India, according to the Australian Financial Review.</P>
      <P>An Indian delegation led by Defense Secretary Ajit Kumar visited
Russia and reportedly agreed to further collaboration on radar,
electronic warfare, submarine and missile systems. It also discussed
further purchases of Russian Sukhoi Su-30 long-range fighters, which
have been proposed by Indian officials as a delivery system for a
nuclear strike against mainland China.</P>
      <P>In addition, Russia's Atomic Energy Minister, Yevgeny Adamov, has
signed a US$3 billion deal with the chairman of the Indian Atomic
Energy Commission to supply two nuclear reactors, which the United
States worries could be used to produce nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>The US State Department has criticized the dealings between India
and Russia, and Washington has accused Moscow of undermining
sanctions against New Delhi for its recent nuclear tests.</P>
      <P>But, at the same time, Washington has ignored Chinese assistance
to Pakistan, which has followed in India's footsteps. The daily
reports that New Delhi believes mainland China has supplied Pakistan
with nuclear bombs, leading to perceptions of US hypocrisy.</P>
      <P>The daily reported that the Indian government is expected to
blame Pakistan for a bomb that recently derailed a train in the
disputed region of Kashmir, while Pakistan will likely blame
terrorist bombings within its borders on India.</P>
      <P>"It's as if the old Cold War never ended. Except now there's a

      <P>After several rounds of haggling during
the past week, Queensland Premier Rob Borbidge is out of a job and
will be replaced by Labor Party leader Peter Beattie.</P>
      <P>Beattie will attempt to form a minority government within the
"Sunshine State."</P>
      <P>Beattie, whose Labor Party won 44 of the 89 seats contested
during Queensland's recent legislative elections, won support from
Independent Member of Parliament Peter Wellington, giving him the 45

      <P>He foiled an attempt by Borbidge to form a government with the
support of the National Party, two independent parliamentarians and
the One Nation Party, which won 11 seats in the recent elections.</P>
      <P>Borbidge's failure to build a government was welcomed by Asians
in Australia who worried about the prospect of the One Nation Party
being part of a coalition government.</P>
      <P>Analysts said the Labor Party government under Beattie would not

    <DATELINE>Canberra,   June   25   (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Australia expects talks between
presidents Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin can sharply reduce conflicts
between the United States and mainland China and enable them to
establish and maintain a stable balance of power, according to the
Australian Financial Review.</P>
      <P>If that does not happen, however, Canberra could be sandwiched
between the two countries should hostilities erupt over Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Despite assurances of a new era in Sino-US relations, the two
countries will remain competitors, according to the author of the
analysis, Geoffrey Barker.</P>
      <P>Barker noted that for all Clinton's talk of cooperation, the
United States ultimately sees mainland China as a rising economic and
strategic power which, one way or another, it has to coax or change
or co-opt in order to limit its potential ability to impact adversely
US interests and influence. Powerful anti-mainland China lobbies in
Washington advocate attempts to contain mainland China.</P>
      <P>While mainland China is expected to pressure the United States to

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND  CHINA  WILL  STRESS COMMON INTERESTS WITH US: INDIAN DAILY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bangkok,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Kuo Fang-chih)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing will show US President Bill
Clinton during his visit that the United States has common interests
with mainland China, interests that pit them against Japan and India,
a New Delhi-based newspaper said in its editorial Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Hindustan Times said mainland Chinese officials have already
begun pointing out such interests. For example, the two countries'
alliance against Japan during World War II has been noted, according
to the paper.</P>
      <P>"For Mr. Jiang Zemin, there could not be a better timing of the
visit than this when Japan is in the throes of a severe economic
crisis and its earlier role as the major economic player in Asia has
been considerably diluted."</P>
      <P>The paper said mainland China has an opportunity to persuade
Clinton that the country has acted responsibly during Asia' economic
meltdown and that its political, economic and military strength
entitle it to a prominent position in Asian affairs.</P>
      <P>Noting that Clinton wants mainland China to play a bigger role in
Asia, The Hindustan Times said that emerging strategic relations
between Beijing and Washington bode ill for India.</P>
      <P>Although mainland China is now projecting itself as a "reformed
responsible power which is seeking peace and stability in Asia," the
editorial warned Washington and Asian countries that Beijing's real
goal is to make Americans and Asians "forget its role in actively
assisting the North Korean and Pakistani nuclear programs."</P>
      <P>India has rightly rejected third-party intervention in bilateral
matters with Pakistan after Clinton suggested mainland China's
participation in any future Indo-Pakistani talks, it said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PROBE INTO ALLEGED SEXUAL MISCONDUCT HITS SANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  June 24 (CNA)
(By M. J. Tzou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Investigations of alleged sexual misconduct
committed by a senior Taiwan law enforcement officer have hit a snag
because of the accuser's uncooperative attitude, investigators said
here on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Shih-ming, head of a three-member investigative team from
Taiwan, told a group of Taiwan journalists stationed in Paris that
the team still has no opportunity to interview Christine Yang, the
presumed victim of the alleged sexual assault by Cheng Chuan, acting
director of the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau (MJIB).</P>
      <P>Huang, also chief secretary of the Justice Ministry, said he
and his colleagues managed to meet with Christine's parents shortly
after they arrived in Paris on June 22.</P>
      <P>"We have got important, useful information about the case from
talking with the Yangs," Huang said, adding that the team on
Tuesday visited the hotel where Cheng's alleged sexual misconduct
took place.</P>
      <P>"We have taken photos of the hotel room where Cheng stayed
during his 1996 Paris trip," Huang said. "Nevertheless, we have so
far been unable to meet Christine in person."</P>
      <P>Huang said getting Christine's testimony is very important.
"Her statement can serve as direct evidence and has strong legal
effect, while her parents' testimonies can only serve as indirect
evidence and their legal effects are weak."</P>
      <P>Christine checked into a Paris hospital on the very day of
Huang's arrival. A hospital spokesperson said Christine's father,
Yang Wan-ching, has asked the hospital not to let any guest meet his
daughter. As a result, neither Haung's mission nor any Taiwan
journalist has managed to gain access to Christine.</P>
      <P>Huang said Yang had given him a copy of Chinese transcript
detailing Christine's statements to French police two days after the
alleged sexual assault happened.</P>
      <P>The transcript was reportedly written by Yang himself. "Further
verification is needed before we can ascertain the transcription's
authenticity," Huang said.</P>
      <P>At her father's insistence, Christine filed a complaint about
Cheng's alleged sexual misconduct with the police station near her
home in September 1996.</P>
      <P>Huang said his team looks forward to obtaining the original
French transcript of Christine's complaint to the French police as
well as her doctor's diagnosis report.</P>
      <P>"We fully understand it won't be easy to acquire the two
original documents because French law offers strict protection for
privacy," Huang explained, adding that the team has sought the
assistance of the French Institute in Taipei, which handles
Taiwan-France exchanges in the absence of official ties between the
two countries.</P>
      <P>Huang quoted a French police officer as having told his team
that according to French law, Christine's complaint with the police
cannot be used as evidence to prove the accused's misconduct. Under
the French law, the police are even not required to probe such
complaint.</P>
      <P>"Should Christine have 'reported the crime' to the police after
the alleged misconduct took place, the French police would have
investigated into the case at that time," Huang quoted the French
police officer as saying.</P>
      <P>Yang and his wife had accused Cheng of having touched
Christine's breast and private parts under the excuse of
administering Chikung, a traditional Chinese martial art believed to
have curative powers, to their daughter when he made a private trip
to Paris on Sept. 9-13, 1996.</P>
      <P>The Yangs alleged that Cheng's sexual misconduct had caused great
distress to Christine who was then 19 years old and suffering from
anorexia nervosa.</P>
      <P>Although Cheng has categorically denied all the Yangs'
allegations, many questions surrounding the case remained
unanswered, prompting the Ministry of Justice to send Huang's
mission to France to collect related information first-hand.</P>
      <P>The team originally planned to leave for home on Saturday. As
investigations have not proceeded smoothly, Huang said the team may
postpone its return until next Wednesday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SIX TOWNSHIPS IN PINGTUNG COUNTY CONTAMINATED BY TOXIC WASTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Six townships in the southern Taiwan
county of Pingtung have been contaminated by toxic waste, the
county's environmental protection chief reported on Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsu Ho-cheng, director of the Environmental Protection Bureau
under the Pingtung County Government, said unscrupulous property
developers have illegally extracted large quantities of sand and
gravel from many tracts of farmland in the six townships because the
county government has completely banned gravel extraction from local
rivers.</P>
      <P>Hsu said the developers have then filled the resulting craters
with industrial waste in an attempt to cover up their unethical
practices.</P>
      <P>"As industrial waste usually contains large amounts of toxic
chemicals, the affected farmland has become unarable. Worse yet,
poisonous substances in the waste have contaminated soil and ground
water in the nearby regions," Hsu said.</P>
      <P>The six most seriously contaminated townships are Kaoshu,
Likang, Yenpu, Neipu, Hsinyuan and Hsinpei, according to Hsu.</P>
      <P>Quoting field surveys conducted by the government-funded
Industrial Technology Research Institute, Hsu said soil and ground
water near large tracts of farmland in the six townships contain
dangerous levels of such toxic chemicals as phenol, toluene,
trichloroform, styrene and dichloroethylene. Exposure to these
substances can cause many diseases, including cancer and other
deadly ailments.</P>
      <P>In addition to reporting the case to the Cabinet-level
Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), Hsu said the county
government has set up a 20-member task force to intensify patrols of
farmland in the six townships.</P>
      <P>"We have also asked the EPA to give us financial and manpower
support," Hsu said, adding the county government will make further
surveys to understand how serious the contamination is and how large
the contaminated acreage is.</P>
      <P>EPA Administrator Tsai Hsun-hsiung has agreed to earmark NT$5
million to help finance the county's first-stage clean-up project in
addition to dispatching a 12-member team to assist in the
patrol mission.</P>

and to meet with ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan during the trip in
Shanghai. SEF Vice Chairman Shi Hwei-yow is also invited to visit the

      <P>Taiwan Power Company (Taipower) on Thursday
confirmed that it is seeking a uranium enriching service from the
Urenco Group of the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>A Taipower official, who requested anonymity, said in a telephone
interview that if the Dutch government approves the deal, the
Dutch-British-German consortium will be the third to offer the
service to Taipower, along with the US and France.</P>
      <P>Although the Associated Press reported on Thursday that the Dutch
government has approved the deal, the official said that the
state-run enterprise has not yet received any approval document from
the Dutch government.</P>
      <P>She said that the uranium ore imported by Taiwan from the US,
Canada, and South Africa has to be enriched before it can be
manufactured into fuel bars for use in Taiwan's three nuclear power
plants, pointing out that the density of uranium in the ore must be
increased from 0.7 percent to 3.5 percent for nuclear power use.</P>
      <P>Taipower decided to approach the Urenco group in order to
diversify its sources of enriched uranium, in preparation for the
completion of the island's fourth nuclear power plant, the official
said.</P>
      <P>According to the AP report, Dutch Economics Ministry spokesman
Lucc van Zipp said on Thursday that the Dutch government has approved
the "sale of uranium" to Taiwan for use in two nuclear power plants,
while Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman Frank de bruin stressed that
the uranium will only be used for peaceful purposes.</P>

      <P>Beattie came from behind as the winner of the Queensland state

      <P>The support gave the Beattie government 45 seats in the

seats required.</P>
      <P>Most Asian immigrants in the state welcomed Beattie's victory in

      <P>Several pro-independence groups on Thursday
urged US President Bill Clinton to support the right to
self-determination of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In an open letter to Clinton, the groups, including the
Association of Taiwan Professors, said that it is natural for the US
and mainland China, now the world's only superpowers, to seek to
improve their bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>"We hope the summit between President Clinton and his mainland
counterpart Jiang Zemin on July 27 will be a big success," the groups
stated in the letter which was issued when Clinton departed on his
nine-day mainland China trip on Wednesday.</P>
      <P>"What we want to tell you is that it is the people of Taiwan, not
the US or the People's Republic of China, who should decide the

      <P>"The right of self-determination by the people, proclaimed by
former US President Woodrow Wilson at the end of the First World War,
has taken deep root in the political tradition of the US," the letter
stated.</P>
      <P>The human rights diplomacy initiated by former US President Jimmy
Carter in 1978 provided substantial encouragement to the people of
Taiwan to struggle for their right to self-determination, it added.</P>
      <P>"It is our undeniable right to establish a `Taiwan Republic,'
either with or without US support," the letter continued.</P>
      <P>It went on to say that Taiwan conforms totally with the criteria
of a sovereign country, as it has independent jurisdiction over
interior, diplomatic, defense and judicial affairs in its territory.</P>
      <P>"Besides, the US should understand the fact that the PRC has not
ruled the island for a single day since 1895," the letter pointed
out.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is extremely concerned about the result of the impending
talks between Clinton and Jiang, as the so-called Taiwan issue is

      <P>"People worry about the possibility of a deal behind closed
door," said Hu. "The United States is a very trustworthy friend, but
there have been ups and downs in our relationship. Basically, of
course, people have that kind of concern and worry."</P>
      <P>"We do not hope to see the US and mainland China reach any
agreement on Taiwan, either verbal or in written form," Hu said.</P>
      <P>When asked about Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula, Hu
said Clinton's trip to Hong Kong at the end of his China tour must
not been seen as tacit agreement that the formula, originally
designed for Hong Kong, can be extended to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan and Hong Kong are completely different. Therefore
whatever is being done, the so-called 'one country, two systems'
could never be applied to Taiwan," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VIRAL OUTBREAK CAUSES CONCERN IN OVERSEAS CHINESE COMMUNITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San Francisco, June 25 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The deadly enteroviral outbreak that
has claimed the lives of at least 51 infants and young children in
Taiwan in recent weeks has sparked concern in overseas Chinese
communities in North America.</P>
      <P>Many parents in northern California have canceled plans to take
their children to Taiwan for summer vacation, community sources said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Also, some parents have decided not to allow their children to
participate in an annual six-week summer camp organized by the
Republic of China's Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC) for
ethnic Chinese children living in the United States and Canada,
sources said.</P>
      <P>"Some of them have decided to cancel their children's
registration for the summer camp program scheduled to start early
next month," said an OCAC official.</P>
      <P>The official added that the representative office has conveyed
the Chinese parents' concerns and inquiries to Taiwan authorities.</P>
      <P>So far about 1,000 Chinese adolescents, with more than 130 of
them from northern California, have registered for the program this
year.</P>
      <P>Chinese families in North America often send their children to
Taiwan to receive instruction in Chinese culture, history and
customs.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's representative office in San Francisco
has received many inquiries from Chinese parents about the status of
the enteroviral epidemic in Taiwan, sources said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a US public health official stationed at the San
Francisco International Airport denied reports that the Atlanta-based
US Centers for Disease Control has issued a directive regarding the
outbreak.</P>
      <P>The American official said that without a formal CDC directive,
the public health office would not take any precautionary measures or
issue a travel warning.</P>
      <P>The official was responding to a local press report that a
17-year-old Taiwan student in the United States had twice developed a
high fever after visiting Taiwan in March. The report cited medical
reports that indicated the student had developed symptoms similar to
Taiwan's enterovirus patients. The report further said the student is
almost certain to have been infected by the intestinal virus.</P>
      <P>Spread by physical contact, the enterovirus usually attacks
children under 5 years old. The virus breaks down the immune system
and can leave infants susceptible to encephalitis, meningitis and
acute inflammation of the heart muscle.</P>
      <P>Initial symptoms include fever, vomiting, drowsiness and ulcers
in the mouth and on the feet and hands. Of those infected, however,
only a small number develop more severe complications such as
encephalitis or meningitis.</P>

      <P>Patrick Chairman Chris Corrigan said the new deal would boost the

      <P>"Kundun," the epic tale of the early life

hit in Australia.</P>
      <P>"Kundun," which was previously banned in Australia over fears of
protest from mainland China, has taken in almost A$450,000
(US$281,250) since it opened on 21 screens last Thursday, according
to Friday's Sydney Morning Herald.</P>
      <P>"Kundun" is fifth in box-office rankings, behind such
blockbusters as "Godzilla" and "Deep Impact," according to the paper.</P>
      <P>At Paddington's Academy Twin Cinema in Sydney, "Kundun" earned a
record A$50,000 (US$31,250) in its first week.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Nicolas Whatson, general manager of Palace Cinemas
News South Wales, said demand is so strong that it is now being shown
on both the cinema's screens. Calling the movie's proceeds
unprecedented, at least within the past 20 years, he said, "We've had
an absolutely extraordinary response. It's really exciting to see a
quality adult film do terrific business."</P>
      <P>The impressive screen average of A$21,303 (US$13,314) for the
opening week of "Kundun" has encouraged its distributor, NewVision,
to order more prints and begin negotiations with Australia's big
three distributors: Hoyts, Village and Greater Union. All three
distributors have expressed interest, said Frank Cox, NewVision's 
managing director.</P>
      <P>The daily reported the movie's success in Australia comes after a

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN PAPER CALLS ON CLINTON TO PRESS BEIJING TO REFORM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton should, during
his trip to mainland China, pressure Beijing to launch immediate
political reforms, free all political and religious prisoners and
scrap restrictions on freedom of speech, according to The Sydney
Morning Herald.</P>
      <P>"The US leader should make it clear Beijing has the choice of
either launching reforms which will give China a chance to minimize
the pain from its looming crisis -- or continuing down the path to
political chaos and oblivion," wrote author David Lague.</P>
      <P>Lague noted Clinton's visit is important because he is in an
unrivaled position to influence President Jiang Zemin and the
post-Deng leadership at a time when "China needs the US much more
than the US needs China."</P>
      <P>"The major danger China poses for the region and the world is not
that it rises to become a belligerent superpower but that it follows
an Indonesian-style path to economic and political collapse, which
would destabilize the region and lead to a colossal refugee exodus."</P>
      <P>He said the United States' conclusion that mainland China's
refusal to devalue its currency amid the Asian financial crisis is a
sign that this ancient nation is ready to assume a leadership role in
the international community is wrong.</P>
      <P>"This is an absurd and possibly dangerous fiction. The reality is
that when Air Force One touched down last night in the ancient Silk
Road capital of Xian, the leader of the world's superpower landed in
a vast and desperately poor country mired in a monumental political
and economic mess," he noted.</P>
      <P>Mainland China has maintained the value of its currency because
it makes sense for them to do so. "If it is judged that depreciation
is necessary to boost sagging exports and maintain economic growth,
the yuan will be devalued -- because the government does not have the
luxury of making grand gestures. It's too busy struggling to
survive," Lague wrote.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ARATS OFFICIAL TO VISIT TAIPEI IN JULY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing will arrange for Li Yafei, deputy
secretary-general of the semi-official Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait, to visit Taipei in late July to help resume
long-stalled cross-strait talks, an ARATS source said Friday.</P>
      <P>Beijing would like Li to visit Taipei prior to a possible visit
to mainland China this fall by Taiwan's top cross-straits negotiator,
Koo Chen-fu, according to the source.</P>
      <P>ARATS on Thursday invited Koo, chairman of the Taipei-based
Straits Exchange Foundation, a semi-official body authorized to
handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of formal contacts, to
visit the mainland in the fall.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the SEF, ARATS invited Koo to visit Fujian,
Shanghai, Nanjing, Xian and Beijing in September or October.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Jan Jyh-horng said upon learning of
the letter that the SEF welcomes a visit by Li and is pleased with
this latest development.</P>
      <P>SEF in a June 19 letter to ARATS proposed that Jan visit Beijing
in July and SEF Vice Chairman Shi Hwei-yow visit in August to pave
the way for a visit by Koo in September or October.</P>
      <P>Thursday's letter was ARATS' first response to the proposal.
Although requests that Jan and Shi visit in advance of Koo were not
answered, the reply did invite Shi to accompany Koo on his visit.</P>
      <P>Local political observers said the ARATS letter was apparently a
result of the impact of US President Bill Clinton's visit to mainland
China, which began the same day.</P>
      <P>Regular cross-strait dialogue, initiated in 1993 after SEF
Chairman Koo Chen-fu and ARATS Chairman Wang Daohan met in Singapore,
was unilaterally suspended by Beijing in 1995 after ROC President Lee
Teng-hui visited the United States. Beijing viewed the visit as an
effort to promote Taiwan independence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>US State Department spokesman James
Rubin on Thursday confirmed that Taiwan will be briefed on the
upcoming summit between US President Bill Clinton and mainland
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Rubin made the confirmation in a news briefing to foreign
reporters in Washington in response to a question on whether Richard
Bush, chairman of the American Institute in Taipei, will fly to
Taipei to offer a report after Saturday's Clinton-Jiang talks.</P>
      <P>Rubin said he did not know when, exactly, the briefing might take
place. "We'll tell them what transpired, in general terms, with
China," he said.</P>
      <P>The only scheduled briefing on Clinton's mainalnd visit is one to
be made by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Japan as she
returns to the United States, he said.</P>
      <P>As for Congressional approval for renewing mainland China's most
favored nation trade status, Rubin said the White House is delighted
that Congress understands the administration's belief that engaging
mainland China is the best way to deal with US concerns over human
rights and weapons proliferation.</P>
      <P>Noting that Beijing has released several political dissidents,
such as Wang Dan and Wei Jingsheng, and has agreed to sign the United
Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Rubin
said such developments have proved the effectiveness of the
administration's policy.</P>
      <P>Despite strong criticism of Beijing's human rights record, the US
House Ways and Means Committee approved MFN, endorsed by Clinton, in
a voice vote on Thursday.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton was tricked into
accepting a welcoming ceremony ill-befitting his status when he
arrived in mainland China Thursday, a Hong Kong newspaper reported
Friday.</P>
      <P>The Sing Tao Yih Pao daily quoted an unnamed Beijing University
professor as saying that the meticulous ceremony arranged by mainland
authorities to welcome Clinton into the ancient city of Xian was by
no means a ritual accorded Chinese emperors.</P>
      <P>Although grand in style, the history professor said, the ceremony
mainly imitated a ritual performed to welcome an envoy from a vassal
state who had come to pay tribute to an ancient Chinese emperor.</P>
      <P>As the head of state from such a powerful country as the United
States, the professor said, Clinton should not have accepted such a
welcome.</P>
      <P>"With limited knowledge about Chinese culture, Clinton fell into
a trap set up by his mainland counterpart, Jiang Zemin," he said.</P>
      <P>Xian was the capital of 12 ancient Chinese dynasties, the
professor said. "Most of the 72 emperors reining in those periods
were buried in the city. Many Chinese people have thus believed that
Xian is filled with spirits of the deceased. Senior communist
leaders, from Mao Zedong on down, have been reluctant to set foot in
the city."</P>
      <P>The professor further said Clinton was apparently unaware of the
taboo when he chose the northwestern city as the first leg of his
nine-day state visit, which will also take him to Beijing, Shanghai,
Gueilin and Hong Kong.</P>

      <P>Taipei on Thursday welcomed a written
invitation extended to the chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) by mainland China, and has decided to respond
quickly.</P>
      <P>The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS),
mainland China's quasi-official body authorized to handle bilateral
exchanges in the absence of official contacts, invited SEF Chairman
Koo Chen-fu to lead a delegation to Fujian, Shanghai, Nanking, Xian
and Beijing in mid-September or mid-October.</P>
      <P>SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow has also
been invited.</P>
      <P>Sheu Ke-sheng, vice chairman and spokesman of the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC), Taipei's top agency in charge of mainland
policy, told a press conference on Friday that Taipei is glad to see
"concrete progress" between the SEF and the ARATS, adding that he
believes it will benefit cross-strait exchanges and mutual
understanding.</P>
      <P>Koo's visit to mainland China will be of great significance, Sheu
remarked, adding that the trip will have to be planned carefully by
high-level SEF personnel.</P>
      <P>Shi also welcomed the invitation, but said the SEF will have to
confer with the MAC before replying. He stressed that an "appropriate
arrangement" will have to be made before any meeting between Koo and
his ARATS counterpart, Wang Daohan.</P>
      <P>Jan Jyh-horng, director of the MAC's Department of Research &amp;

    <HEADLINE>US CHINA POLICY DESCRIBED AS VACILLATING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  25  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States' China policy over
the years has been vacillating, and displaying a lack of consistency
and stability, a China analyst said here recently.</P>
      <P>Harry Harding of George Washington University made the remarks
during an interview with the Central News Agency earlier in the week.</P>
      <P>The China expert has access to high-ranking Clinton
Administration officials, and in fact briefed President Bill Clinton
for the second time on Tuesday before Clinton embarked on his visit
to mainland China.</P>
      <P>Harding noted that both sides of the Taiwan Strait have been
actively lobbying for US support, each side trying to tilt US policy
in its favor, which could be a cause of the lack of consistency in US
policy.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is therefore especially worried about what will develop
regarding US policy toward Taiwan after the US improves its ties with
the mainland, he said.</P>
      <P>Harding said he believes both sides of the Taiwan Strait have
focused too heavily on trying to influence US policy, and have not
shown enough enthusiasm in trying to develop cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>He also said that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should open
another channel for dialogue so as to help ease misunderstanding and
explore possible frameworks for future relations.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the Clinton administration has begun to address its
vacillating policy toward China, Harding said that the US seems to be
becoming more explicit about its policy toward mainland China,
pointing out that the US has said that it wants to develop a
"constructive strategic partnership," with Beijing.</P>
      <P>He said he is opposed to the US maintaining a "strategic
ambivalence" approach toward Taiwan, saying that the US should state
clearly its four basic principles, which he described as follows:</P>
      <P>-- The US insists that the future of Taiwan must be resolved by
both sides of the Taiwan Strait through peaceful means;</P>
      <P>-- The US will support any arrangement to which the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait agree;</P>
      <P>-- The US is against either side imposing its will on the other,
for example, the US will not accept a unilateral announcement of
independence by Taiwan, nor will it accept an unprovoked invasion of
Taiwan by mainland China;</P>
      <P>-- The US believes that only through continued reforms and the
steady development of cross-strait relations can the Taiwan issue be
finally resolved.</P>
      <P>Harding said he believes the US should continue to provide Taiwan
with defensive weapons under these principles, and voiced his
opposition to a recent article by Chas Freeman, former US assistant
secretary of defense, which said that the US should review its policy
regarding arms sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also stated his opposition to the setting up of a time
schedule to resolve the Taiwan issue, and to the idea that the US
should make any explicit statement in favor of the eventual
reunification of China.</P>
      <P>He described these principles as being in line with the US stance
of not wanting to act as a mediator between the two sides, and of
wishing to stop the efforts by both sides to try to dictate US
policy.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing authorities have banned mainland
Chinese media from transmitting live broadcasts of US President Bill
Clinton's activities in mainland China, a Hong Kong newspaper
reported on Friday.</P>
      <P>The Sing Tao Yih Pao daily said that although major foreign news
media have been giving extensive coverage to Clinton's ongoing
mainland visit, Beijing has tightened control of its own media.</P>
      <P>All official mainland media, including China Central Television
Station, have received directives that they should not broadcast live
Clinton footage during his nine-day state visit, the paper said.</P>
      <P>The daily continued that although Beijing's leaders regard
Clinton's visit as one of the country's most important diplomatic
events of this century, the 1.2 billion mainland residents will be
the last to know about Clinton's activities in their land.</P>
      <P>The paper quoted Beijing sources as saying the ban was imposed
out of three considerations:</P>
      <P>-- Clinton's visit is a diplomatic event, and there is no
precedent of mainland media being permitted to transmit live
broadcasts of diplomatic activities;</P>
      <P>-- While mainland China is willing to accord Clinton a grand
welcome, it wants to keep all ceremonial rituals low profile to avoid
causing suspicion or panic among neighboring powers such as Russia
and Japan;</P>
      <P>-- Beijing is afraid that Clinton may touch on some sensitive
topics, such as the bloody Tiananmen massacre, which could fuel
pro-democracy sentiments on the mainland.</P>
      <P>The paper said all official media in the four mainland cities --
Xian, Beijing, Shanghai and Gueilin -- on Clinton's itinerary have
been instructed to use as many dispatches from the Xinhua News Agency
as possible with regard to Clinton's activities. Xinhua is the
official mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party.</P>
      <P>Clinton arrived in the ancient city of Xian in northwestern
China on Thursday for a nine-day visit.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said on Friday that
the Republic of China hopes to strengthen cooperative ties with
Western democratic nations, as the ROC shares identical values and
common interests with them.</P>
      <P>In an exclusive interview with Fortune magazine conducted at his
Executive Yuan office, Siew said the ROC shares identical freedom,
democracy and human rights values with Western democracies, and has
common interests with them in areas such as economics, politics and
security.</P>
      <P>The premier said Taiwan has remained relatively unscathed by the
Asian financial turmoil thanks to its solid economic base,
well-developed high-tech sector, healthy financial systems and
well-concieved government policies.</P>
      <P>However, the island needs to continue to bolster high-tech
research and development, as well as promote economic liberalization
and financial globalization, if it intends to head off further
challenges in the future, Siew added.</P>
      <P>The interview will be published in Fortune's August issue,
together with a special report on Taiwan's high-tech development,
according to a Government Information Office source.</P>

Friday that the ROC would like to see the US and mainland China make
progress on Beijing's bid to enter the World Trade Organization
(WTO).</P>
      <P>Wang made the remarks when asked by a CNA reporter whether US

Zemin will help Beijing's WTO entry. He was also questioned on the
summit's possible effect on Taiwan's bid to join the world trade

      <P>The minister said that mainland China's progress in WTO talks has
been very slow, but pointed out that talks on Taiwan's entry have
entered the final stages. Out of the 26 WTO signatory parties that
requested bilateral talks with Taiwan, only one, the European Union,
has yet to complete them.</P>
      <P>He said his ministry is watching closely the development of the
Clinton-Jiang talks, and would welcome any progress made by Beijing
and Washington on WTO entry, especially if it could contribute to
early entry for both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan applied to enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian said
on Friday the municipal government will help foot medical bills for
city residents hospitalized for enterovirus infections.</P>
      <P>Chen made the announcement after a meeting of a contingency task
force founded by the city government to handle enterovirus-related
affairs.</P>
      <P>Chen said the city government will subsidize each hospitalized
enterovirus patient up to NT$15,000 (US$434) in hospital fees not
covered by the National Health Insurance Program.</P>
      <P>Starting on Thursday, Chen said the 23 nurseries under the
jurisdiction of the city government's Bureau of Social Affairs will
offer temporary child care services for working mothers. The service
fee is NT$100 per hour and the 23 nurseries will be able to offer
services for 1,000 kids.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chen said, the Bureau of Health will join forces with
the bureaus of Social Affairs and Education to intensify sanitary
inspections of private kindergartens, nurseries, talent classes and
after-school classes.</P>
      <P>Chen said the city government will abide by a package of
guidelines set by the Department of Health for those day-care
centers around the island to contain the further spread of the
epidemic.</P>
      <P>According to the DOH rules, each class at all those centers
should accommodate no more than 30 children and at least two tutors
should be provided for each class.</P>
      <P>If two children are found to have been infected in each class,
then the class should be closed. All those centers should give a
30-minute sanitation education to the children in the morning, with
emphasis on handwashing.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chen said, the municipal government will furnish
each household with a copy of manual within the next five days to
help city residents better understand the enterovirus-related
symptoms and complications as well as effective precautionary
measures to prevent the viral infection.</P>
      <P>All city government-run hospitals will offer round-the-clock
counseling services and the city government has also set up hotlines,
fax lines and an Internet website to offer counseling and
information about the latest development of the epidemic.</P>
      <P>Chen also called on all citizens to cooperate with the city

      <P>Taiwan Provincial Governor James Soong
said on Friday that he does not expect the Clinton-Jiang summit to
harm the interests and rights of the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Soong said that Taiwan's people have the right to pursue a system
based on the principles of freedom and democracy, and they do not
want to be treated as a pawn in Washington-Beijing negotiations.</P>
      <P>"No country or individual has the right to use the well-being of
the people of Taiwan as a political bargaining chip," Soong stressed.</P>
      <P>He said the people of Taiwan treasure the friendship between
Taiwan and the US, and will continue to pursue democracy and freedom.
Both of the Clinton government and Beijing authorities should "never
ignore the will and determination of the people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>The governor added that the cross-Taiwan Strait dispute should be
resolved in a peaceful and rational way.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's people enjoy life under a free and democratic
system and that while they do not desire to engage in any form of
armed conflict, they will never accept being ruled by a communist
Chinese regime.</P>
      <P>Mainland China and Taiwan have been divided and ruled by separate
governments since the 1949 civil war, with each side claiming
sovereignty over the whole of China.</P>
      <P>However, most countries around the world recognize Beijing as the
sole legitimate ruler of China, and the Beijing government as a

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE RECESSION SEEN WORSE THAN THAT IN 1985</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  26  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's economy is heading for a
recession worse than the one it experienced in 1985, economists from
Nanyang Technological University (NTU) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The forecast for Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) is
expected to shrink by 1.7 percent this year and the economy will
experience a mild recession, they said.</P>
      <P>In the 1985 downturn, the economy contracted 1.6 percent.</P>
      <P>Falling external demand -- both regionally and globally -- will
push Singapore into recession this year even though its economic
fundamentals are sound.</P>
      <P>The good news is that the recession will be short-lived and the
economy will bounce back next year to register a mild growth of 3.2
percent.</P>
      <P>The NTU forecast for this year is the gloomiest so far. Based on
a quarterly econometric model, it predicts the economy will have
shrunk by 2.7 percent in the April-June quarter ending on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The drop would worsen in the third and fourth quarters this year
and spill over into the first quarter of next year before a
turn-around will occur.</P>
      <P>The Singapore government is due to present an updated official
forecast on Monday when a package of off-budget measures to boost the
economy is unveiled in Parliament.</P>
      <P>The NTU economists said Singapore's economic outlook had worsened
due to the following four factors: another cyclical slowdown in the
global electronic industry, which hit Singapore's manufacturing
sector and thus exports; prolonged political and economic
uncertainties in Indonesia; a weak Japanese economy and yen; and a
meltdown of Singapore's services exports.</P>
      <P>Singapore's two growth engines -- the manufacturing sector and
financial and business services sector -- are both heading for a
contraction, the economists predicted.</P>
      <P>Manufacturing output is likely to contract by 3.3 percent, hit by
the downturn in the global electronics industry and significant
reduction in Singapore's manufactured exports.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the financial and business services sector output is
predicted to decline 2.9 percent this year due to a contraction in
loans and advances, a tapering off in volatility in share prices and
falling property prices.</P>
      <P>The recession will likely keep consumer prices down even though
the Singapore dollar would be soft at 1.78 to the US dollar before
recovering.</P>
      <P>The economists said economic growth next year would be led by
manufactured exports, expected to rebound with a full recovery in the
global electronics industry.</P>
      <P>However, for financial and business services, the recovery would
only take place toward the second half of next year, they added.</P>

      <P>Three dissidents living in Hangzhou,
capital of Zhejiang Province in eastern China issued Thursday a
statement, saying that they want to establish "the Democratic Party
of China".</P>
      <P>They also filed an application Thursday for establishing the
political party with the Civil Affairs Department of the Zhejiang
Provincial People's Government, according to a press release from the
Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
movement in China.</P>
      <P>The dissidents' open declaration of their plan to establish an
opposition party in mainland China is unprecedented, and therefore
is an epoch-making event, the information center said in the news
release.</P>
      <P>The dissidents also made public Thursday the constitution of the
political party.</P>
      <P>The party will bring direct democratic elections to the Chinese
mainland, establish a constitutional democratic system, and eliminate
totalitarian and corruptive rule, the statement said.</P>
      <P>The statement also said that political power comes from the
general public, and that the government must be built on the basis of
free elections.</P>
      <P>The three dissidents are Wang Youcai, Wang Donghai, and Lin Hui.
Wang Youcai was one of the 21 student leaders wanted by the public
security authorities for their part in the 1989 Tiananmen incident.
He was captured later and sentenced to four years in prison. He was
released from prison in 1991.</P>
      <P>They called upon all democracy campaigners in the country to
join the party so that a national congress of the party can be
convened in the not too distant future, although it is uncertain
whether the Chinese communist government will tolerate such an
activity.</P>

      <P>US President Bill Clinton said Washington
does not plan to change its policy with regard to Taiwan despite
continued pressure from Beijing to officially denounce Taipei's bid
to join international organizations.</P>
      <P>Clinton told a group of US journalists accompanying him on his
trip to Xiahe Village in Shannxi, mainland China that the United
States will stick to its policy shaped by the three communiques
between the Washington and Beijing as well as the Taiwan Relations
Act.</P>
      <P>Although the 1978 communique acknowledges there is only one China
and Taiwan is a part of it, Washington has resisted Beijing's demand
for a proclamation that it would not support an independent Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan authorities were delighted that Washington did not bow to
Beijing pressure to reverse its long-standing policy.</P>
      <P>The president's comments were in response to a question from the
press. The exchange was released by Clinton's press secretary and
went as follows:</P>
      <P>Question: There have been some suggestions that you're going to
sort of accept the Chinese insistence, that during the press
conference you're going to sort of declare the United States decision
not supporting Taiwan independence, not supporting Taiwan's bid for
the United Nations, and not supporting one China, one Taiwan, (or)
two China's. Is it going to happen?</P>
      <P>Clinton: Well, first of all, you should come to the press
conference to see what happens. But our position with regard to
Taiwan is embodied in the three communiques and in the Taiwan
Relations Act and in the facts of our relationship over the years. So
I think it's obvious that there will be no change in our position one
way or the other on this trip.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Council for Economic
Planning and Development (CEPD) warned Friday that Taiwan's economy
may further decline in the coming months as major economic indicators
showed signs of sluggishness in May.</P>
      <P>The CEPD said Taiwan's economy continued to flash a "yellow-blue"
light in May in accordance with a government rating system, with the
composite index standing at 20 points, the same as in April.</P>
      <P>The CEPD uses a five-color rating system to gauge the domestic
economy. A "red" light means the economy is overheated, a
"yellow-red" light reflects the heating up of an economy, "green"
indicates stable growth, while "yellow-blue" refers to an economic
slowdown. A "blue" light indicates a recession.</P>
      <P>The highest government agency in charge of drawing up the
nation's economic policy said it would be hard for the local economy
to receive a "green light" for June because of a weaker New Taiwan
dollar and a dull financial sector.</P>
      <P>Although the government has taken measures to stimulate local
demand as a means of propping up the island's economic performance,
the CEPD pointed out, the domestic economy may further slide in the
third quarter since the May leading economic indicators have shown
signs of deterioration.</P>

determination to maintain its Taiwan policy.</P>
      <P>Hailing Clinton's comment as a clear and firm signal that
Washington will stay on course with its current Taiwan policy,
Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Roy Wu said "we appreciate and
welcome it."</P>
      <P>In response to a journalist's question about the possibility that
he will officially announce a decision not to support Taiwan, Clinton
said "there is no change in our position" with regard to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is the first hint Clinton has given that he will not make any
promises over Taiwan other than those already provided in the three
communiques with Beijing. He also quelled speculation that Washington
will knuckle under Beijing pressure to denounce support for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs David Tawei Lee called
Clinton's remark as a "generalized term" which reflected Washington's
desire, but it remains to be seen how events will develop.</P>
      <P>Lee said a special Cabinet-level group has been set up to monitor
Clinton's mainland visit and will keep a close eye on the summit

      <P>Taiwan's net foreign debt incurred by
domestic banks totaled only US$2.9 billion as of the end of June
1997, the Central Bank of China (CBC) said Friday.</P>
      <P>The CBC made the statement to clarify a report by the US-based
Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) credit rating corporation. In its recently
released report, S&amp;P gave Taiwan's long-term foreign currency and
domestic currency debt credit rating an "AA+" and the rating for the
nation's short-term foreign and domestic currencies an "A-1+".</P>
      <P>S&amp;P considers the general situation for Taiwan's foreign debt
stable.</P>
      <P>However, S&amp;P indicated Taiwan's international reserves amounts to
US$84 billion, almost three times of that of total short-term foreign
debt of the nation, implying the nation's total short-term foreign
debt was near US$30 billion. The CBC said that figure does not
reflect reality.</P>
      <P>The CBC indicated the statistics released by the Bank of
International Settlement (BIS) showed total amounts of the nation's

branches in offshore financial business and does not include the debt

    <TEXT>
      <P>No major accomplishments will be made by US
President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese leader Jiang Zemin during
their summit in Beijing on Saturday, according to a report by the
Kuomintang.</P>
      <P>Bargaining, compromises and an exchange of interests will feature
in the summit, said the report which was carried in the latest issue
of "Mainland Situation" a biweekly published by the KMT's Mainland
Research Department.</P>
      <P>In the face of strong support for Taiwan in the US Congress and
other sectors, Clinton is not expected to make any big concessions to
Jiang on US policy toward Taiwan and other major issues, said the
report.</P>
      <P>However, Clinton and Jiang will likely reach a consensus on
certain other issues, including the framework of a Washington-Beijing
strategic partnership, trade, regional security and human rights
protection, the report said.</P>
      <P>Clinton's visit will help boost mainland China's international
status, increase its confidence, willingness and ability to take part
in international affairs and give it ample room to play in the
international community.</P>
      <P>Although Clinton is not expected to concede to Jiang on the
Taiwan issue, he will likely make a "certain degree of compromise" in
this regard, the report added.</P>
      <P>If this is the case, the "psychological impact" it will have on
Taiwan will be more than substantial, the report said.</P>
      <P>But if Clinton agrees to Beijing's demand to codify the so-called
"three no's" policy -- no US support for Taiwan's membership in the
United Nations, no US support for "one China, one Taiwan" or two
Chinas, and no US support for Taiwan independence -- then an
additional barrier will be erected to Taiwan's bid to increase its
international profile, it added.</P>
      <P>On the issue of cross-strait relations, the report said as
Taiwan's strategic position remains unchanged, maintaining the status
quo on cross-strait relations will be in the US' best interests.</P>
      <P>Although the US will likely ask both sides of the Taiwan Strait
to increase contact and exchanges, Beijing's manner is key to whether
cross-strait ties can be substantially improved, the report said.</P>

      <P>After the two-hour summit meeting with mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, US President Bill Clinton said he regretted that no
breakthrough agreements were reached on Beijing's WTO bid.</P>
      <P>"President Jiang and I agreed on the importance of China's entry
into the World Trade Organization. I regret we did not make more
progress on this front. We must recommit ourselves to achieving that
goal," Clinton said.</P>
      <P>The key factor causing Beijing's WTO bid to lag behind is that it
wants to join the WTO as a developing, rather than a developed,
country.</P>
      <P>During previous rounds of WTO talks with the US, mainland China
has argued unsuccessfully that it should receive favorable membership
terms as a developing country. In other words, Beijing does not want
to assume the responsibilities of a developed country in its foreign
trade dealings.</P>
      <P>A day earlier, US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said
in Beijing that the US wants greater access to mainland China's
agricultural, industrial, and service markets before it will fully
support Beijing's WTO bid.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, ROC Vice Economic Affairs Minister Lin Yi-fu said in
Taipei on Saturday that Taiwan's accession to the WTO should not be
affected by the results of the Clinton-Jiang talks.</P>
      <P>Lin said Taiwan is expected to sign a WTO agreement with the US
in the next two weeks, as only the wording on seven product items
needs to be reconfirmed.</P>
      <P>Among the 26 WTO member countries which have conducted bilateral
consultations with Taiwan on its terms for WTO membership, only talks
with the European Union have yet to be finalized, while negotiations
with the US, Argentina, Thailand and Hong Kong have concluded
successfully, but without the signing of formal agreements.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the agreements with Thailand and Argentina are also
expected to be signed in the near future, while talks with the EU are
expected to be concluded next month when Economic Affairs Minister
Wang Chih-kang visits Europe to take care of the matter personally.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong has been reluctant to formally ink its accord because
it fears angering Beijing, Lin noted. The mainland China authorities
feel that Taiwan should not be allowed WTO entry before the mainland,
irrespective of negotiations or agreements.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING OVERTURE AIMED AT 'FORMALIZING' ROC'S DEMISE: SEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's proposal that the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait hold political talks to end their state of
hostility is aimed at "formalizing" or "confirming" the Republic of
China's demise, an experienced negotiator with mainland China said on
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Shi Hwei-yow, vice chairman and secretary-general of the Straits
Exchange Foundation (SEF), the quasi-official intermediary body
authorized to handle cross-strait exchanges in the absence of
official ties with mainland China, made the remarks at a seminar
marking the first anniversary of Hong Kong's reversion to Beijing's
rule.</P>
      <P>Shi said mainland China intends to use the conduit of political
talks to formally end the civil war between the ROC government and
communist forces.</P>
      <P>"By so doing, Beijing will be able to formally declare the demise
of the ROC and assert its claim that the so-called `one China' means
the People's Republic of China," Shi explained.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, Shi said, the ROC, founded in 1911 as Asia's
first republic, has continued to exist even after it lost the
mainland to the Chinese communists and moved its seat of government
to Taiwan in 1949.</P>
      <P>Shi further said that the "one country, two systems" unification
scheme imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong last July is absolutely
inapplicable to Taiwan, pointing out that the ROC is an independent
sovereign state, while Hong Kong is a former British colony. The ROC
will never accept the "one country, two systems" formula, he said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Wu An-chia, vice chairman of the
Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), said the ROC looks
forward to seeing Hong Kong retain its freedom, democracy and
prosperity.</P>
      <P>"A liberal, democratic and prosperous Hong Kong will certainly
benefit increased ties with Taiwan and also contribute to positive
interactions across the Taiwan Strait," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Wu also reiterated the ROC's opposition to Beijing's "one
country, two systems" formula, saying it in no way befits Taiwan's
status.</P>
      <P>"As a democracy, the ROC formulates its policy based on public
opinion. At the moment, the majority of its people oppose communist
China's one-party dictatorship and socialist system," Wu explained.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, many public opinion polls have shown that
nearly half of Hong Kong's residents also believe the "one country,
two systems" formula is unsuitable for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"As a sovereign state, the ROC has its own defense and foreign
policies and can decide its own destiny," Wu said, adding that Hong
Kong, in contrast, is just a special administrative region under
Beijing's jurisdiction. "Against this backdrop, it's extremely
inaccurate to compare Taiwan to Hong Kong," he added.</P>

      <P>A dispute over dissidents has caused some
tension in the early stages of US President Bill Clinton's visit to
mainland China, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (CBC) reported on
Friday.</P>
      <P>The report said US officials formally complained to Beijing about
several dissidents who were arrested just before Clinton's arrival on
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Two of them were freed on Friday shortly before Clinton left the
area. Yang Hai, 29, who was jailed for a year for his role in the
1989 pro-democracy demonstrations, said he was "kidnapped" by police
on Thursday to stop him meeting US journalists, according to the CBC.</P>
      <P>Yang Jun was freed after being held overnight, the report said.</P>
      <P>It noted that Clinton was expected to raise the issue on Saturday

      <P>US President Bill Clinton has reassured
the Republic of China that the US will continue to supply weapons and
defend Taiwan from any unprovoked aggression from mainland China,
Australia's mass circulation daily The Sydney Morning Herald reported

with mainland China and the US' Taiwan Relations Act, combined with
the history of Washington's ties with Taipei over the years.</P>

the most friction in the difficult relationship between Washington

      <P>Taipei is worried that the US will bend to pressure from Beijing
over arms sales which allow the heavily outnumbered Taiwan military

      <P>The program, launched in 1995 by former Prime Minister Paul

    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore's manufacturing output in May
fell 4.5 percent from the same month of 1997, dragged down by a 9.6
percent drop in electronics production, the Singapore Economic
Development Board (EDB) said Friday.</P>
      <P>All major segments of the electronics cluster, except computer
peripherals and printed circuit-board assembly had lower output.</P>
      <P>"Weak demand lowered the output levels of personal computers and
telecommunication equipment," the EDB said, adding that excess supply
decreased the output of disk drives and semiconductors.</P>
      <P>Singapore's manufacturing output for the first five months of
this year grew 3 percent compared to the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Chemicals and engineering clusters managed to chalk up positive
growth in their output in May at 4.9 percent and 0.6 percent
respectively.</P>
      <P>The petrochemical, pharmaceutical and petroleum segments powered
the output growth of the chemicals cluster, which expanded a healthy
14.1 percent for the January-May period year-on-year, statistics
showed.</P>
      <P>A small May production increase in the engineering cluster was
due to "the decline in the precision engineering segment and was
almost nullified by increases in the transport and process
engineering segments," the report said.</P>
      <P>Overall, engineering output expanded 9.2 percent in the first
five months of this year. Production in transport engineering grew
17.4 percent, while that of process engineering, rose 10.5 percent.

    <DATELINE>Beijing,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Wang Hsin-chung &amp; Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton did not mention
the so-called "three noes" policy toward Taiwan during a joint press
conference at the end of his two-hour summit with mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin on Saturday.</P>
      <P>In an ensuing report on the summit achievements, the US
authorities also did not mention either Taiwan, or the cross-Taiwan
Strait issue.</P>
      <P>The "three noes," which Beijing was keen to discuss at the
summit, are: no US support for the "one China, one Taiwan" policy; no
US support for Taiwan independence; and no US support for Taiwan's
membership in international organizations.</P>
      <P>Throughout the Clinton-Jiang press conference, little was
mentioned about Taiwan, except for Jiang's remark that "the issue of
Taiwan is an important and sensitive one and the US must stick to its
policy of recognizing only one legitimate Chinese government `in the
interest of smooth growth' in US-China relations."</P>
      <P>Jiang mentioned Taiwan a second time when he was talking about
Tibet. He said there are two preconditions for Beijing to resume
talks with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader. Firstly, he
said, the Dalai Lama must recognize that Tibet is a part of China,
and secondly, the Dalai Lama must also recognize that Taiwan is a
province of China.</P>
      <P>Clinton, for his part, reaffirmed the US' "one China" policy,
which opposes independence for Taiwan, and he encouraged more direct
dialogue between Taipei and Beijing. The pursuit of the "cross-strait
discussions that recently resumed is the best path to a peaceful
resolution" of differences between the two sides, he said.</P>
      <P>Clinton made no further references to Taiwan, not even toward the
end of the press conference when he was responding to Jiang's remarks
about Tibet. Clinton said only that the US recognizes Tibet as a part
of China, without mentioning Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Clinton's paucity of words about Taiwan seemed in line with the
administration's original intentions regarding the summit agenda, as
well as a recent call by several US congressmen not to codify the
"three noes" during his mainland China trip.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The majority of Taiwan companies with
interests in mainland China have high expectations for an early
resumption of dialogue across the Taiwan Strait, according to a
recent opinion poll released on Saturday.</P>
      <P>The survey, conducted by the Chinese National Federation of
Industries (CNFI), found that 87.2 percent of the respondents
believe that reopening of long-stalled cross-strait dialogue will
benefit bilateral trade and economic cooperation. Only 12.3 percent
said they don't think resuming talks will have a great impact on
cross-strait commercial ties.</P>
      <P>The CNFI dispatched questionnaires to 2,000 local enterprises
randomly selected from the 18,000 corporations with legally
registered mainland investments on May 15-31. The federation
received 385 valid replies for a 19.25 percent return rate.</P>
      <P>Among the respondents, 71.4 percent said economic issues should
be given the top priority if the two sides resume dialogue; 18.1
percent said functional or practical issues should be discussed
first; 7.6 percent said political topics should top the agenda;
while 2.9 percent said diplomatic issues whould be addressed first.</P>
      <P>The survey also found that most local business people have
become more optimistic about the future of cross-strait relations.
Nearly 53 percent said they are convinced that cross-strait ties will
improve gradually in the next two years. In a similar CNFI poll, only
30 percent gave an optimistic forecast for the development of
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>According to poll results, 77.3 percent of the respondents said
they think mainland China's currency will depreciate in the next two
years, while 21.1 percent said they expect the yuan to remain stable
over the coming year.</P>
      <P>As much as 82 percent said they believe if the mainland currency
does not depreciate, the competitiveness of mainland-produced goods
will be seriously weakened or affected.</P>
      <P>The CNFI released the survey results shortly after the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) invited C. F. Koo, chairman of Taipei's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) to visit the mainland either in mid-September or
in mid-October.</P>
      <P>SEF and ARATS are quasi-official intermediary bodies
authoritized by their respective governments to handle cross-strait
exchanges in the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Beijing unilaterally suspended institutionalized dialogue
between the two bodies shortly after ROC President Lee Teng-hui made
a landmark visit to the United States in June 1995. Beijing
interpreted Lee's US visit as a move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China has on many occasions called for early
resumption of regular SEF-ARATS dialogue, including a long-stalled
meeting between SEF Chairman Koo and his ARATS counterpart, Wang
Daohan.</P>

      <P>The Taiwan industries of frozen foods, frozen seafood and frozen
vegetables and fruits -- which altogether exported an average of
US$300 million worth of products annually -- are aggressively seeking
sales overseas as the domestic market in Taiwan is saturated, said
Shen Dah, head of the Taiwan Association of Frozen Food Industries.</P>
      <P>Shen said products they are seeking to promote in the United
States are frozen vegetables, fruits, vegetarian food and seafood.
They will not introduce any animal products as the US prohibits meat
imports.</P>
      <P>America is now Taiwan's second largest overseas market of frozen
seafood, said Hsu Chuo-ying, head of the Taiwan Regional Association
of Frozen Seafood Product.</P>
      <P>With frozen seafood exports to the US reaching US$188 million
last year, more than half of Taiwan's entire frozen foods exports,
the frozen seafood industry is encouraged and is attempting to
increase its presence in the US market, Hsu noted.</P>
      <P>The frozen food industry representatives will proceed to the east
coast of the United States Saturday to continue their promotion of
Taiwan-processed frozen foods.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports of frozen foods once reached a high of US$2.3
billion a year, a level comparable to that of the textile and garment

      <P>The industry, however, shrank to about US$300 million over the

      <P>Republic of China Foreign Minister Jason Hu
on Friday delivered a keynote speech at an international conference
in Warsaw.</P>
      <P>The three-day "International Relations and Democracy" conference
which opened on Friday, is being jointly sponsored by the Stefan
Batory Foundation of Poland, the Institute for National Policy
Research of the ROC, and the International Forum for Democratic
Studies of the United States.</P>
      <P>In his address, Hu discussed the need for the world's democracies
to stand together in defense of democratic principles, and to join
together in efforts to strengthen democracy throughout the world.</P>
      <P>Emphasizing that democracy fosters sustainable economic policies
over the long term, the minister said that in the wake of the Asian
financial crisis, the advantages of democracy have become clearer. An
authoritarian regime can quickly change its economic policies, he
said, while a democracy is better able to make a sustainable
commitment to policy reform.</P>
      <P>He elaborated on this by saying that while authoritarian rulers
can reverse their decisions overnight, mature democracies have
institutionalized constraints such as constitutional checks and
balances, due process, and legislative deliberation. These
constraints make it more difficult for policy to be changed on a whim
or for the benefit of a select group.</P>
      <P>"For my country, the Republic of China on Taiwan, it is paramount
that the global democratic transformation of our time should spread
and take root. We know that the fate of democracy is mainly
determined from within, but we have come to appreciate how much of a
difference international support and solidarity can make," He said.</P>

economic and academic circles at a meeting held to further enhance

      <P>The official went on to explain the intricacies of the

    <HEADLINE>PASSENGER LINER SUPERSTAR CAPRICORN TOWED BACK TO KEELUNG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A passenger liner which stalled en route
from Japan's Okinawa to Keelung due to a power outage, arrived in
Taiwan's northern port of Keelung Saturday afternoon with the
assistance of two ROC navy towboats.</P>
      <P>The Star Cruises Superstar Capricorn left Keelung Wednesday for
Okinawa's capital city Naha to begin a routine three-day, two night
voyage, with 515 crew and 218 passengers on board.</P>
      <P>According to schedule, the Panama-registered vessel should return
to Keelung at 4:00 p.m. Friday, but it stalled about 30 miles off
Keelung due to a power failure.</P>
      <P>The liner's Taiwan agency, Barwil Agencies Inc., sought
assistance from the ROC navy. Five of navy boats rushed to the scene,
but due to rough waves and poor nighttime visibility, towing did not
start until early Saturday morning.</P>
      <P>Before the towing began, Keelung mayor Lee Ching-yuan and
officials from Star Cruises took a fishing boat to approach the
Superstar Capricorn. They tried to calm the passengers down and
explain what the towing process entailed.</P>
      <P>The ship finally reached port at 1:30 p.m. and passengers were
allowed ashore soon afterward. Many passengers expressed gratitude
for being able to return safe and sound.</P>
      <P>Most of the passengers looked tired as they spent a sleepless
night without electricity and water. Some passengers told reporters
that they were not afraid during the crisis as they sang to pass the
time on deck.</P>
      <P>Several passengers said they felt the captain and crew had done
their best and helped calm them during their horrible 23-hour ordeal.
One woman passenger said the captain told them they were the best
passengers in the world, adding that unity and calmness helped them
get through the night.</P>
      <P>Barwil Agencies Inc. apologized to passengers for the
inconvenience and gave them red envelopes containing NT$500 as they
stepped off the vessel. The company said it would refund the full
fare to passengers and offer a free ocean trip.</P>
      <P>The 28,000-ton vessel measuring 673 feet in length with a 82.7
feet mast, belongs to an Indonesian group. The 25-year-old 10-decked
ship has 400 guest rooms for 800 passengers with entertainment
facilities such as pubs, karaoke clubs, video game parlors, swimming
pools, and a sauna.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's policy-making leaders will hold a

July, government sources said Saturday.</P>
      <P>It will be the first such meeting this year for the top advisory

      <P>Reports on the summit, as well as the current mainland and

    <HEADLINE>SUMMIT ENDS, US URGED TO ABIDE BY PRINCIPLES OF THREE COMMUNIQUES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Wang Hsin-chung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
Saturday urged the United States to abide by the "three Sino-US joint
communiques and joint statement to ensure the smooth development of
bilateral ties."</P>
      <P>Jiang made the call in his opening remarks at a joint news
conference held with US President Bill Clinton after the two leaders
met at Beijing's Great Hall of the People Saturday morning. Jiang
said that the Taiwan issue is the most important and sensitive issue
in Beijing-Washington relations.</P>
      <P>During the long-anticipated summit meeting some agreements were
forged, but division on several issues remained, most notably those
regarding human rights. Jiang argued that since the two countries
differ in social system, ideology, historical, cultural and
traditional backgrounds, they have different ways and means to
realize human rights and fundamental freedoms.</P>
      <P>Leaders of the two sides reached an agreement not to target their
respective nuclear missiles at each other's country. This move
indicates to the world that "China and the United States are
cooperative partners instead of adversaries," Jiang said.</P>
      <P>He said mainland China has promised not to be the first to use
nuclear weapons under any circumstances since it first possessed
nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>In their meeting, Jiang and Clinton promised to strengthen their
dialogue and cooperation between the two countries on major
international issues.</P>
      <P>The two agreed that mainland China and the US, as permanent
members of the UN Security Council, should continue to make concerted
efforts to promote peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and
the world as a whole, Jiang said.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that, "common interests of China and the US are
not reducing, but increasing; and the foundation for bilateral
cooperation is not weakened, but consolidated."</P>
      <P>Jiang said he and Clinton believe the two countries should also
work together to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, strengthen environment protection, crack down on
international crime, drug trafficking and international terrorism.</P>
      <P>The visiting US president said that "a stable, open and
prosperous China is good for the United States."</P>
      <P>Clinton reaffirmed the "one China" policy, saying that "I
reaffirmed our long-standing 'one China' policy to President Jiang,
and urged him to pursue the cross-strait discussions recently resumed
as the best plan to a peaceful resolution."</P>

      <P>The chairman of Taiwan's main opposition
party said on Saturday he is satisfied with US President Bill
Clinton's firm stance on the issue of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsin-liang, chairman of the pro-independence Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), made the statement shortly after Clinton and
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin held a joint news conference
in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Clinton said at the press conference that in his summit meeting
with Jiang Saturday morning, he had reaffirmed the United States'
"one China" policy. He also advocated the pursuit of the
"cross-strait discussion that recently resumed as the best path to a
peaceful resolution" of disputes between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>"Judging from Clinton's statement, the United States has not made
any concessions to communist China over the Taiwan issue," Hsu said,
adding that Clinton did not touch on such sensitive issues as US arms
sales to Taiwan and the so-called 'three no's' policy.</P>
      <P>Hsu said Clinton's firm attitude will help improve Taiwan's
status in the international community. "His friendly gesture has
enabled Taiwan to face mainland China on an equal footing," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu also lauded Clinton for bringing up human rights issues and
the bloody Tiananmen massacre in his talks with Jiang.</P>
      <P>Even though Beijing failed to make major breakthroughs in issues

    <HEADLINE>THOUSANDS DEMONSTRATE FOR TAIWAN INDEPENDENCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Thousands of Taiwan independence advocates
took part in a demonstration Saturday, demanding that the government
hold a referendum on Dec. 5 to allow voters to determine the future
of the island.</P>
      <P>The event was organized by about 20 pro-independence groups such
as the Taiwan Independence Party (TAIP) and Association of Taiwan
Professors.</P>
      <P>Organizers said they wanted to express concern over the possible
effects on Taiwan of the summit meeting between US President Bill
Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, and highlight the
right of Taiwan citizens to self-determination.</P>
      <P>Demonstrators gathered in front of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial
Hall at 3:30 p.m., each wearing orange bands on their heads. They
also carried banners reading: "One Taiwan, One China" or "Protecting
Taiwan, Founding A New Country".</P>
      <P>Lee Chen-yuan, TAIP honorary chairman and leader of the
demonstration, said Clinton was doing quite well in the summit. He
pointed out that in the news conference following the meeting between
the two leaders, Clinton did not say Taiwan is a part of mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the so-called "Taiwan issue" cannot be tackled by
only the US and the mainland. Through self-determination by Taiwan
people and peaceful pressure from the international community can the
dispute between the mainland and Taiwan be peacefully solved, he
said.</P>
      <P>Professor Kao Cheng-yen at the National Taiwan University said
the results of the Clinton-Jiang meeting showed that US policy toward
China has not changed much. He said at a time when the Kuomintang
still seeks unification, the people of Taiwan demand the right to
decide if they want to establish a new country.</P>
      <P>Legislator Yeh Chu-lan of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party said no matter what the results of the Clinton-Jiang meeting
are, it would not affect the determination of the people of Taiwan to
declare their own country. She expressed hope that the demonstration
will let the international community know the wishes of the people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Demonstrators marched to the American Institute in Taiwan, the
American de facto embassy to Taiwan. A declaration was read in front
of the institute, stressing that the future of Taiwan should be
determined by its 21 million residents.</P>
      <P>The statement said although the group feels Clinton's proposal
that "the Taiwan issue should be peacefully solved" is in line with
the common interest of maintaining international peace and
development, the island's sovereignty and the people's dignity should
be respected.</P>
      <P>It urged the government to immediately institute a referendum law
to allow people to vote on the independence issue on Dec. 5, a date
that coincides with legislative elections.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US URGED TO STRENGTHEN PARALLEL TIES WITH TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington should strengthen parallel ties
with Taipei as it engages in closer relations with Beijing, Vice
Minister of Foreign Affairs David Lee said Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a news conference held in Taipei following the summit between
US President Bill Clinton and his mainland Chinese counterpart Jiang
Zemin, Lee urged the people in Taiwan not to overreact to the summit,
which did not result in any surprises as the US administration had
promised.</P>
      <P>As expected, the news conference held after the summit at
Beijing's Great Hall of the People Saturday did not touch on the
so-called "three no's" policy toward Taiwan, causing no apparent
damage to Taiwan's interests, Lee said.</P>
      <P>He, however, asserted that the Republic of China is a sovereign
state, and that any issues involving the ROC's interests should be
discussed with Taipei, not with Beijing.</P>
      <P>It was not yet known as of Saturday afternoon how much of the
discussion between Clinton and Jiang was devoted to Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan issue was not included in any of the nine major topics
of the Clinton-Jiang summit agenda, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee said under Washington's policy of engagement with Beijing,
more high-level meetings between the US and mainland China in the
future are inevitable. He called for the people of Taiwan to view
such developments as casual as possible.</P>
      <P>"We need not be over-worried about such developments," Lee said,
"because if such engagement policy is conducive to bolstering
regional peace and stability, it is what we are pleased to see."</P>
      <P>On Clinton's remarks calling for Beijing and Taipei to resume a
cross-strait dialogue, Lee said over the past several years, Taiwan
has repeatedly expressed willingness to return to the negotiating
table with Beijing.</P>
      <P>"President Clinton's remarks today indicated that the United
States is fully aware of Taipei's sincerity in this effort," he
noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affairs Council Vice Chairman and spokesman
Sheu Ke-sheng said he personally did not understand what was in Jiang
Zemin's mind when he linked Taiwan to Tibet during the post-summit
news conference in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Jiang said there are two preconditions for Beijing to resume
talks with the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader. First, the Dalai
Lama must recognize that Tibet is a part of China, and second, the
Dalai Lama must also recognize that Taiwan is a province of China,
Jiang said.</P>
      <P>On Clinton's calls for the resumption of the cross-strait talks,
Sheu said Taipei's stance has always been very clear. Taipei hopes to
solve its differences with Beijing through negotiations in a
practical and rational manner.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BEIJING URGED NOT TO DOWNGRADE ROC AS 'LOCAL GOVERNMENT'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Lien Chan on Saturday
protested Beijing's downgrading of the Republic of China's status as
a "local government."</P>
      <P>"We can never accept Beijing's attempt to 'localized' the ROC's
status," Lien said in a live radio program shortly after a summit
meeting between US President Bill Clinton and his mainland
counterpart, Jiang Zemin, in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Jiang told a news conference after his meeting with Clinton
that Taiwan is a province of the People's Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Responding to Jiang's remarks, Lien said he hopes mainland China
will deal with its relations with Taiwan with new thinking or
openminded thinking.</P>
      <P>Lien reiterated Taiwan's flexible and pragmatic attitude toward
differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. "We have
always kept our doors open for cross-strait dialogue and
consultation."</P>
      <P>Noting that the Republic of China is a sovereign state founded
in 1911, Lien said it absolutely cannot accept the "one country, two
systems" scheme that Beijing has imposed on Hong Kong. "Nor can we
accept Beijing's attempt to downgrade the ROC as a province or
region under its jurisdiction."</P>
      <P>Lien further said cross-strait issues cannot be resolved by
military means because the key points lie in differences between
systems and lifestyles.</P>
      <P>"The two sides should respect each other and work hand-in-hand
to promote constructive exchanges and positive interactions," Lien
said.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years, Lien said, the ROC has held out
olive branch on many occasions. "We have called for early
resumption of cross-strait dialogue broken unilaterally by
Beijing in mid-1995, signing of a peace agreement, exchanges
of visits by the top leaders on both sides and joint actions
in helping resolve the Southeast Asian financial crisis."</P>
      <P>Much to Taiwan's regret, Lien said, Beijing has failed to make
positive response to all those goodwill overtures.</P>
      <P>Lien said he hopes Beijing's Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) will resume its institutionalized
dialogue with Taipei's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) as soon as
possible. SEF and ARATS are quasi-official organizations authroized
by their respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in
the absence of official ties.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the United States is likely to mediate
cross-strait disputes, Lien said Washington already promised not to
act as a go-between, nor to pressure Taipei to negotiate with
Beijing in 1982 when it offered "six guarantees" to Taiwan. "The US
guarantees and policy toward Taiwan have remained unchanged," he
explained.</P>
      <P>Lien said he was not surprised by the fact that the
just-concluded Clinton-Jiang summit has not achieved major
breakthroughs in issues related to Taiwan. "We were aware that
the Clinton-Jiang summit would not focus on issues related to the
ROC," he said.</P>
      <P>Lien further called on the United States to continue reinforcing
relations with Taiwan while seeking to expand engagements with
Beijing.</P>

he appreciates the remarks President Bill Clinton made Saturday in
Beijing about Taiwan and the efforts the US government has made to
maintain peace and stability in the Asian Pacific area.</P>
      <P>At a press conference in Beijing on Saturday afternoon,

      <P>Chang Rong-kung, director general of the Mainland Affairs
Research Department of the Kuomintang Central Committee, told the

cautious about it, because Beijing officials may continue to pressure
Clinton into mentioning the "three nos" before the end of his visit
in mainland China.</P>
      <P>The "three nos" refer to the US position of no support for Taiwan
independence, no support for the idea of "one China, one Taiwan" or
"two Chinas", and no support for Taiwan's bid to join the United

      <P>Chang said that, judging from the remarks of President Clinton

    <TEXT>
      <P>A political scholar warned Saturday that
even though Taiwan's interests were not sacrificed at the
Clinton-Jiang summit meeting, relations between Taipei and Washington
will be affected.</P>
      <P>Chang Wu-yue, dean of the Graduate Institute of Mainland Studies
in Tamkang University, said as Washington-Beijing ties are expected
to improve further after the summit between US President Bill Clinton
and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Taiwan has to prepare for
a change in relations with the US.</P>
      <P>Chang said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' task force,
established to tackle the possible effects on Taiwan of the
Clinton-Jiang summit meeting, should become a standing committee to
respond to any development in Washington-Beijing ties.</P>
      <P>In reference to the so-called "three no's" policy, he said "no
support" is somewhat different from "being opposed to."</P>
      <P>The "three no's" refers to no US support for an independent
Taiwan, no US support for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan,"
and no US support for Taiwan's bid to enter the United Nations.</P>
      <P>Chang said no US support for Taiwan independence and no support
for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" is in line with
Washington's current policy, and if the summit meeting restates this
support, it would not hurt Taiwan very much.</P>
      <P>However, if Clinton said in the meeting that the US does not
support Taiwan's bid to enter the UN or other international
organizations, it could hurt Taiwan at a time when it seeks to
increase its international profile, Chang noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Ying Nai-ping, an economics professor at the National
Chengchi University, said the US has delinked the human rights issue
with trade and economic issues because of successful lobbying by US
businessmen.</P>
      <P>Ying said despite the fact that the US government has gradually
accepted the "three no's" policy, he believes the Clinton-Jiang
meeting will help bring the two sides of the Taiwan Strait back to
the negotiating table.</P>
      <P>Wu Chai-yi, a researcher at Taiwan Research Institute, said at a
time when Beijing continues to block Taiwan's diplomatic efforts,
Taiwan can only use its economic strength to expand its international
profile.</P>

out that it can only be determined by Taiwan's 21 million residents.</P>
      <P>Saying there is only one Taiwan and there is only one national
interest, the pro-independence mayor urged people in Taiwan to unite
to let their voices be heard beyond the island.</P>
      <P>Taiwan must currently deal with issues of dignity, security and
development, Chen said. Only through unity, he said, can Taiwan's
people create a better tomorrow.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO CONTINUE MONITORING CLINTON'S MAINALND VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China will continue to
closely monitor US President Bill Clinton's mainland China visit
until its conclusion on July 3, Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu
said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Hu's remarks came after Clinton and mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin met Saturday in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Hu said the Republic of China will make a formal response to the
Clinton-Jiang meeting after the United States provides the Republic
of China a detailed report on Clinton's trip.</P>
      <P>"So far, no signs have shown that the US has done anything
that is not in keeping with its promises," he said.</P>
      <P>Washington has repeatedly pledged to Taipei that Taiwan's
interests would not be hurt in the Clinton-Jiang meeting and that
there would be not a fourth communique or joint statement regarding
Taiwan following the summit.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether Washington will cling too closely
to Beijing in trilateral Washington-Beijing-Taipei ties, Hu said many
countries, including Japan, are concerned about such a development,
and urged Washington to take measures to ease their concerns.</P>
      <P>Hu said his ministry will further enhance contacts and exchanges
with both the US Congress and administration in the future and that
it has worked out a three-year package with that aim.</P>
      <P>Hu made the remarks after returning from a whirlwind visit to
Poland on Saturday, where he had been invited by the Stefan Batory
Foundation to deliver a keynote speech at the opening of the
three-day "International Relations and Democracy" conference in
Warsaw.</P>
      <P>Describing the fast-developing countries in central and east
Europe as a "new Europe" emerging on the world stage, Hu said
strengthened relations with countries in the region will produce
greater trade and commerce opportunities and help Taiwan lay the
groundwork for improved European ties.</P>
      <P>Hu, who also presided over a working meeting with ROC diplomatic
personnel stationed in eastern European countries in Prague earlier
this month, went on to say that during his recent trips to Poland and
the Czech Republic, he felt that the two countries are very friendly
toward Taiwan and that the ROC government is willing to boost
bilateral exchanges with them.</P>
      <P>Stressing the importance for the nation to "reach out," the
foreign minister said he decided to visit Poland even though his trip
coincided with the Clinton-Jiang meeting in Beijing.</P>
      <P>Despite his 72-hour absence from Taipei, Hu said a task force led
by Vice Foreign Minister David Lee set up to monitor the
Clinton-Jiang meeting was operating smoothly.</P>
      <P>Lee said at a Saturday news conference following the summit that
the Republic of China welcomes the agreements reached between
Washington and Beijing on weapons proliferation, de-targeting
missiles at each others' cities and a joint response to Asia's
financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Lee also praised Washington for keeping its promises and for its
guarantees that no joint communique or public declaration on Taiwan
would be announced, pointing out that Clinton's call on mainland
China to resume negotiation as soon as possible with Taiwan is in
line with the ROC government's stance on cross-strait ties.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28  (CNA)
(By  Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Three Taipei law enforcement officials
probing allegations that the head of Taiwan's Investigation Bureau
sexually assaulted a 19-year-old girl in Paris in 1996 returned to
Taipei Sunday afternoon.</P>
      <P>The three-member team, led by Huang Shih-ming, secretary general
of the Justice Ministry , refused to discuss the investigation with
reporters at the Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in Taoyuan.</P>
      <P>But speaking at a brief press conference in Paris after wrapping
up their probe there on Saturday, Huang said the team had interviewed
the victim of the alleged assault, Yang Yu-chen, on Friday.</P>
      <P>Yang, 20, has accused Chen Chuan, the investigation bureau's
acting director, of attempting to rape her.</P>
      <P>Yang's mother, Chiu Pai-lien, permitted Li Tsui-lien, the team's
sole female investigator, to meet with Yang at a Paris area hospital
where she is being treated for psychic trauma stemming from the
alleged incident.</P>
      <P>Although the hospital refused to disclose Yang's mental status,
the woman seemed mentally competent during the interview and answered
questions with what little Chinese she knew, said Huang.</P>
      <P>Chiu Pai-lien was present at the interrogation but did not
interrupt the meeting, said Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang did not reveal details of the interview at the press
conference in Paris, saying only that all information and evidence
collected by the team will be presented to the six-member panel that
commissioned the probe.</P>
      <P>Yang Yu-chen's interview capped the Paris leg of the team's
investigation, which also included interviews with Yang's mother and
her father, Yang Wan-ching, as well as a spot-inspection of the hotel
where the alleged incident took place, said Huang.</P>
      <P>Huang expressed regret that the team failed to obtain a copy of
Yang's complaint to the French police and the hospital's diagnosis of
the woman's mental state. The team will continue to seek the
information through Taipei's representative office in Paris, said
Huang.</P>
      <P>Cheng is accused of sexually assaulting Yang while performing
Chihkung therapy, in which the practitioner channels and focuses
positive energy, ultimately projecting it into a recipient. He has
admitted performing the therapy on Yang while visiting her parents in
Paris two years ago.</P>
      <P>Yang's father filed complaints with Taipei authorities to no
avail. His allegations received public attention, however, after an
opposition parliamentarian made them public and called for an
investigation after Cheng had been tapped to become the bureau's
permant director.</P>
      <P>The Justice Ministry set up a special panel on June 7 to look
into the allegations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON CRITICIZED FOR CONSIGNING TIANANMEN TO HISTORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,   June   27   (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi
criticized President Bill Clinton on Saturday for trying to relegate
the Tiananmen Square tragedy to history.</P>
      <P>She said the president's approach is "a rejection of former
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang's brave initiative to get China's
leaders to reverse the Tiananmen Square verdict."</P>
      <P>The Californian Democrat, who has been critical of President
Clinton's mainland China policy, added that the press conference after
the Beijing summit meeting was a victory for mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, because without making any concessions on
trade, proliferation or human rights, mainland China's president has
accrued all of the benefits of standing side-by-side with the
president of the United States.</P>
      <P>In a statement on the Clinton-Jiang summit, Pelosi noted that
President Clinton was right when he said the American people believe
that the use of force and the tragic loss of life at Tiananmen Square
was wrong. But he was wrong in trying to relegate the Tiananmen
Square tragedy to the realm of "past action" and missed an
opportunity to associate himself with mainland China's reformers.</P>
      <P>As long as people are still being held in prison for the peaceful
expression of their religious and political beliefs, and dissidents
are not free to speak freely in mainland China, the Tiananmen Square
era continues, claimed the congresswoman, adding that "on human
rights, President Clinton has said just enough for US domestic
consumption, and not enough to produce results for the Chinese
people."</P>
      <P>Results were lacking in other areas, too. Progress at this summit
has been limited to a rehashing of earlier announcements and the
acceptance by the Clinton administration of a series of promises the
mainland Chinese government has already made and not kept, sometimes
repeatedly.</P>
      <P>Once again, said Pelosi, the mainland Chinese government has
gotten away with promising to study the Missile Technology Control
Regime and promising to sign, at a later date, the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JIANG USES TIBET ISSUE TO DOWNGRADE TAIWAN'S STATUS: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 28 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>When mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin
equated Tibet with Taiwan at a joint press conference with US
President Bill Clinton, he intended to downgrade Taiwan's status to a
local government, said a Taiwan political scholar on Sunday.</P>
      <P>Pan Shi-tang, a professor at the Graduate Institute of Mainland
Chinese Studies under Tamkang University, said that during the press
conference after the summit meeting, Jiang used the Tibet issue to
stress the country's "one China" policy, contending that both Tibet
and Taiwan are part of mainland China.</P>
      <P>On the Tibet issue, Jiang gave preconditions for talks between
Tibet's spiritual leader, the exiled Dalai Lama, and himself, saying
that "if he acknowledges that Tibet is an inseparable part of China
-- at that same time he also must admit that Taiwan is a province of
China -- then, as far I see it, the door to negotiation is open".</P>
      <P>Pan also said that although Taiwan was not a focal point in the
summit, which focused on the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons,
regional security and international cooperation, Taiwan should
recognize the possibility that the Taiwan issue might be raised in
talks outside an official summit.</P>
      <P>Another scholar Liu Yi-chun, assistant researcher at Academia
Sinica, echoed Pan's views, warning that the government must be alert
that the two countries might have reached an under-the-table
agreement on Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Taiwan diplomatic officials felt relieved when Clinton did not
mention the so-called "three noes" during the conference. But Liu
questioned whether officials have considered the possibility of a
tacit agreement being reached.</P>
      <P>Liu pointed out that according to reports, after the press
conference, US National Security Adviser Samuel Berger said during a
briefing that Clinton had reaffirmed to Jiang his support for the
United States' "one China policy" including the "three No's" policy
toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" are no support for an independent Taiwan, no
support for a "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" policy and no
support for Taiwan's admission to the United Nations or other
international organizations into which admission is restricted to
recognized countries.</P>
      <P>Liu said that even though Taiwan's interests were not sacrificed
at the summit meeting, Taiwan has to keep watching closely any
development in Beijing-Washington relations.</P>
      <P>Pan and Liu made the remarks in a seminar, titled "Clinton-Jiang
Summit Meeting and Cross-Strait Relations," sponsored by the Chinese

    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Kuomintang and Foreign Ministry
do not see eye to eye on the impact of the "three noes" promises
demanded by Beijing from Washington during the just-concluded summit
between US President Bill Clinton and mainland Chinese President
Jiang Zemin.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister David Tawei Lee played down the effects of
the call for support for the "three noes" -- no US support for an
independent Taiwan, no support for a "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan" policy and no support for Taiwan's membership in
international organizations that require statehood. Lee's remarks
were made in a seminar sponsored by a local think tank.</P>
      <P>Dismissing the first two noes as nothing more than a rehashing of
promises embodied in previous communiques between Beijing and
Washington, Lee said that only the third promise of not supporting
Taiwan's membership in international organizations is new and could
negatively affect the island's efforts to promote its international
profile.</P>
      <P>Claiming the third no conflicts with the results of a 1994 review
of Washington's Taiwan policy, Lee called on the United States to
live up to its promises and help Taiwan join functionary
international bodies.</P>
      <P>Chang Jung-kung, director of the KMT's Mainland Affairs
Department, disputed Lee, saying that any public declaration of the
"three noes" would spell disaster for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" were not raised at the joint press conference
held by Clinton and Jiang on Saturday, but US National Security
Adviser Samuel Berger mentioned them in a background briefing to

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  28 (CNA)

    <TEXT>
      <P>Fast on the heels of allegations that the
acting head of Taiwan's investigation bureau sexually assaulted a
woman in Paris in 1996, another official has been charged with raping
an overseas Chinese woman in Panama last year, according to a local
newspaper.</P>
      <P>The China Times reported on Sunday that the angry father of the
woman, identified only by her surname of Lin, filed a claim demanding
NT$100 million (US$2.94 million) in damages, as well as a public
apology from the government.</P>
      <P>The alleged rape occurred during President Lee Teng-hui's
high-profile trip to Panama from Sept. 7 to 9, 1997.</P>
      <P>An ROC diplomat, identified only by his surname of Chen, was
stationed in Peru by the Government Information Office and
temporarily transferred to Panama City for Lee's trip. Chen is
accused of raping Lin, whose father is a leader among the city's
Chinese community and owns a company and several plants there, the
China Times reported.</P>
      <P>Lin's father was quoted as saying that the official raped Lin at
least five times, in the workers' living quarters of the makeshift
press office built for President Lee's visit and in the official's
hotel.</P>
      <P>Lin's father further accused Chen of luring Lin into Chen's hotel
room and sexually assaulting her for more than four hours, during
which time he seriously injured the woman's vagina.</P>
      <P>Chen was summoned by the GIO to Taipei after Lin's father filed a
complaint. Chen was later dismissed for abandoning his post, as he
had returned to Panama City a second time without permission. He was
also accused of conduct unbecoming an official.</P>
      <P>A GIO official told the newspaper that Vice Foreign Minister
David Tawei Lee, then secretary general of the GIO, as well as
several senior GIO officials had apologized to Lin and her father
personally, but had denied their claims for damage on grounds that
the GIO should not be held responsible for its staff's personal
conduct.</P>
      <P>The case has flared up at a time when the acting head of the
island's Investigation Bureau, Cheng Chuan, is under investigation
for allegedly attempt to rape a Chinese girl in Paris in 1996.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Academics attending a Sunday seminar said
the meeting between US President Bill Clinton and his mainland
Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, will hurt Taiwan to some extent and
urged the ROC government to take preventive measures to reduce the
possible damage.</P>
      <P>J. K. Chang, head of the ruling Kuomintang's Mainland Affairs
Operations Department, said the Clinton-Jiang summit will undoubtedly
hurt Taiwan. He urged the government to work to improve relations
with the United States and to let the world know Taiwan's position.</P>
      <P>Chang said Clinton fell short of speaking publicly on Beijing's
demands for support for its "three noes" in his Saturday meeting with
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin because Beijing has not
renounced the use of force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" are no US support for an independent Taiwan, no
support for "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and no support
for Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations.</P>
      <P>H. T. Pan, a professor of mainland affairs at Tamkang University,
warned the government not to be too optimistic. Expressing his belief
that Clinton and Jiang must have discussed the "three noes" issues
and even Beijing's demand that the United States reduce arms sales to
Taiwan, Pan said the government cannot judge the substantive contents
of the Clinton-Jiang summit talks solely by its resulting news
conference.</P>
      <P>Although the impact of Clinton-Jiang meeting on Taiwan will be
limited in the short term, Pan warned of a long-term effect,
especially in US arm sales to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As Washington and Beijing may hold regular bilateral talks in the
future, Taiwan should pay greater attention to changes in the two
countries' relations, Pan said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN URGED TO USE ITS DEMOCRACY TO WIN INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 28 (CNA)
(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Rather than focus too much on the so-called
"three noes," Taiwan should use its democracy and economic strength
to establish a new, strategic value to the world, several scholars
suggested Sunday.</P>
      <P>They said in a public TV program -- "Face the Audience" that
although the United States is engaging in closer relations with
mainland China, the United States' insistence on democracy and human
rights bodes well for Taiwan. They stressed Taiwan should take
advantage of its democratic and economic achievements to win
international support and respect.</P>
      <P>Regarding the "three noes," Shaw Yu-ming, director of the
Institute of International Relations, said that no US support for
Taiwan independence and no support for "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan" was implied in the 1972 Shanghai Joint Communique. If US
President Bill Clinton restates this support, it would not hurt
Taiwan very much, he said.</P>
      <P>If, however, Clinton said that the United States does not support
Taiwan's bids to enter international organizations into which
admission is restricted to recognized countries, it will hurt Taiwan
at a time when it seeks to enhance its international profile, Shaw
said.</P>
      <P>Shaw suggested that the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs press the
United States to adhere to a 1994 review of its 1979 Taiwan Relations
Act. In the review, the US government promised to help Taiwan join
functionary international organizations.</P>
      <P>He said that when the US and mainland China are moving toward
closer ties, Taiwan has to make efforts to promote relations with
Washington as well as Beijing. He warned that if the government
cannot strengthen cross-strait exchanges, Taiwan's position in
trilateral Taipei-Beijing-Washington relations will be weakened.</P>
      <P>Shaw said that the ultimate goal of the defense policy is to win
support from people on the mainland. One of the best ways to promote
mutual understanding is to allow mainland Chinese students to study
in Taiwan, he said.</P>
      <P>Relief programs offered by Taiwan's Buddhist Compassion Relief
Tzu Chi Association in the mainland also serve as a bridge between
Taiwan and the mainland, he noted.</P>

(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Once again, US President Bill Clinton
gained the ideological and moral high ground when he confronted his
Chinese counterpart, Jiang Zemin, over the issue of human rights.</P>
      <P>Mainland China was obviously put on the defensive when it came to
such matters, with the Tiananmen incident the most glaring example,
The Straits Times said Sunday in a news analysis report from Beijing
on the Clinton-Jiang summit Saturday.</P>
      <P>Jiang seemed to be defending an indefensible case, it noted.</P>
      <P>The fact that he had to read carefully from a prepared text,
uncharacteristic of him when addressing other less-sensitive matters,
underlined the sensitivity and difficulty he has experienced over
this particular issue.</P>
      <P>For years, the mainland Chinese were told that the military
crackdown in Tiananmen Square was justified on the grounds of
national stability. Jiang reiterated that line at a press conference
following the summit.</P>
      <P>Clinton said that he went into some length exploring with Jiang
on ways that those "imprisoned for non-violent activities in June
1989" may be released.</P>
      <P>The fact that China has allowed blatant US interference in its
affairs may be seen as the Chinese leadership conceding that the
Tiananmen action was not entirely right, whatever the justification,
the report said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Time is not on Taiwan's side, and the
island will lose its advantage in cross-strait negotiations if talks
cannot be resumed soon, a heavyweight with the pro-unification New
Party said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wang Chien-shien, the New Party's candidate for Taipei mayor,
said Taiwan must push for an early resumption of cross-strait
negotiations, because Taiwan will gradually lose ground in
cross-strait talks while mainland China gains ground.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the Saturday meeting between US President Bill
Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing, Wang
said it seems that Taiwan's interests were not hurt as a result of
the meeting. But he warned that Taiwan's interests will eventually be
sold out if Washington and Beijing continue their engagement.</P>
      <P>The United States has sold out the Republic of China several
times, he said, but added that Washington will not do so again at
present because it is playing the "Taiwan card" in its dealings with
Beijing.</P>
      <P>It is very dangerous if a country's fate is determined by another
country, Wang said. He called on the people of Taiwan to stand up and
build a better country to maintain Taiwan's advantage in cross-strait
competition.</P>
      <P>Jaw Shau-kong, election manager of the New Party, also warned on
Saturday that the Clinton-Jiang meeting means a strengthening of
Washington-Beijing ties, a signal of danger to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Although no signs of change in cross-strait relations have been
seen following the Clinton-Jiang meeting, Taiwan will face greater
difficulties in future trilateral Taipei-Washington-Beijing ties as
relations between Washington and Beijing improve, Jaw noted.</P>
      <P>Jaw said Taiwan should reduce its reliance on the United States
and conduct negotiations with the mainland under the framework of
"one China," which means that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
belong to the same China, but each side remains independent of each
other. "One China" does not refer to the "People's Republic of
China," he said.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan leaders have indicated that they are
positive about Saturday's summit meeting between Presidents Bill
Clinton and Jiang Zemin in Beijing.</P>
      <P>They expressed the hope that the summit will be beneficial to the
Asian Pacific region, and not be harmful to the relations between
Taiwan and the United States.</P>
      <P>In the summit Clinton and Jiang agreed to work together
for progress in pollution control and prevention of nuclear
proliferation. They also talked about cooperation in stabilizing the
financial situations in Asia and improving the legal and judicial
system of mainland China. The two leaders also agreed, among other
things, not to target each other with nuclear missiles.</P>
      <P>In the press conference held after the meeting, Clinton
reaffirmed the United States' "one China" policy and urged the
pursuit of cross-strait dialogues as the best path to peaceful
resolution of the differences between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>To Taiwan leaders' relief, Clinton did not mention in the
press conference the "three nos" Beijing leaders reportedly wanted
him to mention during his visit to Beijing. The "three nos" refer to
the US position of no support for Taiwan independence, no support for
the idea of "one China, one Taiwan" or "Two Chinas", and no support
for Taiwan's bid to join the United Nations and other international
organizations of sovereign countries.</P>
      <P>Premier Vincent Siew said Saturday the remarks made by Clinton
in the press conference indicated that there is no change in the
attitude of the United States toward Taiwan. He expressed the hope
that the US government will continue to stick to the Taiwan Relations
Act and its long-standing attitude toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Siew also said that he hopes the submit meeting will eventually
contribute to the stability and peaceful development of the Asian
Pacific region, and will not undermine the relations between Taiwan
and the US.</P>
      <P>When asked Sunday whether the summit has tipped the balance of US
foreign relations in favor of Beijing, Foreign Minister Jason Hu said
many people, including those in Japan, have such feeling at the
height of rapprochement between Washington and Beijing. The US
government should pay attention to this "psychological effect" and do
something about it, he added.</P>
      <P>Vice Foreign Minister David Tawei Lee said Saturday that the
summit has resulted in some agreements, which will be conducive to
the stability and prosperity of the Asian Pacific region and
beneficial to mainland China's programs of reform and openness. "We
would be glad to see these happen," he said.</P>
      <P>Lee also pointed out that the US and Taiwan share many ideals
and values, and have common interests. Taipei will continue to try to
enhance its relations with Washington for mutual benefits, he said.</P>
      <P>"We are confident in the development of relations between the
two countries," Lee said, adding that he hopes Washington will take
concrete steps to improve its relations with Taipei, so as to help
create a "win-win-win situation" for the US, Taiwan, and mainland
China. He said Taiwan will request US support for its bid
to join functional international organizations such as the World
Health Organization.</P>
      <P>Lee also said that mainland China has not renounced the use of
military force against Taiwan and has been trying to hinder Taiwan's
activities in the international community. This is an important
factor affecting peace and stability in the Asian Pacific region, he
added. (more)</P>

that he believes the meeting will be conducive to more dialogues
between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Wu said that it is the policy of his government to pursue
dialogues with mainland China, and that he believes cross-strait
discussions will progress gradually in an orderly manner.</P>
      <P>He however pointed out that the differences between Taiwan and
mainland China in economic, political and social systems
and developments will remain for quite a long time, hindering the
progress of discussions between them.</P>
      <P>In the seminar, Shaw Yu-ming, director of the Institute of
International Relations of the National Chengchi University in
Taipei, said the summit indicated Beijing leaders apparently believe
that the shortest way to grab Taiwan is going through Washington.</P>
      <P>Under such circumstances, Taiwan has to try to improve its
relations with the US, and at the same time try to manage
cross-strait relations "in a pragmatic, sincere, rational,
far-sighted manner." Taiwan must be active in dealing with mainland
China and avoid misunderstanding, he said.</P>
      <P>In an interview with the Taipei-based Broadcasting Corporation of
China Saturday, Vice President Lien Chan urged Beijing leaders to be
"open-minded" and handle its relations with Taiwan on the basis of
mutual respect.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will try to improve its relations with mainland
China in a pragmatic and flexible way. "Our door is always open for 
consultations," he said. "But we can never agree to Beijing's attempt
to downgrade us to a local government."</P>
      <P>Lien expressed the hope that Washington will improve its
relations with Taipei while trying to expand engagement with Beijing.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States government has adhered
to the Taiwan Relations Act, and nothing in the act has been -- or
will be -- changed, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in
Beijing on Sunday.</P>
      <P>"The message to the people of Taiwan is the same as it has always
been, which is that we believe there needs to be a peaceful
dialogue," Albright said during an interview with the CBS television
program, "Face the Nation."</P>
      <P>"The Shanghai Communique governs the way that we deal with the
issue. We have urged the Chinese, mainland Chinese, to have a
peaceful dialogue (with Taiwan), and our policy is the same as it has
always been, which is a one China policy," she said.</P>
      <P>Albright said that the United States will continue to urge both
Taiwan and mainland China to enter into a peaceful dialogue with each
other to resolve their differences.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Relations Act, enacted by the US Congress and approved
by then-US President Jimmy Carter in 1979, regulates Washington's
unofficial ties with Taipei and promises to provide Taiwan with
defensive weapons.</P>
      <P>Regarding human rights in mainland China, Albright said "there is
a long way to go." On the Beijing authorities' refusal to allow
meetings between Clinton and mainland Chinese dissidents, she said
the president has met many mainland Chinese people, and through his
televised speech to some 700 million mainland Chinese citizens, "he
virtually spoke to the dissidents."</P>

    <HEADLINE>US ARMS SALES IN NO WAY UNDERMINES 'ONE CHINA' POLICY: CLINTON</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US arms sales to Taiwan will in no way
undermine its "one china" policy, visiting American President Bill
Clinton said on Monday.</P>
      <P>"Our policy is that weapons sales to Taiwan are for defensive
purposes only. We are in no way trying to undermine our 'one China'
policy," Clinton said in reply to a question from a Beijing
University student.</P>
      <P>Clinton said the US' China policy is embodied in the three
Washington-Beijing communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act, a US law
which requires the United States to furnish Taiwan with defensive
arms to ensure its security.</P>
      <P>Noting that the United States already recognized communist China
and adopted a "one China" policy 20 years ago, Clinton said he
reaffirmed this policy to mainland President Jiang Zemin during their
summit talks on Saturday.</P>
      <P>While committing himself to the "one China" policy, Clinton
also reiterated the the consistent US stance that unification
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should occur strictly by
peaceful means.</P>
      <P>Against this background, Clinton said, the United States has
encouraged cross-strait dialogue to achieve eventual peace
unification.</P>
      <P>Clinton further said mainland China should not think US arms
sales to Taiwan will hinder cross-strait unification or spoil its
commitment to the "one China" policy. "US policy is not an obstacle
to the peaceful reunification of China and Taiwan," he added.</P>
      <P>In his off-the-cuff response to students' questions following
his 20-minute speech, Clinton also sought to dispel Beijing's
contention that Washington's security treaty with Tokyo is aimed
at containing mainland China.</P>
      <P>Clinton explained that the US-Japan defense cooperation
guidelines, which were amended last year, are designed for
revamping strategic relationship between the two countries.</P>
      <P>The treaty is not designed to contain any specific country, but
for supporting stability in Asia, Clinton stressed.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that the United States has stationed troops in
South Korea to prevent a military invasion by North Korea. For
ensuring Asia-Pacific regional stability, Clinton said, the US has
also stationed troops in Japan and signed a security pact.</P>
      <P>"We cannot see the agreements of today through the mirror of
yesterday's conflicts," Clinton said.</P>
      <P>In fact, he noted, most countries in the world hope to forge
security partnership with mainland China in the 21st century. The
United States, for instance, looks forward to cooperating with
mainland China to help reduce tensions caused by the recent nuclear
tests in India and Pakistan.</P>
      <P>"I believe there will be more cooperation in this field in the
future," Clinton said.</P>

      <P>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday
categorically denied that the Republic of China has promised to give
US$20 million in cash aid to Poland to help the eastern European
country develop its small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>MOFA spokesman Roy Wu discounted a report in Monday's China Times
that Foreign Minister Jason Hu reached an agreement with Warsaw on
the aid during his one-day visit to the country this past weekend. Wu
said the report was absolutely untrue.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister was invited by the Stefan Batory Foundation
to deliver a speech at the opening of a three-day "International
Relations and Democracy" conference in Warsaw, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Hu did not discuss with any Polish officials the prospect of
Taiwan providing Poland with financial aid, nor did he make any
agreements during his trip, Wu stressed.</P>
      <P>According to the China Times, however, Hu reached an agreement
with Warsaw officials on the US$20 million aid package, as well as
achieving a consensus with Polish officials on agreements for
investment guarantees and double-tax exemptions between the two
countries.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A lawmaker with the opposition Democratic
Progressive Party warned the government on Sunday of the possibility
that an under-the-table deal was reached between US President Bill
Clinton and mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin during their
Beijing summit on Saturday.</P>
      <P>In a written inquiry to the Executive Yuan, DPP Legislator Trong
Chai said the joint Clinton-Jiang news conference following their
meeting showed that the two were reserved about the substantive
contents of their talks.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to gain a detailed understanding of the
agreement reached between the two sides to de-target missiles at each
other's cities, saying it could affect future US arms sales to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chai said Jiang spent some time explaining the Taiwan issue to
Clinton during their meeting. Jiang asked the United States to abide
by the three joint communiques.</P>
      <P>Clinton, meanwhile, urged Taiwan and mainland China to resume
dialogue soon in the news conference. Citing informed sources, Chai
said Clinton assured Jiang that the United States would sell only
defensive weapons to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The DPP lawmaker said that if the US government reduces arms
sales to Taiwan, it would be a loss to the United States. He called
on the government to stress this to Washington when the United States
sends an envoy to Taiwan next month to brief the Republic of China
government on the results of the summit.</P>
      <P>As the United States is still Taiwan's major arms supplier, Chai
said the government should keep supplies stable to help safeguard
Taiwan's security and build public confidence.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Netherlands announced Sunday the
creation of a new WTO program, due to start in September 1998, for
trainees from developing countries, according to the Geneva-based
World Trade Organization.</P>
      <P>The program is designed to help trainees learn, while working for
the WTO, about trade and development-related matters and further
their understanding of trade policy.</P>
      <P>After a maximum of two years, trainees will return to their
ministries and contribute to the strengthening of their countries'
institutional capacities.</P>
      <P>"Effective integration of developing countries in the
international trade system is crucial, not only for their
development, but also for the credibility of the WTO as a world trade
organization. This requires institutional capacity in these countries
to deal with WTO matter. Through this initiative, we hope to make a
modest contribution to this effect," said Ambassador Eveline
Herfkens, permanent representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.</P>
      <P>Initially, there will be up to three trainees per year in the
program, and they will be considered WTO staff members for the
duration of their involvement in the program.</P>
      <P>The Netherlands will cover the cost of the program. Further

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON ADDS SUBSTANCE TO SYMBOLISM AT TIANANMEN: PAPER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton has injected
substance into the symbolism of his reception at Tiananmen
Square, the site of brutal massacre in 1989, according to a well
respected Australian columnist.</P>
      <P>"The extraordinary Clinton-Jiang news conference,
broadcast live and uncensored to hundreds of millions of Chinese and
around the world, demonstrates the correctness of Bill Clinton's
decision to go ahead with the reception at Tiananmen Square," wrote
Greg Sheridan, foreign editor of the mass-circulation The Australian.</P>
      <P>Harshly criticized by some Republicans and Democrats in the
United States for agreeing to be welcomed at the square, Clinton
however publicly rebuked the mainland Chinese leadership for the
massacre by saying, "I believe, and the American people believe, that
the use of force and the tragic loss of life was wrong."</P>
      <P>Clinton also proposed that Jiang engage in direct dialogue with
Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, a proposal that was perhaps
as unwelcome to Jiang as Clinton's words on the Tiananmen Square
massacre, Sheridan commented.</P>
      <P>That the exchange took place in public and was broadcast on
mainland Chinese television "is a win for both leaders. It has
allowed Clinton to achieve the inestimable double for being true to
America's profound commitment to human rights, while at the same time
pursuing a constructive, calm, business-like relationship with
China," Sheridan wrote.</P>
      <P>In an editorial Monday, the paper commented, "Tiananmen Square
again has become the focus of international attention -- this time
for promoting the prospect of real harmony between two very powerful
nations that are vital for Australia's long-term interests."</P>
      <P>Calling the debate over Tiananmen Square unprecedented, the
editorial welcomed it as an important development in bilateral
relations between Washington and Beijing.</P>

    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The leader of Australia's One Nation
Party said she wanted Australia to substantially reduce immigration
to zero-growth levels because she does not want to see the country
"Asianised."</P>
      <P>In a TV program Sunday, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson said
that if her party scores a victory in the upcoming federal elections
similar to the one it enjoyed in recent state elections in
Queensland, she would introduce policies to curb immigration and
demand the government test potential immigrants' English proficiency.</P>
      <P>"I think there should be a test on English. I think everyone
should have some knowledge of the English language," she said.</P>
      <P>But both the federal government under Prime Minister John Howard
and the opposition under Kim Beazley slammed Hanson's policies as
divisive and unworkable.</P>
      <P>"These prepositions are absurd in the least," said Immigration
Minister Philip Ruddock. "This would deny ordinary Australians the
right to marry people who did not speak English, and would not allow
Australians to bring their own children into Australia if they didn't
speak English," he added.</P>
      <P>He said about 26,000 of the 80,000 people who migrate to
Australia each year are spouses or life partners whom Australians met
overseas or are dependent children of Australians.</P>
      <P>About 30,000 to 40,000 Australians go abroad to work each year,
and Hanson said she agreed to allowing the same number of migrants
into Australia to fill the loophole, thus halving Australia's current
quota of about 80,000 immigrants.</P>
      <P>Hanson said the Racial Discrimination Act should be repealed on
the grounds that it discriminates against white Anglo-Saxons and
prevents criticism of non-whites.</P>

    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singaporeans should not reduce spending
so much that the economy further contracts, said Singapore Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew on Sunday.</P>
      <P>"Our consumers should not become over-pessimistic and over-save,
as in Japan. Otherwise, we will have a recession through our
pessimism," he cautioned.</P>
      <P>Lee made the remarks in a speech at a fund-raiser on Sunday
marking the first anniversary of his constituency's community
development council.</P>
      <P>Recent statistics bear out Lee's warnings on consumer spending:
an April report showed 60 percent of Singaporeans were spending less
on entertainment, clothes and shoes, while more than half were
eating out less often.</P>
      <P>In his speech, Lee also said the government would take steps to
cut business costs and help businesses obtain credit to tide them
over the current economic downturn. Local companies are finding it
difficult to obtain loans because foreign banks are tightening
credit lines under orders from their head offices, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Local banks, meanwhile, are nervous about lending money to
companies with negative cash flows, he added. The government will
discuss the problem with banks and will enact programs similar to
one that has offered loans at preferential rates to smaller
businesses, he said.</P>
      <P>Discussing Singapore's economic picture for this year, Lee said
that while preliminary figures showed positive growth in the second
quarter, the figures appear to be moving downward. Singapore will
likely avoid negative growth this year, although the region's
slowdown will extend into 1998 and even 1999, he said.</P>
      <P>Lee said Asia's economic turmoil is no longer confined to East
Asia and has spread to regions such as Japan.</P>
      <P>Japan's recession risks affecting the United States and Europe
as well. "Singapore and the region will not fully recover until Japan
recovers," he said. "Nobody at present can say with confidence
when that will be."</P>

(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Helen Sham-Ho, the only high-profile
member of the New South Wales Parliament of Chinese descent,
announced on Monday that she has left Prime Minister John Howard's
Liberal Party.</P>
      <P>Sham-Ho said her departure is due partly to Howard's weakness in
dealing with the One Nation Party and its leader, Pauline Hanson. In
particular, Sham-Ho expressed disappointment in Howard for not
speaking out against Hanson for a speech she delivered in the federal
parliament in 1996.</P>
      <P>The speech contained remarks regarded as anti-Asian immigration
and anti-Aboriginal people.</P>
      <P>Sham-Ho has been a Liberal Party member for 11 years and has been
a member of the NSW Legislative Council for 10 years, according to
her spokesperson.</P>
      <P>Sham-Ho did not mention during the press conference whether she
would join another party. But the spokesperson told CNA that Sham-Ho
would compete as an independent in the next NSW state election.</P>
      <P>The Liberal Party, which along with the National Party, forms
Australia's coalition government, has lost two high-profile party
members of Chinese descent in the past 10 days.</P>
      <P>Last week Peter Wong, former chairman of the Federation of
Chinese Communities in NSW and director of the herbal medicine
department at the University of Sydney, quit the party because it had
not condemned Hanson and her One Nation Party.</P>
      <P>Wong migrated to Australia from Indonesia and has lived in Sydney
for more than 35 years.</P>
      <P>The One Nation Party captured 11 seats in recent state

      <P>Clinton said the US stance on relations across the Taiwan Strait
is based on the "one China" policy embodied in its three joint
communiques with Beijing, as well as in the Taiwan Relations Act of
1979. That act requires the United States to furnish Taiwan with
defensive weapons to ensure its security.</P>
      <P>"We are pleased to see Clinton again clearly mention the US

Clinton said the US policy toward Taiwan is not an obstacle to the
peaceful reunification of mainland China and Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Our policy is that weapons sales to Taiwan are for defensive
purposes only. We are in no way trying to undermine our one China
policy," Clinton explained.</P>
      <P>He further said the United States has consistently encouraged the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait to engage in peaceful dialogue to
resolve their problems and that cross-strait reunification should be
achieved strictly by peaceful means.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VIRAL DEATH TOLL REACHES 54</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As of Monday, 262 people have been
hospitalized for enterovirus infections, and of them 54 have died,
according to sources from the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The two most recent deaths were those of a 2-year-old boy who
died at Taipei's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital on June 24, only 10
days after he was diagnosed as being infected with the virus, and a
9-month-old girl who died the same day at Taichung's Veterans General
Hospital.</P>
      <P>The girl had lived two months after being diagnosed as having the
virus, the longest period of time anyone in Taiwan has lived after
being infected, said Hsu Hsu-mei, deputy director of the DOH's
Communicable Disease Control Bureau.</P>
      <P>To more effectively treat the disease, Hsu suggested doctors
check patients' brains with the aid of the magnetic resonance
imaging.</P>
      <P>Previous autopsies have shown victim's brain stems had fatal
lesions, whereas doctors originally thought the children had died
from edema pulmonary, meningitis or encephalitis.</P>
      <P>Some doctors have been able to save the lives of patients
infected with the virus by curing the lesions on their brain stems.</P>
      <P>Although the DOH has said the epidemic has already peaked in
Taiwan, the number of suspected infections totaled more than 1,000
islandwide as of Monday. The virus first began ravaging children on
the island in mid-February.</P>
      <P>The DOH initiated an islandwide "hand-washing" campaign on
Monday, urging the public, especially children, to wash hands more
frequently and more thoroughly to help stop the spread of the
epidemic.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TASK FORCE READY TO REVIEW ALLEGED SEXUAL ASSAULT CLAIM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A task force established to investigate a
sexual assault charge against Cheng Chuan, acting director of the
Investigation Bureau, is ready to review information in the case, the
convenor of the investigation said Monday.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister of Justice Chiang Hao made the remarks after a
three-member team returned from a fact-finding trip to Paris on
Sunday.</P>
      <P>Cheng has been accused of sexually assaulting Yang Yu-cheng in a
Paris hotel room in 1996. He has denied any wrongdoing in the case,
saying that he was performing the traditional Chinese physical
therapy "Chihkung" on the young woman.</P>
      <P>Investigators will question Cheng regarding some issues that
arose from information gathered by the task force, Chiang said.</P>
      <P>The task force has initially reported to have met with Yang at a
Paris hospital where she is being treated for mental stress stemming
from the alleged incident. However, only Li Tsui-lien, the team's
sole female investigator interviewed Yang.</P>
      <P>Li made notes but did not record her conversation with Yang, who
appeared to be mentally competent when answering questions, Chiang
was told.</P>
      <P>Investigators will continue to try and obtain a copy of Yang's
complaint to the French police and the hospital's diagnosis of Yang's
mental state through the ROC representative office in Paris.</P>
      <P>The task force will now carefully sift through the related
information and scrutinize every detail and the timing of the alleged
incident, Chiang said. He added that he could not predict when the
task force would be able to give a formal report on the case.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Cheng has declined to speak with the media about the
matter other than to say he would cooperate fully with the
investigation. He again apologized to the staff of the Investigation
Bureau for tarnishing the reputation of the bureau with this personal
matter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US TO CONSIDER LEE'S VISA ISSUE ON CASE-BY-CASE BASIS: BERGER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  June  28  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States will consider ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's visa applications on a case-by-case basis, a
senior official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>White House National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, who is
currently accompanying US President Bill Clinton on a high-profile
state visit to mainland China, made the statement during a live
broadcast interview with CNN.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the US government would grant President Lee a visa
if Cornell University were to invite him to give another speech in
Ithaca, New York, Berger said, "We make those decisions on a
case-by-case basis."</P>
      <P>Berger went on to say the United States made a decision back in
the Nixon administration to have a one-China policy -- and then
carried it forward through a bipartisan administration for the past
25 years.</P>
      <P>"That is to recognize the government of China as the overall
government. And that means we don't have a one China/one Taiwan
policy. But, we have a good relationship with the people on Taiwan,"
Berger said.</P>
      <P>He also expressed the US hope that the Taiwanese and Chinese
resolve their differences peacefully. "We think that a cross-strait
dialogue, which is perhaps about to begin again, is the best way to
do that."</P>
      <P>Asked if the United States will continue to sell advanced
warplanes to Taiwan, Berger said Washington will follow the Taiwan
Relations Act as well as the three joint communiques with Beijing,
which govern the US' defense supply relationship with Taiwan. The US
agreed to sell 150 F-16 jetfighters to Taiwan in 1992, and at least
60 of the advanced warplanes have been delivered to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>President Lee delivered a speech at a Cornell University alumni
reunion during his visit to the United States in June 1995. The visit
angered Beijing authorities as they viewed the trip as a veiled move
to promote Taiwan independence. In retaliation, Beijing conducted a
series of missile tests and live-fire war games in waters near Taiwan
between mid-1995 and March 1996, and unilaterally broke off regular
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Beijing's show of force prompted the Clinton administration to
send two aircraft carrier battle groups to help stabilize the
situation in Taiwan Strait.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLINTON STRESSES PARTNERSHIP WITH MAINLAND IN SPEECH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Wang Hsin-chung &amp; Eva Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton, in a speech to
students Monday at Beijing University, stressed the importance of a
US partnership with mainland China.</P>
      <P>During his 30-minute speech, which was broadcast live on mainland
Chinese state television, Clinton pointed out that Washington wants
to build a new relationship with Beijing.</P>
      <P>"America wants to build a new relationship with you for a new
century. We want China to be successful, secure and open," he said.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned the necessity of cooperation with Beijing on
the nonproliferation of nuclear and chemical weapons. Mainland China
and the US are pursuing a joint strategy to ease tensions on the
Indian sub-continent, Clinton said.</P>
      <P>The US president departed from the text of his speech to make a
personal plea for students to help save the environment.</P>
      <P>However, human rights was the overriding theme of Clinton's
speech at Beijing University, the cradle of the 1989 pro-democracy
movement. He cited the declaration of the United Nations to show the
importance of human rights. He said freedom is universal and
"indivisible" from economic prosperity.</P>
      <P>"Economic security is an essential element of freedom," said
Clinton, adding that "true freedom must mean more than economic
opportunity. In America we believe that freedom itself is
indivisible."</P>
      <P>Clinton praised the mainland for not devaluing the Chinese
currency. He said when the financial turmoil hit Asian countries such
as Indonesia and South Korea, it was no longer an isolated problem
within one or two individual countries, but an issue for Asia as a
whole. He expressed his hope to cooperate with Beijing in stabilizing
Asian financial situation.</P>
      <P>There are some both in the US and the mainland who have doubts as
to whether engagement between Washington and Beijing is rational and
beneficial to both sides, Clinton said. In view of the tendency of
world events and challenges faced by this generation, cooperation
between Washington and Beijing would be much better than alienation
and isolation, he concluded.</P>
      <P>The president also presented a collection of books to the
university library's American Studies Reference Collection after his
keynote speech and a question-and-answer session on Monday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC HAPPY TO SEE IMPROVED BEIJING-WASHINGTON TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  June  29  (CNA)
(By M. J. Tzou and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is happy to see the
United States improve its relations with mainland China, but only if
it does not affect the interests of Taiwan, an ROC government
spokesman said over the weekend.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, director-general of the Government Information
Office (GIO), made the remarks in an interview with the Paris-based
Asia Magazine.</P>
      <P>Chen said the ROC hopes Clinton's trip to the mainland will help
resolve their differences and boost the mainland's sense of
responsibility in Asia and world peace.</P>
      <P>He also said improved ties between Beijing and Washington will
help people on the mainland get to know a system of freedom,
democracy, and prosperity, so they can compare it with their system.</P>
      <P>Asked about the effects of the Hong Kong handover on Taiwan, Chen
said the status of Hong Kong and Taiwan are completely different.</P>
      <P>Noting that Hong Kong is a former British colony without a
constitution, sovereignty, and defense capabilities, he said it has
implemented a weak democratic system and press freedoms are
deteriorating.</P>
      <P>These point to the "deficiency" of the one country, two systems,
Chen said.</P>
      <P>In contrast, Taiwan has enjoyed full-fledged press freedoms
rivaling that of the west. Taiwan has more than 370 papers, nearly
5,000 magazines, 74 broadcasting stations and more than 20 TV
stations, he added.</P>
      <P>On the issue of cross-Taiwan Strait relations, Chen said the
policy of the Kuomintang has been to promote unification gradually,
while the opposition Democratic Progressive Party advocates Taiwan
independence, and New Party hopes for early unification, and the
Taiwan Independence party hopes for early independence.</P>
      <P>Chen said 85 percent of people in Taiwan hope to maintain the
status quo, while those who advocate early unification or
independence are minimal.</P>
      <P>He also said although the DPP won in the year-end mayoral and
magistrate elections last year, it does not necessarily reflect the
independence aspirations of voters as they were local elections. The
legislative and mayoral elections coming up in December are more
important.</P>
      <P>On economic relations with the mainland, Chen said the ROC
government will not stop Taiwan businessmen from investing in the
mainland as long as such investment does not affect the economic
development and security of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As both sides of the Taiwan Strait have yet to establish an
investment guarantee agreement, he said the ROC government will
continue to restrict the categories and amount of Taiwan investment
permitted in the mainland.</P>
      <P>Regulations regarding Taiwan's small- and medium-sized
enterprises that want to invest US$50 million in mainland China will
remain unchanged so those in the mainland can share Taiwan's
development experience, Chen added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign investors should increase their
investment in Taiwan's stock market as the "greater China" economies
have performed better than other Asian countries amid the financial
crisis, an industry expert said.</P>
      <P>John S. Wadsworth Jr. an executive in charge of Far Eastern
operations with the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, a world leading
investment bank, made the remarks to reporters after a meeting with
Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang.</P>
      <P>Wadsworth met with Wang on behalf of Morgan Stanley President
Philip Purcell, who is sidelined from long-distance travel due to
poor health.</P>
      <P>Wadsworth praised the ROC's handling of the crisis, including the
Central Bank of China, and suggested that foreign investors increase
their shares in the Taiwan stock market to 5 percent as prices have
fallen below reasonable levels.</P>
      <P>Foreign capital accounts for 3 percent currently in the local
bourse.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's electronics sector is very competitive but also highly
risky, Wadsworth said, adding that a weaker yen will keep stronger
pressure on the electronics sectors of Taiwan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The yen may continue to fluctuate, and changes in the value of
the yen will play a crucial role in the overall economic situation in
Asia, he said. This is particularly true after the recent guarantee
by mainland Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji to US Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin that the renminbi will not be devaluated.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAC REITERATES OPPOSITION TO 'ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS' SCHEME</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) reiterated on Monday that the "one country, two systems" scheme
imposed by Beijing on Hong Kong is not applicable to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The council issued the statement two days before the first
anniversary of the British handover of Hong Kong rule to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing managed to use the 'one country, two systems'
formula to take over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, the MAC said the
Republic of China on Taiwan can never accept such a format.</P>
      <P>First and foremost, the council said, the format offers no
guarantee that Taiwan will permanently be able to retain its current
free, democratic and prosperous way of life.</P>
      <P>The MAC further pointed out that Beijing's "one country, two
systems" proposal is a contradictory, transitional and suppressive
scheme aimed at annexing Taiwan into its one-party dictatorship.</P>
      <P>The council also cited several fundamental differences between
Taiwan and Hong Kong. First, the ROC is an independent sovereign
state, while Hong Kong was a British colony.</P>
      <P>Second, the ROC has diplomatic ties and its own self-defense
force. In contrast, Hong Kong did not have either of these two
critical characteristics of a sovereign state, the council said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the council said, since the ROC is now a full-fledged
democracy, its future should be determined by its people, while Hong
Kong residents had no right to determine their own future through
elections to begin with.</P>
      <P>Last but not least, it said, the handover had been decided long
ago as a part of a lease agreement, but there is no timetable for the
reunification of Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Noting that Taiwan and mainland China are now ruled by two
separate but equal political entities, the MAC said Beijing should
drop its communist system and opt for a "good system."</P>
      <P>The "good system" refers to freedom, democracy and equitable
distribution of wealth, the MAC explained.</P>
      <P>"We look forward to seeing this good system implemented
in mainland China as early as possible. By then, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Macau and mainland China can be unified under this 'one country, one
good system' formula," the MAC said in its press statement.</P>
      <P>To facilitate its takeover of Hong Kong, Beijing has promised to
retain Hong Kong's capitalist system and way of life for 50 years.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 29 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Hong Kong has gradually been "mainlandized"
since it reverted to Beijing's rule last July, a senior mainland
affairs official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Lin Chong-pin, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council, made the remarks in a report on Hong Kong's
post-handover developments over the past year.</P>
      <P>Lin said Hong Kong has maintained close interaction with mainland
China since its handover. "As a result, the former British colony has
been gradually 'mainlandized,'" he stated.</P>
      <P>The mainland policy planner also pointed out that although major
countries such as the United States and Japan have generally
recognized the territory's smooth handover, they have taken note of a
potential threat to Hong Kong's freedom and legal system.</P>
      <P>Since the territory reverted to Beijing's rule under a "one
country, two systems" scheme, Lin said the people of Hong Kong have
become increasingly dissatisfied with the performance of their
government.</P>
      <P>"While the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government has
functioned generally smoothly, its operational efficiency has
declined as compared with previous levels, particularly in its crisis
handling," Lin said.</P>
      <P>He also cited public opinion polls conducted by Hong Kong Chinese
University as showing that the approval rating of Tung Chee-hwa, Hong
Kong's chief executive, declined from 63.34 percent in February to an
all-time low of 56.2 percent.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, Lin said Hong Kong's post-handover politics
has proceeded within the framework set forth in the Basic Law and its
operations have gone more smoothly than many had expected.</P>
      <P>"While the Hong Kong government has followed Beijing's guidelines
in handling political affairs, mainland authorities have not
explicitly interfered with Hong Kong's internal affairs," Lin said.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lin said Hong Kong people have become increasingly
discontent over the slow progress in democratic development, the
increasingly worsening financial woes and structural problems within
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Lin also said although Hong Kong's press freedoms have generally
been maintained, mainland Chinese forces have gradually entered Hong
Kong media organizations and self-censorship among Hong Kong media
has become more common.</P>
      <P>Touching on Hong Kong-Taiwan relations, Lin said, bilateral
civilian exchanges have remained almost the same. Nevertheless, he
said, official exchanges remain limited because stringent

      <P>US Secretary of Commerce William M. Daley said that there is no

    <HEADLINE>GERMAN PAPER COMMENTS ON LIVE CLINTON-JIANG BROADCAST</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Bonn,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Lilian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The German daily "Die Welt" said on Monday
that mainland China's President Jiang Zemin achieved two purposes by
allowing a live broadcast of the joint press conference which
followed his summit meeting with US President Bill Clinton.</P>
      <P>"Die Welt" correspondent Johnny Erling said that Jiang on the one
hand wanted to help relieve Clinton from US pressure due to his
participation in the official greeting ceremony in Tiananmen Square;
and on the other, Jiang is expecting a change in his own country.</P>
      <P>Erling also said, however, that Jiang's move was not
well-tolerated by the party, and that the live broadcast has not been
replayed. The party has also forbidden the official mainland press
from discussing or commenting on the statements, he added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT LEE CALLS FOR OVERALL REVIEW OF CLINTON-JIANG SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Lee Teng-hui has ordered the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs to conduct an overall review of the
possible impact of a summit meeting between Washington and Beijing, a
senior official said on Monday.</P>
      <P>Foreign Minister Jason Hu told a press conference that Lee gave
the directive after hearing his briefing on the talks between US
President Bill Clinton and his mainland Chinese counterpart, Jiang
Zemin, in Beijing last Saturday.</P>
      <P>Hu quoted Lee as directing that the Foreign Ministry should
continue keeping close watch on the possible impact of Clinton's
current mainland visit on relations between Taipei and Washington as
well as on Taiwan's security and future development.</P>
      <P>"In addition, the president wants us to evaluate the
impact of the Clinton-Jiang summit in three dimensions: prospects of
human rights and democracy, regional peace and stability, and
interaction across the Taiwan Strait," Hu said.</P>
      <P>He added that the ministry's North American Affairs Department
and an interministerial task force formed earlier this month to
tackle with the possible impact of the Clinton-Jiang summit will
carefully study all related issues in accordance with Lee's
instruction.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Hu also briefed Premier Vincent Siew on the
Clinton-Jiang summit. "The premier has demanded the ministry to
furnish him with an in-depth comprehensive report on the event's
possible impact on our relations with the United States and on our
country's overall pragmatic diplomacy after the US briefs us on
Clinton's current mainland visit."</P>
      <P>As Siew will be on a South Pacific visit when the US envoy comes
to brief ROC officials, Hu said the premier has asked the Foreign
Ministry to try to let the US better understand Taipei's
stance and action guidelines in addition to listening to US
views and positions.</P>
      <P>Hu quoted Siew as saying that the US is not expected to
sacrifice or undermine Taiwan's interests in its engagement with
mainland China because such moves are not in the US interests and
would hinder regional peace and development.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Clinton's speeches in mainland China in the past
few days, Hu said Clinton has so far not deviated from basic US
policy toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Nevertheless, we must remain cautious and vigilant as mainland
China still wants to take advantage of Clinton's current visit to
pressure the US to make concessions or compromise on Taiwan-related
issues," Hu explained.</P>
      <P>To his knowledge, Hu said, the US didn't intend to talk much
with mainland China concerning cross-strait issues. "It is Beijing
that has always taken the initiative to discuss Taiwan-related
issues," he added.</P>
      <P>Clinton arrived in mainland China last Thursday for a nine-day
state visit.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIA'S LIBERAL PARTY SHOCKED BY MP'S RESIGNATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra, June 29 (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Liberal Party of the Australian state
of New South Wales is stunned by the sudden resignation of Liberal
Member of Parliament Helen Sham-Ho, a veteran MP of Chinese descent.</P>
      <P>Ho had intended to compete for the speakership of the NSW
Legislative Council, but failed to obtain support from her party
because it feared offending the One Nation party.</P>
      <P>One Nation and its leader, Pauline Hanson, are known for their
anti-Asian, anti-multiculturalism, anti-Aborigine and anti-foreign
investment stance.</P>
      <P>Saying she was disappointed by her party's rejection, Ho on
Monday made a sudden announcement of her resignation.</P>
      <P>She said another factor behind her decision to quit the Liberal
Party was her disappointment at the weak leadership of Liberal Prime
Minister John Howard in his dealings with One Nation.</P>
      <P>At a press conference in Sydney, Ho, who migrated to Australia
from Hong Kong, said she was disappointed by Howard's failure to take
a strong stand against Hanson.</P>
      <P>The Liberal Party, which governs Australia in a coalition with
the National Party, has now lost two high-profile members of Chinese
descent within 10 days.</P>
      <P>Last week, Peter Wong, former chairman of the Federation of
Chinese Communities in NSW, and director of the Herbal Medicine
Department at the University of Sydney, announced his resignation
from the party because the party under Howard did not condemn One
Nation, resulting in racial tension between the Asian community and
One Nation supporters.</P>
      <P>Ho had been a Liberal Party member for 11 years and a member of
the NSW Legislative Council for 10 years, according to her
spokesperson, who told the CNA that Ho will contest the next NSW
state election, expected in 1999, as an independent.</P>

(By Lin Wen-fen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A high-ranking ruling Kuomintang (KMT)
official said on Monday that he feels relations between Taiwan and
the US will not be affected much by the just-concluded Clinton-Jiang
summit.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General John Chang said the people of Taiwan should
not worry too much about the possible effect of the summit on Taiwan,
adding that as an independent sovereign state, the Republic of China
will defend its existence.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Huang Li-ching, director of the KMT's Cultural Affairs
Department, said that although Beijing is expected to increase its
pressure on Taiwan for direct trade links and political talks in the
wake of the summit, the government and ruling party are confident of
tackling this challenge.</P>
      <P>She said that in addition to this external pressure, Taiwan is
also facing internal pressure as a result of differences of opinion
among the island's various political parties and factions.</P>
      <P>Huang called on Taiwan's parties to forsake these differences and
work for the national interest of Taiwan's 21 million residents.</P>
      <P>She also quoted a report compiled by her department which said
the fact that US President Bill Clinton did not mention the so-called
"three noes" policy toward Taiwan during the joint press conference
at the end of the meeting signifies that the US is keeping its
promise not to sacrifice Taiwan's interests for enhanced US-mainland
ties.</P>
      <P>However, the report also said that despite their differences on
human rights and other issues, Washington and Beijing are expected to
engage in a closer, more constructive relationship.</P>
      <P>At one point during the joint press conference, Jiang referred to
Taiwan as being part of mainland China, which the report described as
a signal that Beijing has not given up its attempts to downgrade the
ROC's status to that of a local government.</P>

Muraoka on Monday said his government is happy with the results of
the Clinton-Jiang summit talks which took place on June 27.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a regular press conference in Tokyo, the spokesman
for the Japanese government termed the summit "positive, constructive
and productive."</P>
      <P>"To ensure sound and stable relationships among Japan, the US,
and China is very important for the stability and prosperity of the

      <P>In order to dispel these worries, US Secretary of State Madeleine

Hashimoto on what Clinton discussed with Jiang and other mainland

    <HEADLINE>ALISHAN'S SACRED TREE  RELEGATED TO HISTORY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  29  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Alishan's "sacred tree," one of Taiwan's
oldest landmarks, was relegated to the history books after being
pulled down on Monday for safety reasons.</P>
      <P>Some 200 spectators were on hand to witness the historic event as
the 35-meter-high tree was sawn short and felled.</P>
      <P>The red hinoki cypress, which was more than 3,000 years old and
had a girth of 23 meters, died nearly 40 years ago after being hit
twice by lightning.</P>
      <P>Despite this, it had remained standing, and was one of Alishan's
major attractions. People had even tried to revive it by inserting
small cypress buds into its decaying trunk.</P>
      <P>However, torrential rain last July undermined the tree's roots to
such an extent that it tilted and partly collapsed, leaving what
remained a potential danger to visitors.</P>
      <P>After exhausting every method to preserve the tree, and after
consulting various experts, the Taiwan Forestry Bureau was forced to
make the unhappy decision to pull it down for safety's sake.</P>
      <P>The tree, which was first recorded in 1906 when the island was
ruled by the Japanese, was declared sacred because of its age and
great height -- reported at the time to be 185 meters, according to
sight measurements.</P>
      <P>After the island reverted to the Republic of China in 1945, a
more scientific measurement found it to be only 52 meters high and
actually two cypress trees growing intertwined. A later survey ranked
it the island's second-highest tree, although it was struck off the
list of the top ten big trees earlier this year.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US URGED TO LIVE UP TO ITS COMMITMENT TO TAIWAN SECURITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington, June 30 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator from the Republic of China
urged the United States to live up to its commitment to Taipei so it
would not have to resort to the development of nuclear weapons to
deter a possible attack from mainland China.</P>
      <P>Parris Chang, a legislator from the Democratic Progressive Party,
made the comment in the latest issue of Defense News, a weekly
magazine.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the legislative Defense Committee said there are
several reasons why Taiwan has not developed nuclear weapons, the
most important is that the US is committed to Taiwan's security.</P>
      <P>Chang noted that Beijing leaders have refused to renounce the use
of force against Taiwan. The US could help preserve a nuclear-free
Taiwan by living up to its commitment outlined in the Taiwan
Relations Act through the support of a democratic and independent
Taiwan free from Beijing's aggression and control.</P>
      <P>In the article entitled "US holds key with Taiwan," Chang also
said the recent tit-for-tat nuclear testing between India and
Pakistan raised once again a similar debate in Taipei -- "should
Taiwan go nuclear to deter an unpredictable and belligerent China."</P>
      <P>The answer to that question is categorically "no," Chang said.</P>
      <P>Chang said Taiwan has expertise and financial resources. If
Taiwan were to perceive that there was no guarantee to its security
or sense the US were selling out Taiwan in an effort to develop a
strategic partnership with China, the motivation to go nuclear would
be there, he added.</P>
      <P>However, the people on Taiwan would never permit such a weapon of
mass destruction to be used on their compatriots in the mainland,
Chang said.</P>
      <P>Moreover, if Taiwan were not able to strike first, it would not
have second-strike capability after absorbing an initial attack due to
its small size. It would therefore be irrational for Taiwan to
acquire nuclear weapons as it would be a massive waste of resources,
he added.</P>
      <P>"Most importantly," Chang said, "the 1979 US-Taiwan Relation Act
commits Washington to provide Taiwan with adequate defensive weapon
to deter Chinese aggression."</P>
      <P>"When Taiwan gave up its research and development of nuclear
weapons 10 years ago under US pressure, it was with the tacit
understanding that the United States would provide Taiwan with a
protective nuclear umbrella," the lawmaker wrote.</P>
      <P>Chang added "such US commitment has been the basis for Taiwan
government policy not to develop nuclear weapons."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE SCALES DOWN 1998 GROWTH RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore, June 29 (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Singapore on Monday revised its official
forecast for economic growth in 1998 from the 2.5 percent to 4.5
percent range to between 0.5 percent and 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>Finance Minister Hu Tsu Tau made the announcement in a
parliamentary statement on Singapore's economic performance which
included the government's off-budget measures aimed at cushioning
Singapore's economy from the regional economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>Although Singapore achieved 5.6 percent growth in the first
quarter of this year, the finance minister said the growth rate for
the second quarter is expected to fall to negative 0.5 percent to 2.4
percent. The growth rate may possibly dip into negative figures in
the second half of the year, he added.</P>
      <P>The off-budget measures include the following which are intended
to help stabilize Singapore's property market:</P>
      <P>1. Deferment of the Government Land Sales (GLS) Program;</P>
      <P>2. Suspension of the 5 percent premium for extension of project
completion period;</P>
      <P>3. Allowing re-assignment of GLS parcels; and</P>
      <P>4. Deferment of stamp duty payment for the purchase of
uncompleted properties.</P>
      <P>These measures have been chosen to help avoid exacerbating over
supply in the property market and to facilitate an adjustment and
consolidation of the market in this period of economic slowdown, the
Singapore Ministry of National Development said Monday.</P>
      <P>A stable and healthy property market is essential to maintaining
market confidence and the proper functioning of the economy, it
added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Paris,  June  29   (CNA)
(By M. C. Tzou and  Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A ranking ROC government official said
Monday that Taipei is delighted to see an improvement in
Washington-Beijing ties and urged Washington to encourage Beijing to
safeguard peace and security in Asia.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-jen, director general of the Government Information
Office (GIO), made the remarks in interviews with a number of leading
French newspapers, magazines and radio stations during his two-day
stay here.</P>
      <P>Chen, as the ROC government spokesman, hailed the remarks made by
US President Bill Clinton who is currently visiting mainland China.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said Clinton fully reflected how the United States
values freedom, human rights and democracy in his speeches. Chen said
Clinton's comments will go far to boost progress and development in
the mainland.</P>
      <P>The GIO director general also called on Washington to urge
Beijing to take an active role in easing tensions brought about by
India and Pakistan's nuclear weapons tests.</P>
      <P>Referring to the question of whether Washington-Beijing
engagement will affect Taipei-Washington or Taipei-Beijing ties, Chen
said the impact of Clinton's trek to mainland China on cross-strait
relations remains to be seen.</P>
      <P>As Beijing has continued to be reluctant to renounce the use of
force against Taiwan and end its efforts to block Taiwan in the
international community, Chen said he does not believe Beijing will
relax its stance toward Taiwan because of warming ties with the US.</P>
      <P>Due to mainland China's constant military threat in the Taiwan
Strait, the GIO head said Taiwan has to maintain sufficient defensive
capabilities to ensure its security. He added that Taiwan is very
willing to improve its ties with the mainland to the benefit of both
sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>If Beijing does not alter its hostile attitude toward Taiwan, it
will affect peaceful cross-strait development and hinder the process
of China's unification, he stressed.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the mayoral elections for Taipei and Kaohsiung
slated for the end of this year, Chen predicted both will be fierce
contests. Latest surveys showed that candidates for the Kuomintang
have an advantage over Democratic Progressive Party candidates.</P>
      <P>"Democracy has come of age in Taiwan," Chen noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC OIL PRICES TO BE LOWERED BY 1.57%</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Starting Wednesday, domestic prices for
various oil products will be lowered by an average of 1.57 percent,
Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) announced on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>After the adjustment, the price for gasoline will drop to NT$18
(US$0.53) per liter from the current NT$18.2.</P>
      <P>Prices for diesel and unleaded gasoline will also be cut by NT$0.2
per liter, while the price for fuel oil will be slashed by NT$95 per
kiloliter.</P>
      <P>The air pollution fee imposed on fuel oil consumers will also be
removed beginning from Wednesday as the Environmental Protection
Administration (EPA) has decided to cancel the measure.</P>
      <P>The state-run oil company said the adjustment is mainly aimed at
reflecting its declining crude oil import costs. The new pricing
formula is based on two criteria: crude oil price at US$14 per barrel
and the currency exchange rate at NT$34.4 against the US dollar.</P>
      <P>"We have also taken into account our profit target for fiscal
1999, projected at NT$22.2 billion, in deciding the adjustment
range," said a company spokesperson.</P>
      <P>Crude oil prices have remained weak in the international market
in recent months. The CPC spokesperson said the company may adjust
its oil products prices again in tandem with international crude oil
prices and the New Taiwan dollar's exchange rate.</P>
      <P>"We have adopted a floating pricing system aimed at more
effectively pegging domestic oil prices to the general international
market trend," the spokesperson said, adding that under the new
system, the company has conducted a weekly review of domestic oil
prices since March.</P>
      <P>After the adjustment, the domestic-use liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG) price will be lowered to NT$10.88 per liter from NT$11.11, and
vehicle-use LPG will fall to NT$10.6 from NT$10.8.</P>
      <P>The new prices for 92-unleaded gas and 95-unleaded gas will stand
at NT$16.8 and NT$17.8, respectively.</P>
      <P>In response to the price cut announcement, state-run Taiwan Power
Co. said it would not cut its power rates for the time being because
the decrease in fuel costs is small.</P>
      <P>The company said it will save an estimated NT$630 million in
annual power generation cost because of the CPC's new oil price cut.
This translates to a decrease of a marginal NT$0.005 in per
kilowatt-hour power generation cost.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics said the oil price adjustment will help drive down the
domestic consumer prices and wholesale prices by about 0.054 percent
and 0.069 percent, respectively.</P>
      <P>The directorate said although vegetable and fruit prices rose
significantly in June due to inclement weather in several parts of
the island, the consumer price index climbed less than 2 percent in
the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, the directorate said, the effect of the oil price
cut may be offset by typhoon-caused damage in the coming
months. As a result, it added, the consumer price index may rise
faster in the second half of the year than in the first half.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>About 30 kilograms of heroin with a market
value of NT$800 million (US$23.19 million) was seized in a drug raid
in Taichung, central Taiwan, Investigation Bureau under the Ministry
of Justice reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It is the largest haul of illegal drugs seized this year. Police
also arrested two key suspects Lo Chi-kuang, 44, and Chang Wan-jui,
39.</P>
      <P>Police were tipped earlier that an international drug ring was
planning to smuggle heroin produced in the golden triangle bordering
Thailand and Burma into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The heroin was shipped to mainland China from the southwest
border region and made its way to Guangzhou in southern China. The
drugs were then hidden inside hollow construction bricks and
delivered to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lo and Chang asked a trading company to ship the bricks in 12
shipping containers to Taichung Harbor. The company was unaware of
the drug smuggling operation.</P>
      <P>Police arrested the two when they went to the trading company to

      <P>During a 13-hour search, investigators were unable to find any
drugs in the first 11 shipping containers. They eventually found the
heroin in the last remaining container.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Health officials on Tuesday warned the
public to be on guard against dengue fever during visits to countries
in Southeast Asia.</P>
      <P>Hsu Hsu-mei, deputy director of the Department of Health's Bureau
of Communicable Disease Control, said a dengue fever epidemic is
currently sweeping Southeast Asia. In Indonesia alone, more than
30,000 cases have been reported with 777 fatalities.</P>
      <P>Hsu said that so far this year 32 cases of dengue fever have been
reported in Taiwan. All were contracted during visits to Southeast
Asian countries, she said, adding that this year's figure is double
that of the same period last year.</P>
      <P>Of the 32 cases, nine originated in Indonesia, seven in the
Philippines, six in Thailand, five in Malaysia, two in Burma, two in
Cambodia and one in Vietnam.</P>
      <P>So far no locally contracted dengue fever cases have been
reported, but Hsu said that the public should be aware of the
possibility of an epidemic in Taiwan as the weather becomes hotter
and the rainfall is more abundant.</P>
      <P>Hsu urged the public to eradicate the places in which the Ades
mosquito -- the carrier of the sometimes-fatal disease -- breed,
including discarded containers and tires. This is the most effective
way of preventing an outbreak, she said.</P>

polls, many believe they are better off today than in the good old
days.</P>
      <P>The economy looks great. The stock market is shrugging off the
Asian flu. The crime rate is down. The price of oil is at a 25-year
low. Most of the world is at peace.</P>
      <P>So it should be no wonder that public opinion polls are finding
Americans in an optimistic mood -- more confident about the future,

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States and mainland China are
neither entitled nor in a position to negotiate issues concerning the
Republic of China on Taiwan, a senior official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Foreign Ministry spokesman Roy Wu made the statement in response
to reports that US President Bill Clinton mentioned the so-called
"three noes" policy toward Taiwan at a roundtable meeting in Shanghai
Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>The reports quoted Clinton as confirming at the closed-door
meeting that he told mainland President Jiang Zemin during their
summit meeting in Washington last October that the United States will
not support independence for Taiwan, a "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan" policy or Taiwan's membership in international
organizations in which statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the reports, Wu said Washington and Beijing lack
legitimate power to negotiate any Taiwan-related issues. "The United
States should refrain from doing so, because such moves will give
mainland China and other countries misconceptions," he added.</P>
      <P>Wu said the Republic of China has clearly outlined its national
policy in the National Unification Guidelines. "Our government has
also reiterated on many occasions that its goal to pursue national
unification under a free, democratic system has remained unchanged."</P>
      <P>The spokesman went on to say he sees no need for Clinton to
repeat the so-called "three noes" at this moment. "I don't think
Clinton's statement adds anything to the substance of the US policy."</P>
      <P>Wu stressed that the Republic of China has no intention of
interfering with Beijing-Washington relations. "We also hope the
United States will discuss with the ROC, not mainland China, any
issues related to Taiwan or relations between our two countries," he
said. "Otherwise, relations across the Taiwan Strait mill be
adversely affected and long-term US national interests will also be
undermined."</P>
      <P>Clinton arrived in Shanghai Monday evening. He has already
visited Xian and Beijing and will later travel to Gueilin and Hong
Kong before ending his nine-day visit on July 3.</P>

      <P>Australian migrants from Asian countries 
 are uniting in an effort to beat the One Nation Party in the next
state and federal elections in the face of growing disarray in the
Liberal and National Party coalition government.</P>
      <P>Over 20 Asian community associations have offered to raise funds

coming state and federal elections, said Lee Fu-yuan, a leader of
Melbourne's Chinese community.</P>
      <P>The One Nation Party is divisive and anti-Asian, he told CNA, and
many Chinese and Asian migrants do not want to see the party's
influence spread to Melbourne and Victoria.</P>
      <P>In Sydney and New South Wales (NSW), Chinese and Vietnamese
community leaders have vowed not to support the Liberal and National

      <P>Five of the seven questions posed to US
President Bill Clinton during a question-and-answer session at
Beijing University were directed by school authorities, according to
Monday's Washington Post.</P>
      <P>The questions were put to Clinton after he delivered a speech at
the university, commonly known as Beida.</P>
      <P>University officials and students discussed and deliberated for
an entire week which questions would be raised, according to an
international studies graduate student at the university who was
cited in the report.</P>
      <P>Often referred to as the craddle of mainland China's
pro-democracy movement, Beida today is populated by students who are
more pragmatic and prudent than those who participated in
demonstrations nine years ago, the paper said, adding that the
students' sharp questions challenged Clinton's position on human
rights.</P>
      <P>Wang Yangmei, a Beida law student, told the Post that she thought
it was good the students had the guts to raise the questions, which
reflected most students' thoughts and beliefs.</P>
      <P>Clinton is a great diplomat, she said. Although students were not
completely satisfied with the president's replies, Clinton enabled
students to understand his attitude, she said.</P>
      <P>Fellow law student Wang Bin said Clinton is entitled to promote
human rights, "but don't pin much hope on that ... we Chinese have
our own problems based on current reality."</P>

      <P>Group members include manufacturers of furniture, machinery,

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton's reiteration of
the so-called "three noes" is not expected to significantly impact
ROC national interests, a senior official said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"The 'three noes' has long been an established US policy.
Clinton's reiteration will only have limited impact on our
interests," said Shen Lyu-shun, director of the Foreign Ministry's
North American Affairs Department.</P>
      <P>Even though Clinton has reaffirmed no US support for Taiwan's
membership in the United Nations, Shen said, the ROC government will
continue to seek international support and sympathy for its cause.</P>
      <P>Noting that over the past six years, the Republic of China's bid
to rejoin the United Nations has won much sympathy in the
international community, Shen said, "We'll continue to promote our
bid. Even if we can't realize our goal in the near future, it is a
good strategy to help the international society understand our stance
and win more support for our cause."</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, Clinton said at a
roundtable meeting in Shanghai on Tuesday morning that the United
States does "not support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas, or
one Taiwan-one China." Clinton further said the United States does
not believe Taiwan should be a member in any organization for which
statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>In response, Shen said the Republic Of China has endured the
adverse impact of the policy ever since it was adopted by the United
States.</P>
      <P>"Even if Clinton's reiteration does afflict new harm to Taiwan,
the impact will not be very great," Shen said at a public hearing on
the possible impact of Clinton's current mainland China visit.</P>
      <P>Shen said local people need not worry about the future of the
Republic of China merely because Clinton reiterated his country's
position.</P>
      <P>So far Clinton's visit has not damaged Taiwan's interests, Shen
said, adding that the ROC still has ample room to further develop US
relations and will be able to maintain its pragmatic diplomacy
strategy.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China lost its UN seat when the world body
admitted Beijing in 1971. Starting in 1993, ROC's diplomatic allies
have consistently urged the UN General Assembly to study a feasible
measure for the 21.3 million people in Taiwan to be represented in
the organization. However, such a proposal had been unable to make
the agenda for the annual UN General Assembly meeting because of
Beijing's opposition.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SINGAPORE UNVEILS S$2 BILLION STIMULUS PACKAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Singapore,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Conrad Lu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Singapore government announced
Monday a S$2 billion (US$1.2 billion) stimulus package that will
result in a budget deficit of S$800 million, the country's first
deficit in more than 10 years.</P>
      <P>The government also revised downward this year's economic growth
estimates from earlier predictions of 2.5 percent to 4.5 percent to a
more modest 0.5 percent to 1.5 percent.</P>
      <P>The package was unveiled in parliament by Finance Minister Hu Tsu
Tau against a backdrop of what he described as a "deteriorating
external environment ... not problems inherent in our own economy."</P>
      <P>Growth in the second half of this year could be "very weak, and
possibly even become negative," he said, adding that Singapore must
prepare for slower economic growth over the next few years as the
region recovers from its current financial turmoil.</P>
      <P>Included in the plan is a near doubling of the size of the Local
Enterprise Financing Scheme credit line, which helps provide
Singapore businesses with working capital. The line will be increased
from S$900 million to S$2 billion. Absent from the plan, however,
were cuts in personal or corporate income taxes, as well as a
reduction in interest rates.</P>
      <P>The plan also includes a one-year suspension of stamp duties on
share transactions. The measure, which is expected to cost the
government S$50 million, is aimed at helping stockbrokers cope with
sharply lower trading volumes.</P>
      <P>Starting Wednesday, the government will also incur a
S$400-million revenue loss from a property tax rebate of 40 percent
on commercial and industrial properties. This comes in addition to a
15 percent rebate announced in February.</P>
      <P>Hu noted that, given the Singapore economy's open nature, it is
difficult to stimulate domestic growth through pump-priming or
boosting local consumption. However, several ongoing public sector
infrastructure projects will be speeded up.</P>
      <P>"We must brace for slower economic growth during the next few
years," Hu said. "Some companies will feel the fall in demand and
profits more acutely than others. Retrenchment will increase as
businesses consolidate and restructure. This process will be painful
but we must accept it as the only way to adapt to the changed
economic conditions and resume growth."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Premier Vincent Siew said on Tuesday
that he saw no need for US President Bill Clinton to spell out the
"three noes" policy toward Taiwan during a meeting with mainland
Chinese local leaders earlier in the day.</P>
      <P>Siew said that if the United States is really concerned about ROC
policy, US officials are welcome to hold talks with ROC officials at
any time.</P>
      <P>Siew's remarks were in response to news reports that while
meeting with community leaders in Shanghai, Clinton told them that
"We don't support independence for Taiwan, or two Chinas .... And we
don't believe that Taiwan should be a member in any organization for
which statehood is a requirement."</P>
      <P>The premier's response is the first time he has commented on
Clinton's historic nine-day visit.</P>
      <P>In related news, Vice Foreign Minister David Lee said on Tuesday
that he did not think Clinton's remarks added anything substantial to
the United States' policy.</P>
      <P>The ROC government, however, will express its concern over the
matter when a US envoy comes to Taiwan later this week to brief the
government on Clinton's visit, Lee said. The ROC government will also
make clear its position, as well as its expectations, on issues of
mutual concern.</P>
      <P>The United States and mainland China are neither entitled nor in
a position to negotiate issues that relate to the Republic of China's
sovereignty, said Lee, who is also in charge of an inter-agency task
force set up to address new developments in Beijing-Washington
relations that occur during Clinton's visit.</P>
      <P>Asked if Clinton's statements will affect ROC efforts to rejoin
the United Nations, Lee said that the US government told Taiwan in
1994 that it would not support Taiwan's bid to join international
bodies whose members are sovereign countries. Taiwan, however, has
not changed its position and is still seeking membership.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Ranking officials with the pro-independence
Democratic Progressive Party said on Tuesday that the DPP needs a
more flexible strategy in the face of possible changes in trilateral
Taipei-Washington-Beijing ties.</P>
      <P>Commenting that "the current situation across the Taiwan Strait
will continue at least another 10 years," DPP Secretary-General Chiu
Yih-jen said he is not worried about possible changes in cross-strait
relations.</P>
      <P>"As the United States has already set up a strategic partnership
with mainland China, Washington should prefer the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait maintain the status-quo," he said.</P>
      <P>Chiu's remarks came after US President Bill Clinton reiterated US
support for the "three noes" policy toward Taiwan during a forum in
Shanghai Tuesday morning.</P>
      <P>"We don't support independence for Taiwan or two Chinas ... And
we don't believe that Taiwan should be a member in any organization
for which statehood is a requirement," Clinton told participants in
the forum.</P>
      <P>Chiu said he does not believe that this new development in
trilateral Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations will affect the DPP's
pursuit of Taiwan independence. But he noted that the DPP needs to
adopt a more flexible strategy as its goal of independence for Taiwan
has become harder to achieve in light of Clinton's announcement.</P>
      <P>The DPP will discuss the issue Wednesday in a meeting of the
party's policy-making central standing committee, he said.</P>
      <P>Pointing out that situation between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait is no longer a zero-sum game, Chiu said Taiwan must adjust its
thinking, since "what communist China has gained does not necessarily
mean a loss for Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Yen Wan-chin, director of the DPP's mainland affairs department,
said Clinton's public declaration of not supporting Taiwan
independence will make it harder for the country to obtain legal
status in the international community. The DPP needs to further
ponder the issue of Taiwan independence, which has always been the
party's goal, he added.</P>

      <P>More than half of Taiwan people are
opposed to the Beijing-proposed "one country, two systems"
unification scheme, according to a public opinion poll released on

      <P>The poll, released by the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) on the eve of the first anniversary of Hong Kong's handover by
Britain to Beijing, found that 51.1 percent of the respondents said
they can't accept the "one country, two systems" model even if the
formula is successfully implemented in Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>A similar poll conducted in Hong Kong, however, found that 48.6
percent of Hong Kong residents interviewed think that the "one
country, two systems" scheme is suitable for Taiwan; while 36.9
percent said they don't think the formula is applicable to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MAC survey also showed that 35.4 percent of Taiwan
respondents feel that Hong Kong's overall situation has worsened
since it reverted to mainland China's rule on July 1, 1997; 17.3

same; and only 6.6 percent said the situation there has become even
better than before.</P>
      <P>While 36.2 percent of Taiwan respondents feel that
Taiwan-Hong Kong relations have become less close than before, 63.9
percent said they hope to see bilateral ties get ever closer. Nearly
52 percent of Hong Kong residents also said the current Hong Kong
government should maintain close relations with Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MAC poll further found that 29.1 percent of Hong Kong
respondents expect the two sides of the Taiwan Strait to gradually
move toward unification, compared to 48.1 percent who forecast the
status quo on both sides of the strait will be maintained.</P>
      <P>The poll also found that 34.9 percent of Hong Kong
residents hope to see the cross-strait status quo be
maintained, while 48.8 percent said they hope the two sides
will reunify.</P>
      <P>According to poll results, 54.7 percent said they support
Taiwan's bid to expand its diplomatic frontier, while 26.2 percent
said they oppose such moves.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 59.4 percent of Taiwan respondents threw their
support behind the proposal that Taiwan and Hong Kong exchange
official representative offices; while 74.2 percent of Hong Kong
respondents said they feel Taiwan needs to set up an official

insisting that he had just performed the traditional Chinese
physical therapy "Chikung" on Christine, who was then 19 years old
and suffered from a chronic disease.</P>
      <P>The Justice Ministry sent a three-member team to Paris earlier
this month to collect information about the allegations. The team's
only female member, Li Tsui-lien, managed to interview Christine in
a hospital room in Paris last weekend. Christine was admitted into
the hospital before the arrival of the Taiwan team to receive
treatment for mental stress stemming from the alleged sexual assault
incident.</P>
      <P>According to press reports, Christine had told Li that Cheng had
touched on her breast and private parts while administering Chikung
on her.</P>
      <P>The task force is now carefully sifting through related
information and scrutinizing every detail. Chiang said it's still
too early to predict when the task force will be able to come up
with a formal report on the case.</P>
      <P>Investigators are still trying to obtain a copy of Christine's
complaint to the French police filed shortly after the alleged
sexual assualt and the hospital's diagnosis of her mental state
through the country's representative office in Paris. The two
documents can serve as evidence to help justify Christine's
allegations.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's China Shipbuilding Corp. (CSC)

economic development of most countries in the region.</P>
      <P>The state-run company has obtained new orders which had

      <P>South Korea is one of the regional countries hit hardest by the

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Bill Clinton's mentioning of the
"three nos" Tuesday in Shanghai will not change Taiwan's mainland
policy and its decision to pursue dialogues with mainland China, an
official of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said.</P>
      <P>Clinton said at a forum in Shanghai that, during his summit with
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing, "I had a chance to
reiterate our Taiwan policy which is that we don't support
independence for Taiwan, or 'two Chinas' or 'one Taiwan one China,'
and we don't believe Taiwan should be a member in any organization
for which statehood is a requirement." The US position is known as
the "three nos."</P>
      <P>President Clinton's public mentioning of the "three nos" has
apparently made Taiwan leaders indignant.</P>
      <P>When asked Tuesday by the press to comment on Clinton's
mentioning of the "three nos" at the forum, MAC Vice Chairman and
Spokesman Sheu Ke-sheng said that Taiwan's policy to pursue national
unification under the principles of democracy, freedom, and equal
distribution of wealth will not be changed and that Taiwan will
actively make arrangements for cross-strait dialogues this fall.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's chief negotiator Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Strait
Exchange Foundation (SEF), has received an invitation from the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) to meet
with his mainland Chinese counterpart Wang Daohan this fall in
Shanghai. The SEF and ARATS were established in Taipei and Beijing
respectively in 1991 to handle civilian exchanges between the two
sides in the absence of formal relations.</P>
      <P>Sheu expressed the hope that Beijing will handle cross-strait
relations realistically. It will certainly be harmful to the
development of the relations if mainland China continues to make
all-out efforts to hinder Taiwan's activities in the international
community, he added.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan will try to step up exchanges and consultations
with mainland China and hopes that the Koo-Wang meeting this fall in
Shanghai will be fruitful.</P>

    <HEADLINE>US SHOULD NOT IGNORE ITS PROMISES TO TAIWAN: FOREIGN MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States should not ignore its
promises to support Taiwan's efforts to have a voice in international
organizations, ROC Foreign Affairs Minister Jason Hu said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Hu said that in its 1994 review of US policy on Taiwan,
Washington made clear that the US does not support membership for
Taiwan in international organizations for which statehood is a
requirement. Nevertheless, he added, Washington also said in the
review that it supports efforts that would help Taiwan to be heard in
international organizations.</P>
      <P>Commenting on US President Bill Clinton's remarks on Tuesday in
Shanghai of the so-called "three noes" policy toward Taiwan, Hu said
that although the policy is not a new development, it seems
unnecessary for Clinton to spell it out at this time.</P>
      <P>Clinton's affirmation of the "three noes" -- no support for
independence for Taiwan, no support for "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan," and no support for Taiwan's membership in international
organizations in which statehood is a requirement -- was an effort to
please the Beijing authorities, who have been pushing the US to
codify the policy, Hu said.</P>
      <P>The foreign minister said he is aware of concern in the
government hierarchy over Clinton's latest statement, as well as the
aftershocks the statement has caused among the Taiwan public.</P>
      <P>However, he stressed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
has not been "caught unprepared" by Clinton's words.</P>
      <P>Clinton's statement does not necessarily mean that the US' firm
policies regarding the pursuit of peace and stability have changed,
Hu said, adding that the motive behind the statement was simply to
dissuade Beijing from making any rash or sudden moves on the Taiwan
issue.</P>
      <P>He stressed that the MOFA will further bolster its efforts on all
its diplomatic fronts, as well as in its relations with the US, so as
to diminish the harm caused by Beijing's schemes to suppress Taiwan
in the international community.</P>
      <P>At the same time, he said, Taiwan will also continue to improve
its relations with mainland China. By doing so, Beijing's hostile
attempts will lose their meaning, the foreign minister said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>`THREE NOES' NOT NEW US POLICY: SCHOLAR</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June 30 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>US President Bill Clinton's affirmation of
the so-called "three noes" policy in Shanghai is not a new
development in US policy toward Taiwan, an independent world affairs
scholar said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Dr. Hsieh Shu-yuan, who is the only member from Taiwan of the
Pugwash Conference on Sciences and World Affairs, winner of the 1995
Nobel Peace Prize, said Clinton's Tuesday remarks of the "three noes"
policy is unlikely to alter the existing situation across the Taiwan
Strait. In fact, she said, the affirmation may contribute to
bolstering stability in the region.</P>
      <P>Hsieh urged the Taiwan public not to be over-worried about
Clinton's latest remarks, as the policy has been a set and consistent
part of US policy on Taiwan for years.</P>
      <P>Reports from Shanghai said that Clinton confirmed at a
closed-door meeting on Tuesday that the US will not support
independence for Taiwan, will not support "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan", and will not support Taiwan's membership in
international organizations in which statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>Although it is the first time a US president has voiced the
"three noes" policy, the development is not expected to cause any
additional harm to Taiwan's interests, Hsieh noted.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who has taught at National Taiwan University and at
Marshall University in the United States, said that no matter when or
where Clinton made the remarks, they are still in compliance with the
US policy of "ambiguity" toward Taiwan, and the US support for Taiwan
has not been affected or limited.</P>
      <P>Hsieh, who has also taught at universities in Africa and Italy,
said Taiwan's worries over Clinton's remarks are absolutely
unnecessary, and she urged the people of Taiwan to learn to view the
Clinton-Jiang summit from a broader perspective.</P>
      <P>Since the US policy toward Taiwan remains unchanged despite the
fact that it has been publicly spelled out by a US president, the
people of Taiwan should turn their attention to the brighter side of
the summit, which is poised to defuse nuclear proliferation, enhance
economic stability in Asia, uphold human rights values and result in
better Washington-Beijing ties.</P>
      <P>Taiwan itself could even end up benefiting from these
developments, Hsieh concluded.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's bid to join the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will not be affected by US President Bill
Clinton's statement on the so-called "three noes" policy toward
Taiwan, Economic Affairs Minister Wang Chih-kang said on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Issues involving Taiwan's and mainland China's membership in
international organizations should be handled separately, he said.</P>
      <P>Clinton spelled out the US' "consistent" policy toward Taiwan
during the Shanghai leg of his mainland China tour on Tuesday, saying
that the US does not support independence for Taiwan, does not
support "two Chinas," or "one Taiwan, one China," and does not
support Taiwan's membership of any organization for which statehood
is a requirement.</P>
      <P>The economics minister said the "name issue" has always been a
sensitive one in terms of Taiwan's membership in international
organizations. Taiwan joined the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) forum under the name "Chinese Taipei," while it applied for
WTO membership under the name of "the Customs Territory of Taiwan,
Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu." Clinton's remarks, therefore, exert no
affect on Taipei's bid to join the WTO, Wang said.</P>
      <P>Wang also welcomed US Commerce Secretary William Daley's recent
remarks that there is no direct relationship between Taiwan's and
mainland China's accession to the WTO.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI CITY MAYORAL CANDIDATES URGE ADJUSTMENT OF `GO SLOW' POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, June 30 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two candidates for the year-end Taipei City
mayoral election on Tuesday urged the government to adjust its "go
slow, be patient" policy toward investment in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Ma Ying-jeou of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) and Wang Chien-shien
of the opposition New Party made the suggestions at a meeting in
Taipei sponsored by the National Federation of Certified Public
Accountants to mark Public Accountant Day.</P>
      <P>They also expressed their views on the government's "three noes"
policy.</P>
      <P>Wang said that if Taiwan continues its policy of no direct trade,
postal, or transportation links with the mainland, then it stands to
lose valuable trade opportunities as the mainland economy continues
to grow. He pointed out that by 2002, the mainland economy is
expected to have expanded seven-fold.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the ban be lifted immediately, and that the
three direct links be listed on the agenda of high-level cross-strait
talks scheduled for September.</P>
      <P>Ma said that once Taiwan joins the World Trade Organization, it
will be unable to avoid contact with the mainland, by which time,
Taiwan will be forced to adjust its "go slow, be patient" policy.</P>
      <P>But he also stressed that until that time arrives, Taiwan need
not adjust the policy hastily, but should maintain some flexibility
regarding when and if the policy should be changed.</P>
      <P>He predicted that questions regarding the policy will be resolved
after the September talks.</P>
      <P>Commenting on remarks on the US' "three noes" policy on Taiwan
made by President Bill Clinton in Shanghai on Tuesday, Wang said the
damage to Taiwan will not be too great.</P>
      <P>The "three noes" in this case refers to no support for an
independent Taiwan, no support for "two Chinas," or "one Taiwan, one
China," and no support for Taiwan membership in any international
organizations for which statehood is a requirement.</P>
      <P>Wang said that resources now being channeled into Taiwan's UN bid
should be diverted back to domestic issues, and that Taiwan should
focus on its internal affairs and public construction works.</P>
      <P>Ma, on the other hand, said that Taiwan need not panic. He said
he believes that Taiwan will not be so easily sold out, and that
Taiwan should improve its relations with mainland China at the same
time that the US is improving its relations with the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUSTRALIAN SENATOR STRESSES NEED FOR STRONGER AUSTRALIA-TAIWAN TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Canberra,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Peter Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The chairman of the Australia-Taiwan
Parliamentary Group has stressed the need to strengthen bilateral
ties between Canberra and Taipei.</P>
      <P>In a speech to the Senate in Canberra last week, Senator Sandy
MacDonald of the National Party said the pursuit of free trade is
"immensely important to every Australian -- not just farmers and
exporters, but to all of us."</P>
      <P>"I am conscious of the need to build the strong personal,
economic and political links between our two countries," he said.</P>
      <P>He said two-way trade between Australia and Taiwan totaled A$6.7
(US$4.5) billion in 1997.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is a major and growing source of services for Australia,
he said, citing Australia's export revenue, especially tourism and
education, which was valued at A$707 (US$532) million in 1995-96 and
the fact that Taiwan is potentially a significant source of
investment for Australia.</P>
      <P>Despite the Asian financial crisis, Australian exporters continue
to sell their products in the region, which accounts for about 60
percent of Australia's total exports.</P>
      <P>MacDonald criticized the anti-Asian policy of Australia's One
Nation party, saying: "To be anti-Asian equals fewer jobs; to be
anti-foreign investment equals fewer jobs."</P>
      <P>"Isolationism hurts the poorest and least trained people in the
community the most," he said.</P>
      <P>He warned that One Nation could only damage Australia and cost
Australian jobs, and called on the Senate to realize that "One Nation
does not speak for this nation, because on this very important aspect
of our foreign policy it is wrong, and ordinary Aussie wage earners
will be the losers.</P>
      <P>"We rely on our trade links and our reputation and we do not want
to be thought of as some backward-looking, unsophisticated,
aggressive place," the senator said.</P>

      <P>The ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA)
said on Tuesday that it sees no need for US President Bill Clinton to
repeat the so-called "three noes" at this point, as such a statement

      <P>"Otherwise, this will give communist China and the international

      <P>The ROC has no intention of interfering with the development of

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  June  30  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States has no intention of
heightening the political significance of its "three noes" policy
towards Taiwan, said Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Hsu
Hsin-liang on Tuesday.</P>
      <P>"This is the reason why US President Clinton chose to spell out
the `three noes' policy at an informal meeting with community leaders
rather than announce it at a formal press conference," Hsu said at a
press conference.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Clinton said in Shanghai that "we don't
support independence for Taiwan, or `two Chinas' or `one Taiwan one
China,' and we don't believe Taiwan should be a member in any
organization for which statehood is a requirement."</P>
      <P>In addition, Clinton also emphasized that US arms sales to Taiwan
will not affect its adherence to the "one China" principle, which
further decreases the significance of the "three noes" policy, Hsu
added.</P>
      <P>The DPP heavyweight said that by answering questions raised by
students at Beijing University and by radio listeners at a call-in
program in Shanghai, Clinton has performed very well by talking about
human rights and freedom to the Chinese, and even the people of the
whole world. "The influence is far-reaching," he added.</P>
      <P>Hsu urged the government to establish a "cross-strait affairs
advisory committee under the Presidential Office" as soon as possible
to solicit consensus on mainland policy.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, DPP Secretary-General Chiu Yi-jen said that the "three
noes" policy will not prompt the DPP to adjust its pro-independence
stance, as Hsu and former party chairman Shih Ming-teh already took
that step years ago when they announced that the DPP will not declare
Taiwan independent should it become the island's ruling party.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian, another DPP heavyweight, said
Clinton did not clearly declare US opposition to the three issues,
saying "no support" is not equal to "opposition."</P>

      <P>The world's largest congregation of 327
blackfaced spoonbills can be found at the mouth of the Tsengwen Creek
in southern Taiwan's Tainan County, representing 53 percent of the
world's population of the endangered birds.</P>
      <P>Professor Huang Chin-ming, a member of Taiwan's Coast Protection
Association, on Tuesday released the number, which was provided by an
international survey task force on blackfaced spoonbill conservation.</P>
      <P>He cited Dr. Tom Dahmer, leader of the survey mission, as saying
that Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, mainland China, Macao, and Vietnam
were covered in the 1998 investigation, and that a total of 613 of
the wetland birds were found in those regions.</P>
      <P>Dahmer said the task force has so far been unable to ascertain
whether the population is increasing or decreasing, or whether or not
it is stable, and warned that if no effective protection measures are
taken, the birds will face extinction.</P>
      <P>The mouth of Tsengwen Creek has been listed as a major habitat of
the blackfaced spoonbill, with around 300 migrating every winter from
the north to the wetland area.</P>
      <P>Despite urging from domestic and international wildlife
conservationists to list the wetland as a wildlife protection area,
industrial development has never stopped, and there are now plans to
drain the whole area to build an industrial park.</P>
