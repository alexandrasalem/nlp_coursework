Confucius' lesson of the day: "In my method of teaching, I always
wait for my student to make an effort himself to find his way through
a difficulty, before I show him the way myself. I also make him find
his own illustrations before I give him one of my own. When I have
pointed out the bearing of a subject in one direction and found that
my student cannot himself see its bearings into other directions, I
do not then repeat my lesson."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NEEDS LONG-RANGE MISSILES TO DETER PLA ATTACKS: U.S. EXPERT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Jan.  31  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Washington should seriously consider
selling Taiwan long-range attack missiles so it can better deter the
growing missile, air and naval forces of mainland China's People's
Liberation Army (PLA), a U.S. military strategist said Thursday.</P>
      <P>To sustain a sufficient level of deterrence in the Taiwan Strait,
Taiwan requires the greater air defense and antisubmarine
capabilities of the Kidd class destroyer, as well as the even greater
anti-aircraft and potential antimissile capabilities of the Aegis
class destroyer, said Richard Fisher Jr., a senior fellow with the
private nonprofit Jamestown Foundation.</P>
      <P>In his latest article carried in China Brief, a publication of
the Jamestown Foundation, Fisher said the purchase by mainland China
of two Russian Project 956EM Sovremenny class destroyers, with the
contract being signed this Jan. 3 for delivery by 2006, highlights
the continuing growth in the PLA's capability of putting military
pressure on Taiwan.</P>
      <P>It is increasingly apparent that the "center" of the PLA's
counter-Taiwan strategy will be its space-missile-air power combine,
Fisher noted, pointing out that this might include support from
airborne troops, which can decide the outcome of a conflict in a
short period of time.</P>
      <P>The mainland Chinese naval forces, and especially its growing
submarine forces, would be critical in a combined forces effort to
stop the U.S. Navy from helping Taiwan. But if Beijing were to try
subduing Taiwan by a naval blockade, then ships like the Sovremenny
would assume a greater importance, wrote Fisher, the managing editor
of China Brief.</P>
      <P>For general operations against Taiwan, Fisher analyzed, the PLA's
goal would be to first strike Republic of China Navy at its ports
with missiles, aircraft and special forces units. Surviving warships
would then face a superior number of mainland Chinese submarines,
strike aircraft, combat ships as well as numerous naval mines.</P>
      <P>The Sovremennys, with their 130mm naval guns, could either
provide fire support for amphibious invasion forces or act as the
leading edge in a blockade operation, said Fisher, who is a noted
military strategist, particularly on the PLA.</P>
      <P>Concern in both Taipei and Washington about mainland China's
first purchase of two Russian Project 956E Sovremenny class
destroyers in 1996 is justified by the fact that Taiwan and perhaps
even the U.S. Navy lack an effective defense against the ship's
SS-N-22 Sunburn (3M-80E Moskit) supersonic anti-ship missile, Fisher
said, adding that both of these Sovremennys are now assigned to
mainland China's East Sea Fleet which faces Taiwan and Japan.</P>
      <P>For Taipei and Washington, mainland China's recent purchase of
even more advanced models of the Russian-made Sovremenny serves to
validate the Bush administration's decision last year to sell Taiwan
U.S. Kidd class destroyers and eight new conventional submarines,
Kidd said, noting that there is an even greater requirement for the
submarines now to counter the new Sovremennys.</P>

    <HEADLINE>INCUMBENT  LEGISLATIVE  YUAN  PRESIDENT WINS RE-ELECTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Incumbent Legislative Yuan President Wang
Jin-pyng won his re-election bid overwhelmingly Friday, the first day
of the fifth legislature.</P>
      <P>Wang, who served as president of the fourth legislature, vice
president of the third and is concurrently a vice chairman of the
opposition Kuomintang, won 218 votes from the 225 legislators.</P>
      <P>Wang, who as a nine-term legislator has a great deal of
experience of Taiwan's lawmaking organ, said after his victory that
he wishes to create an "efficient and high-quality" legislature.</P>
      <P>He had been favored from the start to win the election because he
had secured general support from all four major political parties.
Even the ruling Democratic Progressive Party endorsed him in a
goodwill gesture in exchange for the KMT's support for its candidate
-- Hong Chi-chang -- for the vice presidency.</P>
      <P>The DPP has become the largest party in the new legislature with
87 seats, the KMT has 68 seats, the People First Party (PFP) has 46
seats and the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) 13 seats.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT and the PFP joined forces to recommend P.K.
Chiang of the KMT for the vice presidency, which seemed to give the
situation an uncertain factor, but Wang was able to win after
receiving support from the DPP and the TSU.</P>
      <P>Wang's 218 votes was the highest number of votes to be garnered
in any legislative presidency election. However, some dissenting
legislators used the voting to express their preferred choices,
resulting in one vote each for legislators Lu Po-chi, Hong Chi-chang,
Shen Fu-hsiung and Wang Hsing-nan of the DPP and one for P.K. Chiang.</P>
      <P>Wang won only 134 votes in the previous legislature, when the KMT
was the dominant force in the legislature and the PFP had yet to
appear. The DPP's candidate for the speaker on that occasion was
Chang Chun-hsiung, who received only 72 votes.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is likely to
suspend newly sworn-in Defense Minister Tang Yao-ming's rights as a
member of the opposition party, a KMT official said Friday.</P>
      <P>Tang, who replaces Wu Shih-wen as minister of national defense
under the new Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-ruled Cabinet led by
Premier Yu Shyi-kun, assumed his duties that day, despite a recent
decision by the KMT Central Standing Committee to ban KMT members
from serving in the new Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The ban was imposed to uphold the party's determination to force
the DPP to take sole responsibility for the administration.</P>
      <P>The suspension of Tang's party rights is more lenient than
outright expulsion from the party, because Tang gave his word to the
KMT decision-makers on a four-point guarantee that he will remain
patriotic to the nation and people and will keep the Republic of
China Armed Forces neutral and nationalized.</P>
      <P>The four-point guarantee also stipulates that he will try to
bolster national security, will not help promote Taiwan independence,
will not stump for any DPP candidates in any elections, and will not
participate in any party political activities.</P>
      <P>The KMT Evaluation and Discipline Committee is expected to make a
final decision within days on Tang's punishment.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the committee is also considering measures to
discipline KMT member Yang Teh-chih, who was also sworn in Friday as
chairman of the Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired

    <HEADLINE>ROC FOREIGN MINISTER STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF `HUMAN RIGHTS DIPLOMACY'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>New Republic of China Minister of Foreign
Affairs Eugene Chien stressed Friday the importance of promoting what
he called "human rights diplomacy" as a way for the country to take
part in international activities.</P>
      <P>Speaking after assuming office, Chien said that the top priority
of the country's diplomatic work in the future will be on democracy
and human rights, economic co-prosperity, peace and security.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan has attained laudable achievements in
democratization over the past decade, as displayed by the peaceful
transfer of power following the March 18, 2000 presidential election.</P>
      <P>"It constitutes an invisible protection for Taiwan's security and
survival," Chien said.</P>
      <P>The new foreign minister stated that the ROC shares with other
democratic countries the common values of freedom, democracy and
human rights and added that further efforts will be made to enlist
the private sector to help the country take part in international
activities.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan has become a member of the World Trade Organization,
Chien went on, his ministry will cooperate with related government
agencies to promote economic and trade relations, which he said will
also help the promotion of diplomatic work.</P>
      <P>In the face of threats from mainland China, the minister said,
his ministry will urge peace-loving people around the world to pay
attention to peace and security.</P>
      <P>Chien added that the appeal for peace in the international
community "will help build a protective net for the ROC's peace and
security."</P>
      <P>At this time of globalization, he continued, everyone should
contribute to the promotion of the country's foreign relations
because "diplomatic work is not only the work of his ministry but
also the work of everyone."</P>
      <P>Chien was a deputy presidential secretary-general before his
appointment as foreign minister, replacing Tien Hung-mao, who has

businessmen's first choice when picking cooperative ventures in
expanding Asia-Pacific markets.</P>
      <P>The BOFT attaches great importance to the current meeting because
it is Taiwan's first with a WTO member economy since it entered the

    <HEADLINE>MAJOR TASKS AWAITING NEW ECONOMIC AFFAIRS MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Major tasks are awaiting Economic Affairs
Minister Christine Tsung with the swearing in of the new "combative
Cabinet" Friday, at a time when Taiwan's economy is still mired in a
recession, according to local analysts.</P>
      <P>Major issues of national concern, such as whether the government
should lift a ban on the relocation of eight-inch wafer plants to
mainland China and the reform of state-run enterprises, remain high
on the agenda of the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), which
analysts said will see a tremendous transformation of Taiwan's
economy in the coming years.</P>
      <P>Although the non-partisan Economic Development Advisory
Conference reached consensus in August last year to ease restrictions
on mainland-bound investment by Taiwan firms, the MOEA has not yet
made a final decision on whether to lift the ban after the Mainland
Affairs Council and some scholars voiced opposition to the opening
late last year out of fear of a capital flight to the mainland.</P>
      <P>But Vice Premier Lin Hsin-yi, who was Tsung's predecessor,
dismissed a widely assumed belief shortly after deciding to take over
the new post that he is opposed to the relocation of eight-inch wafer
plants to the mainland, saying that it is "a misunderstanding" and
that he will address the issue in greater detail in the future."</P>
      <P>Lin's remarks provoked suspicion among observers as to whether
the remarks are an indication that the MOEA will soon remove the ban
in response to keen demand from the local semiconductor industry.</P>
      <P>At the same time, incoming personnel arrangements in various
state-run enterprises, including Taiwan Power Company, Taiwan Sugar
Cooperation and Taiwan Salt Industrial Corporation, will also test
Tsung's wisdom amid high public expectations.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington, Feb. 1 (CNA)
(By W. H. Kuo and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Trade Organization (WTO) can
offer a channel for negotiations and communications for Taiwan and
mainland China, as both sides have recently joined the world trade
regulatory body, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a lunch banquet at the invitation of the U. S.-China
Business Council in Washington, D. C., Zoellick said, "Now, if China
and Taiwan choose, they can employ the WTO as a channel for
communication and negotiation, mutually observe its rules, and use
its disciplines to accelerate the course upon which they have already
embarked."</P>
      <P>"It is not a given that either or both will do so..., but
opportunities of this kind are rarely easy to grasp, and both will
need to apply the courage and wisdom of their ancestors to prosper
from this modern millennium," Zoellick stressed.</P>
      <P>As the Taiwan Strait remains one of the world's most dangerous
flash points, differences between the United States and PRC have
required the most sensitive management, Zoellick said.</P>
      <P>At a time of political and military stalemate, and occasionally
confrontation across the Taiwan Strait, he said, "We have witnessed
extraordinary growth of economic ties."</P>
      <P>"Indeed, Taiwan is emerging as the largest investor in the PRC,
with trade growing from zero to over US$30 billion in a decade,
hundreds of thousands of people from Taiwan living in the Shanghai
area alone, and millions of visitors from Taiwan going to the
mainland," he said.</P>
      <P>Although economic interdependence does not guarantee peace,
Zoellick expressed the hope that "cross-strait economic integration
could offer possibilities to mute differences."</P>
      <P>"Give each side a stake in peace and stability, and challenge
stereotypes as Taiwan's democracy thrives and China's politics
changes," he pointed out.</P>

      <P>New Premier Yu Syi-kun said the top priority
of his Cabinet is to create a administration with global
competitiveness on the basis of a stable society and accomplish the
goal of "building Taiwan strenuously while setting our sights on
venturing into the world."</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks after taking the official seal from his

Adviser to the President Peng Min-ming.</P>
      <P>Yu vowed to accomplish "the historical task" mandated by the
position after taking over as premier Friday from Chang.
Yu, the former top aid to President Chen Shui-bian, lauded Chang
for laying the groundwork for the country's transformation into a
modern country and helping its further development.</P>
      <P>Peng gave a pep talk to Yu and his team at the ceremony,

the hardships due to the international economic slowdown and the
country's first change of political power in history.</P>
      <P>However, Peng said, Chang leaves his post as the country is
beginning to pull out of its economic doldrums, and the victory of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the Dec.1 elections of

      <P>In his farewell speech at the ceremony, Chang expressed his
thanks to President Chen for his full trust and support of his
administration. He also thanked his Cabinet team, saying that many of

      <P>Taiwan is considering sending key
individuals to mainland China to exchange views with the leadership
in Beijing, Premier Yu Shyi-kun of the Republic of China said Friday.
Yu, who was just sworn in Friday also said that Taiwan would
facilitate visits by Beijing leaders should they wish to come to the
ROC.</P>
      <P>At his first news conference after taking office, Yu said that
there are several issues that could be discussed, including
negotiations on the protection of cross-strait investments, the
so-called "mini three links" between two of Taiwan's frontline
islands and mainland China, and the dispute stemming from the 1992
controversy over whether a consensus was reached by the two sides
regarding the "one China" issue.</P>
      <P>"We would welcome official visits to Taiwan by Beijing leaders --
should they wish to make such trips -- and would make all necessary
arrangement for them," Yu said.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu said that peace, safety and stability are the basis of
any development between Taiwan and mainland China, and he regretted
that Beijing has turned a blind eye to the goodwill gestures Taiwan
has made over the past year and a half.</P>
      <P>However, Yu said, his government is glad to see signs that the
Beijing authorities are coming to terms with the fact that the DPP
has the mandate to rule Taiwan.</P>
      <P>However, Mainland Affairs Council Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen was
quick to clarify the premier's remarks, saying that there is no
official policy yet in place regarding sending individuals

      <P>She said that Yu's comments were simply a response to the remarks
made by Chinese Deputy Premier Qian Qichen Jan. 24, when he said that
Beijing welcomed visits to mainland China by all Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) members of Taiwan except those who advocate
Taiwan independence. Qian is in charge of Taiwan affairs for mainland

      <P>Mainland China will challenge Taiwan as
a semiconductor production center, U. S. Trade Representative Robert
Zoellick said Thursday here while giving a speech at a lunch banquet
held by the U.S.-China Business Council.</P>
      <P>As mainland China is expected to become the world's-largest
supplier of information technology hardware in 10 years, mainland
China's recent announcement of its intention to seek free trade
agreements with Southeast Asia and Hong Kong is a natural evolution
of this trend, Zoellick said. He also claimed that the mainland will
soon become the world's second-largest market for personal computers.
Zoellick said that Taiwan companies, the IT powerhouse of the
region, have invested about US$9 billion in assembly and production
plants in the mainland, and added that one-quarter of the world's
desktop computers are already manufactured there along with half of
the world's CD-ROMs.</P>
      <P>The U. S. Trade Representative official attributed the mainland's
spectacular growth in the last 25 years to its progress toward freer

      <P>Taiwan should endeavor to be a center of
innovation and research and the Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) should be the pioneer of the knowledge-based economy
in the country, the institute's president Shih Chin-tai said Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>In a news conference that coincided with the inauguration of
Republic of China's new Cabinet, Shih said that while the Executive
Yuan will focus on the economy, his institute will work toward a
significant leap forward in high-tech development by the year 2008.</P>
      <P>Lin Yu-huan, an ITRI official, said the institute has done much
to attract high-tech talent during recent years, with researchers
with master-degrees accounting for 56 percent of the staff, and those
with doctorates 13 percent.</P>
      <P>The institute has also solicited internationally well-known
experts to serve as advisers at the institute, Lin added.
As the cradle of Taiwan's high technology, the ITRI established
the country's first nanotechnology center last month that involves
the creation and utilization of materials, devices and systems
through the control and manipulation of matter at the nanometer
scale, that is, at the size of atoms, molecules and supramolecular
structures.</P>
      <P>A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter -- about 10,000 times
narrower than a human hair and four times wider than an atom.
Besides, Lin added, ITRI will set up a talent-cultivation center
in the Tainan Science-based Industrial Park in October, and will have
300 researchers by the year 2004 in ITRI's branch in southern Taiwan.</P>

      <P>Kuomintang (KMT) candidate P. K. Chiang was

nail-biting rounds of balloting.</P>
      <P>Chiang's win, with 115 votes against 106 for his Democrative

much-needed boost after it suffered a disastrous defeat in the Dec. 1
elections for lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The KMT saw its seats trimmed in that election from 115 to 68 in
the 225-seat Legislative Yuan.
Chiang led Hong in the first round of balloting, 111 to 108, but
was two ballots shy of the 113 majority which was needed to win in
the first round.</P>
      <P>In the second round, whoever got the most votes won.
The showdown between Chiang and Hong for the mainly ceremonial
post has divided the legislature into two groups, with the KMT and

The almost evenly divided legislature into two political blocs

      <P>A delegation of bishops from the

John Paul II and various Vatican offices on the current state of
Catholic affairs in the Taiwan region.</P>
      <P>Led by Cardinal Paul S.J. Suan of the Archdiocese of Kaohsiung,
nine bishops from dioceses around the island arrived in Vatican City
on Jan. 22 to deliver the report, which is customarily done so once
every five years. The group also attended the multi-faith prayer
gathering in Assisi hosted by the Pope on Jan. 24.</P>
      <P>They briefed the pontiff on the development of each diocese in
Taiwan over the past five years and were told by the Pope in regard
to relations with mainland China that their efforts have promoted
mutual understanding and greater opportunities for dialogue for the
entire Chinese Catholic population.</P>
      <P>Beijing sanctions an official state Catholic Church that does not

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN MERCHANTS ON M'LAND CAN HEAD HOME FOR HOLIDAYS VIA KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China government approved a
tentative arrangement Friday allowing mainland China-based Taiwan
business people to travel directly from the mainland's Xiamen port to
the ROC-held Kinmen island from where they can fly back to Taiwan for
the Chinese New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>Approval was granted by the Bureau of Immigration to a total of
300 Taiwan investors and their relatives to sail aboard a ferry from
Fujian Province's Xiamen port to Kinmen in two groups on Feb. 9 and
10 to return to Taiwan for the holidays.</P>
      <P>The same travelers are scheduled to return to Fujian Province
later in the month by taking similar ferries from Kinmen on Feb. 16,
17 and 24, respectively, allowing them to return to work on the
mainland after the holiday break.</P>
      <P>This marks the first time the ROC government has approved direct
travel of people, rather than goods, across the Taiwan Strait,
following its initiation of the "mini three links" on Jan. 2, 2001
allowing for direct trade, postal and shipping links between the
ROC's outlying islands of Kinmen and Matsu and the mainland port
cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Immigration officials, however, said this is only a
tentative move taken to meet needs during "special periods" of the
year and is not yet a set-in-stone ROC policy pertaining to
cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>The Xiamen-Kinmen-Taiwan trip formula will tentatively be applied
during the Chinese New Year period, as well as during the three other
major traditional Chinese holidays, namely Tomb Sweeping Day, the
Dragon-Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival, Bureau of
Immigration officials said.</P>
      <P>According to officials from the Taiwan Traders' Association in
Fujian, which is sponsoring the first "direct trip" of people across
the Taiwan Strait, the Xiamen-Kinmen-Taiwan sea and air trip will
save roughly NT$10,000 (US$286) for each person per trip. In the
past, a traveler had to spend about NT$16,000 for a one-way trip to
Fujian Province from Taiwan via a "third place," namely Hong Kong or
Macau.</P>
      <P>Sailing from Xiamen port to Kinmen takes about 90 minutes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CIRCULATION OF NT$ 2000-DENOMINATION BILLS WON'T CAUSE INFLATION: CBC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The circulation of NT$2000-denomination bank
notes, slated to begin this July, will not cause inflation nor result
in any abnormalities in Taiwan's financial sector, Central Bank of
China (CBC) Governor Perng Fai-nan said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The CBC is scheduled to formally begin issuing the
NT$2000-denomination bills July 1 to help adjust the structure of
Taiwan's currency. The new bank notes will represent the
largest-denomination bills that the Republic of China government has
ever issued in the Taiwan area.</P>
      <P>Perng said that Taiwan's currency has been controlled well in the
able hands of the CBC and that the island's well-balanced commodity
prices will not be affected by the circulation of the
NT$2000-denomination bills.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan's per capita income has increased fivefold since
the CBC began issuing NT$1000-denomination bank notes in 1980.
According to the standard of the ratio between a nation's
largest-denomination bill and its per capita gross domestic product
(GDP), the NT$1,000 bank note is too low in value to be the
largest-denomination bill in circulation, he noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 2 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator John
Chang said Saturday that the successful collaboration between the KMT
and the opposition People First Party (PFP) in the just-concluded
race for Legislative Yuan president and vice president will have a
direct impact on the year-end Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the power structure of the newly
sworn-in Legislative Yuan, the former vice premier said that Taipei
Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, a KMT stalwart, is favorably placed to seek
re-election with the PFP's support because the two parties were able
to agree on fielding common candidates in Friday's legislative
leadership elections.</P>
      <P>He added that there might also be more room for flexibility in
collaborating to field a common candidate to contest the Kaohsiung
mayorship, a popularly elected post currently held by ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) Chairman Frank Hsieh.</P>
      <P>However, both Chang and PFP Legislator Pang Chien-kuo said it
remains to be seen whether the "pan-blue alliance" -- referring to
the loose alliance between the KMT and its splinter parties, namely
the PFP and the New Party -- will be able to follow the same model to
work together in the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Pang said that he believes the results of Friday's elections have
strengthened the mutual confidence between KMT Chairman Lien Chan and
PFP Chairman James Soong, while President Chen Shui-bian of the DPP
and former President Lee Teng-hui -- the "spiritual leader" of the
Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) -- might now have difficulty forming a
pan-partisan "national stabilization alliance."</P>
      <P>KMT Vice Chairman Wang Jyn-ping won a landslide victory Friday to
be re-elected Legislative Yuan president, and former top government
economic planner P.K. Chiang of the KMT won the vice legislative
presidency by a narrow margin after a hotly contested race against
Hong Chi-chang, a DPP candidate also backed by the TSU.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DEFENSE MINISTER ANNOUNCES TROOPS REDUCTION PLAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Newly sworn-in Minister of Defense Tang
Yao-ming announced Saturday that the military will further trim its
work force from 2004 in line with the government's policy of building
an elite deterrent force.</P>
      <P>Speaking at his first news conference since assuming office
Friday, Tang said the military plans to cut 15,000 troops annually
between 2004 and 2006.</P>
      <P>The three-year troops reduction plan is the second phase of a
military downsizing and modernization package. Former Defense
Minister Wu Shih-wen shelved the plan during his term in office. Tang
announced his decision to revive the plan a day after he succeeded Wu
as the defense chief.</P>
      <P>Tang, who served as chief of the General Staff until Thursday,
said the downsizing package will enter a new stage in 2003, with the
restructuring of military units. "And the Army, Navy and Air Force
general headquarters will complete restructuring in accordance with
the new defense organization law by the end of 2004."</P>
      <P>The three-year troops reduction plan will also get underway that
year, Tang said, adding that the number of Taiwan's armed forces
personnel will be slashed to about 350,000 by 2006 from the current
400,000.</P>
      <P>In implementing the downsizing plan, Tang said, the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) will conduct regular reviews of its possible
impact and make necessary adjustments in terms of mainland China's
military threat, regional security strategy and national defense
resources.</P>
      <P>Tang said cutting the number of service members and upgrading
their combat capabilities as well as modernizing weaponry systems is
the "road that the military must take."</P>
      <P>As for the proposal to replace the current conscription system
with a voluntary military service system, Tang said, the MND has
formed a special task force to study the issue and come up with a
blueprint.</P>
      <P>Turning to his own party membership issue, Tang said he will
never voluntarily renounce his Kuomintang (KMT) membership as he has
deep feelings for the party and defense affairs have little to do
with partisan concerns.</P>
      <P>The opposition KMT has banned its members from joining the
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)-led Cabinet. KMT sources said the
party may suspend Tang's party rights as a penalty.</P>
      <P>Noting that he has been a member of the KMT for more than 40
years, Tang said he is unlikely to willingly withdraw from the party.
"But I would accept any form of punishment handed down by the party,"
he said, adding that as a matter of fact, partisan considerations
have no role in military-related work.</P>
      <P>With Taiwan's democratization, Tang said, its armed forces have
been nationalized. "And neutrality is a basic principle in handling
military affairs," he added.</P>
      <P>According to the ROC Constitution, Tang said, military service
members can freely join any political party or group. Nevertheless,
he said, the constitution also demands that military service members
transcend any regional or partisan concerns in performing their
duties.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, I think that any individual service member's party
affiliation should not be a topic of discussion in the barracks,"
Tang said.</P>
      <P>Touching on the recent large-scale military reshuffle, Tang said
impartiality and transparency have been the top guidelines for
military personnel administration and adjustment.</P>
      <P>In line with the integration of military command and
administration in March, Tang said the military structure will be
adjusted and personnel reshuffled. He made the assurance that any
personnel adjustments will abide by the principles of impartiality
and transparency. "We'll protect the legitimate rights of those whose
jobs will be reassigned," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHIANG'S VICTORY SAID TO SPARE KMT CRISIS OF FURTHER SPLIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The victory of P. K. Chiang in the hotly
contested legislative deputy speakership election will spare the
opposition Kuomintang (KMT) the crisis of further split in the
foreseeable future, local scholars said Saturday.</P>
      <P>Chiang, a veteran former economics official and a freshman
KMT legislator-at large, beat ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) candidate Hong Chi-chang in a runoff vote Friday evening.</P>
      <P>The race was seen the first showdown in the new legislature
between the "pan-blue" camp, which comprises the KMT and its
splinter group -- the People First Party (PFP) -- and the
"pan-green" camp, which refers to the DPP and its ally -- the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU).</P>
      <P>Emile Sheng, a political political Shen Chih-jen, a political
scientist from Soochow University, said Chiang's victory will help
revive the KMT's confidence and morale after the party suffered
embarrassing setbacks in the 2000 presidential election and last
year's legislative elections.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Sheng said, the race has enabled the KMT to
consolidate its ranks and weed out the influence of former
President and KMT Chairman Lee Teng-hui in the party.</P>
      <P>Before the deputy speaker election, Lee had openly thrown support
behind DPP's Hong in an attempt to sway "pro-localization" KMT
lawmakers. But the voting results indicated that almost no KMT
legislators "defected" to vote for Hong.</P>
      <P>In his view, Sheng said, Chiang's win marked an end of Lee's
influence in the KMT.</P>
      <P>Sheng further said the KMT has succeeded in using the race to
"screen out" disloyal members. "And following Chiang's victory, the
KMT has defused the crisis of further split in its ranks," Sheng
noted.</P>
      <P>Yang Tai-shun, chairman of Chinese Culture University's
Political Science Department, echoed Sheng's view, saying that the
deputy speaker election marks a significant victory for the KMT in
its struggle for reviving its past glory and political clout.</P>
      <P>The KMT lost its decades-old control of the legislature in last
December's elections. It commands only 68 seats in the 225-member
Fifth Legislative Yuan inaugurated Friday. With the support of the
PFP, which controls 45 seats, and several independent lawmakers,
Chiang managed to claim the deputy speaker post.</P>
      <P>Although the DPP controls 87 seats in the new legislature, it
still lacks a clear majority. Both Sheng and Yang said they believe
that the "pan-blue" and the "pan-green" standoff will continue in
Taiwan's political arenas in the run-up to the next presidential
election.</P>
      <P>Sheng and Yang also said that the KMT and the PFP should be able
to draw inspiration from the victory of Friday's deputy speaker
election.</P>
      <P>"And whether the two opposition parties can cooperate in the
year-end mayoral elections for Taiwan's two largest municipalities
-- Taipei and Kaohsiung -- will be a litmus test for the possibility
of their cooperation in the 2004 presidential election," Sheng
predicted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Sheng attributed the DDP's defeat in the deputy
speakership election mainly to its excessive self-confidence
and misjudgment of the domestic political situation.</P>
      <P>The DPP didn't field its own candidate for the speaker election
and lent full support for the re-election bid of incumbent speaker
Wang Jin-pyng, a KMT vice chairman. As a result, Wang won
re-election with a landslide.</P>
      <P>The DPP originally expected that its support for Wang would
prompt "pro-localization" KMT lawmakers' support for Hong in the
deputy speaker election. However, such a scenario didn't
materialize.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (OCAC)
Chairwoman Chang Fu-mei Saturday criticized mainland Chinese Vice
Premier Qian Qichen for attempting to "sow discord" among members of
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Qian recently stated that the vast majority of DPP members are
welcome to visit mainland China, except for the small number of
diehards who insist on Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>Chang said on a local radio program that Beijing was apparently
trying to intentionally create an ambiguous situation to serve its
own ends.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she admitted that Beijing has progressed a little
by allowing DPP members to visit the mainland since in the past it
had consistently refused to have contact with the DPP.</P>
      <P>The OCAC chief went on to say that over the past few years,
mainland China has stepped up its work in opposing Taiwan
independence, while promoting unification between the mainland and

      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng said Saturday that Friday's
legislative deputy speaker election indicates that the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) remains a minority force in the
new legislature.</P>
      <P>With the cooperation of the KMT and its splinter group -- the
People First Party (PFP) --, KMT candidate P. K. Chiang managed to
defeat his DPP rival Hong Chi-chang to win the deputy speaker post.</P>
      <P>Lin said Chiang's victory betrays that the KMT and the PFP,
which jointly control 113 seats in the 225-member Fifth Legislative
Yuan, which was sworn in Friday, remain dominating force in the
legislature.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the DPP will respect the majority force in the
legislature and increase communication and consultation with the
opposition parties in formulating major policies in order to ensure
the chamber's smooth operation," Lin said. "The DPP should not
adopt any high-handed tactics in pushing through major bills."</P>
      <P>The DPP managed to emerge as the largest party in the
legislature elected Dec. 1, 2001 by winning 87 seats. Even with the
support of its ally -- the Taiwan Solidarity Union which controls 13
seats -- the DPP still lacks a clear majority. As a result, its
candidate Hong lost to Chiang, a veteran trade and economic
technocrat and freshman legislator-at large, with a vote of
106-115.</P>
      <P>Encouraged by the latest electoral victory, Lin said the
KMT and the PFP will continue pooling their resources to cope with
the year-end Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>PFP Secretary-General Chung Jung-chi echoed Lin's view, saying
that Friday's election indicates that the two parties will stand a
good chance to win a major political election so long as they can
cooperate closely.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSH URGED TO GAIN ASSURANCES OF ADDRESSING CHINESE PEOPLE DIRECTLY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  1  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Commission on International
Religious Freedom has urged the U.S. president to gain assurances
from Beijing that he will have the chance during his upcoming visit
to deliver a speech on human rights and freedoms directly to the
Chinese people via a live and uncensored broadcast.</P>
      <P>In a letter Thursday to President George W. Bush, Michael K.
Young, chair of the commission, also recommended that Bush continue
to raise concerns about religious freedom in mainland China directly
with President Jiang Zemin, "as you began during your discussions in
Shanghai last October."</P>
      <P>Young pointed out that serious violations of the right to freedom
of religion and belief in mainland China have been well documented by
his commission, the U.S. State Department, as well as by religious
and other non-governmental organizations.</P>
      <P>He noted that in October 2001, the U.S. Secretary of State for
the third straight year concluded that the Beijing regime severely
and systematically violates freedom of religion and belief, and named
mainland China as a "country of particular concern" under the
International Religious Freedom Act.</P>
      <P>"An important aspect of promoting religious freedom in China,
along with other human rights, is for representatives of the United
States to inform the Chinese people why the U.S. government is
concerned about human rights practices in their country," he wrote.</P>
      <P>President Ronald Reagan gave an address to Russian students at
Moscow State University during his state visit to the former Soviet
Union in 1988 in which he described in detail the commitment of
Americans to democracy, economic freedom, and the freedoms of
assembly, speech, the press and religion.</P>
      <P>"The commission urges you to follow this precedent and address
the Chinese people directly in a similar fashion to express why the
U.S. government, on behalf of the American people, is concerned with
violations of internationally recognized human rights, including
religious freedom, and why it is U.S. policy to oppose such
violations anywhere in the world, and not just in China," Young wrote
to Bush.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HONG KONG HAS NO PLANS TO CHANGE LINKED EXCHANGE RATE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hong  Kong,  Feb. 2(CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Hong Kong government has no plans of
changing the exchange rate mechanism whereby the Hong Kong dollar is
linked to the U.S. dollar, Financial Secretary Antony Leuang
reiterated in a government announcement released Saturday.</P>
      <P>Leung, who is now in New York attending the World Economic Forum,
said changing the present exchange rate system is not an option for
Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a dinner held by the forum in New York on the evening
of Feb. 1, Leung noted that some people have suggested that the link
be abolished to solve the problem of deflation, which has been part
of the painful process of economic restructuring, now affecting Hong
Kong, saying that these individuals even cited Argentina as an
example to support their argument.</P>
      <P>He reportedly countered these suggestions by saying that "as the
chief executive and I have said many times before, the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region Government has no plan, nor does it
intend, to change the linked exchange rate."</P>
      <P>"The basic point here is that our financial and economic systems
would not be able to withstand the tremendous shock created by the
possible massive outflow of capital if the linked exchange rate were
to go," he added.</P>
      <P>"Hong Kong is markedly different from Argentina. We do not have
any external debt. We have a sizable foreign exchange reserve of over
US$100 billion," he pointed out.</P>
      <P>However, he noted that Hong Kong should learn a lesson from
Argentina and not perpetuate the problem of fiscal deficits.</P>
      <P>Leung pointed out that Hong Kong has been facing the problem of
ongoing deficits for several years and that as financial secretary,
he has had the responsibility of bringing the budget back into
balance within a reasonable period of time.</P>
      <P>He added that he has currently been focusing on controlling
government expenditures.

    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan female backpacker who was suspected
of being raped and murdered in Sanliurfa, eastern Turkey five days
ago, was buried Saturday in Adana where her body was kept for autopsy
after being found.</P>
      <P>At Liu Chieh-ying's funeral were her father, Liu Chun-shung, and
mother from Taiwan, officials from the Taiwan representative office
to Turkey, Turkish officials, and workers of the Taiwan charity
Tzu Chi Foundation.</P>
      <P>Although Liu's father said she was a Buddhist, the funeral
financed by the local government was held in the Islamic style as
most Turks are Moslems. The local government also provided a place
for internment and promised to do their best to help bring her
remains back to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Liu's parents, who flew in from Taiwan Saturday afternoon,
resigned themselves to laying their daughter to rest in a country
thousands of miles away from her homeland after learning that there
is no crematorium in Adana and to airlift Liu's body back to Taiwan
would entail enormous red tape and cost.</P>
      <P>Liu Chun-shung and his wife are scheduled to fly back to Taiwan
on Feb. 4.</P>
      <P>Liu Chieh-ying, 27, arrived in Turkey alone for a trip in the
middle of January. She lodged in a cheap hotel in Sanliurfa Jan. 27.
Her landlord called police Jan. 29 to force their way into her room
after she was reported to have not left her room for two days.</P>
      <P>The police found her scantily-clad body on the bed with her limbs
tied to the four legs of the bed.</P>
      <P>A waiter at the hotel confessed that he killed Liu to steal her
belongings but police suspected that Liu was sexual assaulted before
being killed and more accomplices were involved in the case.</P>
      <P>Located about 1,000 kilometers southeast of Ankara, Sanliurfa is
a small town of Kurds and foreigners are rarely seen there.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  1 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun reaffirmed Sunday that
his new Cabinet would focus on enhancing technological development,
but not at the expense of enriching the cultural heritage of those on
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while visiting Taiho village, Tungshan
township, Ilan County, Sunday to pay his respects to his ancestor's
family shrine and stop at nearby temples.</P>
      <P>Yu mentioned President Chen Shui-bian's ideal of turning Taiwan
into a "green silicon island" and said that his Cabinet will focus on
technology development, but also stressed the importance of cultural
preservation.</P>
      <P>Yu, a self-made man whose reputation was built around his two
terms as county magistrate of Ilan County, has prided himself on
promoting cultural activities during his stint as the county chief.</P>
      <P>He said that only through technology and cultural enhancement can
the nation retain its competitive edge and effectively upgrade the
quality of life.</P>
      <P>Asked about whether the Cabinet will reconsider a revised law
governing the allocation of government revenues, which was railroaded
through the last legislature in mid-January, Yu said that the matter
is now being handled by Lin Chuang, director-general of the
Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and the
Executive Yuan will make its decision soon.</P>
      <P>The revision, initiated by the Kuomintang (KMT) and supported by
the People First Party (PFP), will force the central government to
give a larger portion of its revenue to local governments.</P>
      <P>Prior to the revision, the central government was required to
give 40 percent of the government's transaction tax revenue, 10
percent of the income tax revenue and 10 percent of the excise duty
to the nation's local governments, including the two special
municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Under the revised law, the percentage of revenues to be earmarked
for local governments will increase to 50 percent of the transaction
tax, 30 percent of the income tax and 30 percent of excise duty.</P>
      <P>According to the government's forecast, this could see the money
disbursed to the local governments increase by between NT$150 billion
and NT$310 billion, which would make an enormous dent in the central
government's coffers.</P>
      <P>The revised law also advocates changes to the way the money is
split among the local governments, with 15.5 percent going to Taipei
City, 10 percent going to Kaohsiung City, 61.5 percent going to other
counties and 7 percent going to townships.</P>
      <P>The KMT initiated the changes at the request of Taipei City Mayor
Ma Ying-jeou, who has seen the city's share of the central
government's revenue decrease year by year, especially after the
inauguration of President Chen, who was ousted from Taipei City Hall
by Ma in the 1998 mayoral election.</P>
      <P>Although the Executive Yuan said the reduction is necessary to
reverse the long-standing financial imbalance between Taipei City and
other countries in Taiwan, the opposition said it is a political
reprisal against Ma, who is the highest-ranking elected official in
the KMT and who holds promise to be the party's hope for winning back
the presidency in the future.</P>

tiny wind bell from Japan, which is about the size of a thumb.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the bureau also erected a 13-meter landmark

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The annual Huachiang geese-watching season
in Taipei formally opened Sunday with thousands of bird-watchers
gathered under the Huachiang Bridge in Taipei.</P>
      <P>With the aid of members of the Wild Bird Society in Taipei City,
people used binoculars and tried to identified the different species
according to illustrated guidebooks.</P>
      <P>Most the geese that descended Sunday on banks of the Tamsui
River, which runs through Taipei City, are small geese, numbered at
about 5,000, a few sponge-billed geese and geese of other
species could also be seen.</P>
      <P>The geese stop in Taiwan on their migration north in the spring,
and will keep flying to the island's marshes until late April --
marking the end of the Huachiang geese-watching season.</P>
      <P>Before then, the Wild Bird Society of Taipei City will sent
members to the river banks under the Huachiang Bridge every weekend
to give guidance to those wanting to learn more about the birds.</P>
      <P>The society said in a statement that the number of geese living
in the geese sanctuary on the Tamsui River banks between Youngfu
Bridge and Chunghsing Bridge has leveled off to between 4,700 to
7,000, thanks to the government's conservation policy.</P>
      <P>However, the number of migratory geese stopping in Taiwan on
their way north or south fell by almost half this year, possibly
because of global warming, the statement said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MASTER SHENG YEN SPEAKS AT WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Feb.  2  (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Buddhist Master Sheng Yen delivered a
speech Friday at the 32nd annual meeting of the World Economic Forum
(WEF) in New York and urged tolerance and respect in a multicultural,
pluralistic world to achieve true peace and lasting security.</P>
      <P>Addressing a dinner banquet, Sheng Yen said the notion of
"sacred" varies according to different people, geographic
environments and eras. He stressed, however, that there is only one
supreme truth -- that people should seek "common ground" to mend
their differences.</P>
      <P>"Today, in order to resolve the dangers of conflicts and avoid
annihilation, we need to preserve and respect the values of different
races; other than our own self-centered values, we need to be
tolerant of the values held dear by others too," Sheng Yen said.</P>
      <P>Maintaining that technology research and progress is far more
than just an adventure of mankind's curiosity, Sheng Yen said the
development of the biotechnology sector must take into account human
ethics. He also called for the establishment of a global mechanism to
monitor, supervise and assist the development of biotechnology
related to cloning of human organs or human beings.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a meeting of religious leaders earlier the same day,
the Buddhist master called for a spiritual, ritual and
environmental-friendly life. He stressed that a poor heart is the
root problem of modern society.</P>
      <P>"We should understand that poverty and ignorance are often
interrelated. Because of poverty, it becomes difficult to access
modern, pluralistic and global information. This may then lead to the
isolation of cultures and ways of thinking, and result in
discrimination against, belittling and rejecting whoever is
different," he said.</P>
      <P>As poverty may lead to crime, Sheng Yen said, "We should upgrade
moral and religious education ... and we should make donations to
poor people and exercise the power of love in the world" to help wipe
out poverty.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen also called for providing economic aid, cultural
exchanges and improving educational facilities for the so-called
"fundamentalists" to give them access as a means of eradicating any
forms of "fundamentalism."</P>
      <P>"Military retaliation might have a temporary deterrent effect,
but if a lasting peace is hoped for, we must follow these steps with
love and patience," he suggested.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen, the founder and chief of the Taipei-based Dharma Drum
Mountain Buddhist Association, was the first Buddhist religious
leader ever invited to attend the WEF annual conference. More than
3,000 business, academic and religious leaders from across the world
are taking part in this year's gathering, which opened Jan. 31 and
will run through Feb. 4.</P>
      <P>It was also the first time that the WEF annual conference is
being held outside the organization's founding city -- Davos,
Switzerland. The choice of New York was made as a gesture of support
for the city, which was attacked by suicide terrorists Sept. 11 last
year.</P>
      <P>Sheng Yen left New York Feb. 2 and is slated to return to Taipei
Feb. 4.</P>

      <P>The Taipei District Court has decided to
immediately release former Legislator Lo Fu-chu after finding that
the detention by the prosecutor's office of Lo by force did not
follow legal procedures, a court official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Lo, who lost his legislative protection last Friday, was detained
by force by law enforcement officials Friday afternoon due to his
alleged involvement in fraud, destroying evidence and since officers
felt that he was a flight risk.</P>
      <P>Lo did not reply to questions since he felt that he had been
wrongly detained. Prosecutors appealed to the court to formally
detain Lo.</P>
      <P>A joint court comprising three judges decided to release Lo
immediately after a two-hour debate.</P>
      <P>Lo told local media after his release that he appreciated the
court judges decision which permitted him to explain his side of the
story. He stressed that he still has faith in the judicial system and
promised that he was willing to attend any court investigation.</P>
      <P>Lo refused to answer any direct questions, but only said that he
was under a great deal of pressure.</P>
      <P>A prosecutor at the prosecutor's office of the Taiwan High Court
said further appeals will be made to bring Lo into custody.</P>
      <P>The prosecutor said his office is also worried about the safety

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  3  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
said Sunday he is willing to visit mainland China in his capacity as
the head of Taiwan's highest representative body of public opinion if
permitted by President Chen Shui-bian and four preconditions can be
guaranteed.</P>
      <P>Wang, who was re-elected recently the speaker of the Legislative
Yuan, made the announcement while giving a keynote speech on
parliamentary reform and improved Taiwan-mainland ties.</P>
      <P>Wang said he is willing to travel to mainland China for
discussions on issues of mutual concern for people in both Taiwan and
mainland China should President Chen allow him to do so and the four
prerequisites -- national needs, public consent, parliamentary
approval and reciprocity -- be respected.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, he will also form a new and non-partisan
cross-Taiwan Strait task force at the fifth legislature, which opened
Feb. 1, to help the government's executive branch forge better ties
with mainland China.</P>
      <P>As communication channels between Taiwan and mainland China
through the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and the
Beijing-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait
(ARATS) remained deadlocked, Wang said the resumption of cross-strait
dialogue is vital to improved bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Systemic SEF-ARATS negotiations were unilaterally suspend by
Beijing in 1996 after former President Lee Teng-hui paid an
unofficial visit to the United States in 1995, which Beijing viewed
as a covert move to promote Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The semi-official SEF and ARATS are authorized by Taipei and
Beijing, respectively, to deal with two-way exchanges in the absence
of government-to-government contacts between the two sides.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MANY FOREIGN WORKERS IN TAIPEI TEST POSITIVE FOR PARASITIC DISEASES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Nearly 1,400 foreign laborers in Taipei were
found during 2001 to be carriers of parasitic diseases and thus
potential threats in terms of spreading their disease in their place
of employment, according to the Taipei City Government's Bureau of
Health.</P>
      <P>According to the bureau, a total of 1,370 foreign helpers, most
of whom work as domestic helpers in private households or at nursing
homes, tested positive during health checks last year as carriers of
intestinal parasitic diseases -- a threat to household sanitation and
people's health.</P>
      <P>The bureau conducted health checks on more than 50,000 foreign
laborers in Taipei during 2001. Of the total, more than 1,400 people,
or 2.76 percent, were found to not meet the standards in terms of
health and medical considerations.</P>
      <P>A high of 92.6 percent of those who did not meet the standards,
or a total of 1,370 helpers, tested positive for intestinal parasitic
diseases, bureau officials said, adding that this signifies that
1,370 households or nursing homes are under the threat of being
infected by related diseases through the presence of these helpers.</P>
      <P>Lu Hui-chen, director of the Bureau of Health, called for private
households which employ foreign domestic helpers to pay special
attention to their employees.</P>
      <P>She emphasized that the foreign helpers should be encouraged to
stringently maintain a high level of personal sanitation, including
the habits of frequently washing their hands and of being extra
careful when preparing food.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, all foreign laborers from overseas receive
regular health checks in Taipei -- once every six months -- to help
monitor their health condition. If any are found to be carriers of
serious contagious diseases or fatal diseases, such as AIDS, they are
forcefully repatriated.</P>
      <P>Intestinal parasitic disease patients, however, are not forced to
leave the country as the disease is not an internationally declared
disease, Lu said, adding that carriers can continue to work in Taiwan
as long as they continue to receive medical treatment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>AUTHORITIES PONDERING CONSCRIPT ALTERNATIVES FOR SPORTS TALENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Officials from the Ministry of the Interior
(MOI) are pondering special alternative conscript programs to allow
talented athletes approaching the age of 20 not to discontinue their
sports training because of Taiwan's compulsory two-year military
service.</P>
      <P>MOI officials are now discussing with their counterparts from the
Ministry of National Defense and the Cabinet-level National Council
on Physical Fitness and Sports (NCPFS) about the feasibility of
allowing the young gifted athletes to perform their compulsory
military service as replacements who are only required to serve for
35 days, or possibly allowing them to serve two-year alternative
programs in non-military fields, such as serving as sports
instructors in schools or community centers.</P>
      <P>As of today, the only athletes approaching the age of 20 who have
been allowed to perform the 35-day "replacement" service have been
those who are athletes on national teams or who have won medals at
international meets. So far, approval to perform the "replacement"
service has only been granted to 14 such athletes.</P>
      <P>As the great majority of athletes in Taiwan are unable to meet
this standard, they are forced at the age of 20 to perform the
regular compulsory military service -- thus resulting in the
discontinuation of their sports training for at least two years.</P>
      <P>Since the new Interior Minister Yu Cheng-hsien, who previously
served as Kaohsiung County magistrate and was known for his love of
sports and his fervent support for athletic activities, took office
Feb. 1, the MOI has begun pushing for the implementation of the
alternative military service policy for gifted athletes to allow them
to continue their training uninterrupted and maintain their high
level of performance even while they perform their mandatory military
service duties.</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Industrialists attending a symposium Monday
on challenges and changes facing Taiwan's hi-tech industries stressed
the importance of the government setting up a certification standard
applicable to locally-made as well as imported products.</P>
      <P>Shen Yen-shih, chairman of the Apex Biotechnology Corp., said
that Taiwan manufacturers will face fiercer competition from
international corporations since Taiwan has become a member of the
World Trade Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>While intellectual property and patent rights will be of great
importance to competitiveness, Shen suggested that local
manufacturers should have long-term research plans and develop their
own patent products.</P>
      <P>Hu Ting-hua, chairman of the chipset supplier Macronix
International Co., said that local manufacturers in general were weak
in acquiring intellectual property rights and developing their own
brands.</P>
      <P>Foreseeing that mainland China will eventually become a low-cost
manufacturing hub of the semiconductor sector, Hu said that Taiwan
needs to find new niches based on the existing advantages of strong
design capabilities and its ability to raise capital.</P>
      <P>In the telecommunications sector, Liu Chao-kai, general manager
of Tecom Co., said that telecommunications technologies have advanced
remarkably in the past five years. On the other hand, profit margins
of the manufacturers have been declining.</P>
      <P>To maintain competitiveness, Liu said that a manufacturer should
keep operations economical and emphasize research and development as
well as marketing.</P>
      <P>Liu Yung-sheng, director of the Industrial Technology Research
Institute's Opto-electronics and Systems Laboratories, said that
Taiwan has become an important supplier of such opto-electronic
products as optical storage equipment and panels, with the production
value amounting to NT$400 billion a year.</P>
      <P>He said that innovation and patent rights are vital for local
manufacturers to improve their international competitiveness. Liu
called on local manufacturers to form an alliance on patent rights.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the China External Trade Development Council may help
Taiwan manufacturers to promote the image of Taiwan products in the
international market, he added.</P>

      <P>ROC Representative to Macau Tsai
Chih-chung kept mum Monday on the opening of an office in Macau by
Beijing's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits
(ARATS), a quasi-official body authorized to handle talks with
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We have heard of the ARATS plan to open an office in Macau. As
we remain unaware of its purposes, we should refrain from making any
speculative comments on the ARATS move," said Tsai, head of the
Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in Macau.</P>
      <P>According to customary practices, Tsai said, the ARATS' Taiwan
counterpart is the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).
"If the new ARATS' Macau office intends to deal with Taiwan-related
affairs in the future, it will have to contact the SEF headquarters
in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Liu Gangqi, the mainland Chinese official in charge of Taiwan
affairs at Beijing's liaison office in Macau, announced Sunday that
ARATS would open an office in Macau Monday.</P>
      <P>In his announcement, Liu said, the opening of an ARATS office in
Macau signifies the former Portuguese colony's importance as a
conduit for exchanges across the Taiwan Strait. Liu further said the
new office will work closely with ARATS headquarters in facilitating
cross-strait interchanges.</P>
      <P>Local sources said the Beijing liaison office in Macau didn't
send any invitation to the Taipei representative office to attend the
opening ceremony for the new ARATS office.</P>
      <P>Beijing has unilaterally suspended regular cross-strait dialogue

    <HEADLINE>1ST MAINALND CHINESE TOUR GROUP ARRIVING TUESDAY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 15-member tour group of mainland Chinese
nationals residing in Japan is scheduled to arrive in Taipei Tuesday
for a four-day sightseeing trip, a spokesman for International Tour
Operations (ITO) said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It will be the first mainland tour group to visit Taiwan since
the Republic of China government opened the door for overseas
mainland citizens to make group tours of the island at the beginning
of this year.</P>
      <P>ITO Vice President Lee Ta-wen said most of the members of the
group are leaders of major mainland Chinese organizations in the
Osaka and Kobe areas and that some of them operate travel agencies.</P>
      <P>"All of the members are male and mostly in their 60s or 70s," the
spokesman said," Lee said. "In addition to sightseeing, some of the
members intend to survey the tourist market here."</P>
      <P>During their stay, the group will visit popular northern Taiwan
tourist attractions, including the National Palace Museum, the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Keelung, Wulai and Chiufen as well as major
tourist hotels and restaurants in the region.</P>
      <P>ITO, the local travel agency which organizes the tour
package for the mainland group, said the group has demanded
high-quality room and catering services. The group will stay at the
five-star Taipei Westin Hotel.</P>
      <P>Among the members is Lin Tung-chun, a 77-year-old mainland
Chinese resident in Kobe. He was quoted as having told Taiwan
journalists stationed in Japan that he was very excited to be able
to visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is so close to Kobe, but I have waited for nearly 50
years to enter the island," Lin said. He moved from mainland
China's Fujian province to the southwestern Japanese port
city of Kobe when he was nine years old. In 1959, he made a
transit stop at a Taiwan international airport on his way to Europe.
As he held a mainland passport, he was banned from enter Taiwan at
that time.</P>
      <P>Lin, who is now honorary chairman of the largest mainland Chinese
association in Kobe, said he most yearns to visit Taipei's Sun
Yat-sen Memorial Hall during his stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As overseas mainland Chinese people are only allowed to make
group tours of Taiwan, ITO executives said they don't leave any free
time for individual members.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to boost exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait, Taiwan began Jan. 1 to allow mainland Chinese citizens with
permanent foreign residency or mainland students studying abroad to
make pleasure trips to the island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei Association of Travel Agents (TATA) said
the second mainland tour group may arrive after the Chinese New
Year, which falls on Feb. 12 this year.</P>
      <P>Tourist sources said scores of mainland Chinese residents in San
Francisco have expressed interest in joining a Taiwan-mainland China
tour package organized by a travel agency there.</P>

      <P>He noted that during the last 483 days when he was in office,

    <TEXT>
      <P>The main opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
announced Monday it has decided to suspend all "party rights" to four
of its members who have joined the new Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP)-led Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Chen Keng-chin, head of the KMT's party disciplinary committee,
said the four members to have their party rights suspended are
Minister of National Defense Tang Yao-ming, Veteran Affairs
Commission Chairman Yang Teh-chih, National Coast Guard
Administration Administrator Wang Chun and Minister without Portfolio
Tsai Ching-yen.</P>
      <P>Chen said the four members have violated the party mandate which
says that its members cannot serve in the new DPP Cabinet. This, the
party elders have said, is to enhance political accountability and
strengthen party politics in Taiwan's young democracy.</P>
      <P>"As the four members have expressed their deep feelings for the
KMT and promised to abide by the principles of administrative
neutrality in their work and to refrain from doing anything harmful
to the KMT, we have decided to give them a more lenient penalty,"
Chen explained.</P>
      <P>Instead of expelling them from the party, Chen said, the KMT will
only suspend their rights as members during their terms of office as
punishment.</P>
      <P>Chen stressed that the KMT ban was mainly aimed at promoting
healthy development of Taiwan's fledgling democracy through upgrading
political accountability.</P>
      <P>Chen said the party will decide how to discipline its members
serving as vice ministers or deputy agency heads in the new Cabinet
after the Chinese New Year, which falls on Feb. 12 this year.</P>

      <P>That means the country will no longer be able to prohibit the
import of mainland textiles, while the protective measure that
stipulates that textiles aimed for the domestic market must be made
with home-supplied materials will be done away with.</P>
      <P>As a result, textile manufacturers catering to the domestic
market may turn to mainland suppliers for their materials, dealing a
hard blow to local producers of yarn, cloth and other fibers, which
constitute a market of NT$4.94 billion (US$141.14 million) per year.</P>
      <P>To cushion the impact, the federation recommended that the
government help local manufacturers to develop overseas markets more
aggressively, and that the textile manufacturing process be divided
between the mainland and Taiwan to make best use of each side's
advantages, such as Taiwan's well-developed synthetic fiber
manufacturing industry and the mainland's cheap labor that is suited
to garment processing.</P>
      <P>The report admitted, however, that such a division of labor would
be impossible without direct trade and transportation links across
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's labor-intensive dyeing and finishing industry is most
vulnerable to mainland competition and will therefore urgently need
to transfer some of its operations to the mainland unless the
government allows manufacturers to hire more foreign laborers or lets
conscripts work in the industry as an alternative to military
service, according to the report.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY SHOULD VALUE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY: EXPERTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,   northern  Taiwan,  Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's high-tech
industry should place greater importance on developing its own ideas
rather than relying on foreign technology, experts and industry
leaders said Monday.</P>
      <P>At a seminar on the new challenges and opportunities for the
local high-tech industry with the island's World Trade Organization
accession, Macronix International Chairman Hu Ding-hua said that
Taiwan remains weak in marketing its own brand-name products and
accumulating its own intellectual property.</P>
      <P>Hu said that Taiwan could take the path of establishing design
centers for new and value-added high-tech products, as mainland China
is expected to replace the island as a low-cost manufacturing center
for such products in the future.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Apex Biotechnology Corp. Chairman Thomas Y. Shen urged
biotechnology research institutions to value local talent and local
patents, adding that Taiwan biotech companies must establish their
own design teams instead of just buying available technology.</P>
      <P>Liu Jung-sheng, head of the Opto-Electronics and Systems
Laboratories under the Industrial Technology Research Institute,
pointed out that although Taiwan's global CD-R market share is over
80 percent, the island receives only approximately 30 percent of the
global share of related patent licensing fees.</P>
      <P>Liu recommended that Taiwan companies should consider
establishing a "patent strategic alliance" and should attach higher
value to patents if they want to avoid becoming victims of global
competition.</P>
      <P>The seminar, organized by the China External Trade Development
Council, took place at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park,
which is home to approximately 300 local high-tech companies.</P>

      <P>An official of the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said Monday that the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) has no plans to set up an office in Macau.</P>
      <P>However, the official stressed that the MAC is willing to
exchange views with the Beijing authorities over the setting up of
such an office.</P>
      <P>The MAC official made the remarks on the same day that a Macau
Office of the Association for Relations Across Taiwan Strait (ARATS)
became operational Monday. The SEF and ARATS are quasi-official
bodies set up by Taipei and Beijing, respectively, to handle
cross-strait exchanges in the absence of official ties between the
two sides.</P>
      <P>The MAC, the nation's policy-making body on mainland Chinese
affairs, said that while the opening of the ARATS office in Macau is
important, it is a mainland internal affair.</P>
      <P>The official pointed out that Taiwan has an office in Macau to
deal with issues related to Taiwan-Macau exchanges and that its

      <P>The Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) is
planning to release 66 percent of its shares within a year, in
conjunction with the program to privatize state-run enterprises, a

      <P>CPC Board Chairman Chen Chao-wei pointed out, however, that the

      <P>Lin Wen-yen, vice chairman of the Commission of National

    <HEADLINE>MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION OF REVENUE LAW IS LAST RESORT: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan will ask the legislature
to reconsider the newly revised Law Governing the Allocation of
Government Revenues and Expenditures only as a last resort, Premier
Yu Shyi-kun said Monday.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from journalists while inspecting the Ministry
of the Interior, the premier, who was only sworn in on Friday, said
he will leave no stone unturned in his efforts to solve the problems
caused by the revised law. He added that a motion for the legislature
to reconsider the revision is the last thing he wants to see.</P>
      <P>Any motion for reconsideration of any measures should be put
forward within seven days of legislative approval, which in this case
means Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Yu said his administration would prefer to sort out its
differences with the opposition through amicable communications.</P>
      <P>The revised law railroaded through the opposition-controlled
legislature on the final day of the last legislature obliges the
administration to hand over a larger proportion of central government
revenues to local governments, which the central government says will
cause a financial gap of NT$150 billion (US$4.28 billion) in its
budget.</P>
      <P>Besides, the premier went on, the revised rules will deprive his
administration of the power to ensure that revenue distributed to
local government is used for the purposes for which it is allocated.</P>
      <P>Instead of "giving a bigger slice of the pie" to local
government, as claimed by its sponsors, Yu said, the revised law is
"robbing Peter to pay Paul."</P>
      <P>Yu said he is weighing various options available to his
administration and will try to find a way around the problem without
causing a confrontation between the executive and legislative
branches.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- which mastermind
the revision -- stuck to its guns Monday, with KMT Chairman Lien Chan
saying that the revision is a result of "careful studies by his
party" that has won the support of the majority in the legislature
and that there is no question of the KMT backing down on the issue.</P>
      <P>KMT Legislative Whip Lin Yi-shih urged the Executive Yuan to drop
the option of reconsideration, saying it will pit the ruling party
against the opposition again in the legislature and therefore stir up
political unrest.</P>
      <P>The legislature will be forced to act on the motion for
reconsideration within seven days if it is put forward by the
Executive Yuan, or the revision will automatically lapse.</P>
      <P>However, if the legislature upholds the revision with a simple
majority vote, the Executive Yuan will be pushed to the brink of
either accepting the setback or asking the president to dissolve the
legislature and order a snap election.</P>

(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Department of Health (DOH) has agreed
that the controversial mental sanitarium Lung Fa Temple can be
legalized and allowed to receive "less seriously" mentally challenged
patients, DOH officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The Lung Fa Temple, established 31 years ago in Kaohsiung,
southern Taiwan, has aroused controversy over the years with its
so-called religious and folk therapies for the mentally ill.</P>
      <P>For many years, patients and their families have complained about
the temple's inhumane treatment that includes shackling patients and
forcing them to work outside bareheaded in conditions more
reminiscent of a labor camp.</P>
      <P>However, temple officials claim that "some patients" have
completely recovered after the "treatment" offered, which they said
uses no medicine and is free of charge.</P>
      <P>According to the officials, the "miracles" achieved by the temple
have drawn much attention around the world and many invitations have
been issued to the founder of the temple, Master Shih Kai-feng,
inviting him to introduce another so-called "Taiwan experience."</P>
      <P>In 1997, Stanford University of the United States invited Shih to
give a lecture about the psychological rehabilitation of the
chronically mentally challenged and to visit some psychiatric and
psychological sanitariums nearby to meet various experts.</P>
      <P>A band made up of temple patients has visited many Asian
countries, including mainland China, during recent years and their
performances have been highly acclaimed.</P>
      <P>However, the temple had no links with sanitary or medical
institutions until 2000, when Shih finally agreed to let qualified
doctors offer treatment at the temple.</P>
      <P>Tan Kai-yuan, the director of the DOH Bureau of Medical Affairs,
said that since the DOH has agreed to allow the temple to receive
only less seriously ill patients, the government and social welfare
agencies must take over the treatment of the temple's seriously ill
patients.</P>
      <P>The temple has more than 600 patients.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ASTROPHYSICIST STEPS INTO FATHER'S SHOES AT LOCAL UNIVERSITY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   4   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Frank H. Shu, a world-renowned
astrophysicist stepped into his father's shoes Monday when he took
over as president of National Tsinghua University of the Republic of
China.</P>
      <P>Shu's father, Shu Hsien-shiu, served as president of the
prestigious university three decades ago. Another coincidence is that
both of them were 58 years old when they took their positions at the
prestigious school.</P>
      <P>Shu, took over the seal from retiring President Liu Chung-lang,
in a ceremony held at the university in northern Taiwan. Witnessing
the ceremony were various education officials, former Tsinghua
University President Liu Chao-shiuan and National Chiao Tung
University President Chang Chu-yen.</P>
      <P>Shu, who was born in the mainland Chinese city of Kunming, stayed
in Taiwan for only one year before emigrating to the United States at
the age of six. Accordingly, he had to read a romanized version of
his acceptance vow before changing to English to deliver his
acceptance speech.</P>
      <P>Shu recalled that "when his father was in Taiwan, the biggest
problem was the brain drain to the United States." Nowadays, he went
on, young students are less inclined to go abroad for advanced
degrees.</P>
      <P>Envisioning Tsinghua as a first-class research university, Shu
said the university wishes "to attract the best scholars from
overseas to Taiwan, as well as growing them at home."</P>
      <P>Shu admitted that he grew up mainly in the United States and had
limited knowledge of Chinese. Although he has often returned to
Taiwan for academic activities, he had rarely thought about settling
here.</P>
      <P>When Tsinghua started its selection process a year ago, he said,
one of his friends suggested that he take the post. However, his
father did not approve of the idea and questioned how he could take
the post of president when he couldn't speak fluent Chinese.</P>
      <P>Shu said that when his father died late last year, he thought
about many things. His father, he said, made a great contribution to
Taiwan, which made him feel he had a worthy life and that his
contribution to Taiwan was one of his greatest achievements.</P>
      <P>Shu said that although he felt the environment in the United
States is good, he also wanted to make some contribution to his
"hometown," and to have a worthwhile life.</P>
      <P>In addition, he went on, bringing Taiwan's universities to a par
with world-class universities is also a challenging job. He added
that he heard about Tsinghua so much during his childhood, he could
not believe he would one day be head of the university, with
the additional magic connection with his father.</P>
      <P>Saying that he still had some unfinished work at the University
of California at Berkeley, he said that he may have to shuttle back
and forth between the United States and Taiwan for some months before
settling down.</P>
      <P>He also described "teaching and research" as his two loves and
said he plans to open a course on astrophysics at Tsinghua.</P>
      <P>Two prestigious journals -- Nature and Science -- have recently
reported Shu's selection as president of Tsinghua, highlighting his
stature in world academic circles.</P>
      <P>Shu, who helped establish the Institute of Astronomy &amp;
Astrophysics of Academia Sinica, the highest research institute in
Taiwan, in 1993, has pioneered astronomical studies on the island.</P>
      <P>He has a B.S. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and a Ph.D. in Astronomy from Harvard University. He is
best known for his works on the dynamics of spiral galaxies and their
interstellar media, the mechanisms of mass, energy, and angular
momentum transfer in interacting binary stars, and the structure and
dynamics of planetary rings.</P>

      <P>Republic of China Minister of Foreign
Affairs Eugene Chien said Monday that U.S. President George Bush's
visit to Beijing later this month will not sacrifice Taiwan's
interests.</P>
      <P>Chien told reporters that as Taipei and Washington maintain a
"tacit agreement," he sees no unexpected situation developing over
the Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>Bush will arrive in Beijing Feb. 21 for a two-day official visit.
Mainland Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing is presently in
Washington to discuss Bush's itinerary.</P>
      <P>Chien, who assumed office Feb. 1, said that the United States
will not sacrifice Taiwan to favor the mainland because Taiwan and
the United States share a common interest, while the top priority of
U.S. foreign policy is the war against terrorism.</P>
      <P>Regarding the government's plan to add "Issued in Taiwan" to ROC
passports and the Government Information Office's move to add "ROC on

      <P>The minister reiterated that the guidelines on future diplomatic
work are "democracy and human rights, economic co-prosperity, and
peace and security."</P>
      <P>He also stressed the importance of "keeping secrets" in

      <P>"The Rule of the Game," a new film by
Taiwanese director Ho Ping, will be showcased at the upcoming 52nd
Berlin International Film Festival to be held Feb. 6-17.</P>
      <P>Ho said Monday at a news conference that he will leave for Berlin
Wednesday, and that he will arrive there without giving any thought
as to whether he will win any prizes.</P>
      <P>"`The Rule of the Game' tells a story of several downbeat
characters who are willing to die for money," he said. "This movie is
about the destiny and irony of my generation in Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He described his Mandarin-language film, also called "Wa Dong
Ren" -- literally "the hole-digger" -- as a black comedy.</P>
      <P>"The Rule of the Game" was entered in the International Forum of
New Cinema, an independent section of the Berlinale dedicated to
innovative and experimental cinema.</P>
      <P>It will be shown at the festival four times -- on Feb. 8 at the
Delphi cinema, Feb. 9 at the Arsenal 1 and CinemaxX 3, and Feb. 10 at
the Babylon.</P>
      <P>In the film, the leading character, Turtle, enlists the help of
his enthusiastic friend Chewy to knock out a sly business partner,
but Turtle does not know that Chewy might have another plan in mind.</P>
      <P>Chewy has a rule about killing: "Killing is easy. Burying is
difficult."</P>
      <P>Ho said: "Chewy is the least greedy one, but he has the most
serious problem. He is not pursuing money, sex or even a better
future. He has lost all hope and desire.</P>
      <P>"When the hole is filled, it becomes a grave. Perhaps Chewy
should dig a hole for himself, a well-planned hole where he can lie
down and rest with comfort and dignity," Ho said.</P>
      <P>Last year, Taiwan's "Betelnut Beauty" and "Beijing Bicycle" each

      <P>Former Legislator Lo Fu-chu filed a lawsuit
Monday against a prosecutor who asked a judge to detain him last
week.</P>
      <P>Accompanied by his lawyers, Lo went to the Taipei District Court
to file suit against Sheng Ming-lun, a prosecutor of the Public
Prosecutors' Office of the Taiwan High Court, for "interfering with
his freedom."</P>
      <P>Sheng asked the judge for permission to detain Lo, who is in hot
water for his involvement in fraud and breach of trust, last week but
the request was later denied, although Lo was forced to appear in
court briefly.</P>
      <P>Lo claimed that Sheng threatened and intimidated him during the
arraignment, trying to hurt his family, friends and staff.</P>
      <P>Lo said he is seeking a "fair" trial and expressed hope that the
prosecutor will not try to trump up any accusations against him,
although he admitted that he had committed offenses that could carry
sentences of not more than five years. He also vented his
dissatisfaction that the "black gold" task force of the Public
Prosecutors' Office of the Taiwan High Court was used against him,
claiming that its a "waste of taxpayers' money."</P>
      <P>Sheng said that he would take the suit "in his stride," and added
that he will "do what he has to do." He made no further comment on
the matter.</P>
      <P>Lo was briefly detained Friday afternoon and did not reply to
questions, since he felt he had been wrongly detained. A joint court

    <HEADLINE>OVERALL CREDIT RATINGS OF TAIWAN ENTERPRISES DECLINED IN 2001</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  4  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The overall credit rating of Taiwan's
enterprises, especially the traditional manufacturing sector, showed
signs of decline last year, the Taiwan Ratings Corp. (TRC) said
Monday.</P>
      <P>The TRC lowered the credit ratings of three of Taiwan's
traditional industries in 2001, with outlook negative, due mainly to
the tough operating climate.</P>
      <P>These industries faced oversupply and weak prices in 2001, the
TRC said.</P>
      <P>According to the TRC, the number of entities rated by the
corporation in 2001 soared compared with 2000 and 1999. In 1999, only
seven companies ratings published. The number increased to nine in
2000 and 21 in 2001, it said.</P>
      <P>As a result of the limited pool of rated entities in 1999 and
2000, gauging annual rating trends is difficult. Nevertheless, a
sector review with the information available is still indicative of
current industry trends, the TRC said.</P>
      <P>The number of rated entities whose credit ratings were listed
with outlook negative in 2001 was three, accounting for 14.3 percent
of the total number of rated entities. The number surpassed that in
the previous two years, according to the TRC statistics.</P>
      <P>However, there was one rated entity whose credit rating was
listed with outlook as positive in December last year, the TRC said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR URGES BEIJING TO RESPOND TO PRESIDENT CHEN'S GOODWILL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>London,  Feb.  4 (CNA)
(By Mark Ou and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Visiting Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said in
London Monday that mainland China should respond to all the goodwill
messages expressed by ROC President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>"Chen is by no means a pro-independence diehard as claimed by
mainland China," Ma said in a speech delivered to Chinese residents
in the London area. "My observation is that President Chen is
flexible and willing to change to suit different circumstances."</P>
      <P>Ma said President Chen announced in his inaugural speech that so
long as mainland China does not invade Taiwan, he would never declare
Taiwan independence. In addition, he said, Chen has on many occasions
extended olive branches to Beijing since assuming office in May 2000.</P>
      <P>"Although Chen is unmistakably supportive of Taiwan independence,
he is absolutely not a fundamentalist," Ma noted, adding that
mainland China should recognize Chen's flexibility and make a
positive response to his goodwill.</P>
      <P>"In view of Chen's previous stance, it's not easy for him to
deliver so many goodwill messages and gestures regarding relations
across the Taiwan Strait," Ma said. "Mainland China should not
continue ignoring Chen's goodwill appeals and should instead give him
acclaim."</P>
      <P>In his view, Ma said, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should
acknowledge each other's goodwill to forge mutual trust and improve
bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Ma further said mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen's
recent softened rhetoric on cross-strait relations marked a shift in
mainland China's tactics toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"Qian's statement that members of Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), except for a few pro-independence diehards,
are welcome to visit the mainland in an 'appropriate status' seems to
be conveying a certain message," Ma said. "We can take it as the
start of new stage of cross-strait engagements."</P>
      <P>The Republic of China government has made an appropriate response
to Qian's rare message. But Ma said as the time is not on Taipei's
side in the development of cross-strait ties, the ROC government
should take even more active, concrete measures to break the current
impasse.</P>
      <P>Ma's speech was organized by the Sun Yat-sen Association in
Britain. Despite the chilly rainy weather, many Chinese residents in
the London area attended the meeting.</P>
      <P>Ma arrived in London earlier in the day for a three-day visit
aimed at studying British experiences in promoting cultural and
tourist development.</P>
      <P>"We hope to learn from British experience in order to make Taipei
a more interesting, more tasteful city," Ma said after visiting the
London Tourist Board.</P>
      <P>During his talks with London tourist officials, Ma exchanged
views with them on management and marketing strategies as well as
budget planning. Ma said Taipei must improve its marketing strategy
to attract more foreign tourists.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Ma toured the popular Tate Modern Gallery.
Besides browsing through its exhibits, Ma also expressed interest in
the gallery's budget planning and management system.</P>
      <P>Ma is scheduled to visit Britain's cultural relics preservation
authority Tuesday and will then deliver an address on the challenges
in cross-strait relations in the 21st century at the Taiwan Research
Chair of Oxford University's Center of Asian Studies.</P>
      <P>After winding up his London trip, Ma will travel to Amsterdam for
a two-day visit. While there, Ma will call at Dutch authorities in
charge of canal management and tourist services. Ma said he will also
take advantage of the tour to learn from Dutch experiences in
cultural heritage preservation and relevant renovation expertise and
technologies.</P>
      <P>Ma is accompanied by several Taipei city councilors and municipal
officials on his current European tour.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATIVE CAUCUSES MEET OVER REVISED GOVERNMENT REVENUE ALLOCATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Jan.  5  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling and opposition caucuses in the
legislature held its first coordination meeting Tuesday to discuss
the controversy over the newly revised Law Governing the Allocation
of Government Revenues and Expenditures.</P>
      <P>The revised law, which was hurriedly pushed through on the last
day of the previous legislature last month, was initiated by the
Kuomintang and supported by the People First Party. The law will
force the central government to give a bigger portion of its revenues
to local governments.</P>
      <P>Legislative President Wang Jin-pyng, reading the conclusion
reached at the meeting, said the first session of the fifth
legislature will open Feb. 26, but if the Executive Yuan deems the
revised law hard to execute and asks the legislature to reconsider
the law, the session will open Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Premier Yu Shyi-kun said the Executive Yuan will
decide in two days whether to ask the legislature to reconsider the
revised law, stressing that the Cabinet hopes to solve the problem
through communication.</P>
      <P>Yu reiterated that asking the legislature to reconsider the law
will be a last resort, adding that he hopes the issue will not turn
into rivalry between the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>While inspecting the Ministry of Justice, the premier, who was
only sworn in Feb. 1, said that the entire nation is looking forward
to a stable political environment for the sake of economic
development.</P>
      <P>Yu said that if the revised allocation law is executed, it will
be counter to regulations governing the current account balance under
the Budget Law, and a shortage of current accounts of NT$50 billion
(US$1.42 billion) would likely result.</P>
      <P>Though some have suggested revising the ceiling of the Public
Debt Law to fill the financial gap, Yu said that he fears it may
become a normal practice each year to finance the shortage.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, legislative whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), said that the revised law will cause huge
financial shortages for the government.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that if the DPP caucus tries to revise the law, it will
be a time-consuming process and that the chances of seeing the
opposition party boycotting it will also increase, adding that the
stance of the caucus is "to favor the option of reconsidering the
law."</P>

    <HEADLINE>CONFIDENCE NEEDED TO PROMOTE TAIPEI-MOSCOW TRADE: ROC REPRESENTATIVE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Moscow,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Chang Hung-kuang and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mutual confidence is needed in addition to
interest in investment if bilateral trade between Russia and Taiwan
is to improve, the Republic of China's representative to Moscow said
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Charles S.C. King said that several trade delegations from Taiwan
will visit Moscow in the next few months, demonstrating sufficient
interest in bilateral cooperation, but Russia's 18 percent inflation
rate and its laws governing foreign investments have contributed to a
lack of mutual confidence.</P>
      <P>King said that the 45 percent year-on-year drop in bilateral
trade last year was mainly due to the global economic slump, but
Russia continued to enjoy a US$340 million trade surplus with Taiwan,
with the island exporting only US$260 million in goods to Russia in
2001.</P>
      <P>In regard to the issue of direct flights between Taipei and
Moscow, King said that both governments have already completed all
necessary paperwork after eight years of negotiations, but the
airlines appointed to operate the route are still working on
tax-related details.</P>
      <P>The Russian government views the tax issue with a great deal of
importance because the two governments do not have an agreement in
place to avoid double taxation, King added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In anticipation of rice imports after
Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) this year,
land used for cultivation of rice fell last years to their lowest
level since 1947, the Council of Agriculture (COA) reported Tuesday.</P>
      <P>COA officials said rice planting areas were cut to 332,183
hectares in 2001, down 7,766 hectares from the previous year -- the
smallest paddy acreage since Taiwan was retroceded from Japan in
1947.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that rice planting areas will be further cut to
around 300,000 hectares this year, the officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted that after WTO entry in January, Taiwan will be
required to allow imports of 144,720 tons of rice this year. To cope
with this situation, the agriculture council will continue to promote
its voluntary fallow program and rotational planting of indigenous
crops.</P>
      <P>The officials also said that from 2002 to 2004, the government
will continue to promote a regional rotation fallow system.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DOMESTIC AIRLINES NOT THINKING OF MERGER DESPITE  HEAVY LOSSES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Times have been tough for ROC domestic
airlines over the last two years, but this is not pushing all the
companies to consider mergers because of possible complications, an
official of the Civil Aeronautics Administration said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Although the Ministry of Transportation and Communications has
encouraged the airlines to merge, three of the four domestic carriers
have said that they will wait to make any decision.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's domestic air carriers -- UNI Airways Corp., Mandarin
Airlines, Far East Air Transport Corp. and TransAsia Airways -- have
all suffered heavy losses due to the sluggish aviation market and
rising fuel prices.</P>
      <P>Eva Air Group Chairman Chang Jung-fa Monday suggested that the
four domestic airlines should merge into two to reduce their
operational costs and avoid cut-throat competition. Domestic airlines
have experienced two waves of mergers in the past few years.</P>
      <P>The EVA Air Group in 1995 bought a small domestic airline and
converted it into UNI Airways to serve domestic air routes. Competing
with a dozen other domestic airlines while the market scale was
limited, UNI Airways, like most of its competitors, was constantly
operating in the red.</P>
      <P>The government lifted its restrictions on the domestic aviation
market in 1987, and many new airlines were set up in the early 1990s.
While the domestic market was limited, the airlines were gambling on
the possibility of tapping the lucrative market for direct flights
across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Three years ago, several domestic airlines on the brink of
bankruptcy decided to merge. UNI Airways merged with Great China
Airlines and the China Airlines-affiliated Mandarin Airlines merged
with Formosa Airlines. By 2001, there were only four airlines
operating 28 domestic routes in Taiwan. Still, none of them was
making profit.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the completion of the north-south high-speed
railway by 2006 will affect the aviation business. He suggested that
the four domestic airlines should take stock of the economic reality
now.</P>
      <P>Except for the EVA group-affiliated UNI Airways, executives of
the other three domestic airlines have said that they are not
interested in merger proposals, at least for the time being.</P>
      <P>An executive of Mandarin Airlines said that different corporate
cultures could become serious problems during and after the process
of merging. Mandarin Airline's financial status was adversely
affected after merging with airlines with huge deficits, he added.</P>
      <P>Far East Air Transport Corp. and TransAsia Airways, which have
long cooperated on airport services, are not planning to merge
because of their differing management styles, according to company
executives.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST MAINLAND TOUR GROUP ARRIVES FROM JAPAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 13-member tour group of mainland Chinese
nationals residing in Japan arrived in Taipei Tuesday for a four-day
sightseeing trip.</P>
      <P>It was the first mainland tour group to visit Taiwan since the
Republic of China opened the door for overseas mainland Chinese
citizens to make group tours of the island at the beginning of this
year.</P>
      <P>"I'm excited to set feet on Taiwan after a 60-year wait," said
Jin Hui, leader of the tour group, upon his arrival at Chiang
Kai-shek International Airport, Taiwan's main gateway.</P>
      <P>Jin said he moved to Japan from Beijing with his parents when he
was six years old. Due to complicated political factors, he has been
unable to come to Taiwan for sightseeing.</P>
      <P>"It takes only two hours to fly from Osaka to Taiwan, but I had
to wait six decades to realize my dream to tour the island," said the
64-year-old Osaka resident of Chinese descent.</P>
      <P>Jin said he would take advantage of this rare trip to visit noted
Taiwan cultural and historical relics as well as taste all sorts of
delicious Taiwanese-style snacks.</P>
      <P>He also cited the National Palace Museum in suburban Taipei as
the place he most yearns to visit during his current trip. "I like
Chinese culture very much. Therefore, I went to mainland China to
receive my college education. I have paid numerous visits to
Beijing's National Palace Museum. Although its architecture is
magnificent, its exhibits are not very impressive."</P>
      <P>Jin said he has long heard of the massive collection of exquisite
Chinese art objects at Taipei's National Palace Museum. "Seeing is
believing. I want to take a close look at the Chinese cultural and
artistic treasures there," an emotional Jin said.</P>
      <P>None of Jin's group have ever been allowed to enter Taiwan. All
of them appeared to be delighted to become the first group of
mainland Chinese tourists to visit the island. They were all smiles
while being greeted by a throng of local journalists.</P>
      <P>International Tour Operation (ITO), which organized the tour
package for the group, said most of the visiting mainland tourists
are residing in Japan's Kobe and Osaka areas and engaging in the
travel service business. "In addition to sightseeing, many members
also intend to survey the local tourist market," said an ITO
executive.</P>
      <P>The group will visit major tourist attractions in northern Taiwan
as well as visit famous tourist hotels and restaurants in the region.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to boost exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait, Taiwan began Jan. 1 to allow mainland Chinese citizens with
permanent foreign residency or mainland students studying abroad to
make pleasure trips to the island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei Association of Travel Agents (TATA) said
the second mainland tour group may arrive after the Chinese New Year,
which falls on Feb. 12 this year.</P>
      <P>Tourist sources said scores of mainland Chinese residents in San
Francisco have expressed interest in joining a Taiwan-mainland China
tour package organized by a travel agency there.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WTO ENTRY MAY AFFECT 'CLANDESTINE ECONOMY': REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The livelihood of some 500,000 people on
Taiwan will be affected because of the island's opening to foreign
products and services following its Jan. 1 entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO), according to a recent government analysis.</P>
      <P>As foreign goods and services are expected to flow into the
domestic market in the near future -- bringing down product prices
amid fiercer competition -- the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) reported that the livelihood of
500,000 people, including market vendors, elderly and middle-aged
farmers, and ranking executives, may be affected.</P>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and Development had forecast
earlier that Taiwan's unemployment rate would rise by 0.22 percentage
points following its WTO admission. Taiwan's jobless rate stood at
5.22 percent at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>According to a DGBAS investigation on street vendors, business in
the so-called "clandestine economy" will be particularly hard hit,
despite the fact that the sector may absorb a large number of jobless
workers during recession.</P>
      <P>The investigation also discovered that there are more younger
vendors at traditional markets over the past year. DGBAS officials
said this is an indication that older vendors are being edged out and
added that the number of floating street vendors has gradually grown
in the last 10 years because of the difficulties of shifting
professions.</P>
      <P>According to DGBAS tallies, there were about 256,000 street
vendor stands in 1993, with the number rising to 263,000 in 1998
involving 390,000 people.</P>
      <P>DGBAS officials estimated that the number of street vendor stands
may hit around 300,000 absorbing 500,000 people at present, with
40,000 of the stands located in northern Taipei County.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER MUM ON EVERGREEN'S SHIFT OF STRATEGY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Christine Chung
declined to comment Tuesday on a major local shipping company's
decision to change the country of registration of half of its vessels
to facilitate its investment projects in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Evergreen Marine Corp. Chairman Chang Jung-fa said in the
southwestern Japanese port city of Kobe Monday that his company has
decided to change the registration of half of its 148 container
vessels from either Panama or the Republic of China to Britain or
Italy.</P>
      <P>"The change is aimed at facilitating the company's expansion of
shipping services in Europe and its investment in mainland China,"
Chang was quoted as saying.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chang also said he plans to resign as senior adviser
to the ROC president. His announcement was widely seen as a major
shift in Evergreen's business strategy.</P>
      <P>Responding to Chang's announcement, the newly sworn-in minister
said only that it is a "choice of the entrepreneur himself" and a
"business activity."</P>
      <P>Chung, who served as president and CEO of Taiwan's largest
carrier -- China Airlines -- until last Thursday, said that if she
were still a corporate executive, she would not put personal business
interests above the nation's overall interests.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, she added that she is willing to give her "best
wishes" to Evergreen Group, which operates one of the world's largest
container shipping fleets, as well as Taiwan's second-largest air
carrier, EVA Airways.</P>
      <P>In her first news conference following her nomination
late last month as the ROC's first female minister of economic
affairs, an elated Chung said the "worst moments" for recession-hit
Taiwan are over and that she will make Taiwan's economy "fly again
within two years."</P>
      <P>However, Chang told local reporters covering his Kobe trip that
Taiwan's economic problems cannot be separated from its political
issues. "In the past, the mainland Chinese economy relied on
investment from Taiwan, but in the future, Taiwan's economy will rely
on the vast mainland market. Against this backdrop, if political
issues between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait cannot be resolved,
Taiwan's economic prospects will remain gloomy," he predicted.</P>
      <P>In response, Chung said Taiwan's economy is presently at rock
bottom. "It won't get worse any more," she forecast, adding that if
an enterprise faces difficulties, the first step the company should
take is to review its internal management.</P>
      <P>Chang is known to maintain close ties with ROC President Chen
Shui-bian, a stalwart of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).
Although Chen and his DPP have mellowed their pro-independence
stance, Beijing remains reluctant to resume long-stalled cross-strait
dialogue.</P>
      <P>Amid the lingering political impasse, the mainland has banned
Taiwan's shipping companies and their subsidiaries from setting up
footholds on its shores.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said Chang's decisions to change the
registration of Evergreen ships and resign from the presidential
advisory post are expected to pave the way for his company's smooth
entry into the mainland market.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's foreign currency reserves totaled
US$123.629 billion at the end of January, 2002, an increase of
US$1,419 million over that of last December, setting a record high
but maintaining the third-largest reserves in Asia, according to
statistics released Tuesday by the Central Bank of China.</P>
      <P>In related news, Chi Schive, director of the Taiwan Financial and
Monetary Institute, said that there was no country in the world to
enervate its economy through the parity between its local currency
and foreign currency.</P>
      <P>Any suggestion on the rate between new Taiwan dollar and the U.S.
dollar made by the industry itself was inappropriate, Schive said.</P>
      <P>Schive made the remarks while commenting on local media reports
that Chang Jung-fa, president of the Evergreen Group, suggested that
the new Taiwan dollar should depreciate to NT$38 against one U.S.
dollar as a way to boost Taiwan's competitiveness and to revive the
stagnated economy.</P>
      <P>Schieve pointed out that Chang is engaged in the shipping
industry and from his viewpoint, the new Taiwan dollar should
depreciate and said that the government will face difficulties if
another industry suggests that the new Taiwan dollar should
appreciate to NT$30 against one U.S. dollar based on his stance.</P>
      <P>He cited Japan as saying that Japan continued to depreciate the
Japanese yen, thus causing hyperinflation. "The issue was worth

Revolution-style political struggle against opponents and forsake the
tradition of the "feudalism of literary inquisition," which often
ends in the writers' imprisonment or execution.</P>
      <P>The Boston-based association of independent Chinese literary

Yiliang has been released from a mainland Chinese prison.</P>
      <P>The China Independent PEN urged the Beijing authorities to

rights.</P>
      <P>According to Liu Bingyen, a noted Chinese writer now living in
the United States in self-imposed exile and chairman of the China
Independent PEN, Wang, who insisted on freedom of writing and who
participated in the Chinese Culture Renaissance Movement, was jailed
in February 2000 for two years' of labor and "soul searching" and was

    <HEADLINE>FISHERY EXECUTIVES DIVIDED OVER IMPACT OF MAINLAND LABOR EXPORT BAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ilan,  Taiwan,  Feb.  5 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fishing ship owners in Nanfangao, a
fishing port in the northeastern county of Ilan, are divided over the
possible impact of mainland China's recent alleged decision to
prohibit mainland fishery workers from working in Taiwan, sources
said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lin Yueh-ying, secretary-general of the Nanfangao Fishery
Association, said some local owners believe the ban, if true, would
have a positive effect on the protection of Taiwan's fishery
resources.</P>
      <P>"In the past, mainland fishermen working aboard Taiwan fishing
ships had directed mainland fishing boats to major Taiwan fishing
grounds after ending their contracts with local fishing firms," Lin
claimed.</P>
      <P>Some local ship owners thus believe that the supposed mainland
labor export ban will help stem the recurrence of such scenarios and
facilitate the protection of Taiwan's fishery resources, Lin said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he went on, several other owners have pointed out that
as mainland fishery workers are banned from landing on Taiwan's
shores, local owners have to hire other laborers to assist in
unloading their catches, which actually increases their operational
costs.</P>
      <P>"The mainland export ban may force local ship owners to employ
foreign fishery workers who can land in Taiwan," Lin continued.
"Against this background, hiring foreign workers may be more
cost-efficient."</P>
      <P>However, Lin said, many other ship owners in the Nanfangao area
are worried about the aggravation of the present manpower shortage
following the mainland labor export ban.</P>
      <P>"In the future, local ship owners may have to hire fishermen from
Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand to work aboard their
fishing boats," Lin said. "Language barriers will be the biggest
headache in employing Southeast Asian fishery laborers."</P>
      <P>The fishing industry in the Nanfangao area presently employs
about 1,300 mainland workers and Lin pointed out that "It will be no
easy task to fill all the vacancies left by mainland fishermen."</P>
      <P>With the approach of the Chinese New Year, which falls on Feb. 12
this year, many Nanfangao-based vessels have returned to port in
preparation for the traditional Chinese festival. As a result, the
demand for mainland fishery workers has yet to reach a peak.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, some ship owners said it has become more difficult
to hire mainland fishery workers since they received an internal
mainland document purporting to bear official seals of the mainland
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture, which
declares the mainland's decision to suspend the export of fishery
workers to Taiwan. The documents have not yet been verified and
several reports have described them as a hoax.</P>
      <P>The Nanfangao Fishery Association urged the ROC government to
work out measures to help local ship owners resolve the manpower
shortage problem, which it said will become very serious after the
Lunar New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>It remains unclear why mainland China would abruptly suspend
exports of its fishery laborers. Some sources have said the move may
be aimed at pushing local ship owners to improve living and working
conditions for mainland fishermen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FALUN DAFA DAY MARKED IN 18 MAINLAND CHINESE PROVINCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Feb. 4 (CNA)
(By Eric Tseng and Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Falun Gong followers in some 18 mainland
Chinese provinces have marked their Falun Dafa Day over the past 45
days since the first such day was celebrated in Changchun city in
northeastern Jilin Province Dec. 22, 2001.</P>
      <P>According to the New York-based Falun Dafa Information Center,
Falun Gong practitioners in cities in the 18 provinces, including
Shandong, Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, have followed Changchun's
suit since the end of last year by declaring their respective Falun
Dafa Days.</P>
      <P>Many of them chose Feb. 4 -- the day of the arrival of spring
according to the Chinese lunar calender -- as their Falun Dafa Day,
the center said. Most Falun Gong members practiced calligraphy,
breathing exercises and prayer to mark the day with the aim of
encouraging people living under persecution to continue seeking
truth, beauty and prudence.</P>
      <P>Falun Gong followers in Changchun said in a declaration that
their decision to choose Dec. 22 last year -- the day of the arrival
of winter according to the Chinese lunar calender -- carried a
symbolic meaning as the beginning of "a new life, a new year and the
end of all sin."</P>
      <P>According to the center, the world's first Falun Dafa Day was
observed May 13, 2000. Since then, towns and cities in Canada and the
United States have respectively set up their own Falun Dafa Days.</P>
      <P>A Web site belonging to the Falun Gong said that over the past 13
months, more than 54,700 mainland Chinese people have linked to the
Web site and have declared that they have re-started practicing the
breathing exercises and meditation that is viewed by the Chinese
communists as a sect. Beijing has launched repeated and brutal
crackdowns on its followers across the mainland.</P>

    <HEADLINE>JANUARY CPI UP 0.4 PERCENT FROM DECEMBER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  5  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's consumer price index (CPI) in
January was up a slight 0.4 percent from the previous month and down
1.67 percent from the year-earlier level, according to statistics
released Tuesday by the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS).</P>
      <P>Hikes in tobacco and liquor prices in January following World
Trade Organization entry were partially offset by lower prices for
fresh vegetables and fruit, together with sales promotions for winter
clothing, the DGBAS statistics show.</P>
      <P>The food-excluded CPI registered a year-on-year decrease of 2.23
percent in January, and the service sector CPI fell 3.38 percent from
a year earlier, the largest decline since 1982.</P>
      <P>The island's wholesale price index (WPI) in January grew by 0.57
percent from December but fell 3.45 percent from a year ago,
according to the statistics.</P>
      <P>Compared with the same month of last year, the prices of
Taiwan-produced cigarettes and imported cigarettes in January
increased 38.02 percent and 19.55 percent respectively, pushing the
CPI up 0.42 percent.</P>
      <P>The prices of Taiwan-made liquor and imported liquor in January
grew by 81.89 percent and 2.45 percent respectively, pushing the CPI
up 0.51 percent.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS attributed the year-on-year CPI and WPI declines mainly
to the progress of technology and the relaxation of foreign exchange
control. It said that decline is continuing and added that it remains
to be seen whether the current loosened monetary policy of the
Central Bank of China will result in a currency deflation.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday he
hopes the opposition parties and the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) will reconcile and interact on a basis that will be
conducive to Taiwan's political stability.</P>
      <P>Chen called for all the parties concerned to "reach out their
hands" to each other to allow Taiwan -- "our common home" -- to shine
on the world stage.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Chen said, Taiwan has overcome crises and
impacts of all kinds, both domestic and international, "enabling us
to perceive how vital it is that all of us, regardless of our
different political affiliations and varied cultural and ethnic
backgrounds, should live together on the island as a community."</P>
      <P>Chen said he is glad that after the December legislative
elections, Taiwan's politics have become more stable than before and
that a consensus between the opposition parties and the DPP on
striving for economic growth and political reforms has been made
possible -- developments that made him more confident in the
country's future.</P>
      <P>The president made the remarks at a year-end luncheon party held
to entertain the media from home and abroad.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was particularly pleased to hear the latest report
by the Switzerland-based World Economic Forum that Taiwan's
international competitiveness climbed three notches from 2000 to
reach seventh in the world in 2001.</P>
      <P>He added that he owes former Premier Chang Chun-hsiung a salute
for his performance during his 480-day tenure that ended Feb. 1, and
that he has great expectations for Chang's successor -- Yu Shyi-kun
-- who he said will definitely help lead Taiwan's economy to a

    <HEADLINE>MAINLANDERS FIND NEW WAY TO SNEAK INTO TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taoyuan, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Mainlanders have apparently devised a new
way of sneaking into Taiwan by using forged birth certificates and
identification cards issued by the government of Matsu, an outlying
Republic of China-controlled island, according to Taoyuan district
prosecutors.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors said they believe that more than 100 mainland
Chinese have successfully sneaked into Taiwan over the past year via
Matsu, located close to the mainland in the Taiwan Strait, by using
falsified documents.</P>
      <P>Prosecutor Hsu Ping-wen said that after months of investigations
and fact-finding trips to Matsu, the Taoyuan District Prosecutors
Office has come to the conclusion that an organized crime ring has
been behind the Matsu-Taiwan illegal immigration operations.</P>
      <P>It was found that former People's Liberation Army soldiers and
public security officers from mainland China have entered Taiwan
under this formula over the past year.</P>
      <P>Mindful of the potential threat to Taiwan's national security of
the Matsu-Taiwan "human cargo" smuggling, the ROC's military
intelligence authorities have also pitched in with related
investigations, fearing that former mainland PLA and public security
members might conduct intelligence-gathering operations in Taiwan
once they enter the island.</P>
      <P>The newly-arrived "Matsu" people began to raise suspicions among
Taoyuan prosecutors last year after the prosecutors discovered that
the "Matsu" people "got lost" immediately after entering Taiwan, had
no relatives in Taiwan and were unable to be tracked down by local
police. In addition, the prosecutors found that the guardians who
endorsed the guarantee certificates for the newly-arrived "Matsu"
people did not know them personally at all.</P>
      <P>Hsu, who made several fact-finding trips to Matsu to gain a
further understanding of the situation, said he found out that
Taoyuan citizens Liu Tseng-tung and Liu Chien-wen were part of a
crime ring that began to smuggle illegal immigrants from mainland
China into Taiwan via Matsu in May 2000 after the ROC government
initiated a policy making it more convenient for Matsu residents to
move to Taiwan for permanent settlement.</P>
      <P>Under the policy, all Matsu residents are allowed to emigrate to
Taiwan as long as they can produce their birth certificates,
identification cards and a guarantee document carrying the names of
three Matsu "neighbors" who can prove the applicants are native to
Matsu.</P>
      <P>The two Lius and the human smuggling ring they belong to were
found to have sponsored more than 100 people to move from Matsu to
Taiwan, charging each applicant NT$120,000 to NT$160,000 for
providing them with fake IDs, birth documents and guarantee papers
carrying the names of the required three Matsu residents.
In his interviews with the "Matsu" residents whose names were
used for the guarantee papers, most of whom are local elders, Hsu
found that none personally knew the people they had endorsed. The
guarantors were usually paid NT$5,000 to NT$10,000 for their
signatures, he added.</P>
      <P>The prosecutors also discovered during their investigations that
these "Matsu" immigrants to Taiwan from the mainland are not subject
to the regulations under the existing Statutes Governing Relations
Between People from Across the Taiwan Strait and are therefore not
restricted in terms of the number of times they can enter and exit
Taiwan, according to Hsu.</P>

    <DATELINE>Kinmen, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>People from the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait will for the first time jointly observe the annual Lantern
Festival by setting off fireworks simultaneously on either side of
the narrow stretch of water separating the island of Kinmen from
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Kinmen county government officials said Wednesday that the
fireworks displays will be staged simultaneously on the coast of the
ROC-controlled island and on the coast near the mainland port city of
Xiamen, which is located opposite Kinmen, on the evening of Feb. 26.
The idea for the displays was initiated by the Xiamen city
government and received enthusiastically by Kinmen Magistrate Lee
Chu-feng.</P>
      <P>The Xiamen officials originally proposed that the two places set
off fireworks simultaneously on the eve of the Lunar Chinese New
Year, which falls on Feb. 11, but their Kinmen counterparts suggested
instead that the event be postponed to the Lantern Festival in order
to allow plenty of time for the requisite arrangements to be made.
On the night of the Lantern Festival, a total of 1,120 fireworks
are expected to be set off on Kinmen, while an even more magnificent
display will be sent up in Xiamen.</P>
      <P>In addition to the fireworks displays, the Kinmen county
government will also sponsor a lantern exhibition in Kinmen and a
traditional Chinese puppet show, which is expected to be performed by
the troupe of mainland classic puppet master Huang Yi-chueh,
according to Kinmen officials.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PM TO ASK LEGISLATURE TO REVIEW REVISED ALLOCATION LAW (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Executive Yuan decided Wednesday to
propose a motion to ask the legislature to reconsider a revised law
governing the allocation of government revenues and expenditures, the
first possible conflict between the ruling and opposition camps in
the new legislature.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said the move is "a last resort," necessary
because the Cabinet finds it "hard to implement" the revised law,
which was rammed through the legislature the last day of the
previous legislature.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of a strong reaction from the opposition, Yu
urged "calm and rationality," saying that the national construction
and financial systems are at stake and that his decision had nothing
to do with parties or party factions.</P>
      <P>The revised law, initiated by the opposition Kuomintang and
supported by the People First Party, will force the central
government to give a larger portion of its revenues to local
governments. The executive branch blasted the revision as "hard to
implement" at the time and Wednesday was the last day for the
Exceutive Yuan to ask the legislature to reconsider the law.
Yu said at a press conference held at the Government Information
Office that the revised law was hastily passed without full and
comprehensive communication among all sides.</P>
      <P>He said that the revision would result in a serious imbalance of
the central and local governments in the future, which he said runs
counter to the regulations of the Budget Law. The revision, he
claimed, also fails to provide measures that would allow local
governments to follow the ideals of self-rule.</P>
      <P>He noted that the current subsidy system exercised by the central
government addresses the financial situation of local governments,
replenishing and balancing their accounts, which he said has borne
fruit, citing local governments' shouldering of national health
insurance fees as an example.</P>
      <P>Yu said that the local governments paid up to 98 percent of the
insurance fees, up sharply from 40 percent in the past.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party said it supports Yu's
motion and urged that the matter be viewed rationally and
apolitically.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, the DPP legislative whip, said the party will
communicate with the opposition in the hope that the motion can be
passed, so that the revised law will not "result in squeezing the
subsidies for local governments and therefore the budgets for social
and welfare groups."</P>
      <P>Tsai also urged the Cabinet to present a convincing formula for
the allocation of revenues and subsidies, and to allow all local
governments, as well as the municipalities of Taipei and Kaohsiung,
to participate in discussion of the formula to stem fights over the
allocation issue each year.</P>
      <P>Wu Nai-jen, DPP secretary-general, echoed the premier's remarks
that the motion is a last resort.</P>
      <P>Although there have been suggestions that implementation of the
revised law should be put off for one year in order to allow for
further revision, Wu said that this would not address the immediate
problem, as the Cabinet will soon have to work out next year's
budget.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the KMT accused the DPP of acting "conspiratorially,"
saying that the DPP should shoulder the responsibility if its actions
result in a confrontation between the ruling and opposition camps
that affects political stability and economic development.
After the exceutive branch presents the motion to be
reconsidered, a majority vote will be needed if the original law is
to be upheld.</P>
      <P>Even if the motion fails, the revised Constitution stipulates
that the Cabinet will not have to step down but will have to accept
the failure or seek other options, which the opposition camp claimed
is the reason the Cabinet made the decision to press the motion,
since it "cannot lose."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The KMT Central Standing Committee noted that the Executive Yuan
claimed that the revised allocation law will result in a financial
shortfall of NT$50 billion (US$1.42 billion), but said this could be
resolved by raising the ceiling of the Public Debt Law, "improving
the stock market" and increasing the revenue raised by lotteries,
according to Wu Ching-ki, a KMT spokesman.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the DPP made the decision because it hopes to
"create political instability," which it could then use as an excuse
to bring in the National Security Alliance mechanism touted by
President Chen Shui-bian.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who had promoted the revised law, was
said to be so worried about the latest development that he might cut
short a trip to Europe and return to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The revision would give a large share of government revenues to
local governments and the special municipality of Kaohsiung, while
Taipei would make little gains.</P>
      <P>PFP Chairman James Soong said that the allocation of government
revenues requires full discussion by all involved and urged Chen to
call for coordination between the ruling and opposition camps so that
the choice is not limited to only two options.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian traveled to Nantou
County Wednesday, where he urged businesses to adapt Intel's
world-famous "Intel Inside" slogan and tout "Taiwan Inside" in the
face of robust competition in the global market.</P>
      <P>Chen made the trip to the central county to gain a better
understanding of industrial development in the region that was
devastated by the earthquake of Sept. 21, 1999, the worst temblor to
hit Taiwan in a century. He visited a 30-year-old local factory that
has expanded its operations following the killer quake.</P>
      <P>Chen praised the company's efforts to retain its roots in Taiwan
despite a mainland China investment rush among many Taiwan
enterprises. In light of the huge tasks ahead in the knowledge-based
era, Chen said Taiwan industries are being challenged by the need to
transform following the country's Jan. 1 entry into the World Trade
Organization.</P>
      <P>The president encouraged Taiwan-based businesses to adopt the
"Taiwan Inside" slogan wherever they go and make the island a base of
"spiritual support" for Taiwan businessmen overseas. He also called
for a "second Taiwan economic miracle" through all-out cooperation
between the government and the private sector.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the goal to build Taiwan into a "green silicon
island" is high on the government's agenda, he urged Taiwan-based
firms not to underestimate their own abilities and pointed out that
the World Economic Forum recently rated Taiwan as the world's
seventh-most competitive country, ahead of Hong Kong, Japan, South
Korea and mainland China, and an advance from last year's 10th spot.
Chen also visited a local center where he wished a happy Lunar
New Year to elderly people and children and gave away more than 40
"red envelopes."</P>

      <P>Visiting Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said
Tuesday that a breakthrough between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait is possible in the long term, although it will probably be in
the form of verbal exchanges rather than substantial progress in the
short term.</P>
      <P>Ma made the remarks in a speech he delivered at Oxford
University.</P>
      <P>Ma said that judging from the resilience shown by President Chen
Shui-bian so far, it is possible that there will be some breakthrough
during his term.</P>
      <P>He said that the president has shown strength when facing sticky
issues, and warned that Chen's resilience and ability to initiate
change should not be underestimated.</P>
      <P>Ma cited as an example the scrapping and subsequent resumption of
the semi-finished fourth nuclear plant in late October 2000, a move
that cost long delays and huge financial losses.</P>
      <P>Ma said that this shows Chen is not a fundamentalist and that
while the president may be an anti-nuclear sympathizer, he was
pragmatic enough to support the resumption of the plant's
construction.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, the popular Taipei mayor said that the
mainland should not be suspicious of Taiwan declaring independence,
while Taiwan does not need to worry that it will be swallowed by the
mainland.</P>
      <P>He appealed for a shelving of disputes and focus on the building
of mutual trust so as to seek common ground for a breakthrough,
saying that the return to the so-called "1992 consensus" on "one
China, different interpretations" could serve as a good start.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IFPI, LOCAL POP SINGERS CALL FOR ANTI-PIRACY ACTION IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Executives of the International Federation
of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) and several local pop singers
called Wednesday on the public in Taiwan to reject music piracy and
help "save the music industry from collapse."</P>
      <P>IFPI Chairman and CEO Jason Berman said at a meeting in Taipei
that rampant music piracy has damaged the recording industry in every
region of the world and that the IFPI hopes to call public attention
to what he described as "an endangered industry."</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the IFPI Members Foundation in Taiwan
indicate that sales revenues of Taiwan's recording industry dropped
to NT$5.3 billion in 2001, less than half of the total of NT$12.3
billion five years ago. Pirate music CDs accounted for 48 percent of
the music market.</P>
      <P>While music downloads in MP3 format has been extremely popular
among youngsters in Taiwan, the recording industry is being backed
into a corner, according to IFPI Taiwan Secretary-general Robin Lee.
Accompanied by representatives of Taiwan's recording industry,
Berman and Asia/Pacific regional office Board Chairman Lachie
Rutherford called on Justice Minister Chen Ding-nan, Interior
Minister Yu Cheng-hsien and Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
to ask the government to find effective measures to fight piracy.</P>
      <P>According to an IFPI global anti-piracy watch report, a series of
raids upon warehouses and packaging centers engaged in producing
pirate music CDs have had significant impact on the piracy market in
Taiwan, although the piracy problem remains serious.</P>
      <P>The IFPI Taiwan executive said that his office has been
coordinating with the authorities to fight piracy. In the past year,
he went on, a total of 2,235 cases of piracy were indicted. However,
arrest and the confiscation of pirated products does not stem the
flow because most of the offenders caught are juveniles who are often
treated with leniency by the courts.</P>
      <P>Fighting music piracy remains one of the IFPI's priorities. The
organization, which represents the international recording industry
in 46 countries, reported recently that massive proliferation of
CD-burning and increasing availability of unauthorized Internet
downloads have had a strong impact around the globe. CD album sales
in the first half of 2001 dropped by 4.6 percent from the
year-earlier level.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SUMMER CAMP IN TAIWAN PLANNED FOR TAIWAN CHILDREN IN MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Two mainland-based schools for Taiwan
businessmen's children have decided to organize an annual summer camp
in Taiwan for their students, starting this year, an official with
the Ministry of Education said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The decision was made in a coordination meeting attended by
representatives from the schools for Taiwan businessmen's children in
Dongwan and Shanghai, the official said, adding that the Education
Ministry may grant financial support for the activities.</P>
      <P>With an increasing number of Taiwan businessmen settling down in
mainland China, the Dongwan Taiwan Businessmen's School and the
Huadong Taiwan Businessmen's School in Shanghai were set up in 2000
and 2001, respectively, to meet the educational needs of Taiwanese
children.</P>
      <P>Although the textbooks to be used and the sites for the summer
camp have not yet been decided, it is understood that a total of 173
elementary and junior high school students from the two schools will
return to Taiwan to take part in the planned summer courses.</P>
      <P>In a bid to help Taiwanese children studying in the mainland to
proceed with their studies here, mainland-based schools for Taiwan
businessmen's children usually use Taiwan textbooks that are first
screened by the mainland authorities in order to censor those parts
of the books considered "sensitive" by the communist regime.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ITRI DEVELOPS COMMAND CHIPSET FOR MULTIFUNCTION PRINTERS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Industrial Technology Research
Institute (ITRI) has developed a command chipset that is expected to
help embattled local optical scanner makers to design and produce
more profitable and price-competitive multifunction printers (MFPs).
According to the ITRI's Opto-Electronics and Systems Laboratories
printer technologies division chief, the lab owns several patents on
the new command chipset, which is based on the popular ARM7, a
low-voltage RISC microprocessor architecture made up of a core CPU
and a range of system peripherals that provide a complete system on a
chip.</P>
      <P>Ying Tai-fa said that the lab, which researches, develops and
transfers to Taiwan industry new opto-electronics technologies that
increase competitiveness and create new market opportunities, also
provides its clients with related firmware and system integration
design services, as well as relevant information on merge color
printing and other image processing technologies.</P>
      <P>Ying said that the recent market saturation and price wars for
traditional computer peripherals have gradually reduced their
profitability, with traditional optical scanner makers facing the
greatest pressure.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's optical scanner makers, which dominate the world's
scanner market with an approximately 90 percent market share, have
been looking for new products based on their existing technologies,
and the MFP has piqued their interest because of its market
potential, Ying said.</P>
      <P>An MFP is an office tool for paper management that is connected
to a personal computer or network and combines the functions of
printing, scanning, photocopying and faxing.</P>
      <P>The ITRI is a national-level non-profit research and development
organization that carries out projects entrusted by the government
and private companies.</P>

    <HEADLINE>IPO EXECUTIVE SUGGESTS R&amp;D CAPABILITY IS TAIWAN'S ADVANTAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's information industry maintains the
advantage of research and development capability, even though many
electronics manufacturers have moved their production facilities to
mainland China, according to an international purchasing office (IPO)
executive in Taipei.</P>
      <P>Chen Chiou-ming, general manager of the Hewlett-Packard Greater
China Region IPO, said his office will continue to boost its
purchases from Taiwan, although the deliveries might be made in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Last year, HP purchases from Taiwan's information industry were
valued at US$5.7 billion, up 14 percent from the preceding year,
according to Chen. Taiwan's original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
are major suppliers of notebooks, desktop computers, servers, work
stations, printers, scanners, monitors and digital cameras to the
international corporation.</P>
      <P>He said that many IPOs prefer to place orders with the head
offices of the Taiwan manufacturers because the business and industry
in Taiwan are more advanced in logistics than their mainland
counterparts.</P>
      <P>While it will take time for mainland China to improve its basic
infrastructure and simplify customs clearance procedures, IPOs may
continue to place orders with manufacturers in Taiwan in the next one
or two years, Chen said, adding, however, that it is an unavoidable
trend that the IPOs will begin placing orders directly with mainland
manufacturing plants in the coming years.</P>
      <P>Chen said that for long-term development, business and industry
in Taiwan should stress R&amp;D. As a matter of fact, HP is studying the
feasibility of setting up an R&amp;D center in Taiwan, he disclosed.
He suggested that Taiwan also has the advantage of having the
potential to develop into an international operational center with
capital flow and cargo flow functions.</P>
      <P>Last year, the more than 100 IPOs in Taiwan purchased US$37.8
billion-worth of industrial products, mostly information industry
hardware. The amount is expected to increase to US$41 billion this
year, according to the Ministry of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Purchases by the top 10 IPOs in Taiwan -- Compaq, HP, Dell, IBM,
Apple, Intel, Gateway, Radioshack, Ingram Micro and Solectron -- were
worth US$27.9 billion in 2001, an increase of 2 percent from the
year-earlier level.</P>

      <P>Taiwan's major computer network products
reached a production value of US$3.04 billion last year, 0.9 percent
higher than the year before, the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) announced Wednesday.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS, the annual production value of broadband
modems and ISDN-related wide area network (WAN) products dropped 7.7
percent, or US$1.55 billion, from 2000, amid slumping market demand
and a lackluster global economy.</P>
      <P>OEM products comprised 77 percent of Taiwan's WAN products last
year, with only 14 percent marketed under a local brand name.
The four major makers of WAN products increased their total
market share from 68 percent to 90 percent last year.</P>
      <P>Broadband modems made up 60 percent of the total production value
of local WAN products in 2001, according to the DGBAS.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Council for Economic Planning and
Development (CEPD) will include the establishment of a national
design center as one of its priorities next year, said CEPD Vice
Chairwoman Ho Mei-yueh Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ho said the center is aimed at assisting traditional industries
to make more innovative designs to enhance the value of the products.</P>
      <P>She noted that since Taiwan's traditional industries had focused
a great deal of energy on production, they are easily undercut by
countries that supply cheap labor, now the government is going to
assist them to develop a "knowledge-based economy" and inject into
these industries a new energy.</P>
      <P>Ho emphasized that the government has done much in the
development of nanotechnology, which she said will become the most
important technology in the future -- one that will overshadow even
IC design and its related technologies.</P>
      <P>Nanotechnology involves the creation and utilization of
materials, devices and systems through the control and manipulation
of matter at the nanometer scale, that is, at the level of atoms,
molecules and supramolecular structures. A nanometer is one-billionth
of a meter - about 10,000 times narrower than a human hair and four
times wider than an atom.</P>
      <P>Using nanotechnology, Ho added, traditional industries can make
more innovative and high-value products.</P>
      <P>Ho said that some European countries do not consider products of
traditional industries as low-end articles; for instance, France
deems the perfume industry one of its most important national
industries.</P>
      <P>She also thinks that Taiwan's traditional industries should
strengthen their marketing and try some OEM designs for other
trademarks.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The latest report of the Human Rights
Watch said that the Beijing authorities continue to oppress Falun
Gong members through new laws or new interpretations of existing
laws.</P>
      <P>The report, to be made public Wednesday, said that the Falun Gong
is listed by Beijing as an unlawful religious group and its members,
like the Tibetans and the Uigurs, are treated as "separatists" and
constitute a threat to the communist party.</P>
      <P>Mainland Chinese official documents were quoted as describing the
Falun Gong as a "terrorist" organization.</P>
      <P>A Human Rights Watch official said that it was "extremely absurd"
for Beijing to treat Falun Gong members as terrorists because most
members are "peace-loving and law-abiding" citizens whose acts have
never violated human rights.</P>
      <P>The report said that the Falun Gong now has several million
members around the world, adding that Beijing began oppressing the
Falun Gong in July 1999.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, it noted, Beijing prohibited Falun Gong
members from doing meditating exercises on public occasions and
destroyed tens of thousands of Falun Gong publications.</P>
      <P>The report said that Beijing has also forced some other countries
not to tolerate the Falun Gong to suppress any people who may
consider joining the discipline.</P>
      <P>The official said Beijing's accusation that the Falun Gong

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU)
is to propose banning citizens not born in Taiwan from running for
president or vice president of the nation, a TSU spokesman said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Chien-min, deputy secretary-general of the TSU's
legislative caucus, said that members of the party's legislative
caucus have discussed the idea and added that the TSU plans to
propose to amend the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election and
Recall Law by inserting a clause that "those who were not born in the
free area of the Republic of China" cannot run for the post of
president or vice president.</P>
      <P>He added that because the proposal would involve a constitutional
amendment, the TSU caucus will first have to put the idea before the
TSU's policy-making center for further study.</P>
      <P>Many of Taiwan's most prominent politicians and office-bearers
were born in mainland China or Hong Kong and the TSU proposal will
almost certainly be interpreted by the other parties as a clause to
exclude opposition Chairman Lien Chan, People First Party Chairman
James Soong and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou in future elections.</P>
      <P>However, Chen claimed at a press conference that the proposal is
"based on considerations of national security" and is "not aimed at
any specific people."</P>
      <P>Chen added that if the TSU's proposal were to be approved,
non-Taiwan born residents could still run for legislative and local
government seats.</P>
      <P>The proposal drew immediate criticism and ridicule from both the
ruling and the opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, secretary of the KMT legislative caucus, said that
KMT will strongly oppose the proposal and said that the imposition of
this restriction would violate the Constitution, as well as further
provoke the independence-reunification dispute.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-lang, outgoing secretary-general of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's legislative caucus, also said that the
proposal would violate the Constitution, which protects the right of
every citizen to take part in elections.</P>
      <P>Lee Ching-an, convener of the People First Party legislative
caucus, ridiculed the proposal and pointed out that it would not only
inflame the independence versus reunification dispute but would also

investigations into a China Airlines take-off error that took place
last month.</P>
      <P>ASC Executive Director Jung Kai said that the ASC officials will
help simulate the events that took place Jan. 25, when a China
Airlines jetliner took off at 2:43 a.m. local time from a taxiway
instead of the assigned runway at Ted Stevens Anchorage International
Airport, an incident that NTSB officials have called "a very serious
case" of a lapse in aviation safety.</P>
      <P>According to a preliminary NTSB report, the controllers at the
airport tower were aware that the plane was taking off from a taxiway
but did not radio the pilots to instruct them to abandon the take-off
attempt.</P>
      <P>Although the China Airlines flight CI-001 safely arrived in
Taiwan 10 hours later with its 237 passengers, three pilots and 12
flight attendants, investigators found signs that the plane's landing
gear scraped a mound of snow at the end of the 6,800-foot taxiway,
narrowly avoiding a disaster.</P>
      <P>The plane was supposed to have taken off from a 11,000-foot
northbound runway instead of the westbound taxiway.</P>
      <P>NTSB investigations are focusing on the experience and training
of the China Airlines flight crew, their handling of the events that
led to the error, the performance of the controllers at the airport
tower and the airport's facilities.</P>

      <P>Yu, who assumed the premiership Feb. 1, made the instruction
while inspecting the operations of the ministry.</P>
      <P>According to Vice Minister of Finance Wang Teh-shan, Yu asked the
ministry to coordinate with the Ministry of National Defense and the
Ministry of Education as soon as possible to redress the regulations
which he described as outdated.</P>
      <P>The premier reportedly said that the proposal to repeal the
preferential income tax treatment for teachers and servicemen was
first raised by then-Premier Tang Fei in the second half of 2000.</P>
      <P>As the issue remains unresolved, Yu asked the ministry to
coordinate with related ministries for a satisfactory solution.</P>
      <P>He said that the ministry should study ways to raise the wages of
teachers and servicemen before revoking the preferential treatment so
that their interests will not be affected.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC LAWMAKERS LOBBY THEIR FRENCH COUNTERPARTS FOR WHO ACCESS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Paris,  Feb. 5 (CNA)
(By Tzou Ming-jhie and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Republic of China (ROC) lawmakers
lobbied their French counterparts Tuesday in Paris for the ROC's bid
to join the World Health Organization (WHO) as an observer.</P>
      <P>The five lawmakers: Lai Ching-teh, Chiang Chi-wen, Liu Shih-fang,
Yeh Yi-chin and Chien Chao-tung, led by Presidential Adviser Wu
Shu-min, called on a group of pro-Taiwan French parliamentarians
Tuesday to seek their support for Taiwan's bid to join the WHO as an
observer.</P>
      <P>They were greeted by Senate Vice Speaker Jean-Louis Lorrain,
National Assembly Deputy Jean Francois Mattei and others.</P>
      <P>Legislator Lai who is a physician said Taiwan is an island with a
good health care system, but it could not get any aid from WHO when
it was hit by a 7.3-magnitute earthquake Sept. 21, 1999 because
it is not a member of the WHO.</P>
      <P>The earthquake claimed 2,400 lives and injured thousands of
people.</P>
      <P>Citing another example, Lai said Taiwan was plagued by illness
caused by the enterovirus in 1998, but had no way to know WHO's
precautionary measures against the disease.</P>
      <P>It is not difficult to become an observer of the organization
according to its charter. The Vatican, Palestine and the
International Red Cross are all WHO observers. There is no reason why
Taiwan should not be an observer too, Lai said.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chien Chao-tung said Taiwan's participation in the WHO
would be a win-win scenario where the country can share WHO's
health-care information and help WHO with its work by providing
medical aid to less-developed countries.</P>
      <P>Legislator Liu Shih-fang said WHO's worldwide anti-disease
network will continue to have a big loophole if Taiwan remains
excluded from the organization.</P>
      <P>Jean-Louis Lorrain was impressed with the ROC lawmakers'
reasoning. He said after the meeting that the ROC lawmakers made
clear their reasons for ROC's WHO bid and he believed that the WHO
will open its door to the island soon.</P>

expect to see; if I could only meet with scrupulous men I would be
satisfied. But in a state of society in which men must pretend to
possess what they really do not possess; pretend to have plenty, when
they have really nothing; and pretend to be in affluence when they
are in actual want -- in such a state of society, it is difficult to
be even a scrupulous man."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>M'LAND HAS STUDIED USING WTO FOR CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGES: ROC OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A visiting Republic of China official
said Wednesday that mainland China has recently studied the question
of whether to handle exchanges with Taiwan under the World Trade
Organization (WTO) framework after the admission of both sides into
the world trade regulatory body.</P>
      <P>John Deng, vice chairman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs
Council, made the remarks while speaking on how the two sides of the
Taiwan Strait can carry out exchanges under the WTO framework in a
speech sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a Washington-based think tank.</P>
      <P>Overall, Deng said, Beijing authorities do not intend to engage
in cross-strait dialogue or consultations under the framework of the
WTO, although information collected by the MAC shows that mainland
China has studied the issue.</P>
      <P>Beijing has yet to make clear its stance on using the mechanism
of the WTO to handle cross-strait trade issues, although Mainland
Chinese Vice Premier Qi Qichen did mention in a major speech late
last month that the WTO admission of both sides of the Taiwan Strait
is a new opportunity for the further development of cross-strait
trade.</P>
      <P>Deng said that both sides realize that the WTO will provide an
opportunity for the further development of cross-strait relations,
noting that not only will there be closer cross-strait trade and
economic relations, but both sides will also be able to use the WTO's
spirit of consultation to handle other issues resulting from closer
trade relations.</P>
      <P>Deng told the audience during his speech that the ROC has stated
openly several times that it is willing to make use of all possible
channels, including the WTO, to tackle problems resulting from
promoting cross-strait trade normalization.</P>
      <P>The ROC also realizes that the WTO is an international
organization that promotes trade among its members, Deng said, adding
that Taiwan hopes both sides can stick to dealing with trade issues
and refrain from bringing political issues into the WTO.</P>
      <P>The ROC also hopes that both sides handle cross-strait relations
based on the spirit of equality, and not confrontation, he said.</P>
      <P>With a new round of WTO talks set to begin, Deng said that both
sides can cooperate on many issues and that this can serve to promote
cross-strait trade if both sides realize this potential.</P>
      <P>Deng stressed that the ROC hopes the WTO will be a starting point
for the normalization of cross-strait relations, noting that greater
cooperation and exchanges between Taiwan and the mainland would
certainly help inject new strength into their respective economies
and contribute to the prosperity of the entire Asia-Pacific region.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI MAYOR REGRETS CABINET'S DECISION ON REVISED ALLOCATION LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  Feb.  6 (CNA)
(By Tang Ping-chun and Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday
that the Cabinet's decision to try to overturn a revision in the law
governing the allocation of government revenues and expenditures
showed that the central government is resorting to the old practice
of "centralization of power and financial resources."</P>
      <P>Ma, who is currently on a European tour and is in Amsterdam said
that he heard with regret of Premier Yu Shyi-kun's decision to ask
the legislature to reconsider the revised finance allocation law.</P>
      <P>As a matter of fact, President Chen Shui-bian was against the old
practice of "centralization of power and financial resources,"
according to Ma.</P>
      <P>An important promoter of the revision in the law, the mayor said
that the revision was meant to allow local governments more freedom
in managing their finances and to fulfill their basic needs. The
Cabinet's attempt to reverse the resolution of the previous
legislature gives the impression that it was a decision of political
concern rather than professional consideration, he added.</P>
      <P>Referring to Premier Yu's comment that the motion to reconsider
the revision was "a last resort" that he was forced to take, Ma said,
adding that it was understandable that the premier was concerned
about the development of relations and interactions between the
administration and the legislature.</P>
      <P>While the motion may lead to a confrontation between the ruling
and opposition camps at the beginning of the new legislature, Ma
said, it would definitely not reflect positively on the relations
between the Executive Yuan and the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Questioning the intention of the Cabinet's motion, Ma said that
the Executive Yuan has other alternatives if it finds the
implementation of the revised allocation law too difficult. While the
revised law will only be in force starting fiscal year 2003, the
Executive Yuan will have time in case it wishes to have further
revisions, he added.</P>
      <P>Ma said the revision approved by the previous legislature in
January will help the local governments greatly with their finances.
Kaohsiung City, for instance, will have NT$11.2 billion more revenues
from the annual allocations, while counties and provincial cities
will each have between NT$1 billion and NT$2 billion additional
revenue.</P>
      <P>The revised allocation law was initiated by the opposition
Kuomintang caucus in the Legislative Yuan at the last session of the
previous legislature.</P>
      <P>The revised law stipulates that starting fiscal 2003, 30 percent
of the income tax revenues, 50 percent of the business tax revenues
and 30 percent of the commodity tax revenues levied by local
governments should be given to the central government for public
financial redistribution. Currently, only 10 percent of the income
tax revenues, 40 percent of the business tax revenues, and 10 percent
of the commodity tax revenues are given to the central government for
redistribution.</P>
      <P>While the central government has more financial sources, the
revised law requires that the central government to set aside 7
percent of its revenues from these taxes as special funds for
emergency projects, and the rest should be allocated to local
governments. Taipei City should get 16 percent of the allocations,
Kaohsiung City 14 percent, counties and provincial cities together 48
percent, and villages and townships 15 percent.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan delivered the motion to the Legislative Yuan
Wednesday evening, hoping the new legislature will reconsider the
redistribution formula in view of a possible financial shortfall of
NT$150 billion caused by the revision.</P>
      <P>To override the motion for reconsideration, the opposition
parties need to mobilize 113 votes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET ASSESSING INHERITANCE TAX ISSUES: PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Thursday the
Cabinet is assessing the feasibility of lowering or scraping the
inheritance tax, stressing that this is only a proposal under study,
and not yet a government policy.</P>
      <P>The premier made the remarks one day after reports said that he
had instructed the Ministry of Finance to scrap or lower the
inheritance tax to avoid domestic capital flight overseas.</P>
      <P>Tsai Huang-liang, legislative party whip of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party, said that since the government currently channels
80 percent of inheritance tax revenues to local governments, the
scrapping of the inheritance tax will have a big impact on their
finances.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chiang Chao-yi said that though the scrapping of the
inheritance tax will help stem capital flight, it will run against
the principle of fairness and of government tax revenue collection.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of the Finance officials said that currently 95
percent of those who inherit do not have to pay inheritance tax and
that the total current value of inheritance taxes was around NT$25
billion (US$714.28 million) a year.</P>
      <P>P.K. Chiang, vice president of the legislature, said that the
issue of whether to scrap the inheritance tax can be studied, noting
that a lot of countries do not impose inheritance tax and such
taxation induces capital flight.</P>
      <P>But the former chief of the Council for Economic Planning and
Development also said that the adjustment of the inheritance tax will
have to take into consideration the reduced tax revenues, adding that
even if it is scrapped, it would be done in stages.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Cheng-yuan of the opposition Kuomintang said that
the current inheritance tax ratio is indeed high, and he has no
opposition to lowering it. But he thinks that scrapping it altogether
is not feasible.</P>
      <P>He said that the taxation of inheritance serves the function of
social equality.</P>
      <P>Current inheritance tax law stipulates that NT$7 million will be
exempt from inheritance taxation. This and NT$4 million for the
spouse and NT$1 million for the funeral expenditure means that the
average person will have up to NT$12 million exempt from inheritance
taxation. If the recipient of the inheritance has to support their
parents or children, or inherit agricultural lots, they enjoy extra
deductions.</P>
      <P>A major national conference in mid-August last year suggested to
study the inheritance tax system. The Ministry of Finance said that
in line with the suggestions, the ministry will complete its review
by September this year, although it will only study the scope and
ratio of the inheritance tax, and will not discuss scrapping the
inheritance tax.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW BREED OF ROC VOLUNTEERS HELP TAIWAN'S IMAGE OVERSEAS (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 7 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>God may help those that help themselves, but
in Taiwan, many people in their 20s or 30s are finding the rewards of
volunteering to work in foreign countries to help boost diplomacy.</P>
      <P>The International Cooperation and Development Fund (ICDF) under
the ROC Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) began to train a new
generation of Taiwan volunteers five years ago amid the rising
popularity of voluntary services around the world.</P>
      <P>ICDF Secretary-General Yang Tzu-pao said in a recent interview
that Taiwan has sent agricultural and fishery experts to assist its
diplomatic allies in economic development since the early 1960s.</P>
      <P>"Many of these specialists are aging and our diplomatic budget
has been shrinking in recent years. Against this backdrop, we must
use a more cost-efficient way to accomplish what we should do in the
diplomatic arena," Yang explained.</P>
      <P>In addition, he said, the foreign ministry needs an injection of
new blood and new vitality into its work force.</P>
      <P>"The ICDF then took the initiative to cultivate a new breed of
volunteers," Yang said. "Over the past five years, more than 60
professional volunteers have joined our diplomatic corps to work in
selected countries with or without diplomatic ties with Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Yang said the trained Taiwan volunteers have been using
unofficial methods to strive for expansion of the Republic of China's
diplomatic frontiers. "With professional expertise and perseverance,
they are helping governments and people of other countries better
understand Taiwan."</P>
      <P>According to Yang, the new crop of Taiwan volunteers share
several common features. "They are very young and mostly come from
well-to-do families," Yang said, adding that he admires their
determination to suspend their career pursuits and sometimes carefree
lives in Taiwan and travel to unfamiliar and even barren lands to
help others.</P>
      <P>Yang admitted that the ICDF has suffered some setbacks in
training and dispatching the new-style volunteers.</P>
      <P>"All of the five volunteers sent to our African diplomatic ally
of Swaziland in 1997 failed to serve out their working contracts
because they failed to adapt to the living environment there," Yang
recalled.</P>
      <P>The following year, he said, 50 percent of the volunteers
assigned to the Central American country of Honduras also had to
return home ahead of schedule because of similar reasons.</P>
      <P>After more than five years of experimenting and making
improvements, Yang said the ICDF is now able to train and send
qualified volunteers for overseas assignments without any problems.</P>
      <P>Recounting the ICDF's volunteer training programs and procedures,
Kao Hsiao-ling, an ICDF division chief in charge of volunteer
affairs, said what impresses her most is the passion and undaunted
spirit shown by the young volunteers.</P>
      <P>"Many local people have taken part in domestic voluntary
services, but they tend to work on a short-term basis," Kao said. "In
contrast, the ICDF volunteers must work abroad for at least two
years."</P>
      <P>In her view, Kao said, it's no easy feat for these youthful
volunteers. "Besides their heavy workload, they have to tackle many
difficult language and cultural barriers and adapt to alien working
and living environments."</P>
      <P>Given that their presence in foreign countries may enhance the
profile of Taiwan abroad, these volunteers are cut from a very
special bolt of cloth. Three of them recalled their overseas sagas
during their recent vacation trips to Taipei.
WHAT A HELL</P>
      <P>"What a hell!" was the mantra that Lee Shu-chin often murmured to
herself in the first few weeks after her arrival in Myitkyina, the
third-largest city in Myanmar.</P>
      <P>"It's no ordinary city. It's more like a wasteland in northern
Myanmar," Lee said. "Almost none of its roadways have pavement.
Pedestrians and vehicles travel along in a dusty haze. Rundown
tricycles serve as 'taxi cabs' and its city buses carry not only
people but pigs."

      <P>"I had to adapt myself quickly to a life that has electricity
supply only between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m., and then again between 6 p.m.
and 10 p.m.," Lee recalled. "And simply for taking a bath, I had to
draw water from a well and heat it with charcoal fire."</P>
      <P>While struggling to get accustomed to her new life, Lee was also
taking pains to fulfill her duty as an ICDF volunteer -- teaching
English and history at the senior high school section of a Chinese
school in Myitkyina.</P>
      <P>Lee, who has a master's degree from a U.S. university, said that
at the beginning, she had to use a number of hand signs and body
language to communicate with her students as most of them were
neither fluent in Chinese nor English.</P>
      <P>The 30-year-old's determination to serve out her two-year
volunteer contract faced a severe test after an accidental fall while
preparing hot water for a bath which resulted in burning most of her
body. In addition to enduring debilitating pain, Lee was very anxious
over the possibility of infection by mosquito bites.</P>
      <P>Due to the seriousness of her burns and poor medical services
available in Myanmar, Lee had to return to Taiwan for treatment. On
the eve of her departure, her doctor asked Lee whether she would
return after she recovered. Without pausing, Lee replied: "Of course.
I will return as my dream has not yet been realized."</P>
      <P>Lee told the bewildered doctor that her decision to give up her
NT$40,000-a-month job to work as a volunteer with a living expense of
about NT$10,000 was mainly prompted by her desire to enrich her life
with some exceptional, meaningful episodes.</P>
      <P>"Although I had some doubts about my wisdom after suffering the
burns, I had braced up again. I would not shorten my service just
because of a single setback," Lee said.</P>
      <P>The brave woman really went to Myitkyina again to continue her
voluntary service after regaining her health.
LIFE IN PANAMA</P>
      <P>In comparison, Tsai Pei-chi's tale was completely different. The
21-year-old was assigned to teach Chinese at the largest Chinese
school in Panama City, Panama's capital, after finishing the
ICDF-organized training courses.</P>
      <P>Panama is one of the most advanced countries in Latin America. It
has a world renowned canal and many skyscrapers. "Some people say if
you come to Panama City at night, you may mistake it for New York's
Manhattan," Tsai said jokingly. "I originally expected to work in a
backward area to get a taste of hardship and the old-fashioned
lifestyle."</P>
      <P>Much to her "disappointment," Tsai said she has not found a large
gap between lives in Taipei and Panama City. Her challenges mainly
lie in her work. She has to teach the school's first graders to speak
Mandarin under the Panamanian regulations that require "no homework
and no corporal punishment."</P>
      <P>"All of my students are born in Panama. Despite their Chinese
origin, they are more like Panamanians. It's not easy to have them
speak Chinese, and few of them know where Taiwan is," she sighed.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Tsai said she has learned much after one year of
voluntary work in the Central American state. "I feel that I have
changed a great deal," Tsai said during her recent vacation trip to
Taipei. "I found that I can no longer tolerate the frivolous
lifestyle to which I was so accustomed in the past. I want to return
to Panama soon to continue my work and 'simple but orderly and
exuberant life' there."
MODEL VOLUNTEER</P>
      <P>In the eyes of the ICDF staff, Huang Hsing-wei deserves the title
of a "model volunteer" as she has adapted herself well to both work
and everyday life in Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>A Spanish major, Huang said her strong curiosity about Spanish
culture and Spanish-speaking countries had pushed her to abandon a
teaching contract in Taiwan and travel halfway around the globe to
work as a volunteer.</P>
      <P>Huang has been teaching Chinese at a school known as the most
expensive educational institute in Managua, Nicaragua's capital. The
age of her students varies from nine to those in their 60s.</P>
      <P>In her view, Huang said, Nicaragua is a country where wealth is
not equitably distributed. "While the rich and the famous reside in
plush houses, beggars are common street scenes even in the capital
city." (To be continued)</P>

      <P>For security reasons, Huang recalled, she kept a dog shortly
after her arrival in Managua. Five months later, the dog died in a
traffic accident near where she lived. When she went to a night
school to study Spanish literature that day, a frustrated Huang told
her classmates the sad story.</P>
      <P>The following day, her classmates gave her a lovely dog and told
her: "You're not alone here. You have friends all around." Huang said
she wept. "The tears were shed for my classmates' kindness and
friendship."</P>
      <P>Because of geographical distance, Huang said, Nicaraguan people
are unfamiliar with Taiwan. "They generally feel that Taiwan is a
mysterious country. One student once asked me whether all the people
in Taiwan eat mice as a normal part of their diet."</P>
      <P>With her superb adaptability, Huang has managed to take time out
of her busy working schedule to attend a night school to advance her
knowledge about Spanish language and culture. "I like my work and
life in Nicaragua and am considering extending my job contract for
another year."</P>

      <P>The 312 companies located in the Hsinchu
Science-based Industrial Park had a combined annual turnover of
NT$662.5 billion (US$18.9 billion) in 2001, down 28.7 percent from
the previous year, park administrators announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>The park's deputy director, Yen Tsung-ming, said that last year
marked the first time that the park registered negative growth since
it opened in 1980. The high-tech companies posted 43 percent annual
growth in combined sales in both 2000 and 1999.</P>
      <P>Yen said that the companies are expected to regain momentum with
10 percent to 20 percent annual growth this year, aided by an
additional 35 companies capitalized at about NT$28.1 billion (US$802
million) that are applying to set up in the park. Fifty-one companies
set up shop in the park in 2001.</P>
      <P>IC manufacturers, whose annual turnover in 2001 accounted for 57
percent of the total turnover of the companies in the park, suffered
the greatest decline in aggregate sales last year, at 35 percent
year-on-year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, turnover for computer and peripheral manufacturers,
whose aggregate sales accounted for 24.3 percent of the park's total,
slipped 25 percent from 2000.</P>
      <P>Telecommunications and biotechnology companies in the park were
the only industries that showed sales growth in 2001, at 11 percent

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has
recently made a proposal to Premier Yu Shyi-kun that the government
set aside NT$30 billion in the next six years to help solve the
problem of sluggish sales of industrial land, an economic official
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The changes in the industrial structure and the mass exit of
traditional industries have had a great impact on Taiwan's industrial
zones, and vacant industrial zones which the government and the
private sector have spent tremendous amounts of money on are all
around the island, according the official.</P>
      <P>While high costs to acquire or to rent industrial land remains an
important factor that prevents manufacturing industries from moving
into industrial zones, the MOEA has suggested that the government set
aside NT$5 billion annually from 2003 to 2008 to acquire the land,
and then sell or rent it to manufacturers at low prices.</P>
      <P>In the past years, the government has invested NT$78.4 billion in
developing industrial land, according to statistics released by the
Industrial Development Bureau.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China's National
Security Council Adviser Kau Ying-mao, who has been tapped to be the
vice minister of foreign affairs, said in Washington Wednesday that
Beijing is going out of its way to "denationalize" the ROC.</P>
      <P>Taipei should guard against Beijing's intentions amid a rush of
Taiwan businessmen anxious to do business in the mainland, Kau
warned.</P>
      <P>Kau was speaking at a symposium organized by the Washington-based
Center for Strategic and International Studies on Taiwan's economy.</P>
      <P>Noting that the more modernized and the deeper democratization
mainland China becomes, the easier it will be for the ROC to engage
with the People's Republic of China, Kau said Beijing is bucking the
worldwide trend of globalization by building up its military strength
and deploying missiles across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>There are no signs, however, that Beijing will ever move to the
path of democratization, Kau said.</P>
      <P>Beijing has never renounced the use of force against Taiwan, and
is bending over backward to isolate Taiwan diplomatically with an eye
to depriving the island of its statehood, Kau said, adding that this
may explain why Beijing has always insisted that there is only one
China.</P>
      <P>Michael Hsiao, an adviser to President Chen Shui-bian, echoed
Kau's views at the symposium, saying that the economic ties between
Taiwan and mainland China cannot be normalized because of politics
which cannot be separated from cross-strait economic ties.</P>
      <P>The absence of trust between Taipei and Beijing gives politics a
considerable role to play in cross-strait trade and economic
exchanges, and economic decisions cannot be made without taking
political factors into account, Hsiao said.</P>
      <P>Both Kau and Hsiao arrived in Washington Monday along with a
group of Taiwan politicians and academics to attend the U.S. National
Prayer Breakfast on Thursday.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAINLAND CHINESE MILITARY TRAINING `BECOMING REALISTIC': CIA CHIEF</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  6  (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan remains the focus of Beijing's
military modernization programs and the goal of mainland China's
military training exercises are now more focused on gaining
"real-world" experience than before, according to George Tenet,
director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.</P>
      <P>Over the past year, Tenet told a Senate panel Wednesday, Beijing
has been "emphasizing rigorous practice and operational capabilities,
and improving the military's actual ability to use force."</P>
      <P>"This is aimed not only at Taiwan," he said, "but at increasing
the risk to the United States itself in any future Taiwan
contingency."</P>
      <P>In a separate testimony given before the Senate Select Committee
on Intelligence, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency also
said Beijing's ability to attack Taiwan will have grown significantly
by the end of the decade.</P>
      <P>"By 2005-2010, China's conventional force modernization will
provide an increasingly credible military threat for short-duration
attacks against Taiwan," said Vice Adm. Thomas Wilson.</P>
      <P>Wilson said, however, that he is less concerned than a year ago
about the prospects of a major confrontation between the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>In a prepared testimony, Tenet said that Beijing's latest policy
statement -- inviting select members of Taiwan's Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) to visit the mainland -- was "designed as a
conciliatory gesture."</P>
      <P>Beijing might resume a more confrontational stance, however, if
it suspects President Chen Shui-bian of using the DPP's gain in the
legislative elections last December to move toward independence,
Tenet added.</P>
      <P>Both Tenet and Wilson believe that Beijing would like to see
stability in its foreign policy front, particularly in ties with the
United States, while trying to cope with domestic challenges related
to their accession to the World Trade Organization and the imminent
leadership succession.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's ties with Washington, Tenet said the nature of the
bilateral relationship remains the same, despite the new atmosphere
of cooperation -- particularly on counter-terrorism -- following the
terrorist attacks in New York and Washington last September.</P>
      <P>"September 11th changed the context of China's approach to us,"
he said, "but it did not change the fundamentals."</P>
      <P>He said that the mainland is developing an increasingly
competitive economy and building a modern military force with the
ultimate objective of asserting itself as a great power in East Asia.</P>
      <P>Although Beijing joined the coalition against terrorism, he told
the senators, it remains skeptical of U.S. intentions in Central and
South Asia and views Washington's encouragement of a Japanese role in
counter-terrorism as support for Japanese rearmament, which Beijing
firmly opposes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CROSS-STRAIT WTO ENTRY TO REDUCE POLITICAL TENSION: US OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington  D.C.  Feb. 6 (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Ed Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The World Trade Organization (WTO)
is not supposed to be a venue for political agendas, but with entry
by both sides of the Taiwan Strait, tensions between Taiwan and
mainland China should ease, a senior U.S. trade official said in
Washington Wednesday.</P>
      <P>William H. Lash III, U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce for
Market Access and Compliance, said the two sides of the Taiwan Strait
will gradually find economic cooperation through their repeated
contacts at WTO meetings.</P>
      <P>Lash, who visited Taipei last Jan. 22, said that the United
States attached importance to Taiwan's WTO admission and said that
the United States will continue to support Taiwan as a good WTO
member.</P>
      <P>Lash made the remarks while delivering a speech at a seminar on
Taiwan's economic development outlook sponsored by the Center for
Strategic &amp; International Studies (CSIS), a U.S. think tank.</P>
      <P>Lash said that although the WTO is not a place to discuss
political affairs, Taiwan and mainland Chinese WTO entry will reduce
political tensions between the two sides because they will have to
deal with each other and further improve their relations through
repeated contacts at WTO meetings.</P>
      <P>Lash said that his viewpoint was basically as same as the
viewpoint stated by U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick.</P>
      <P>Zoellick said on Jan. 31 that substantial economic relations
between Taiwan and mainland China already existed before the two
sides became members of the WTO. Both Taiwan and mainland China can
regard WTO as a channel of communications and negotiations to
mutually review their respective regulations and laws to speed up
talks and negotiations.</P>
      <P>WTO participation is just a beginning, Lash pointed out, adding
that difficulties lay ahead.</P>
      <P>Touching on intellectual property rights protection, Lash urged
Taiwan and mainland China to be vigilant for the sake of "your own
interests." "You will eventually benefit from the implement of
intellectual property rights protection," Lash said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan is experienced in international trade, Lash said, adding
that Taiwan's admission into WTO has set a good example.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has the ability to make contributions to the WTO, Lash
added.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan agricultural officials warned
Thursday that although there have been no reports of avian flu
outbreaks on the island, local chicken farms should heighten their
alert, adopt preventive measures and report any suspicious cases
immediately.</P>
      <P>The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine
under the Council of Agriculture recommended that travelers should
refrain from visiting chicken farms in Hong Kong or mainland China in
order not to risk the safety of Taiwan's poultry industry.</P>
      <P>The bureau urged all local chicken farmers to take extra
sterilization measures when entering or leaving their farms and to
make sure their chickens are not given the opportunity to mingle with
waterfowl, which might carry the virus.</P>
      <P>About 186,000 chickens were killed in Hong Kong this week in an
attempt to contain the spread of avian flu.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will begin another massive
crackdown on illegal radio stations after the Lunar New Year holiday
and anticipates eradicating all illegal stations by the end of the
year, Vice Minister of Transportation and Communications Tsai Tui
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that the Cabinet has formally established a special
task force to handle the crackdown on the 130-some illegal stations
that remain unlicensed, disrupting aviation communications and
"affecting public safety."</P>
      <P>According to the Directorate General of Telecommunications, 663
pieces of broadcast equipment were seized over the past five years,
with over NT$10 million (US$285,000) in fines levied and 184 people
convicted, with the longest sentence being three years and five
months in prison.</P>
      <P>Although the government has released 10 batches of frequencies
since 1993, allowing illegal stations to apply for broadcast
licenses, only 151 broadcasters have taken advantage of the
government's liberalizing moves.</P>
      <P>Official figures indicate that most of the illegal stations
provide programming content such as astrology, medicine sales and

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN REGISTERS RECORD-HIGH TRADE SURPLUS IN JANUARY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's foreign trade totaled US$17.05
billion in January, leaving a trade surplus of US$2.33 billion, a
record monthly high, according to statistics released Thursday by the
Ministry of Finance.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports in January totaled US$9.69 billion, while
imports reached US$7.36 billion.</P>
      <P>Although the figures represented drops of 1.4 percent and 20.9
percent, respectively, on a year-on-year basis, Taiwan registered the
23rd consecutive monthly trade surplus.</P>
      <P>MOF officials said the decline of exports in January narrowed to
a single digit from the double-digit falls registered since April of
last year.</P>
      <P>The officials added that although signs of prosperity in Taiwan's
foreign trade remain unclear, exports are expected to grow in May or
June, while growth in imports will lag slightly.</P>
      <P>The officials attributed the decline of 20.9 percent in imports
in January to the abundant stocks held by importers last year because
of the recession.</P>
      <P>Referring to this year's economic prospects, the officials cited
an IMF report on the world economy issued last December, saying that
many countries are adopting more relaxed monetary policies,
international oil prices are falling and the economic structures of
many countries are improving. All these are conducive to the recovery
of the world economy, the officials added.</P>
      <P>The U.S. economy is also emerging from recession, although
slowly, while Japanese economic prospects are less optimistic because
of a lack of consumer confidence, low stock prices, bad financial
systems and slow structural reform, according to the officials.</P>
      <P>Turning to Taiwan, the officials maintained that the island's
economy is expected to shake off the recession this year, thanks to
the government's implementation of public construction projects,
promotion of financial and economic reforms and improvement of the
investment environment, in addition to the increased trade exchanges
brought about by the entry of both sides of the Taiwan Strait to the
World Trade Organization.</P>

(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior official of the Formosa Plastics
Group (FPG) said Thursday that FPG will keep not only its roots but
also its entire enterprises in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>FPG General Manager Wang Yung-tsai admitted that FPG has invested
in the petrochemical industry in mainland China along with the
largest petrochemical industry in the United States, he said that
FPG's investment represents only a small share of the total compared
with the U.S. investment.</P>
      <P>Asked to comment on Economics Minister Christine Tsung's remarks
that FPG cannot blame the government for its business setbacks, Wang
stressed that the group should blame only itself for its bad
performance. However, he added that the government should take
responsibility for failing to lead the growth of Taiwan's
enterprises.</P>
      <P>He reiterated that FPG will adhere to government policy but
stressed that the government should help the private sector grow.</P>
      <P>Wang said that private sector investment in the mainland is a
trend because domestic enterprises are not competing with mainland
enterprises but with global enterprises. Taiwan's competitiveness
will only increase if local enterprises can take advantage of the
mainland's cheap labor, he added.</P>
      <P>Commenting on Tsung's remark that national interests are more
important than the interests of private enterprises, Wang said that
he agrees with the viewpoint but attaches importance nonetheless to
the mainland market.</P>
      <P>Wang also expressed doubt over Tsung's prediction that Taiwan's
economy will take off within two years.</P>

    <HEADLINE>LEGISLATURE  TO  VOTE  ON GOVERNMENT ALLOCATION MOTION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 7 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan agreed Thursday to vote
on an Executive Yuan motion to reconsider the revised Law Governing
the Allocation of Government Revenues and Expenditures on Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>The agreement, worked out after negotiations among the four main
political parties and independent lawmakers, will give Premier Yu
Shyi-kun a chance to explain the reasons for the motion and field 
questions from legislators, after which a vote will be taken.</P>
      <P>Although the government has said the motion for reconsideration
is more a fiscal than a political issue, it is expected nevertheless
to cause a showdown between the ruling and opposition parties.</P>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party vowed to support the
motion for reconsideration. However, DPP Legislative Whip Tsai
Huang-lang said the party will not discipline party lawmakers who do
not follow the party line in the vote, given that the issue is not
political.</P>
      <P>Since the revised law will hurt rather than benefit local
governments, Tsai said he believes any "sensitive" lawmakers will
vote for the motion to annul the revision in the interests of their
own constituencies, even without urging from the party.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the main opposition Kuomintang, which initiated the
changes and railroaded them through the legislature on the last day
of the last session, vowed to override the motion and threatened to
discipline any party lawmakers who flout the party's policy.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng gave a pep talk to party
lawmakers Thursday day in which he claimed that the motion for
reconsideration is "both unwise and unnecessary."</P>
      <P>He rebutted Premier Yu's claim that the revised law, which obliges
the central government to give more of its revenues to the country's
local governments, is "impractical" and said it is not an emergency
requiring a motion of reconsideration.</P>
      <P>Lin added that the motion, coming as it does at the beginning of
the new legislature and new administration, will only spark
confrontation between the two branches of the government, which is
not in the best interest of the nation.</P>
      <P>He accused Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics chief Lin Chuan, who spearheaded the government's campaign
to scuttle the revised law, of hypocrisy, saying that Lin had spoken
out for more revenue to be allocated to local governments in
1995-1998 when he served as financial chief of Taipei city government,
but has reversed his position since serving in the central
government.</P>

      <P>Although New York City Mayor Michael

some 65 percent of the city's voters approve of his performance,
according to the results of a poll released Wednesday.</P>

percent of those surveyed gave Bloomberg a negative rating on his

about the next four years with Bloomberg in office.</P>
      <P>Bloomberg's performance approval rating was slightly better than
the 58 percent his predecessor Rudolph Giuliani received in a poll by

    <HEADLINE>ROC URGED TO FURTHER RELAX POLICIES TOWARD TOURISTS FROM OVERSEAS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>All 15 members of the first group of
mainland Chinese tourists to visit Taiwan made a common statement
near the end of their four-day visit, saying they would like to visit
Taiwan again but only after the island relaxes its policies toward
mainland visitors.</P>
      <P>The group of mainland Chinese tourists residing in Japan, led by
Jin Huei, president of a travel agency in Osaka, was the first group
of mainlanders to visit Taiwan since the Republic of China government
at the beginning of this year opened Taiwan to tour-group visits by
mainland Chinese citizens.</P>
      <P>"Everything was good while we were touring Taiwan, except that
there were too many rules," said Jin, reflecting the opinions of his
tour companions who complained that the rule requiring the group
members to return to their hotel rooms no later than 11 p.m. every
night was "ridiculous."</P>
      <P>Commenting on the curfew -- which Jin reckoned is a measure that
was adopted by the ROC government to prevent the "mainlanders" from
overstaying their visas or absconding -- Jin said he is 100 percent
sure that none of the group members, all of whom are senior citizens
enjoying a certain level of social and economic status in Japan,
would abscond during their short stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, all the tour group members, who are scheduled to
depart Taiwan Friday for home, expressed regret for only being able
to visit for four days, saying it is too short a period of time.</P>
      <P>Carrying packages of Taiwan's famous Oolong tea and powdered pork
with them as souvenirs to take back to Japan, the tourists said the
next time they visit they will definitely not miss visiting such
scenic spots as Mt. Ali and Sun Moon Lake in southern and central
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>For those in the group who were born in Taiwan -- more than 50
years ago -- being unable to travel to southern Taiwan to visit their
birthplaces was particularly regrettable, according to Jin.</P>
      <P>Over the past three days, the mainland Chinese tourists have
visited famous tourist attractions in the greater Taipei area,
including the National Palace Museum, Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall,
the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, Lungshan Temple and the Martyrs'
Shrine.</P>
      <P>They have also toured the Wulai hot-spring resort area, sampled
the well-known Taiwanese snack foods in the Shihlin night market and
enjoyed banquet-like feasts at various restaurants ranging from
Shanghai-style to Peking-style.</P>
      <P>In addition to eating out and sightseeing, the tourists -- most
of whom are in their 60s and 70s and leaders of major mainland
Chinese organizations in Tokyo, Osaka and Kobe -- stayed at the
five-star Taipei Westin Hotel. The four-day three-night package cost
each of them NT$20,000.</P>
      <P>"Taiwan is so close to Kobe, but I have waited for nearly 50
years to enter the island," said Lin Tung-chun, one of the tour
members, upon arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport
Tuesday.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to boost exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait, the ROC government enacted a policy Jan. 1 allowing mainland
Chinese citizens with permanent resident status in a foreign country
as well as mainland students studying abroad to make pleasure trips
to the island.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Taipei Association of Travel Agents said the
second mainland tour group will probably arrive after the Chinese New
Year, which falls on Feb. 12 this year.</P>
      <P>Tourist sources said scores of mainland Chinese residents in San
Francisco have expressed interest in joining a Taiwan-mainland China
tour package organized by a travel agency there.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>BIOBUSINESS Asia 2002, the first
bio-business conference in the Asia-Pacific region, will be held Feb.
28-March 1 at the Far Eastern Plaza Hotel in Taipei.</P>
      <P>More than 300 experts in the biomedical field as well as
representatives from research institutions and venture capital
companies will attend the two-day event.</P>
      <P>Organized by the Industrial Technology Research Institute's
(ITRI) Biomedical Engineering Center (BMEC), the conference is being
co-sponsored by Bayer Taiwan Co., Becton, Dickinson and Company,
Celera Genomics Group, China Development Industrial Bank, the
Industrial Bank of Taiwan, Integrated Taxonomic Information Systems,
MDS Capital, Merrill Lynch, MPM Asset Management LLC, and
Pricewaterhouse Coopers LLP.</P>
      <P>Experts attending the conference will introduce the global trends
in biotechnology as well as successful business models and investment
opportunities, according to conference chairman Dr. Johnsee Lee, BMEC
general director.</P>
      <P>Lee said that the conference will provide biotechnology firms in
Asia an opportunity to introduce their research and development
achievements to the world. More than 20 manufacturers in the United
States, Israel, India, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Singapore and
Taiwan are attending the conference to look for partnership
opportunities.</P>
      <P>On Feb. 27, the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum's biotechnology
conference, which will focus more on policy, regulations and
infrastructure of biotechnology in the Asia-Pacific region, will be
held at the same venue. Representatives from seven countries in the
region will attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>While biotechnology is deemed one of the research areas with the
most potential in the 21st century, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
in recent years has coordinated the efforts of the industry as well
as academic institutions to upgrade Taiwan's biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industries.</P>
      <P>As of the end of last year, there were 150 biotechnology firms in
Taiwan and the number of contract research organizations has
continued to grow.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of the government and business community, the
ITRI in July 1999 set up the BMEC. The center has coordinated the
institute's expertise in electronics as well as mechanical and
material technologies to conduct multidiscipline biomedical research
projects, such as those for biochips, biomaterials and medical
devices.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN NEEDS TO MAKE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AWARE OF ROC STANCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  7  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A senior advisor to the Republic of
China's Presidential Office said Thursday in Washington D.C. that
faced with the constant threat from mainland China, Taiwan needs
high-tech weapons for defense and also needs to make the
international community aware that Taiwan's only goal is for peace
and stability.</P>
      <P>Peng Ming-min, who headed a ROC delegation of politicians and
academics at the U.S. National Prayer Breakfast Thursday, made the
remarks when he addressed a dinner party given in the delegation's
honor by Chen Chien-jen, the ROC representative to the United States.</P>
      <P>Speaking to around 240 overseas and academic leaders in the
greater Washington area, he said that Taiwan's political changeover
in 2000 has shown that Taiwan is moving toward mature democratic
development.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan has turned from an authoritarian regime to a
democratic society over the past 15 years, and that the people of
Taiwan now enjoy full freedom of speech and assembly. Although the
democratic system is not yet perfected and although there is some
chaos in the wake of the political changeover, Peng claimed that this
is because neither the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, which
swept the Kuomintang (KMT) from its five-decade grip on power, nor
the KMT have played by the rules.</P>
      <P>Peng said that he is convinced that through repeated trial and
error and reforms, Taiwan's democratic system will mature.</P>
      <P>He said that if there is another political changeover within a
few years, the adjustment difficulties will be greatly lessened.</P>
      <P>Michael Hsiao, an adviser to President Chen Shui-bian, also said
that the concept of democracy still needs to be entrenched in the
general public in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Kau Ying-mao, an adviser to the ROC National Security Council,
who has been named vice foreign minister, noted that he met with U.S.
officials, parliamentarians, scholars and media during his visit and
that they understand that Taiwan's request for the basic values of
democracy, peace and stability is the same as that of the United
States and in line with the goals and interests of U.S. policy in the
Western Pacific.</P>
      <P>Legislator Parris Chang and Taiwan Institute of Economic Research
Director Wu Rong-yi, said that Taiwan's economic and political
prospect are not as grim as media reports have claimed.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>An official in charge of mainland China
policy urged Beijing to be open-minded in welcoming members of the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party in "their appropriate
capacities."</P>
      <P>Speaking in an interview with a local radio station, Vice
Chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chen Ming-tung said
that compared with the verbal attacks and military intimidation in
1996 when Taiwan held its first popular presidential election, and
the verbal attacks in the run-up to the 2000 presidential election,
mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen's remarks last month on
welcoming visits by DPP members seems more relaxed than before.</P>
      <P>But he also said that although there appears to have been a
modest change in Beijing's attitude, the basic precept of "one
country, two systems" has not changed.</P>
      <P>Chen said that as a democratic country, the people of the
Republic of China enjoys the freedom of expression, that the mainland
should be open-minded toward Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He noted that the atmosphere between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait is subdued and that there is currently no saber-rattling, but
he added that the mainland should face the reality of Taiwan's
existence.</P>
      <P>He also said that since the two sides have joined the World Trade
Organization, they should take that as an opportunity to forge a
channel for mutual exchanges.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S MAJOR PORK PRODUCER SAYS TAISUGAR PORK SAFE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan Sugar Corp. (Taisugar), the largest
pork producer in Taiwan, reassured pork consumers islandwide Friday
that all the company's swine are chemically tested and verified safe
before being sold to private butcher shops.</P>
      <P>Responding to a recent Chang Gung Memorial Hospital report that
blames the abuse of antibiotics used on meat-producing swine as being
partly to blame for the drug resistance of certain deadly bacteria in
pigs, Taisugar Vice President Yeh Hung-chan claimed that
Taisugar-contracted pig farms have never used antibiotics, including
ciprofloxacin, or growth-boosting chemicals.</P>
      <P>Taisugar pig farms do use certain germ-killing chemicals to
assure the swine's growth, he went on, but stressed that all doses
are stopped 130 days before the animals are sold or after the pigs
have reached a weight of 50 kilograms -- a policy adopted to ensure
that no chemical residue is left in the pigs before they go to the
butchers.</P>
      <P>The Chang Gung Memorial Hospital report has caused widespread
concern among consumers and butcher shops are afraid that pork sales
over Chinese New Year will be badly affected.</P>
      <P>In the report, Dr. Chiu Cheng-hsun said that because of excessive
use of antibiotics, the local strain of salmonella enterica serotype
choleraesuis has become immune to nearly all of the most effective
bacteria-fighting drugs, such as ciprofloxacin.</P>
      <P>Chiu stated that since the drug-resistant bacteria can be passed
on to humans through the ingestion of infected meat, many Taiwan
residents could die if they become infected by eating such meat.</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Laborers in Taiwan had a tempestuous year in
2001, with rising unemployment and controversy over revisions to the
Labor Standards Law, according to an analysis based on news reports
concerning laborers in the past year.</P>
      <P>The National Policy Foundation (NPF), an opposition Kuomintang
think tank, released the analysis Friday.</P>
      <P>The amendment of the Labor Standards Law regarding maximum
working hours and its repercussions was chosen as the news event with
the greatest social impact.</P>
      <P>The amendment cut the maximum working hours per employee from 48
hours per week to 84 hours every two weeks, effective Jan. 1, 2001.
As the amendment impacted business and industry, especially in the
face of the recession, industrial and trade associations called on
the government to adopt supplementary measures to reduce the adverse
impact.</P>
      <P>Other items that drew the focus of public attention included
flexible new regulations regarding workers' retirement funds and
pension payments, the jobless population exceeding 500,000, Council
of Labor Affairs restrictions on recruitment of foreign workers,
heavy losses of the labor insurance and workers' pension funds, the
difference between labor policies and the expectations of the
laborers, and the proposal of the Council of Economic Planning and
Development to cancel the minimum wage level regulation, according to
the analysis.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI DOME COULD BE COMPLETED IN 3 YEARS: CITY OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>If everything goes well, the construction of
a domed stadium could begin this year at the earliest and be
completed in three years after the government approved the plan under
conditions the previous day, a Taiepi City government spokesman said
Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Yu-sheng, director of the Information Department of the city
government made the remarks when commenting on the approval of the
long-stalled project by the Council for Economic Planning and
Development under four conditions.</P>
      <P>Wu said that Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou has expressed his
appreciation for the government's "professional" review of the
matter.</P>
      <P>Mayor Ma was elated to learn that the government has approved the
construction of a domed stadium on the site of the Sungshan tobacco
factory, Wu added.</P>
      <P>The project to construct a 45,000-seat stadium was approved in a
coordination meeting a day earlier by the CEPD, under four
conditions.</P>
      <P>The CEPD instructed the Taipei city government to take into
account the fact that the Sungshan tobacco factory is designated as a
historic site, and that the stadium project must consider the impact
on the historic value of the site.</P>
      <P>As the site is located close to the Sungshan domestic airport,
the CEPD also said that a height limitation must be imposed for the
sake of aviation safety.</P>
      <P>The city government must also communicate with area residents,
some of whom are opposed to the construction plan, the CEPD said.</P>
      <P>The central government also agreed that the city government can
appropriate the land needed for the project, but must pay, either
with cash or comparable land elsewhere. The land occupied by the
tobacco factory is valued at about NT$29.2 billion (US$831.9 million)
according to current prices.</P>
      <P>Wu said that the city government believes the first three
conditions can be met, while the most difficult part will be the land
acquisition.</P>
      <P>He said the city government appreciates the central government's
understanding of the city government's financial straits, evidenced
by its willingness to accept a "land for land" deal instead.</P>
      <P>But he added that the city government in fact does not have a
single landlot equivalent in value to that of the Sungshan site and
will have to collect various scattered lots for the exchange.
However, this would then affect future construction plans, so it is
not certain if will be acceptable to the central government.</P>

(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The United States expects the Taiwan
issue to come up during President George W. Bush's visit to Beijing
later this month but U.S. policy will not change as a result, a
senior U.S. official said Thursday.</P>
      <P>"The Chinese will try to get us to discuss Taiwan but we don't
have much room there for discussion," said the White House official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.</P>
      <P>"There will be no change in our policy toward Taiwan," he said
during a background briefing for Washington-based reporters from
Japan, South Korea and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Bush leaves Washington Feb. 16 for a six-day trip to Tokyo, Seoul
and Beijing. This is originally part of a visit last October that was
cut short because of America's counter-terrorism campaign in
Afghanistan.</P>
      <P>Bush is scheduled to arrive in Beijing Feb. 21, the 30th
anniversary of the first trip to mainland China by U.S. President
Richard Nixon.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the president may issue a joint statement with
Chinese leaders to commemorate that historic event, the senior
official said, "There may be some kind of statement."</P>
      <P>"Actually, what's more important," he said, "is to use this visit
as an opportunity to look to the future."</P>
      <P>The official said that Washington appreciates the muted reaction
to Bush's decision late last year to pull out of the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty with the Russians.</P>
      <P>He said that Bush will also thank Beijing's leaders for their
cooperation in the war on terrorism.</P>
      <P>Bush is expected to spend less than 48 hours in Beijing, during
which a meeting with President Jiang Zemin and a speech at Chinghwa
University are planned. He will also see the Great Wall and tour a
busy downtown shopping area.</P>

      <P>Officials at Chiayi
Airport said Friday that the Ministry of Transportation and
Communications has decided to spend NT$150 million (US$4.3 million)
to rebuild the airport, a project to be completed by the end of 2003.</P>
      <P>Chiayi Airport Director Wang Yo-lin said that the number of
travelers that the airport serves peaked in 1998 at approximately one
million a year, gradually declining after the country sank into
recession to the current figure of around 300,000 travelers a year.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the transportation ministry made the decision to
build newer and more spacious facilities for the airport to meet
future travelers' needs after anticipating the number of people using
the airport to rise to 500,000 annually by 2021 because of Chiayi
County's status as a major tourism area in central and southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>According to Wang, the ministry's administrating agency
overseeing the Mount Ali National Scenic Area is interested in
setting up a bus depot at the airport to make it more convenient for

      <P>Visitors usually reach Mount Ali from Chiayi by bus or train,
through a 72-kilometer scenic railway.</P>

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian encouraged the
country's armed forces Friday to fight for the survival of the
country and the well-being of the people.</P>
      <P>Speaking to a brigade of the ROC Army stationed near Taipei, the
president said the Republic of China has no intention of provoking a
conflict or starting an arms race against any country, but everyone
should be well aware that national security cannot be ensured without
paying a price, and an appropriate deterrent force is vital to
achieving this goal.</P>
      <P>The president encouraged the armed forces to strengthen their
rapid response capabilities to emergency, saying it is vital for both
the armed forces and the government to be ready to react quickly to
whatever challenges they must face.</P>
      <P>Chen also called on the people of the nation to pull together and
be vigilant in the defense of their country, citing the terrorist
attacks in New York and Washington on Sept. 11 as an example of the
kind of uncertain events that can befall a nation.
 "The strength of national defense is only as strong as the
weakest link and that every individual counts in keeping the country
free and safe", said the president.</P>
      <P>The president, whose only son is now doing one year and 10 months
compulsory military service in the army, urged military officers to
train and treat recruits humanely, and take care of them as a parent
would take care of their own children.</P>
      <P>Chen arrived at the army brigade on a tour of armed forces units
around Taipei. He was flanked by Minister of National Defense Tang
Yiau-min and other military leaders on the trip.</P>
      <P>The tour also took him to an ROC Navy radar station in Linko,
Taipei County and an air force unit earlier in the day. The president
wore the uniform of each branch of the military service he visited
during his inspection and wherever he went, he was given a warm
reception by the soldiers. They scrambled to shake hands with the

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Former Minister of Education Ovid Tseng took
over the vice presidency of the Academia Sinica Friday, the most
prestigious academic institution in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tseng said the priorities for him will be the promotion of
international academic exchanges and a national "digital learning"
project, in addition to integrating the study of the way the human
brain works and behavioral and cognitive sciences.</P>
      <P>Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh said Tseng will be a
valuable addition since he has both global vision and the energy to
help develop the nation.</P>
      <P>Tseng holds a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology from Pennsylvania
State University and helped establish the Psychology Department at
Taiwan's National Chung Cheng University in 1990. He became president
of National Yang Ming University in 1999 and joined the Chen
Shui-bian administration as education minister in 2000.</P>
      <P>After teaching at Ohio State University, and the universities of
California at Riverside and Berkeley, Tseng was barred from returning
to Taiwan because of what the government termed his "remarks designed
to incite." He finally return to Taiwan in 1984 thanks to the
assurances of the Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Although being Taiwan's education minister for just 622 days,
Tseng said there is still much reform work to be done. He said that
his understanding of the differing characteristics of the island's
universities will help him better integrate educational experiences
at the Academia Sinica.</P>
      <P>Tseng added that he also aspires to elevate Taiwan's academic
research to the international level. He pointed out that Taiwan's
academic level is already quite high in some areas, but is lacking in
others. Tseng said realizing the potential in all areas is a personal
goal of his.</P>
      <P>Citing the example of Japan and Singapore -- which have
integrated different sciences efficiently -- Tseng said Taiwan needs
to catch up with these regional academics.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 8 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun directed the Ministry of
Finance and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics Friday to study the issue of central government budget
allocations so that disputes of the kind currently pending in the
legislature can be avoided in the future.</P>
      <P>Yu gave the agencies three months to work out a system for the
central government to provide financial aid to local governments in
such a way that there would be parity for all concerned.</P>
      <P>The system should be fair and transparent but it should not spell
out a fix proportion of the revenues to be given to any one agency as
this is usually the catalyst for controversy, the premier said.</P>
      <P>The re-think of the allocation issue should be done as part of
the government's reform plan where the government is downsized yet
more efficient by handing over more power and funds to local
governments, Yu said.</P>
      <P>The current methods of allocating revenues among central and
local governments provided in the Law Governing the Allocation of
Government Revenues and Expenditures is at the center of the current
controversy.</P>
      <P>It was revised by the previous opposition-controlled legislature
despite the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's opposition to the
move on the grounds that it would create a shortfall in the budget
needed to effectively operate the central government.</P>
      <P>Yu's administration is asking the newly-assembled legislature to
review the revision. The changes to the way the funds are allocated
will be invalidated unless the new legislature, which is almost
evenly divided between the ruling and opposition camps, upholds the
revision by a simple majority.</P>
      <P>Although political analysts said the opposition is fighting an
uphill battle in the legislature, lawmakers of the leading opposition
Kuomintang (KMT), which initiated the original changes, gathered
Friday to work out a way to scuttle the motion for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng said KMT lawmakers will
stick to their guns in the fight and will fan out across the island
in the next few days to marshal support for the party's opposition to
the Cabinet's motion.</P>
      <P>The motion is scheduled to be debated Feb. 19 and a vote will be
taken immediately afterward.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC OFFICIAL, LEGISLATORS CALL FOR E.U. SUPPORT OF ROC'S WHO BID</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Brussels,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By Tang Ping-chun and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Republic of China presidential adviser
along with five ROC legislators met with members of the international
media stationed in Brussels Friday to promote Taiwan's bid to re-join
the World Health Organization (WHO) as an observer.</P>
      <P>National policy adviser Wu Shu-min, who is also head of the
Medical Professionals Alliance in Taiwan (MPAT), was accompanied by
ROC Representative to the European Union David T.W. Lee and
legislators William C.D. Lai, Liu Shih-fang, Chien Chao-tung, Yeh
Yi-chin and Chiang Yi-wen at the news conference.</P>
      <P>Wu said that his delegation is seeking the support of European
countries for the ROC's WHO bid. He pointed out that the U.S.
Congress has already ratified a resolution in support of Taiwan's
efforts to participate in the WHO, but added that more backing from
other countries is needed.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's accomplishments in the areas of medical and
public health give it the ability to contribute to the international
community but that the island has been unable to become a member of
the WHO because of Beijing's continued obstruction.</P>
      <P>Wu's delegation arrived in Brussels Thursday and met with several
E.U. and Belgian health officials and lawmakers to solicit their
support.</P>
      <P>As a founding member of the WHO, the ROC participated in the
organization's activities and programs for 24 years before being
forced to leave the WHO in 1972 in the wake of mainland China's
admission into the United Nations.</P>
      <P>In 1997, when Taiwan began seeking re-admittance to the WHO,
representatives of the MPAT and the Department of Health (DOH)
attended a meeting of the World Health Assembly (WHA) in Geneva to
promote support for the ROC's WHO bid.</P>
      <P>Since then, ROC allies have submitted numerous proposals to the
WHA, urging the international community to respect the health rights
of Taiwan's nearly 23 million people and to recognize the island as a
valuable partner in world health care.</P>

    <HEADLINE>GIANT "I LOVE YOU" ROADSIDE SIGN ERECTED FOR V.P. LU BY ADMIRER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Changhua,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Another "explicit" admirer of Vice
President Annette Lu has come forth, this time via a large sign
saying "I love you" placed Saturday alongside the highway near
Changhua, central Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The admirer, Tony Chen, who is an English teacher at a cram
school, said the move was absolutely not a momentary impulse, adding
that he has planned it for a long time as a gift to Lu for the
upcoming Valentine's Day.</P>
      <P>The "I love you" T-bar sign will stand for one year at cost of
NT$1.028 million, including location rent, fees to have the sign
made, the electricity bill and building costs, according to Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen denied putting up the highway sign to gain personal
publicity, saying that "I don't need to publicize myself as I'm
already a popular cram school English teacher, a well known writer
and a scholar with two master's degrees from the United States who
has more than 100 lecture chairs a year."</P>
      <P>He stressed that the sign is only an expression of his admiration
for the vice president whom he said he has for long been attracted to
for her "compassion for people, congeniality, courage, political
perceptiveness and global vision."</P>
      <P>Noting that a roadside sign is the "most direct" way of showing
his love for Lu, Chen said that he wants the entire country to see
his expression of love and that he hopes the vice president will give
him a kindly response.</P>
      <P>If possible, Chen said, he would be pleased to help the vice
president to fulfill one of her wishes of seeing the English level of
the people of Taiwan further upgraded.</P>
      <P>Some people have expressed concern that the sign might be viewed
as illegal and therefore removed. Chen responded by arguing that if
that is the case, all the T-bar advertisement signs that appear one
after another several hundreds meters apart along the Sun Yat-sen
Freeway should also be removed.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu's first "explicit" admirer, a man who
runs a debt collection agency in Taipei, came forth last year by
attempting to bring 999 roses to her at the Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Tung Nien-tai tried to bring Lu the roses to court her, but the
move caused a commotion in front of the Presidential Office and Tung
and his roses were barred by police and guards from entering the
premises.</P>
      <P>The flowers were not acknowledged by Lu's office, which Tung said
made him very upset. Lu also did not make any response to Tung's
courting.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SYSTEM PROVIDERS SEE POTENTIAL OF ERP MARKET IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>While increasing numbers of businesses in
Taiwan have applied commercial software and enterprise management
systems, software and systems providers in Taiwan are doubling their
efforts to explore the domestic market, especially among small- and
medium-sized businesses, according to an industrial source.</P>
      <P>A spokesman of the Data Systems Corp. specializing in enterprise
resource planning (ERP) said Saturday that ERP has focused attention
of visitors to the 2002 Spring Multi-media Computer Show sponsored by
the Taipei Computer Exhibition at the Taipei World Trade Center
exhibition hall from Feb. 6-10.</P>
      <P>So far, the integrated ERP systems have been applied mostly by
medium-sized or large enterprises due to the considerably high cost.
The minimum NT$1.5 million investment is considered much too high by
most small companies with an annual turnover below NT$200 million.</P>
      <P>As more and more industrial firms have computerized their
operations in terms of accounting, personnel administration and
logistic systems, domestic software houses are developing integrated
ERP systems for small- and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      <P>The SmartERP system developed by the Data Systems Corp., for
instance, costs less than NT$300,000 and is suitable for small- and
medium-sized businesses, according to the company spokesman.</P>
      <P>In recent years, many leading information technology
manufacturers in Taiwan, such as Acer Group, ASUSTek, CMC Magnetics,
and United Microelectronics, have made big investments in software
research and development, according to the Industrial Development
Bureau (IDB).</P>
      <P>The IDB forecasts that the production value of Taiwan's software
industry will rise to US$14 billion by 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TWELVE LOTTERY WINNERS IN TAIWAN TO JOINTLY SHARE US$ 14.9 M. JACKPOT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Twelve people hit the jackpot in the latest
drawing of Taiwan's "public benefits" computerized lottery to share
the approximately NT$524 million (US$14.9 million) in grand prize
money, TAIPEIBANK announced Saturday.</P>
      <P>Bank officials explained that although the winning numbers were
drawn the previous night, compiling the statistics on the winning
tickets took much longer than expected due to the record number of
computer lottery ticket purchasers and also because of an error
relating to the bank's other traditional lottery drawing that forced
the entire computer system to be shut down for two hours.</P>
      <P>According to the bank, the sixth drawing of its computerized
lottery broke the world record for the highest number of
single-drawing transactions, while also recording the fifth highest
amount ever in terms of single-drawing turnover.</P>
      <P>A total of 39.8 million computerized tickets were sold islandwide
between Tuesday night and Friday evening, raking in NT$1.99 billion
(US$56.7 million) for the state-sponsored lottery.</P>
      <P>Although the odds of winning the jackpot are estimated at only
one in 5.25 million, the low investment of NT$50 (US$1.43) per ticket
has set people's imaginations on fire, with many hoping to strike it
rich.</P>
      <P>Bank officials said that the computer system used to tally
statistics on the geographical distribution of lottery winners was
shut down after it was discovered that two of the bank's branches
sold 4,300 tickets for the traditional lottery without registering
them in the system.</P>
      <P>The system was brought back online after several attempts to key
in the numbers for those tickets failed because of the computer
program's security measures that prevent changes to be made after the
winning numbers for the traditional lottery have been drawn, the
officials added.</P>
      <P>The bank stressed that holders of those 4,300 tickets who have
won prizes can still redeem them at TAIPEIBANK instead of at the
lottery vendors.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Japan will be the theme country of the 2002
Taipei International Book Exhibition (TIBE) opening at the Taipei
World Trade Center exhibition hall Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>A total of 1,017 publishing companies from 47 countries will
participate in the six-day exhibition organized by local publishers
associations.</P>
      <P>The organizers said Saturday that several prominent Japanese
writers, cartoonists and editors have been invited to attend the book
fair. The organizers have arranged workshops featuring Taiwan-Japan
cultural exchanges on a project of reproducing masterpieces from the
National Palace Museum, databases in Japanese about Taiwan issues,
Japanese animation, and flexibility in human relations at the
exhibition venue during the exhibition.</P>
      <P>Marking the 10th anniversary of the book fair, the organizers are
also hosting two special exhibitions featuring Russian illustrations
and the French printing-engraving technique "chalcographie" which has
been in use since the 16th century.</P>
      <P>Co-sponsored by the Louvre, the "Reunion des musees nationaux"
(RMN) of France, the French Institute in Taipei, and the Le
Pigeonnier Bookstore in Taipei, the chalcographie exhibition will
display copper plates from the 16th century and a 200-kilogram
handpress machine loaned by the Louvre.</P>
      <P>Francois Baudequin, studio director of the Louvre Museum
chalchography workshop, will give demonstrations of the handpress at
the exhibition hall, according to the organizers.</P>
      <P>The exhibition of Russian illustrations is being sponsored by the
Chinese Publishers Development Foundation. On display will be 300
illustrations from popular fairy tales, Russian encyclopedias, and
historical stories created by some 100 Russian artists. A noted
Russian illustrator Kirill Chelushkin will attend the exhibition and
sign autographs of his posters at the venue.</P>
      <P>In view of the rising Internet applications in the publishing
business, the organizers have also arranged a series of discussions
featuring online reading, literature on the Internet, multimedia
design, digital archives, and the knowledge-based economy during the
exhibition.</P>
      <P>With some 400,000 visitors expected, the TIBE has developed into
the largest book exhibition in Asia, according to the organizers.
While rights exchanges and marketing of publications are the two
major functions of the annual event, the book fair has established
its reputation as a trade center of Chinese literary works.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FIRST GROUP TO TAKE M'LAND-KINMEN-TAIWAN ROUTE ARRIVES IN KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,  Feb.  9  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of mainland China-based Taiwan
business people and their relatives were ferried directly from the
Fujian Province port city of Xiamen to the Republic of China-held
island of Kinmen Saturday, on the first leg of their journeys back to
Taiwan for the Chinese New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>The sailing of the 181 ROC citizens aboard the Kinmen-based ferry
"Tai Wu" marked the first ROC government-approved direct
transportation of people, rather than goods, from mainland China to
ROC-held territory, following the government's initiation of the
"mini three links" Jan. 2, 2001.</P>
      <P>The mini three links allows for direct trade, postal and shipping
links between the ROC's outlying islands of Kinman and Matsu and the
mainland port cities of Xiamen and Fuzhou in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>Upon their arrival at Kinmen's Shuitou port, the Taiwan
passengers, most of them members of the Taiwan Investment and
Business Association in Xiamen, were warmly greeted by Kinmen
Magistrate Lee Chu-feng and Kinmen-based New Party Legislator Wu
Cheng-dien.</P>
      <P>All the passengers said they were thrilled with the trip, not
only because the voyage was the first of its kind, but also because
it saved them a lot of time and money.</P>
      <P>The direct Xiamen-Kinmen-Taiwan sea and air trip will save
roughly NT$10,000 (US$286) for each person per trip. In the past, a
traveler had to spend about NT$16,000 for a one-way trip to Jujian
Province from Taiwan via a "third place," namely Hong Kong or Macau,
or vice versa.</P>
      <P>Sailing from Xiamen port to Kinmen takes about 90 minutes. And a
flight from Kinmen to Taipei takes about 50 minutes.</P>
      <P>Chen Kuan-ting, an assistant director of the Cabinet-level
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) -- Taiwan's top agency in charge of
policies toward mainland China -- and Liao Yun-yuan, director of the
Business and Trade Department of the quasi-official intermediary
organization of the Straits Exchange Foundation, traveled to Kinmen
from Taiwan to witness the arrival of the group.</P>
      <P>Kinmen Magistrate Lee expressed the hope that the direct
Xiamen-Kinmen-Taiwan trip formula, a "tentative arrangement" as
labeled by the MAC, will turn out to be popular and successful and
will eventually persuade the government to make it a fixed policy.</P>
      <P>Huang Tieh-jung, chairman of the Taiwan Investment and Business
Association in Xiamen, who was among the group, said now that both
Taiwan and mainland China are full members of the World Trade
Organization, it is both sides' duty to further strengthen business
and trade exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He added that he hopes that the Xiamen-Kinmen-Taiwan trip formula
will become a fixed policy and that the ROC government will
eventually turn the Xiamen-Kinmen passenger ferries into a regular
service to make people exchanges between the two sides much more
convenient and cost efficient.</P>
      <P>The second group of its kind, which will include 115 Xiamen-based
Taiwan business people and their relatives, is scheduled to depart
from Xiamen on Sunday for Kinmen, from where the group members are
also expected to fly to Taiwan the same day for the Chinese New Year
holidays.</P>
      <P>The same travelers are scheduled to return to Fujian Province
later in the month by taking similar ferries from Kinmen on Feb. 16,
17 and 24 to return to work on the mainland after the holiday break.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Kinmen county government is planning to establish
a school exclusively for children of mainland China-based Taiwan
business people to further serve the special group of people and
their dependents, according to Magistrate Lee.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  8 (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A U.S. business leader said Friday the
situation in the Taiwan Strait should remain stable amid rapid
cross-strait economic integration, Taiwan's recent assurances it
won't declare formal independence in the short term and Beijing's
upcoming leadership transition later this year.</P>
      <P>Christian Murck, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in
mainland China, said at a seminar in Washington that although
cross-strait relations are currently facing an impasse, economic
integration between the two economies appears to be an inevitable
trend.</P>
      <P>Murck said that some of his Taiwanese friends spend equal parts
of the year between living in Taipei and living in Shanghai because
many of the restaurants and other stores that they frequent in Taipei
have also opened branches in the cosmopolitan mainland city.</P>
      <P>He added that although a sign of good will on the part of
mainland China can be glimpsed from mainland Chinese Vice Premier
Qian Qichen's recent public invitation to select members of Taiwan's
ruling Democratic Progressive Party to visit the mainland, the
People's Liberation Army remains set on building up its strength --
particularly its amphibious fighting capabilities.</P>
      <P>Murck said that he expects U.S. President George W. Bush to touch
on cross-strait issues during his upcoming visit to Beijing, in
addition to issues related to human rights, anti-terrorism and
mainland China's recent World Trade Organization accession.</P>

    <HEADLINE>THAI COUPLE AMONG 'LUCKY 12' TO SHARE FIRST PRIZE IN LOTTERY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Thai husband and wife, in Taiwan as
contract laborers, hit the jackpot in Friday's lottery draw, but
their luck didn't stop there -- they also won the second prize, a
major daily newspaper reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>China Times said that the Thai couple working at a Hsinchu
textile plant in northern Taiwan will share the first prize of
NT$524,531,100 (US$1,494,390) with 11 others, and share the second
prize of NT$109,436,958 (US$311,786) together with 32 others.</P>
      <P>The couple was the first foreign workers to win the top prize in
the state-sponsored lottery, the reports said.</P>
      <P>"Who would have thought that Thai laborers would win the first
and second prize as well?" a dormitory manager at the textile plant
said upon learning of the news.</P>
      <P>The manager, surnamed Wu, added, "The company has decided to send
the couple back to Thailand for their safety as soon as we find out
where they are."</P>
      <P>The Thai man, 33, and his wife, 29, had just completed their
two-year contracts with the plant and had extended their contracts
for another year, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The couple disappeared soon after learning that they had hit the
jackpot.</P>
      <P>They purchased five NT$50 (US$1.42) lottery tickets, Wu said. The
foreman at the plant, for unknown reasons, took down all five sets of
numbers, and broke the news when the winning numbers were announced
Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu said that when the winning numbers were drawn, the couple was
working the night shift. When the couple heard that they had won,
they went wild, shouting and hugging the other Thai workers. They
also said that they would give the other workers NT$10,000 (US$284.9)
each. But by dawn the next day, the couple were not at the plant
dormitory.</P>
      <P>Wu said that their personal data showed that they had used their
birthday dates, their ages, and the validity date of their passports
for their "lucky numbers." These numbers, together with the number
39, which has appeared several times in past drawings, turned out to
be the winning combination: 2, 4, 15, 16, 29, 33 and 39.</P>
      <P>Lottery fever has gripped the island since the lotto was started
last month. Every Tuesday and Friday, people can be seen queuing up
before ticket booths, because they believe that buying tickets on the
last day will bring them extra luck.</P>
      <P>Of the previous drawings, there were no first prize winners in
the first and fifth drawings. This drawing, the sixth, produced the
largest number of first-prize winners, even more than the 11 who
combined to win in all the previous drawings.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BIRTHPLACE RESTRICTION FOR PRESIDENCY REFLECTS PUBLIC OPINION: TSU</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The proposal to revise the law to allow
only those born in Taiwan to be qualified to run for the presidency
and vice presidency of the Republic of China is only a reflection of
public opinion, the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the tiny TSU, whose spiritual leader is former
President Lee Teng-hui, said it was just a topic discussion within
the party and that it has not yet become a policy or a plank of the
party.</P>
      <P>In response to criticism by Kuomintang (KMT) Chairman Lien Chen
that the idea is a "Hitler-style, fascist trick aimed at creating
ethnic hatred in Taiwan," the TSU official said that the only thing
fascist would be if the people were denied the right to discuss the
issue in public.</P>
      <P>He claimed that the TSU's proposal to amend the President and
Vice President Election and Recall Law such that only those born in
Taiwan could run for the presidency and vice presidency was made out
of the party's concern over national security and country
identification.</P>
      <P>Stressing that the TSU has not yet reached any resolution on the
issue, the spokesman said the party does not wish to provoke any
independence-unification dispute regarding Taiwan's fate. The TSU
just wishes to express its strong desire to safeguard Taiwan, he
noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lien, who is vacationing in France, blasted the TSU's
proposal as a "vile act" aimed at creating ethnic confrontation in
Taiwan society. He said such a move goes against the world's
prevailing trends of democracy and will eventually be forsworn by the
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks during a gathering in Paris with scores of
ROC nationals residing in France.</P>
      <P>The chairman of Taiwan's largest opposition party also voiced
deep regret over the KMT's major loss in December's legislative

    <HEADLINE>NUMBER OF AIDS CASES REACHES NEARLY 4,000 IN TAIWAN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  10  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The number of people in Taiwan with AIDS
reached 3,985 in 2001, or an increase of more than 20 percent from
the previous year, a major daily newspaper quoted a Department of
Health (DOH) report Sunday.</P>
      <P>The China Times reported that DOH officials said that one
worrying phenomenon is that young people are not paying enough
attention to safe sex practices.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the trend has resulted in an increase in
AIDS patients -- 644 new AIDS cases were reported in 2001, or an
increase of 21.1 percent over the previous year and the largest
increase over the past years.</P>
      <P>Statistics showed that 98 percent of those with AIDS got the
disease through having sex, and among these the ratio of gay or
bisexual patients has increased every year. The ratio surged to 57.4
percent in 2001 from 53 percent in 1997 and the trend is especially
obvious in young people.</P>
      <P>For those between age 15 and 24, the ratio of gays with AIDS was
higher -- up to 75 percent of those infected in that age group over
the last five years are gay or bisexual.</P>
      <P>The health department said that this could be attributed to the
fact that gays are more concerned with AIDS and are regularly checked
for AIDS, so that the number of them being diagnosed is relatively
higher.</P>
      <P>But on the other hand, it could show that gays, especially the
younger ones, have not paid enough attention to safe sex, DOH
officials said.</P>
      <P>They noted that the younger group is becoming more closely
related to AIDS, noting that although statistics still showed that
those between 20 and 39 are still the mainstay of those contracting
AIDS, ratio of the group between 15 and 24 with AIDS has increased
rapidly. Although only 74 people fell into this younger group, the
number of those with AIDS has risen in five years to 134.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2ND  GROUP  OF  TAIWAN BUSINESSMEN IN XIAMEN RETURN VIA KINMEN</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kinmen,   Feb.   10  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The second group of 108 mainland
China-based Taiwan businessmen and their relatives left Xiamen,
Fujian province for Taiwan's offshore island of Kinmen Sunday for the
Chinese New Year, which falls on Feb. 12.</P>
      <P>The group followed the first 181-member group the previous day,
and then traveled on to other parts of Taiwan for the most important
holiday for Chinese people.</P>
      <P>The 108 people aboard the ferry Ta Yang No. 11, departed from
Heping Wharf in Xiamen and arrived in Shuitou Wharf at 11 a.m. to
warm greetings by Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng.</P>
      <P>Taiwan businessmen, after a nearly two-hour trip across the
Kinxia (Kinmen-Xiamen) Strait, said that they felt happy upon landing
on Kinmen, adding that in the past they had to go to Hong Kong or
Macau on their way to Taiwan, which was a waste of time and money,
and they were elated to be able to return to Taiwan through Kinmen
this year.</P>
      <P>Some Taiwan businessmen also said that they believe cross-strait
exchanges should be improved. A Taiwan businessman surnamed Chen said
that full cross-strait links on trade, post and transportation is
inevitable, and the government should face the issue pragmatically.</P>
      <P>They said even with the "three mini links" in effect, the trip is
still arduous having to take the ship first to Kinmen and then take a
plane to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Taiwan inaugurated the "mini three links," -- the direct trade,
post and transportation links between two of Taiwan's offshore
islands, Kinmen and Matsu, and mainland China, on Jan. 1, 2001.</P>
      <P>Kinmen County Magistrate Lee said the revised offshore island
construction regulations stipulate that Taiwan people could use the
offshore islands of Kinmen, Matsu and Penghu to enter or leave for
the mainland after prior approval.</P>
      <P>Lee said the successful trips by Taiwan businessmen will serve as
a good beginning, adding that he hoped that there will be regular
shipping between Kinmen and Xiamen, and that Kinmen will play the
role as a mid-point of cross-strait exchanges.</P>
      <P>The 108-member group, except for 12 Kinmen residents, then took
planes to Taipei, Taichung or Kaohsiung later for family reunions.</P>
      <P>The first and second group of Taiwan businessmen and their
relatives are scheduled to retrace their routes to return to mainland
China Feb. 16, 17 and 24.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PFP IS WEIGHING ALTERNATIVE WAY OUT OF BUDGET ALLOCATION DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Los  Angeles, Feb. 9 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The best way to get out of the dispute
over the revised budget allocation law lies in a comprehensive
revision to current regulations rather than negating or upholding the
revised rules, People First Party (PFP) Chairman James Soong said in
Los Angeles Saturday.</P>
      <P>Soong who arrived in L.A. on a private vacation during the
Chinese New Year holiday said that although the revised rules
governing the allocation of the central government budget are not
comprehensive, as admitted by the Kuomintang (KMT), the original
rules are not perfect either, as the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) has admitted.</P>
      <P>So why should the two parties lock horns in a partisan dispute
while both sides know their arguments don't hold water, Soong said.</P>
      <P>The PFP will try to find middle ground and come up with an
alternative way for the allocation of funds rather than just sustain
the revision or reinstate the original rules, the PFP leader said.</P>
      <P>The dispute stems from a KMT-initiated revision to budget
allocation rules which, the DPP claims, are impractical and should be
negated.</P>
      <P>A vote in the legislature on a motion for reconsidering the
revision is scheduled for Feb. 19. The KMT, which controls 68 seats
in the legislature, needs to field support of at least 113 lawmakers,
or a simple majority, to retain the changes.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NEW WESTERNIZATION TAKING ROOT IN MAINLAND CHINA (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Feb.  10  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Quietly and without much fanfare, the
"Middle Kingdom," which has embraced an insular view of themselves
and the rest of the world, is moving on a way of westernization --
supplanting authoritarian dictates with individual efforts to enhance
prosperity.</P>
      <P>A Beijing historian specializing on the Ching Dynasty said the
country is in a similar situations to that during the reign of
Emperor Tungzhi when his regime came to realize the advantages of the
West's powerful gunboats and cannons.</P>
      <P>The Ching Dynasty used the West's weaponry to put down the
rebellion by Hung Xiu-chuan, who founded the short-lived Taiping
Heavenly State between 1851-1864, and defeated France in a 1894 war
for the control of Vietnam -- which had been a vassal state under the
Ching dynasty, according to the historian.</P>
      <P>The victory over France in the China-France War encouraged
Chinese of that time to study Western ways of building cannons and
warships out of cast iron to defend their county, but this trend died
out with the collapse of the Ching dynasty in 1911.</P>
      <P>NEW BORROWING FROM THE WEST</P>
      <P>Mainland China faces a much different world today from the one
nearly a century ago. Westernization is now more related to words
like "Internet," "Olympics," "APEC," "WTO" and "citizenship."</P>
      <P>And for Chinese wanting to tap into the secrets of success in the
West, there is one essential ingredient: the ability to speak
English.</P>
      <P>A good example is Wang Ying, a senior at a leading university
in Beijing. He attends an English language cram school five days a
week but must pay for tuition by holding down three jobs.</P>
      <P>The young man, originally from southern China, said he must work
hard because the tuition is very expensive, but there is another
reason -- the dream of saving enough money to study abroad in an
English-speaking country.</P>
      <P>Working three jobs has stretched Wang to the limits of his
endurance, but a good command of English, and the possibility of
studying in the West -- and the good job that could come his way --
make all the work seem worth it.</P>
      <P>"This is what all of my classmates dream of," said the young man.</P>
      <P>SUCCESS IS THE GOAL</P>
      <P>The leaders of the Chinese Communist government are experiencing
the same feelings now that the country, after two decades of "reform
and opening," has seen 100 million people out of its 1.3 billion
population enter the middle-class, and even the poorest 100 million
are not as bad off as in past years, according to the Beijing
historian.</P>
      <P>Beijing's successful bid to host the 2008 Olympics, its
successful hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
summit in Shanghai, and the country's admittance to the World Trade
Organization, have reinforced the conviction of both the Chinese
government and the people of the country that they are moving on the
right path -- one that incidentally happen to mirror the West.</P>
      <P>Guo Cheng-yuan, a well-known scholar of international relations
in Beijing said the modern history of China is in some ways like a
helix.

    <DATELINE>Beijing,  Feb.  10  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>In other words, Guo said, modern Chinese history looks as if it
is a series of repeating events, but in fact, it is a string of
similar causes and effects with different outcomes because of the
impact of the particular circumstances of the time.</P>
      <P>The scholar said it doesn't take a historian to know that the
Westernization campaign during the Ching dynasty was different from
the current one. The previous campaign was aimed at strengthening the
weak Ching dynasty with western weaponry, but the current changes
have less to do with consolidation of the power of the state than
with individuals' pursuit of a higher living standard -- or, more
precisely, increased personal wealth has become more pressing that
defending the country by borrowing technologies from foreign
countries.</P>
      <P>The current craze to learn English in mainland China is just one
symptom of the desire for personal growth -- and a fatter wallet, Guo
said.</P>
      <P>A ONE-WAY STREET?</P>
      <P>Will the current westernization campaign be more successful than
the previous one?</P>
      <P>"Sure, there is no question about it," a Beijing businessman said
who studied overseas when he was a student.</P>
      <P>The businessman, surnamed Chang, said unlike the Westernization
during the Ching dynasty -- which prompted bitter controversy about
how thoroughly the country should copy the Western system -- the
current campaign is supported by the whole country from its top
leaders to the grassroots level, since the pursuit of a better living
is believed to be in the best interests of China.</P>
      <P>Chang said that since capitalism has flourished amid the
communist government in mainland China, "citizenship" has become a
current catch-word among Chinese intellectuals, and is a catalyst for
the new campaign.</P>
      <P>Citizenship, Chang said, which contains the notion of legal
responsibility and rights, is a new idea to Chinese who used to
considered themselves as subjects of the state who owed allegiance
only to the nation and were expected to follow its leaders with
complete obedience.</P>
      <P>On the contrary, the idea of being a citizen contains patriotism,
but not to the exclusion of all else. A citizen is supposed to demand
-- even fight -- for his rights from the government, and wants to
have these rights enshrined in law.</P>
      <P>A Taiwan businessman in Beijing, surnamed Ni, said he sincerely
hopes Beijing's new Westernization campaign will succeed. A country
with mature citizens will never go to war over ideological
differences, and such a situation promises a peaceful solution to the
disputes between Taiwan and mainland China, he said.</P>
      <P>Noting that the gross domestic product gap between mainland
China and Taiwan is narrowing because of the rapid economic
development in mainland China, Ni said the lessening of the relative
economic disparity across the Taiwan Strait bodes well for an
amicable resolution of so-called "Taiwan issue."</P>
      <P>However, a professor at a leading university in Beijing said the
Westernization in the Ching dynasty would not have fallen by the
wayside if all it demanded was learning English, studying in the
West, building skyscrapers, hosting international conferences or
doing business in the way of the West.</P>
      <P>What mainland China needs now is not cosmetic realizations of
"Western progress," but a solid grounding in the rule by law and the
establishment of democracy, two elements that will lay the groundwork
for the country's sustainable development, the professor said.</P>
      <P>Borrowing a remark from the late national leader Liu Shaoqi that
China never moves straight forward its goal, but rather it wanders
toward it, the professor said anyone who longs for democracy in
mainland China should be patient. He said the most populous country
in the world may wander for a while longer before finding its true
way on the path to real democratization.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Despite Beijing's objection, Taiwan
will continue seeking to take part in the World Health Organization
(WHO), because the island's 23 million people have the right to fully
participate in the body and acquire information through it, the
Washington Times reported Sunday.</P>
      <P>Quoting Republic of China Department of Health Director-General
Lee Ming-liang, the report said Taiwan has offered US$100 million in
economic aid to 78 countries over the past seven years, while the ROC
government's efforts to eradicate hepatitis-A in Taiwan were also
approved by over 70 percent of the Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>According to the report, the U. S. House of Representatives
passed a resolution last year calling on the administration to
support Taiwan to join the WHO as an observer. Former U. S. President
Bill Clinton also signed an agreement in Dec. 1999 backing Taiwan's
participation at the WHO, but the move provoked strong opposition
from Beijing.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for the Beijing Embassy was cited as saying that
Beijing is opposed to Taiwan's WHO membership because it is an
international organization which requires statehood. The Beijing
official was also quoted as pointing out that Beijing also opposes
Taiwan's joining the WHO as an observer.</P>
      <P>Lee said Taiwan will not challenge Beijing's "one China" policy
and it just wishes to join the WHO as an observer which requires no
statehood. The International Red Cross Society and Palestine
Liberalization Organization are WHO observers.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The mainland Chinese economic powerhouse
may find the going tough in 2002, despite a projected increase in
foreign investment, a study released by the Cabinet-level Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) said.</P>
      <P>International financial experts believe that becuase of the
global economic slump, growth in the mainland could be lower than 7
percent this year -- the first time in the past 11 years that the
figure has dipped that low, the MAC said.</P>
      <P>The study noted that various figures indicate that since last
year the mainland has eased inflationary pressures. Overall,
consumption last year also picked up over the previous year.</P>
      <P>But the slumping stock market signifies the shrinking of mainland
people's wealth and in turn has eroded the public's confidence in the
market. This and the slow growth of farmers' incomes and the
prediction by analysts that the world economy may not rebound as
quickly as expected have all dimmed the prospects for the mainland's
economy this year.</P>
      <P>The study also said that the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in the
United States and the world economic slump have seriously affected
mainland China's exports. Export growth in the mainland in 2001 was
only 6.8 percent -- the lowest level since 1996 -- and the situation
is expected to remain stark this year. Mainland Chinese Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng had said that
the unstable world economy will further impact exports from the
mainland and the result could be worse than the situation the country
faced in 1997 during the Asian financial crisis.</P>
      <P>Losses by state-owned enterprises also continue to rise, spilling
more red ink in the financial sector, where the debt reached US$30.2
billion in 2000.</P>
      <P>One positive sign is that foreign capital inflow to the mainland
is expected to reach a new high of US$61 billion in 2002, the study
said.</P>
      <P>A study by Harvard University, however, said that foreign
investment is not an elixir for sustained development of the mainland
economy, noting that those enterprises that do not have sound
structures could rapidly fold after losing their competitive edge,
especially after mainland China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.</P>
      <P>Overall, the MAC said that the economic outlook in the mainland
this year is not overly optimistic. In addition, mainland China will
face uncertain economic and political development in the future,
which will pose serious challenges to the leadership and financial
navigators of the country.</P>

month it was too early to pass judgment on the effects on society the
lottery may have, preferring to adopt the same "wait and see" view as
the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Finance recently asked Taipei Bank, which
sponsors the state-run lottery tickets, to pay special attention to
the phenomenon of residents going to extremes to find "magic numbers"
at temples and to watch carefully the habits of gamblers. The message
was deemed by observers to have a veiled subtext -- watch that
the lottery fever does not get out of hand. This has triggering
speculation that the ministry may try to find ways to reign in the
lottery.</P>
      <P>The latest drawing, which will be held Tuesday, or Chinese New
Year Day, has attracted betting of over NT$1 billion so far. With a
tendency to try one's luck on festive days, it is expected that the
amount could hit a new high.</P>
      <P>Lee Yuan-tseh, the highly respected president of the Academia
Sinica and a Nobel laureate, asked Premier Yu Shyi-kun to keep a
close eye on the remarkable effects that the new lottery is having on
society and specifically to monitor the seemingly uncontrolled buying
of tickets.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Chuang Shou-han said that although it is
generally agreed upon that runaway sales of lottery tickets is a
serious concern, the Cabinet is still observing events, and has no
formal policy on the issue.</P>
      <P>One Taipei Bank official, trying to head off worries over the
overheated buying by the public, said that the phenomenon would most
likely die down in several months -- just like the craze for
Portuguese egg-tarts which threw the nation into a buying frenzy a
few years ago.</P>
      <P>Ting Yu-kang, the president of Taipei Bank, said that lottery
tickets are simply a consumer product, and that it is unnecessary to
give them any moral significance.</P>
      <P>Ting said that to understand more about consumption behavior
regarding the lottery, Taipei Bank has commissioned a market survey
to learn what segments of society buys lottery tickets and why.</P>
      <P>As the lottery is barely a month old, Ting believes that it is
too early to conclude that lotto mania has infected the public and
needs to be subdued.</P>
      <P>Ting said initial surveys have found that people, on average, buy
around NT$390 worth of lottery tickets and that much of this is
impulse buying. There are very few people who spend NT$10,000 on
tickets, for example, said Ting.</P>
      <P>He said that the long lines at ticket vendors is not an
indication that the lottery is overheated; rather, there are too few
booths to satisfy consumer demand. Currently there are 3,200
computerized vending stalls around the island. Ting said that Taipei
Bank will increase that number to 5,000 by the end of March, and
8,500 by the end of year.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a foreign labor rights protection group has expressed
concerns about reports that a Thai husband and wife working in a
textile plant in northern Taiwan disappeared after winning the first
and second prizes of the latest lottery drawing Feb. 8.</P>
      <P>A Catholic service center for foreign labor has implored Taipei
Bank to keep the identities of the Thai couple confidential, and that
the Council of Labor and representative offices for foreign labors
come up with regulations to help foreign workers claim prizes and
safely return to their countries, if they desire.

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT URGES NATION TO BE READY FOR CHALLENGES IN NEW YEAR'S MESSAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  11  (CNA)
(By Bear Lee)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC President Chen Shui-bian urged his
fellow countrymen Monday in his Chinese Lunar New Year speech to be
ready for all challenges that lie ahead.</P>
      <P>In his message released on the eve of the Chinese Lunar New Year,
Chen recalled that Taiwan suffered many hardships over the past year,
including typhoons that hit the island one after the other and
resulted in destructive flooding.</P>
      <P>In addition, the terrorist attacks on the United States last
Sept. 11 brought down global economic growth and Taiwan has also felt
the economic pinch.</P>
      <P>However, Taiwan has stood tall in the face of these difficulties
because of the wisdom and perseverance on the part of both the people
and the government. "We have passed the challenges," the president
said.</P>
      <P>Chen added, however, that greater challenges and difficulties are
waiting for the nation now that Taiwan is a member of the World Trade
Organization (WTO). Taiwan was granted full member status on Jan. 1
this year.</P>
      <P>WTO membership for Taiwan will mean all-out global competition,
which will not only affect trade and economics, but also the fields
of science, culture, art and thought, he said.</P>
      <P>"We must, in the shortest possible time, make a thorough change,
turning ourselves into a 'global individual with a global vision,'"
Chen said.</P>
      <P>"If we do not change now, we will not be able to find our place
in the future global landscape," the president warned.</P>
      <P>Chen encouraged the new Cabinet, which was sworn in Feb. 1, to
complete cross-the-board reforms as soon as possible to further
buttress Taiwan's foundation.</P>
      <P>"Only by doing this can Taiwan take advantage of the opportunity
at the very moment that the global economy begins to rebound. In this
way we will be confidently telling the world community: We are ready,
we are coming."</P>
      <P>The president also wished his fellow countrymen a prosperous and
peaceful Year of the Horse.</P>

(By Ben Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>Today is Thursday, Feb. 14, or the third
day of the first month of the Year of the Horse according to the
lunar calendar. Following is a list of important events that have
occurred on this date in the past:

1766: Thomas R. Malthus, the British economist who wrote "An
Essay on the Principle of Population," is born. His 1798 work argues
that populations tend to increase faster than food supplies unless
the increase is checked by moral restraints or by war, famine or
disease.

1779: Captain James Cook, the British navigator and explorer who
commanded three major voyages of "discovery," charting and "naming"
many islands in the Pacific Ocean, is killed by a native's spear in
Hawaii.

1797: British naval forces under Adm. John Jervis and Capt.
Horatio Nelson defeat the Spanish fleet off Portugal's Cape St.
Vincent.

1859: Oregon becomes the 33rd state of the United States.

the National Cash Register Company (now NCR Corporation) for 15
years, is made president of a company that later becomes
International Business Machines Corporation (IBM).

1933: The League of Nations refuses to recognize the Japanese
puppet regime known as "Manchukuo." To deflect world condemnation of
their hegemony, the Japanese invaders of northern China installed the
Manchukuo regime in 1932. This "land of the Manchu" proved to be no
more than another stepping stone for the extension of Japanese
aggression.

1939: The German battleship Bismarck is launched.

1950: The Communist Chinese regime and the Soviet Union sign the
"Sino-Soviet Friendly Alliance and Mutual Assistance Treaty" in
Moscow.

1956: Soviet President Nikita Khrushchev denounces the policies
of Joseph Stalin at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party.

1962: Gen. Hu Chung-nan, strategic adviser to President Chiang
Kai-shek, dies in Taipei at the age of 68.

1972: Mexico establishes diplomatic relations with mainland
China.

moon.

1972: Washington relaxes trade restrictions against Beijing,
putting it on the same basis as Moscow.

1973: Walter Benche Medina, newly-appointed ambassador of El
Salvador, arrives in Taipei to assume his post.

1974: A six-member Jordanian trade mission led by S.A. Matouk,
president of the Amman Chamber of Commerce, arrives in Taipei for a
weeklong visit.

1975: The Marinas Islands in the Pacific becomes a territory of
the United States.

1977: Shih Wei-liang, a noted Republic of China musician, dies in
Taipei at the age of 54.

1989: Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's religious leader, issues a
"fatwa," or death sentence, against British writer Salman Rushdie for
what he deemed to be blasphemy in the author's book "The Satanic
Verses," sending him into years of hiding.

1999: Former Nixon White House aide John Ehrlichman dies at the
age of 73. He served 18 months in prison for his role in the
Watergate cover-up.

2000: President Lee Teng-hui confers the Order of the Brilliant
Star with Grand Cordon on Cor Boonstra, president of Royal Philips
Electronics, in recognition of his company's contributions to
Taiwan's economic development.

2000: Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Chen
Shui-bian says that he will visit Beijing and invite mainland Chinese
leaders to visit Taipei if he wins the March 18 election.

2001: Premier Chang Chun-hsiung announces the resumption of
construction on Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant, ending a
protracted standoff between his Cabinet and the opposition-dominated
Legislature over the project.

Confucius' lesson of the day: "Earnestness without judgment
becomes pedantry; caution without judgment becomes timidity; courage
without judgment leads to crime; uprightness without judgment makes
men tyrannical."</TEXT>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Philippine Department of Labor and
Employment (DOLE) and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) are
working out a training program that would help generate one million
jobs in 2002, as pledged by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.</P>
      <P>In a report to Malacanang, Labor Secretary Patricia Sto. Tomas
said that the DOLE is now tapping the academic world as a major
element in the Job Corps program of the government.</P>
      <P>Sto. Tomas said the DOLE and CHED will soon finalize a working
arrangement with some local schools and foreign governments to enable
Filipino students to train at foreign establishments and
institutions.</P>
      <P>She said the arrangement would be formalized with the signing of
Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) with at least eight schools offering
courses in nursing and hotel and restaurant management.</P>
      <P>Teresita Manzala, director of DOLE's Bureau of Local Employment,
said consultations were ongoing on the forging of agreements with
nursing schools like the University of the Philippines-Manila, the
University of Santo Tomas, St. Louis University-Baguio, St. Paul
University-Cagayan, St. Paul University-Iloilo, Silliman University
in Dumaguete City, Liceo de Cagayan and San Pedro College.</P>

education attache an overseas training program in the United States
for nursing interns, adding that U.S. officials appeared to be
receptive to the program.</P>
      <P>Aside from the nursing internship program, Manzala said the DOLE

States and Canada for outstanding hotel and restaurant senior
students.</P>
      <P>The DOLE has already signed a memorandum of agreement with 14
maritime training schools, manning and training agencies on the

(By Jay Chen and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S. Senator Robert G. Torricelli
(D-N.J.) came up with a bill Tuesday demanding that the Bush
administration help Taiwan obtain observer status at this year's
World Health Organization (WHO) annual conference scheduled for May.</P>
      <P>Senate sources said Wednesday the content of the
Torricelli-authored bill is the same as that of one passed by the
House of Representatives last December.</P>
      <P>Both bills express full support for the Republic of China's bid
to join the Geneva-based organization as an observer and authorize
the U.S. secretary of state to draw up a comprehensive plan to help
Taiwan realize this goal at the 2002 WHO annual conference.</P>
      <P>The Torricelli-drafted bill also demands that the secretary of
state present a written report containing the above-mentioned action
plan to Congress within two weeks after the bill clears the Senate
floor.</P>
      <P>The House approved the Rep. Sherrod Brown-initiated bill in
mid-December last year. The bill was then referred to the Senate for
deliberation. However, the Senate has so far not listed the bill in
its agenda.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Sen. Torricelli decided to present a new
bill with exactly the same content as the House version.
Congressional sources said Torricelli is seeking Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Joseph Biden's (D-Del.) consent to have
the bill brought up directly for Senate discussion and approval.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun will attend a lunch
meeting with senior executives of major Taiwanese trade associations
in mainland China Feb. 21 to seek their opinions about the
development of economic relations across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>This will be the first direct encounter between Yu and mainland
China-based Taiwanese business and industry executives since Yu
assumed office Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>The meeting will be jointly organized by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), the
Chinese National Federation of Industries (CNFI) and the
quasi-official Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) as part of the
Chinese New Year celebrations, government sources said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The meeting is also expected to serve as a major conduit for
senior government officials to exchange views with mainland
China-based Taiwanese business people on cross-strait trade and
economic issues.</P>
      <P>In addition to Yu, Minister of Economic Affairs Christine Tsung,
MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen and SEF Chairman Koo Chen-fu will also
address the meeting.</P>
      <P>Trade sources said the business community is paying close
attention to the upcoming meeting as local industrial heavyweights
are keenly waiting for Yu's Cabinet to announce whether it will allow
them to set up 8-inch wafer manufacturing plants and upstream
petrochemical facilities in mainland China.</P>
      <P>"We hope to know whether Yu is likely to take advantage of the
lunch meeting to announce any major government policy goals or
directions," a CNFI executive said.</P>
      <P>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. Chairman Morris Chang
said earlier this month that the government should decide on major
cross-strait investment policies as soon as possible. Fresh from a
visit to major mainland Chinese industrial parks in the Shanghai
area, Chang also criticized the previous "no haste, be patient"
mainland investment policy, saying that too much government
interference with economic activities would only stymie business
vitality.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT GEARING UP FOR FUNDING BATTLE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  14 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With a legislative vote on a Cabinet move
to overturn the newly revised government budget allocation law
drawing near, the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) is stepping up
preparations for the upcoming showdown with the ruling party.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus whip Lin Yi-shih said Thursday that the
caucus is scheduled to call a news conference Friday morning to
pledge its determination to veto the Cabinet motion to overturn the
amendment bill to the Law Governing Government Revenues and
Expenditures.</P>
      <P>"We'll present a package of figures and other data at the news
conference to back our claim that all city and county governments
around our country will get more money from the Tax Redistribution
Fund under the revised budget allocation law," Lin explained.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed the revisions to the tax revenues
redistribution law, authored by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, a KMT
stalwart, on Jan. 18, but the Cabinet filed a proposal Feb. 6 asking
the Legislature to reconsider the revisions before the amendment bill
took effect.</P>
      <P>Lin said his party will invite mayors and magistrates of all
KMT-controlled cities and counties to a meeting Friday afternoon to
discuss the controversial funding issue and work out effective
strategy to uphold the Ma-initiated allocation revisions.</P>
      <P>"Friday is the first work day for government agencies after the
Chinese New Year holiday. We must start our lobbying drive on the
same day to underscore our determination to win the 'funding
battle,'" Lin stressed.</P>
      <P>On Saturday, Lin said, the party's policy coordination commission
will invite KMT mayors and magistrates as well as KMT legislators who
once served as local government chiefs to further discuss feasible
"winning strategy."</P>
      <P>In addition to mobilizing all KMT legislators to vote against the
Cabinet's motion for reconsideration, Lin said, the party will also
use every possible means and channels to help all social quarters
understand that the Ma-authored new tax revenues allocation law can
really help resolve local governments' financial problems.</P>
      <P>However, the legislative caucus of the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) expressed doubts about the reasonability and
feasibility of the new allocation law.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Tsai Huang-lang said he would not like to
see the issue become a partisan feud. "The KMT should let its
lawmakers vote on their own discretion through rational and
professional discussion."</P>
      <P>Tsai said he is convinced that if the KMT allow its lawmakers to
vote freely, many of them would vote against the Ma-authored version
as its allocation formula is impractical under the current
government fiscal situation.</P>
      <P>Under the revised allocation law, Tsai said, the
central government will have to blow up the base of the tax
redistribution fund, so that local governments can receive more
money. "But a bigger tax redistribution funding base obviously means
a cut into other spending," he noted, adding that the central
government will have to slash its subsidies to local governments for
education and social welfare programs in order to allow for
increased tax redistribution funds.</P>
      <P>The Legislature is scheduled to vote on the Cabinet's motion
to overturn the newly passed revision bill Feb. 19. To override
the motion, the opposition camp need to mobilize 113 votes. The KMT,
which controls 68 seats in the 225-member Legislature, will have to
seek the support of the People First Party (PFP), which controls 45
seats. The PFP has yet to announce its stance on the funding
dispute.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MORE SHIPS OF TAIWAN MARINE COMPANIES FLYING FOREIGN NATIONAL FLAGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More and more ships of Taiwan-based marine
corporations have been switching the national flag they fly out of
convenience, with less than 20 percent currently flying the Republic
of China flag, according to a Ministry of Transportation and
Communications (MOTC) official.</P>
      <P>The official said that the Evergreen Marine Corp.'s recent
announcement that at least half of its fleet will fly the British or
Italian national flag has arisen concerns which have been brewing for
many years that increasing numbers of local shipping companies are
switching the flags they fly on their vessels for convenience.</P>
      <P>MOTC statistics showed that in 1992, 24.4 percent of the shipping
liners of Taiwan-based shipping companies were flying the ROC
national flag, while by 2000, only 16.8 percent were flying the
national flag.</P>
      <P>An executive of the Republic of China Marine Business Association
said the maritime transportation sector has felt that it has not been
treated as an important production sector by the government despite
the fact the island is an export-oriented economy.</P>
      <P>The transportation sector has been granted fewer investment
incentives and less preferential treatment in terms of taxes,
according to the executive.</P>
      <P>He said that in order to encourage local shipping firms to have
more of their vessels fly the ROC national flag, the MOTC should
coordinate with other government departments in thoroughly reviewing
and revising the Maritime Law.</P>
      <P>He suggested that the government provide more preferential tax
treatment to the sector on the one hand, while on the other relaxing
restrictions regarding the recruitment of mariners and direct
shipping links between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>

      <P>The BOFT list of 2,058 products -- mostly raw materials for
manufacturing industries -- marked the largest number of items from
across the Taiwan Strait to be allowed in since Taiwan became a full
member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) on the first day of this
year.</P>
      <P>The BOFT made known the latest import list following approval by
the Executive Yuan on Jan. 16 of newly-revised trade policies that
allow direct trade between Taiwan and mainland China, direct imports
of mainland products to Taiwan and new control systems responsible
for monitoring imports from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The latest list of 2,058 items increased the number of products
that Taiwan allows to be directly imported from mainland China to
7,946 -- equal to 75 percent of what is desirable under the WTO
framework.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved an import list of 2,126 products from
mainland China on Jan. 16. But the BOFT temporarily shelved 68
products on the grounds that some of them are finished products that
if imported might pose threats to their domestically-produced Taiwan
counterparts. The 68 products included confectionery, grains,
feedstuffs, edible salt and natural sand.</P>
      <P>In the future, the BOFT will conduct a routine review every two
months on the mainland Chinese imports, and cross-division meetings
will be held every six months to fully monitor the imports from
across the Taiwan Strait, BOFT Director-General Wu Wen-ya said.</P>
      <P>Together with the latest BOFT-publicized list was another
announcement that the BOFT may take "relief" steps, including
restricting the volume of the imports, if any imported mainland
Chinese products are found upon review to have caused major
interferences in the Taiwan market, Wu said.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan also proposed on Jan. 16 that Taiwan allow
funds from mainland China to be invested in Taiwan's service industry
sector, including the domestic real estate and housing market.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) is aiming to open Taiwan
to all mainland Chinese industrial products except for about 100
items that concern national security, national defense and the
military preparedness of Taiwan. The opening will take place over
four years in three stages, according to Executive Yuan officials.</P>
      <P>Household electrical appliances, such as refrigerators and
television sets which could be competitive in terms of price against
their Taiwan-made counterparts, are not included on the latest list,
MOEA officials said.</P>
      <P>Of the nearly 900 categories of mainland Chinese agricultural
products on the list, citrus fruits, grapes, peaches, apples,
papayas, whole ducks, turkeys, and squid will be allowed to be freely
imported, while other items, including pears, betel nuts, chicken
meat, bottled milk, mackerel, dried mushrooms, coconuts, bananas,
pineapples, mangoes, dried longan and dried day lily, will be allowed
to be imported under a quota system, according to Council of
Agriculture (COA) officials.</P>
      <P>Since mainland China is still designated as a foot-and-mouth
disease affected area, the import of cloven-hoofed animals, including
pigs, cattle, goats and sheep -- and their meat -- will remain
banned, COA officials said.</P>
      <P>Other noted agricultural products, such as potatoes, guavas and
oranges, will also remain banned because those crops in mainland
China have reportedly been affected by diseases, the officials said.</P>

    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  14  (CNA)
(By James Kuo and Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>U.S policy toward Taiwan remains
unchanged, and according to the Taiwan Relations Act, Washington will
dutifully help Taiwan defend itself, U.S. National Security Adviser
Condoleezza Rice said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Rice said the U.S. policy toward Taiwan is clear and definite,
namely that the United States is against any changes to the status
quo in the Taiwan Strait by either side and that both sides of the
strait should resolve their differences peacefully.</P>
      <P>She made the remarks Thursday during a press conference held at
the White House mainly on the upcoming weeklong three-nation Asian
trip by U.S. President George W. Bush slated to begin Saturday.</P>
      <P>Bush is set to visit Beijing next Thursday and Friday after stops
in Tokyo and Seoul.</P>
      <P>During his stay in Beijing, President Bush has "no planned
meeting" with Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao, whom it has been
widely speculated will be the appointed successor to mainland Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, according to Rice.</P>
      <P>"We don't have plans to meet separately with him. It may well be
that they will see each other in some form," she said.</P>
      <P>Bush's Feb. 16-22 trip to Japan, South Korea and mainland China
is an important opportunity for the United States to "articulate and
demonstrate that our strategic interests in the region are remarkably
deep, diverse and enduring," Assistant Secretary of State for East
Asian and Pacific Affairs James Kelly said Thursday.</P>
      <P>President Bush will discuss the fight against international
terrorism, regional concerns, and bilateral issues during each stop
on his trip, Kelly said in a prepared statement made before the House
International Relations Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The nation's coffers could be topped up by
up to NT$30 billion (US$0.86 billion) a year from state-run lottery
sales if the recent frenzy in lottery ticket buying continues, Vice
Finance Minister Chang Hsiu-lian said Friday.</P>
      <P>Chang said the government could make NT$30 billion (US$0.86
billion) annually from the computerized lottery, including tax
revenue and profits, if the Ministry of Finance's goal of NT$100
billion (US$2.86 billion) in lottery ticket sales a year islandwide
is attained.</P>
      <P>He added that judging from the hot sales over the past several
weeks, overall lotto sales for the year might exceed that goal.</P>
      <P>The vice finance minister, however, noted that sales might also
drop in later months if the buying craze subsides.</P>
      <P>Taipei Bank launched Taiwan's first computerized lottery on Jan.
16 together with three other kinds of scratch-and-win lottery tickets
in a government program to help raise funds for the government as
well as for charity purposes.</P>
      <P>Lottery ticket sales for the first drawing of the computerized
lotto on Jan. 22 reached NT$776 million, with sales gradually
increasing over the past several weeks to over NT$2 billion for the
seventh drawing.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER STRESSES PRINCIPLE OF FAIRNESS IN ALLOCATION OF FINANCES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 15 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Friday the reason
the Executive Yuan has submitted a motion to the Legislative Yuan
requesting that it "reconsider" and "discuss" the revised finance
allocation law is so that the issue is settled based on the
principles of fairness and transparency.</P>
      <P>On the first working day after the Lunar New Year holidays,
Premier Yu reiterated his concern regarding the motion which was
submitted to the Legislative Yuan Feb. 6 and will face a legislative
vote Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>The revised allocation was approved by the previous Legislature
during its last session in January. Although it is only scheduled to
take effect from the start of fiscal 2003, the Executive Yuan said
that it finds implementing the revised allocation law too difficult
due to a possible financial shortfall of NT$150 billion caused by the
revision.</P>
      <P>The Premier said the Executive Yuan is asking the Legislature to
think over whether the revision is beneficial to the balanced
development of Taiwan's cities and counties.</P>
      <P>Referring to Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou's role as a major promoter
of the revision in the law, Premier Yu said metaphorically that the
finance allocation must not be the lone decision of the "eldest
brother" and that each of the 25 "brothers" (cities and counties) in
the "family" should have a say.</P>
      <P>Responding to Premier Yu's statement, Mayor Ma said that the
revised law takes into consideration the welfare of "all brothers and
sisters" and is meant to fulfill President Chen Shui-bian's election
campaign promise of allowing local governments more freedom in their
financial management.</P>
      <P>The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) called for a press
conference Friday morning to explain the ruling party's position.
Tsai Huang-liang, secretary-general of the DPP Caucus in the
Legislative Yuan, reiterated the party's concern that the Executive
Yuan will not be able to make both ends meet under the revised
allocation law.</P>
      <P>While calling for all the DPP legislators to support the
administration, Tsai said that the DPP will not use party discipline
to confine its members on an issue of public policy.</P>
      <P>Since the revised law was approved by the previous Kuomintang
(KMT)-majority Legislature, the KMT, which is the largest
opposition party in the current Legislature, is resolute that the
Legislative Yuan will not pass the motion Feb. 19.</P>
      <P>At the weekly meeting of the Central Standing Committee Feb. 6,
KMT Chairman Lien Chan gave the directive that all KMT legislators
must be mobilized to block the motion. Lien will call for a KMT
caucus meeting at the Legislative Yuan in the evening of Feb. 18.</P>
      <P>Lin Yi-shih, secretary-general of the KMT Caucus, also called on
legislators of other parties to support the KMT position. He pointed
out that the motion is nothing but a "political gesture" by the DPP.
The administration can request further revisions to the allocation
law if it is necessary instead of having to overturn the revised law.</P>
      <P>To override the motion for reconsideration, the opposition
parties need to mobilize 113 votes.</P>
      <P>Lin Feng-cheng, secretary-general of the KMT Central Committee,
convened a meeting of mayors and magistrates of KMT-ruled cities and
counties Friday afternoon to discuss measures against the motion.</P>
      <P>The National Policy Foundation, a KMT think tank, is calling for
a public hearing Saturday morning. Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, Lin
Chuan, who is the director-general of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and Lin's predecessor Wei Duan
will discuss with scholars and specialists the issue of the proper
distribution of public finances.</P>
      <P>While the KMT is gearing up for the battle, the People First
Party (PFP) has remained undecided on the issue. Chin Huei-chu,
deputy convener of the PFP Caucus, said the party caucus will reach a
resolution Feb. 18, although a preliminary opinion survey among PFP
legislators shows that more than half will choose to block the motion
first and submit a new revised version for discussion thereafter.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN CALLS FOR RECONCILIATION AMONG PARTIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian on Friday called
for reconciliation among Taiwan's political parties to help secure
peace and stability in the nation's politics.</P>
      <P>In a group greeting ceremony held at the Presidential Office
after the Chinese New Year holidays, Chen said he hopes that during
this new year, peace and harmony will replace bickering and
confrontation between the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and the
opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Chen said because of everybody's hard work, the nation and the
people survived many challenges last year. In the new year, he said,
"we have to work even harder, because the new challenges will neither
be fewer nor milder than last year's."</P>
      <P>In the face of increasingly harsh competition in the
international arena, Chen said, "we have no time to hesitate and no
resources to waste."</P>
      <P>Only by pooling together the will and efforts of the entire
nation's people can Taiwan move ahead and not be left behind in the
global competition, Chen said.</P>
      <P>Also speaking at the ceremony, Vice President Annette Lu said
that in the new year, Taiwan faces five major challenges in the areas
of the environment, the economy, politics, society and ethics, all of
which will severely test the wisdom and confidence of the people of
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lu said in order to tide over these challenges, the nation should
first consolidate its leadership so that the people can regain their
confidence in the government.</P>
      <P>Most importantly, she said, the people should seek to bolster
brotherhood and compassion among each other.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI BANK WILL WIND UP POPULAR LOTTERY IF ORDERED: BANK OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  16  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>TAIPEIBANK will wind up the recently
launched government-sponsored lottery if and when ordered to do so by
regulators, a manager for the bank was quoted as saying Saturday
after Vice President Annette Lu denounced the lottery as a "social
landslide."</P>
      <P>Yang Jui-tung, the manager for the lottery organized by
TAIPEIBANK, said his bank will stop running the lottery if the
government gives the order, according to a report in the China Times
Express Saturday.</P>
      <P>He also told the newspaper the bank has already withdrawn a
television commercial which boasts the lottery as a way of converting
papaya seeds into caviar, which has a similar appearance.</P>
      <P>Instead of encouraging the purchase of lottery tickets, Yang
said, his bank will focus future advertisements for the lottery on
its contributions to social welfare.</P>
      <P>The lottery has enthralled people around the island since it was
launched Jan. 16, with people waiting in long lines to purchase
tickets.</P>
      <P>The enthusiasm stirred up by the lottery has drawn fire from
critics who claim it is encouraging gambling and the idea of getting
rich quick instead of through hard work. Underground lotteries have
also begun using the winning numbers of the lottery to choose their
winners.</P>
      <P>Annette Lu represents the most prominent figure who has
criticized the lottery with her "social landslide" comments.</P>
      <P>Her remarks have led to speculation that the government may
backpedal on its approval of the lottery as was done in 1990 when the
government at the time ordered TAIPEIBANK to put a halt to a similar
lottery after only three drawings.</P>
      <P>The present lottery has been so popular that many venders have
run out of the special paper used to print the tickets before
Saturday.</P>
      <P>Yang Jui-tung said Saturday that the paper shortage could not be
relieved until next week as all the bank's paper which was expected
to last six months has already been used up in a single month and the
next consignment of paper imported by the bank will not arrive until
next week.</P>
      <P>The bank is mulling over whether to change the computer program
to allow for five bets per single ticket, but such a change would
take at least one month to carry out, Yang said.</P>
      <P>He estimated that about one-tenth of the 2000 to 3000 lottery
ticket venders have run out of the paper for printing the tickets,
but local newspapers have reported that about one-fifth of the
venders have suffered shortages of the paper, with each vender
sustaining losses of about NT$20,000 per day.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO CONTINUE IN EFFORTS TO JOIN WHO: HEALTH DEP'T HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By David Wang and David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan will continue in its efforts to
join the World Health Organization (WHO), Taiwan's top health policy
planner said Friday in New York.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-liang, head of the Republic of China's Cabinet-level
Department of Health, made the remark while being interviewed by the
German press agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur (DPA).</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan meets all the requirements for joining the
organization and has the resources to help solve other countries'
health issues, adding that "joining the WHO is a fundamental right of
the 23 million people of Taiwan."</P>
      <P>Because of mainland China's opposition, Taiwan has only been
seeking to become a WHO observer instead of a full member. At
present, the Geneva-based WHO has 191 members, including mainland
China.</P>
      <P>The WHO holds an assembly each May, and mainland China has each
year consistently obstructed proposals put forth for granting Taiwan
entry into the organization as an observer.</P>
      <P>Lee said that Taiwan will continue in its efforts this year to
become a WHO observer. Although the United States has not openly
supported Taiwan in achieving this goal, it has also not stated that
it will not support it, he noted.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan hopes to join the WHO "on the basis of pure
humanity" because "being part of such an international organization
will not only help many other countries, it will also benefit
Taiwan."</P>
      <P>He pointed out that Taiwan spends more than US$100 million
annually on aid to dozens of countries, including the sending of
medical care experts to these countries to help solve health issues.</P>
      <P>However, he added that Taiwan's medical care experts stationed
abroad, especially in those countries that do no have diplomatic
relations with Taiwan, do not yet have the same protections provided
by international conventions that are enjoyed by United Nations
personnel.</P>
      <P>Only by Taiwan joining the WHO can the island's medical care
experts be put under the same protections, Lee said, adding that
Taiwan needs the WHO and the WHO needs Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Lee told the DPA that 90 percent of the people of Taiwan are
covered by the island's national health care system, a figure that is
second only to Sweden in terms of the percentage of a nation's
population receiving such coverage.</P>
      <P>Because Taiwan has not been admitted into the United Nations, it
cannot quickly receive aid from abroad, according to the DPA report,
which cited the disastrous earthquake that hit Taiwan in 1999 when
reluctance on the part of Beijing to allow relief aircraft to use its
airspace meant aid materials were unable to quickly reach
quake-stricken areas.</P>
      <P>Lee is scheduled to depart for Taipei Friday night.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE SPEAKER OF LEGISLATURE CALLS FOR ROC-JAPAN FREE TRADE PACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tokyo,  Feb. 16 (CNA)
(By Mike Chang &amp; Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The vice president of the Republic of China
Legislative Yuan said Saturday that Japan should enter into a free
trade agreement with Taiwan, just as it did with Singapore.</P>
      <P>In an interview published in the Saturday edition of Japan's
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, P. K. Chiang, the former ROC economics
minister, said such a pact, preferably including South Korea and Hong
Kong, would significantly reduce costs for Japan's manufacturing
industry.</P>
      <P>He said that compared to their Japanese counterparts, Taiwan
businesspeople are more accustomed to mainland Chinese trade
practices, adding that closer cooperation with Taiwan
businesspeople would help Japanese businesspeople to venture into the
market of mainland China, which operates more by the rule of
administrators than by the rule of law, which often confounds
Japanese traders who are used to the latter.</P>
      <P>The former ROC government's chief economist prescribed two kinds
of medicine for Japan which, like Taiwan, has been suffering from a
hollowing-out of its industry with many domestic companies relocating
their manufacturing operations overseas.</P>
      <P>The two remedies for Japan he mentioned were the upgrading of its
technology to churn out products with higher added-value, and the
improving of its research and development capabilities as well as of
its capability of exploring new markets to sustain its status as one
of the logistics centers in Asia.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong has held its own with other cities in the region by
maintaining itself as a center of logistics, while Taiwan has had an
advantage over Hong Kong in terms of research and development as well
as manufacturing.</P>
      <P>A free trade pact with Hong Kong and Taiwan would offer Japan a
valuable opportunity to exploit the competitive edges of these two
regions for its own benefit, Chiang continued.</P>
      <P>He blamed Japan's mismanagement of its bubble economy for the
exodus of many of its companies, which has in turn worsened the
country's economy, not to mention the effects of the emergence of the
mainland Chinese economy which has attracted huge amounts of
investment.</P>
      <P>Taiwan has been plagued by the same problems over the last year
or two, Chiang noted, adding that a free trade pact with Japan would
help stem the outflow of capital and business in both places.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. POLICY TOWARD TAIWAN UNCHANGED: U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  15 (CNA)
(By Jay Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>White House National Security Adviser
Condoleezza Rice on Thursday ruled out a major restatement on U.S.
policy toward Taiwan during President George W. Bush's trip to
Beijing next week, saying America's policy is "very clear" and
unchanged.</P>
      <P>"The United States doesn't want to see any unilateral change in
the status quo (across the Taiwan Strait)," Rice said in response to
a question during a special briefing on the president's trip.</P>
      <P>She said that cross-strait issues should be resolved peacefully
by both sides of the strait and that the United States has certain
obligations under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to help Taiwan defend
itself.</P>
      <P>"Those are the cornerstones of American policy toward Taiwan,"
she pointed out, adding that this "has not changed, and I don't think
it needs particularly to be restated (during the president's trip),"
she added.</P>
      <P>The comments came as President Bush prepares to leave on Saturday
for a weeklong tour to Northeast Asia, with scheduled stops in
Beijing as well as in Tokyo and Seoul.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, a senior State Department official said that
Bush will reiterate to the mainland Chinese leadership a "strong
interest in a candid, cooperative and constructive relationship that
reflects fully American ideals and values".</P>
      <P>James Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for Asia and the
Pacific, told a congressional hearing that in addition to discussing
the war on terrorism, Bush will during his visit try to expand common
ground with mainland China in critical areas.</P>
      <P>The areas for possible cooperation include fighting the illicit
drug trade and the trafficking in people. Kelly also said that the
U.S. side will "speak frankly with Chinese leaders about our
differences on issues such as non-proliferation and human rights".</P>
      <P>At the White House briefing, Rice said that the United States
also wants to engage Beijing on issues of strategic nuclear policy.</P>
      <P>Bush will tell Beijing's leaders that the U.S. missile defense
program "is not aimed at anybody, it is not intended to give the
United States unilateral advantage, and all peace-loving countries
should be comfortable" with the program, she said.</P>
      <P>The president will arrive in Beijing on Feb. 21 after stops in
Tokyo and Seoul. Highlights of Bush's visit to Beijing will include
meeting with mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu
Rongji, delivering a speech at Chinghwa University, and touring the
Great Wall.</P>
      <P>This will be Bush's second trip to mainland China in four months.
He was in Shanghai in October for the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation informal leadership summit. At the time, he was scheduled
to visit Beijing as well as the Japanese and South Korean capitals,
but the trip was cut short because of the war in Afghanistan.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A war over how to divide revenues between
the central and local governments was simmering Saturday with both
the ruling and opposition parties going out of their way to canvass
support for their positions.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers of the leading opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which
initiated and pushed through a change to the existing rules governing
the allocation of revenues among the various governments during the
last session of the previous Legislature in January, fanned out
across the island Saturday to gain support for a rejection of the
Executive Yuan's request for a cancellation of the revision which
gives local governments a bigger share of revenue.</P>
      <P>Claiming the revision will give local governments more financial
resources without damaging the central government's ability to carry
out its policies, the KMT organized a symposium on the issue Saturday
to press home its case.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT, who asked KMT
lawmakers to come up with a revision, said at the symposium that by
suggesting a change in the allocation of finances, he was only trying

the public should refrain from overindulging in the recently launched
government-supported lottery, saying that it has caused a "social
landslide."</P>

suspended.</P>
      <P>The vice president made the remarks while speaking at a ceremony
marking the opening of the 13-story Buddhist Cheng Te Cultural and
Educational Building in Taipei to use.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the people should speak, behave and earn money with
a good conscience and that they should not get lost in what she
called a "political, economic, cultural and social mudslide."</P>
      <P>Several other prominent political figures also attended the
ceremony, including Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, Vice Minister of the
Interior Hsu Ying-shen and Legislative Yuan members Chen Hsueh-sheng

      <P>Paraguayan President Luis Angel Gonzalez
Macchi has expressed the hope that he can visit the Republic of China
sometime this May, a senior official of the Cabinet-level Council for
Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Yeh Ming-feng, secretary general of the CEPD, said that the

      <P>Yeh said that President Gonzalez attached great importance to the

      <P>During his meetings with the mission in Asuncion, President
Gonzalez repeatedly expressed his gratitude to the ROC for its
assistance in helping Paraguay's economic development, Yeh said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP LU HOPES TAIWAN AND MAINLAND CHINA WORK TOGETHER FOR PEACE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  17  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu of the Republic
of China Saturday expressed the hope that mainland China and Taiwan
will avoid confrontation and work together for "permanent peace"
through cooperation.</P>
      <P>In a video conference with some 500 Taiwanese American students
attending the 2002 annual meeting of Taiwanese American Student
Associations at Harvard University, Lu said she hoped the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait would be reconciled with each other and cooperate
with each other. The students are from Harvard, Yale, Cornell, and
other leading universities of the United States.</P>
      <P>Speaking from her office at the Presidential Palace in Taipei, Lu
said mainland China and Taiwan are "distant relatives" and "near
neighbors," pointing out that the Communist government established by
Mao Zedong in 1949 has never ruled Taiwan even for one minute.
"Taiwan is absolutely not a part of the People's Republic of China,"
she added.</P>
      <P>Lu hoped that mainland China and Taiwan should help each other
as relatives and neighbors. "They should work together for peace and
prosperity, and avoid war and hatred," she said.</P>
      <P>She encouraged Beijing to embrace the system of freedom and
democracy and abandon its "one country, two systems" rhetoric.
She hoped that the two sides would "compete with each other," and not
"struggle against each other."</P>
      <P>Since the two sides have joined the World Trade Organization
(WTO), they should be able to increase their economic and other
exchanges in a peaceful and reciprocal way under the framework of the
world trade regulating body, Lu asserted.</P>
      <P>The vice president predicted that Beijing would try very hard to
have President George W. Bush say something unfavorable to Taiwan
during his visit to Beijing on Feb. 21-22. This kind of mentality (to
hurt Taiwan) will certainly strengthen Taiwan people's suspicion and
fear of China and hinder the development of friendly relations, she
pointed out.</P>
      <P>Lu told the students that in the past 50 years Taiwan has made
a great achievement in the promotion of democracy, freedom, human
rights, and benevolence for the people, and also in the development
of high technology. This is a kind of what she called "soft national
strength," which mainland China doesn't have.</P>
      <P>She encouraged the students to make the "soft national strength"
known to their American friends in the hope that they will better
understand Taiwan and help it join more international organizations.</P>

cancellation of the revenue allocation law revision passed in January
during the last session of the previous Legislature.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tsai Huang-lang, secretary-general of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's) legislative caucus, called on
the opposition parties not to resort to party discipline so as to
allow all legislators to vote freely on the issue in this coming
Tuesday's vote.</P>
      <P>Tsai told a CNA reporter that the DPP's legislative caucus will
meet Monday afternoon to discuss the Executive Yuan's request, saying
that the DPP will not use party discipline against its members.</P>
      <P>He said that a DPP legislative caucus task force was continuing
to lobby those legislators elected from counties in southern Taiwan
and the aboriginal areas, stressing that the results of these efforts
have been good.</P>

allocation plan within two months.</P>
      <P>Opposition KMT Chairman Lien Chan, who is currently on a visit to
Europe, has decided to cut his trip short and return to Taipei Monday
to lead KMT lawmakers in rejecting the Executive Yuan's request.</P>
      <P>Lien will attend the KMT's legislative caucus meeting to be held
Monday evening to map out the party's strategy in blocking passage of
the Executive Yuan's request.</P>
      <P>KMT Secretary-General Lin Feng-cheng said that the KMT chairman
is deeply concerned over the Executive Yuan's proposal and that Lien
has discussed counter-measures with him and Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou
and has directed him to convey his instructions to all KMT lawmakers.</P>
      <P>The KMT will do its utmost to mobilize its lawmakers to reject
the Executive Yuan's request, Lin noted, but he refused to say
whether the KMT will resort to party discipline.</P>
      <P>Members of the KMT legislative caucus will call on Kaohsiung
Mayor Frank Hsieh Monday with the aim of pushing Hsieh to express his
position on the revision issue.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Legislator Chou Hsi-wei of the opposition People First
Party (PFP) said that a great majority of PFP lawmakers are opposed
to the Executive Yuan's request. He pointed out that the final
decision will be made Monday at the party's legislative caucus
meeting, adding he believes that all PFP lawmakers will vote against
the Executive Yuan's request.</P>

    <HEADLINE>YU MAKES LAST-MINUTE EFFORTS TO HAVE ALLOCATION REVISION OVERTURNED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun made last-minute
efforts Monday to have the newly-revised allocation law overturned by
visiting separate party caucuses at the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Yu met with Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng and the
legislative caucus leaders to lobby for support of the Executive
Yuan's motion to overturn the allocation law revisions that were
passed Jan. 18 during the last session of the previous Legislature.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed the revisions to the tax revenues
redistribution law, authored by Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, a stalwart
of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT), but the Cabinet filed a proposal
Feb. 6 asking that the Legislature reconsider before the amendment
bill takes effect.</P>
      <P>Yu noted that the amendment bill was enacted by the "old
Legislature" elected on public opinion of three years earlier, saying
that the bill should be looked at and discussed again by the new
Legislature elected based on present public opinion.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan has opted to try to have the new revenue
allocation law overturned as it said it finds it extremely difficult
to carry out, Yu pointed out.</P>
      <P>The Legislature is scheduled to vote Tuesday on the Cabinet's
motion to overturn the revision bill, with the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) and the opposition parties gearing up for
battle as partisan disputes over the issue rising.</P>
      <P>On the eve of the Tuesday showdown, Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng said he takes no sides on the issue. "Whether the
revision bill is overturned or not, in my opinion, there is a third
case -- namely that new amendments to the revision bill are
inevitable," Wang noted.</P>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma said if the revision bill were to be overturned
in Tuesday's vote, it would be tantamount to a failure of financial
reform regarding local-level governments.</P>
      <P>Ma said the newly revised allocation law can really help resolve
local governments' financial problems, adding that most of all, it is
designed to fulfill President Chen Shui-bian's campaign promise of
giving more power and money to local governments.</P>
      <P>At a public hearing at the Legislative Yuan called by independent
Legislator Sisy Chen over the much-disputed issue, Lin Chuan, head of
the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, said if
the revision bill were indeed to take effect, it would leave both the
central and the local governments in a deeper financial quagmire with
nobody faring any better.</P>
      <P>Lin called for support for the overturning of the revision bill,
saying that if it is successfully overturned in Tuesday's vote, the
Executive Yuan will submit a new amendment bill in three months to
replace the Ma-authored revision.</P>
      <P>The opposition People First Party (PFP) said in a position paper
Monday that it is opposed to the ruling DPP's scheme to highlight the
revision dispute by ordering an overturn motion which has made the
legal issue a political one.</P>
      <P>The PFP requested that the Executive Yuan put forth a new amended
version of the finance allocation law in two months so as to help
settle the dispute.</P>
      <P>PFP Policy Center director Chang Hsien-yao noted that the PFP
expressed strong protest and regret over the ruling DPP's recent
moves to exert pressure on local governments over the overturn plan.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, many local governments have been threatened
recently that if they don't support the overturn plan, their regular
subsidies and subsidies under special plans will all be cut.</P>
      <P>He added that the threats to the local governments have in turn
affected the attitudes on the revision issue of some of the elected
legislators representing local counties.</P>
      <P>The KMT fanned out across the island over the weekend to gain
support for a rejection of the Executive Yuan's request for a
cancellation of the Ma-authored revision, which gives local
governments a bigger share of revenue.</P>
      <P>The KMT claimed that the revision will give local governments
more financial resources without damaging the central government's
ability to carry out its policies.</P>
      <P>To override the Executive Yuan's planned overturn motion, the
opposition camp needs to mobilize 113 votes in the 225-seat
Legislature. The KMT, which controls 68 seats, will have to gain the
support of lawmakers from the PFP, which holds 46 seats, and possibly
other independent legislators in order to be successful in Tuesday's
showdown.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC TO BECOME 29TH CONTRACTING PARTY TO GPA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Geneva-based World Trade Organization
(WTO) is expected to approve the Republic of China's application to
join its Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) Thursday, making
Taiwan the 29th signatory to the multilateral accord.</P>
      <P>The WTO's GPA commission is scheduled to hold a meeting Wednesday
and Thursday whose agenda will include endorsing the ROC's
GPA membership.</P>
      <P>An ROC delegation, headed by Kuo Yao-chi, chairwoman of the
Cabinet-level Public Construction Commission (PCC), left for Geneva
Monday to attend the upcoming GPA conference as Taiwan became a full
WTO member at the beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>Once the GPA commission approves Taiwan's GPA accession
protocol, the document will then be referred to the ROC's
Legislative Yuan for approval. According to WTO regulations, Taiwan
will formally become a GPA signatory or contracting party 30 days
after it deposits its instrument of ratification at the WTO's
Secretariat.</P>
      <P>If all goes smoothly, Taiwan will become the GPA's 29th
signatory around the end of March or early April. Joining the GPA
will create both opportunities and challenges for Taiwan. While other
GPA signatories must open their government procurement markets, worth
an estimated NT$6.8 trillion (US$194.29 billion) annually, to Taiwan,
the island will also have to allow foreign companies to bid for its
government procurement projects, including engineering, financial and
labor services, worth about NT$200 billion per year.</P>
      <P>In view of Taiwan's impending participation in the GPA, Premier
Yu Shyi-kun has ordered the PCC and other relevant government
agencies to brace up for both the opportunities and challenges that
will come with the GPA accession.</P>
      <P>A PCC official said Taiwan's civil engineering and construction
industries still lack the experience of cooperation in exploring
overseas markets. "Local engineering and construction companies must
streamline structures and management in order to upgrade their
competitiveness," said the official.</P>
      <P>He pointed out that many of Taiwan's engineering and
construction firms should merge among themselves so that they can
pool their resources for securing overseas construction contracts.</P>
      <P>For its part, the official said, the PCC will coordinate with
the Ministry of the Interior and other government agencies in
revising the existing laws governing construction, consulting
services, architects and civil engineering technicians to
facilitate their merger and cooperation.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the domestic power generation equipment manufacturing
industry will also face increased foreign competition after Taiwan
becomes a GPA contracting party.</P>
      <P>The state-owned Taiwan Power Co. purchases about NT$30 billion
worth of electricity generating facilities annually. The Ministry of
Economic Affairs plans to open 67 of those items to both domestic
and foreign bidders from July 1. Most of the listed products are no
longer suitable for domestic production.</P>
      <P>As for 28 other items that local manufacturers still command
some competitive edge, they will not be opened to international
bidding within the first five years following Taiwan's signing of the
GPA.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KEELUNG GOVERNMENT TO SEARCH FOR RUMORED GOLD NEAR OLD FORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Annoyed by repeated acts of vandalism by
people looking for gold rumored to have been buried in an old battery
fort in Keelung by Japanese forces during World War II, the
government of the city in northern Taiwan has decided to try its own
luck at uncovering the alleged cache.</P>
      <P>Rumor has it that some 5,000 kilograms of gold were buried by the
Japanese near the Tahwulun Battery Fort on a hill in Keelung City
before the invaders fled the country after Japan was defeated in the
war.</P>
      <P>The rumors have led to many stealthy raids by fortune-seekers
over the past decades, including the last one on Jan. 21 this year.
The latest attempt to find the gold was particularly brazen, with
those responsible running an excavator over a low brick wall during
the dead of night and driving into the fort dig.</P>
      <P>Nobody knows if anything was taken away, nor is there any
evidence that gold was recovered in earlier attempts in 1994 and
1999.</P>
      <P>Keelung City Government officials said the rumored 5,000
kilograms of gold would currently be worth over NT$1 billion and
could be contained in a relatively small container of about 65cm x 65
cm x 65 cm. Officials said that if the government does not step in
the site will continue to attract unlawful attempts to strike it
rich.</P>
      <P>Lin Chen-hsing, a Keelung City Government official in charge of
civil and cultural affairs, said the government will explore the
battery fort, now a park, to determine whether the rumors are true
before vandals do more damage to the fort and its adjacent
environment.</P>
      <P>The Tahwulun Battery Fort, built in the Ching dynasty to fight
against and watch for invaders from the sea, is now a second-class
national legacy location entitled to government protection.</P>
      <P>According to Lin, the Ministry of the Interior (MOI) is willing
to allocate funds to financially support the Keelung City
Government's exploration plan.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the first-stage of the examination of the
location will begin in March, with the Keelung government offering
open bids for potential diggers to compete the excavation work.</P>
      <P>According to Liu Wen-shih, director of the MOI Department of
Civil Affairs, a man surnamed Chen from Taipei County wrote the
Ministry of National Defense (MND) authorities in 1983, saying that
he intended to apply for MND permission to excavate for gold on the
site. Back then, the fort was under the jurisdiction of the MND.</P>
      <P>Chen said he was told by a Japanese soldier during the period
when Taiwan was still under Japanese colonial occupation that some
5,000 kilograms of gold were buried near the battery fort in Keelung.
Chen said he is positive that the Japanese were unable to recover the
gold in their rush to leave the island.</P>
      <P>At the time, the MND authorities didn't take Chen's application
seriously. The application was subsequently passed on to the MOI,
which also ignored Chen's proposal, considering it nonsense, Liu
said.</P>
      <P>Since then, many have speculated on the veracity of Chen's claim
and others have searched -- illegally and in vain -- for the gold.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGNERS ACCOUNT FOR 8.9% OF TAIWAN'S GRASSROOTS LABOR FORCE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Foreign nationals have become an important
group in Taiwan's grassroots work force, accounting for 8.9 percent
of the island's total manual labor force in 2001, the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA) reported Monday.</P>
      <P>CLA tallies showed that 304,605 foreign laborers legally worked
in Taiwan last year, with the manufacturing sector accounting for the
lion's share of alien workers.</P>
      <P>According to CLA statistics, 157,000 foreigners worked in various
manufacturing industries in 2001, marking a 14 percent drop from the
year-earlier level amid a lingering domestic economic slowdown.</P>
      <P>In contrast, the number of foreign nationals engaging in social
and personal services increased 6 percent from the 2001 level to
113,000 due to local people's increasing demand for family helpers
and housemaids.</P>
      <P>In terms of nationalities, Thailand remained the largest source
of foreign laborers, accounting for 128,000. Indonesia came in second
with 91,000, followed by the Philippines with 72,000, and Vietnam
with 13,000.</P>
      <P>CLA tallies also showed that Taoyuan County had the largest
number of foreign laborers last year, totaling 64,740. Next was
Taipei County with 43,538; Taipei City, 35,733; Taichung County,
33,022; and Changhua County, 19,527.</P>
      <P>"The figures indicate that counties with industrial parks or
export processing zones remain the main areas of concentration for
foreign laborers," a CLA official said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CANADIAN SUPPORT GROWING FOR TIBET-CHINA DIALOGUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Ottawa, Feb. 17 (CNA)
(By S.C. Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Canadian parliamentary and civilian support
for dialogue between Tibet's exile government and the mainland
Chinese government is growing despite the cancellation of a visit by
the Dalai Lama to the Canadian capital scheduled for late April.</P>
      <P>Tibet's spiritual leader was to visit Ottawa April 28-30, but the
visit was canceled as a result of his recent illness. The Kashag
(Cabinet of the Tibetan Government in Exile), as well as friends and
supporters of the Dalai Lama and Tibet, have expressed concern about
the many demands on his time.</P>
      <P>Thubten Samdup, president of the Canada Tibet Committee, which
was to host the visit to Ottawa, said that "we will continue to press
the Canadian government to play an active role in bringing the
Government of China to the negotiation table to resolve the ongoing
conflict peacefully.</P>
      <P>Samdup noted that the Dalai Lama's scheduled visit to Canada in
2004 has not been affected by the current cancellation.</P>
      <P>The Canada Tibet Committee has kicked off Campaign 2002, with the
goal of getting half of the members of Parliament, or 150 members, to
sign on to a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien asking
him to convene face-to-face negotiations between representatives of
the Dalai Lama and the mainland Chinese government.</P>
      <P>"We already have more than 80 signatures," including those of 20
Liberal members of Parliament, Samdup said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, a group of twelve prominent Canadians has sent a
letter to Chretien encouraging him to meet with the Dalai Lama if he
visits Canada.</P>
      <P>The twelve, who formed an advisory committee for the visit,
include representatives from Canada's First Nations, business,
non-governmental, labor and entertainment communities.</P>
      <P>"The diversity of the committee reflects the broad-based support
for Tibet among Canadians", said Samdup, adding that "the willingness
of these individuals to lend their names to the Dalai Lama's visit is
a reflection of their sentiment towards this man and his cause."</P>
      <P>They include Ms. Patricia Adams, executive director of Probe
International; Hon. Mr. Warren Allmand, president of Rights &amp;
Democracy; Hon. Mr. Ed Broadbent, author and former leader of the
federal New Democratic Party; Mr. Matthew Coon Come, national chief
of the Assembly of First Nations; and Mr. Ken Georgetti, president of

    <HEADLINE>TAIPEI LANTERN FESTIVAL INSPIRED BY EXPRESSIONIST PAINTINGS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The 2002 Taipei Lantern Festival will
feature a series of giant lanterns representing Vincent van Gogh's
"Irises in the Garden," Marc Chagall's "I and the Village," Gustav
Climt's "Kiss," and Pablo Picasso's "Dream," an official of the
Taipei City Government said Monday.</P>
      <P>The official said that the lantern craftsmen in Taipei are trying
to present new designs with motifs borrowed from the most prominent
European painters of the 19th and 20th centuries, adding
international flavor to the traditional Chinese festival on the 15th
of the first lunar month, which falls on Feb. 26 this year.</P>
      <P>The official said that the giant theme lantern, however, will be
modeled on the Chinese zodiac animal of the year -- a horse. Since
the Taipei Lantern Festival was first held in 1990 on and around the
Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, the zodiac animal of the year has been
chosen every year as the motif of the theme lantern.</P>
      <P>In the evenings from Feb. 26 to March 3, the city government has
arranged a series of gala activities at the plaza in front of the
memorial hall.</P>
      <P>A most lively festival which marks the conclusion of the Chinese
New Year celebrations, the Lantern Festival will be celebrated at
temples and cultural centers around the island.</P>
      <P>In Kaohsiung, the city government and the Tourism Bureau will
jointly sponsor a parade of lantern-decorated wagons. The Taichung
City Government is presenting an exhibition of lanterns featuring
Chinese folklore as well as environmental protection themes at the

      <P>A former opposition Kuomintang (KMT)
stalwart, now deputy secretary-general of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU), was promoted to secretary-general of the
party Monday, a TSU source said.</P>
      <P>Lin Chih-chia will succeed Su Chin-chiang, who was recently
designated by President Chen Shui-bian as an adviser to the National
Security Council and will take the new post in the next two days,
said Hsiao Kuan-yu, director of the TSU's cultural and publicity
affairs department.</P>
      <P>Lin had served as KMT legislator, secretary-general of the
party's caucus in the legislature, and director of the KMT's policy
research department.</P>
      <P>Lin originally planned to run for the magistrateship of Taipei
County, northern Taiwan, in last yearend's legislative and local
elections. However, he decided to let the opposition New
Party-nominated Wang Chien-shien run for the post to keep his promise
that he would withdraw from the election if his approval rating was
lower than Wang's in an opinion poll.</P>
      <P>Wang took a slight lead against Lin in the opinion poll and
represented the so-called "pan-blue alliance," which had support from

      <P>Over 250,000 visitors from across Taiwan
poured into Taitung County during the nine days of the Chinese Lunar
New Year holiday, the East Coast National Scenic Area Administration
reported Monday.</P>
      <P>Recreational resorts and tourist spots located in the Chihpen Hot
Springs, the East Rift Valley National Scenic Area and the East Coast
National Scenic Area were the most popular destinations in the

    <HEADLINE>VALUE OF INTERNET ADS ESTIMATED TO EXCEED NT$1 BILLION FOR 2002</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Fueled by a global economic recovery and a
large increase in the number of broadband users, the value of ads on
the Internet may break the NT$1 billion mark for the first time to
hit NT$1.11 billion for 2002, the Market Information Center (MIC)
under the Institute for Information Industry has forecast.</P>
      <P>MIC analyst C. L. Kung said the Internet ads market began to
burgeon in 1996 with the spread of online businesses. The market
scale was NT$120 million in 1998, with the figure rising to NT$350
million in 1999 and NT$870 million in 2000, respectively, Kung said.
However, the figure fell to NT$830 million for 2001, the first
decline in six years, as a result of the economic slump, he added.</P>
      <P>Affected by the recession, advertisements in major news media
such as newspapers and on television stations registered an average
decline of 10 percent in 2001, ahead of the 4.59 percent fall on the
Internet, he noted.</P>
      <P>According to an MIC investigation, the leading reason behind
those businesses which did not post ads on the Internet last year was
a "skepticism about their effectiveness."</P>
      <P>Kung said the number of Taiwan's wide-band household users is
expected to reach 2 million this year and that has raised high
expectations in the local Internet industry that a new era of GPRS
and third-generation mobile phones will be heralded in the near
future.</P>
      <P>He forecast that the scale of the Internet ads market will
further expand by 42 percent to NT$1.58 billion in 2003, with the
figure continuing to increase to NT$2.38 billion in 2004 and NT$3.74
billion in 2005.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT MEMBERS QUESTION POLICE ROLE AS CABINET'S 'DELIVERY SERVICE'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four opposition Kuomintang (KMT) lawmakers
filed an appeal with the Control Yuan Monday asking the nation's
highest watchdog body to look into whether the Cabinet had abused its
power in ordering police to deliver documents to local government
chiefs.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative caucus deputy whip Lee Chuan-chiao and three of
his colleagues -- Lee Chia-chin, Chu Feng-chi and Cheng Feng-shih --
filed the joint appeal on the eve of a legislative vote on a Cabinet
motion to overturn an amendment bill to the Law Governing Allocation
of Government Revenues and Expenditures.</P>
      <P>The four legislators asked the Control Yuan to probe the
propriety of the Cabinet's directive that demanded city and county
police bureaus deliver their position papers on the budget allocation
issue to the country's 25 mayors and magistrates as well as the 225
lawmakers before Feb. 16.</P>
      <P>They enclosed with their appeal a duplicate copy of the National
Police Administration's notice to city and county police bureaus
regarding delivery of the Cabinet's position paper for the reference
of the watchdog body.</P>
      <P>The KMT lawmakers claimed that the Cabinet's move to mobilize the
police force to deliver the Cabinet's documents seemed to have
violated the police service law and the administrative procedural
law.</P>
      <P>"We hope that the Control Yuan will check whether the Cabinet
should be held responsible for any irregularities or malfeasance,"
the lawmakers said in their petition letter.</P>
      <P>Control Yuan member Ku Teng-mei met with the four opposition
lawmakers and accepted their petition letter on behalf of the
watchdog body.</P>
      <P>"We'll ask the Cabinet to explain in detail the whole thing and
will decide on possible subsequent actions after receiving a Cabinet
reply," Ku said.</P>
      <P>In response to opposition criticism about the Cabinet's move,
National Police Administration (NPA) Director-General Wang Chin-wang
said he saw nothing wrong in the Cabinet asking police authorities to
assist in delivering documents of "great urgency" to local government
chiefs and lawmakers during the Chinese New Year holiday when postal
offices and private courier services were not available.</P>
      <P>Noting that the NPA is part of the government's administrative
system, Wang said, local police bureaus certainly can help deliver
the Cabinet's important documents under such "special circumstances."</P>
      <P>Moreover, Wang stressed that police officers, while delivering
the documents, didn't lobby any city mayor, county magistrates or
lawmakers to support or oppose the new tax revenues allocation law.</P>
      <P>Wang further said the document delivery was just an isolated case
and should not be "politicized."</P>
      <P>Commenting on a reported claim by Taoyuan County Magistrate Chu
Li-lun, a KMT stalwart, that the Cabinet had threatened to transfer
the county's police chief, Hou Yo-yi, to other post if the county
fails to support the Cabinet's move to overturn the new funding
allocation law, Wang said he has no knowledge about the source of the
report.</P>
      <P>Wang said all of his superiors, including the premier, vice
premier, the Cabinet secretary-general and the minister of the
interior, have denied that they had made any contact with Chu during
the Lunar New Year holiday. "Nor did they make any kind of threat to
force the Cabinet to act in a certain way," Wang said, adding that
the NPA has so far not taken any action regarding a personnel
reshuffle.</P>

Monday that Taiwan's economic outlook has almost hit rock bottom and
that this year will see positive growth.</P>
      <P>Tsung also claimed that various economic projectors that estimate
Taiwan's economic growth rate at between 2.7 percent and 3 percent

    <HEADLINE>BUSH'S CHINA VISIT NOT EXPECTED TO HURT TAIWAN'S INTEREST: ROC MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  18  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien
said Monday he does not expect any surprise developments to come from
U.S. President George W. Bush's visit to mainland China later this
week.</P>
      <P>"The United States has more than once briefed us on the main
purposes of Bush's Asia tour before his departure and repeatedly
guaranteed that Taiwan's interests won't be sacrificed during Bush's
trip," Chien told a news conference.</P>
      <P>Bush arrived in Japan Sunday at the start of a three-nation Asia
tour that will also take him to South Korea and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Noting that this is Bush's first visit to the Asia-Pacific area
following his attendance at the annual informal leadership meeting of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum last October, Chien said
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) is keeping close tabs on the
current trip.</P>
      <P>According to Chien, the government has set up a special task
force to facilitate communications with the United States and analyze
relevant developments. "The task force is working around the clock to
monitor Bush's visit to Japan, south Korea and mainland China," he
added.</P>
      <P>The minister further said that since the communication channels
between Taiwan and the United States have been operating smoothly,
MOFA can fully grasp any possible developments. "We hope that people
will keep calm. They need not be nervous," he said.</P>
      <P>Chien said he appreciated statements made by Bush prior to his
departure that Taiwan is a friend of the United States and that the
Taiwan Strait issue should be resolved peacefully.</P>
      <P>Chien said the Republic of China government hopes that the United
States will continue to play the role of "promoter, stabilizer and
balancer" in cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>In his view, Chien went on, the main purpose of Bush's current
Asia visit is to promote world peace and security. "Bush hopes to
take advantage of his trip to forge a consensus with U.S. allies in
the Asia-Pacific area on his administration's fight against terrorism
and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>He said Bush is expected to discuss bilateral security
cooperation, Japan's economic reforms and financial aid to
Afghanistan in his talks with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro
Koizumi.</P>
      <P>During his trip to Seoul, Chien said, Bush is expected to
exchange views with South Korean leaders on arms procurement and
policies toward North Korea.</P>
      <P>"As for the topics to be touched upon in Bush's talks with
Beijing leaders, the agenda will include mainland China's
agricultural market opening, religious freedom and human rights
condition, missile shield and Taiwan Strait issues," Chien noted.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau will establish a set of
ecotourism standards this year to tap into Taiwan's abundance of
ecological resources and help promote the development of the island's
tourism industry, officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 16, the Executive Yuan passed a "2002 Ecotourism Working
Plan" proposed by the Tourism Development and Promotion Committee, as
well as the committee's suggestion that 2002 be designated "Taiwan
Ecotourism Year."</P>
      <P>The Tourism Bureau is currently soliciting logo designs for
"Taiwan Ecotourism Year," with applications accepted until Feb. 20
and final entry submissions accepted until Feb. 28. The creator of
the winning design will receive a prize of NT$30,000 (US$855).</P>
      <P>The government began formulating its ecotourism plan last August
to coordinate with the U.N. proclamation of 2002 as the International
Year of Ecotourism.</P>
      <P>The plan includes six strategies and more than 30 concrete
measures aimed at turning Taiwan into an internationally known
"island of tourism."</P>
      <P>According to the Tourism Bureau, the primary measures include the
drafting of a white paper on ecotourism, the setting of ecotourism
standards, the formulation of regulations governing the
administration of professional guides for natural and cultural
ecology, the provision of training in ecotourism, the promotion of
publicity activities and the selection of 40 ecotourism routes.</P>
      <P>The first ecotourism activity for this year is a
butterfly-watching tour of Butterfly Valley organized by the Maolin
National Scenic Area Administration in Kaohsiung County, southern
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Tourism officials said that the goals of the plan are to
integrate local residents and home-stay operators with the ecotourism
industry to create more job opportunities, protect the island's
ecological resources, avoid the adverse impact of tourism on the
environment and heighten appreciation of Taiwan's native resources,
culture and society.</P>
      <P>In December 1998, the U.N. General Assembly declared 2002 as the
International Year of Ecotourism to generate greater awareness among
public authorities, the private sector and consumers regarding
ecotourism's capacity to contribute to the conservation of the
natural and cultural heritage in natural and rural areas, and the
improvement of living standards in those areas.</P>
      <P>Another goal for the activities surrounding the U.N.
International Year of Ecotourism is to disseminate methods and
techniques for the planning, management, regulation and monitoring of
ecotourism to guarantee its long-term sustainability.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN POLICE TRACK DOWN OPERATORS OF MOVIE88.COM TO MALAYSIA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's Criminal Investigation Bureau has
tracked down the operators of Movie88.com -- an online movie provider
that offers live "streaming rentals" of copyrighted movies at US$1
each -- to a lawyer in Malaysia, local police officials said Monday.</P>
      <P>The officials said that Tan Soo Leong and an accomplice, Yap Hun
Leong, registered their Web domain with the name, address and
telephone number of Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom, "purposely trying to
let Taiwan shoulder the blame" for the site.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Investigation Bureau of the National Police
Administration had originally planned to arrest the suspects when
they returned to Taiwan to update computer equipment they left on the
island, but recent reports by Time magazine, CNET and other media on
Movie88.com blew the case open prematurely, the officials said.</P>
      <P>Local police contacted Interpol to assist their Malaysian
counterparts in the investigation and to help the Motion Picture
Association of America take legal action against Tan, the officials
added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the head of Taiwan's online criminal investigation
division, Lee Hsiang-chen, denied claims by S.E. Tan, an ethnic
Chinese man affiliated with Movie88.com and interviewed by Time
magazine, that Taiwan's Internet copyright laws cannot protect
foreign copyrighted works.</P>
      <P>Citing Article 92 of Taiwan's Copyright Law, Lee said that Tan's
remarks are a misinterpretation of the Taiwan law under which
Movie88.com's actions of profiting from copyrighted movies without
obtaining licenses are considered illegal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BATTLE LINES DRAWN AMONG PARTIES OVER REVENUE ALLOCATION DISPUTE (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 18 (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Battle lines were drawn Monday between the
ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and the two major
opposition parties over a simmering dispute about how to divide the
annual revenues among the central and local governments.</P>
      <P>The People First Party (PFP) -- the second-largest opposition
party, decided Monday to vote against an Executive Yuan request for a
reconsideration of the revised rules governing the allocation of
revenues.</P>
      <P>After four hours of discussions, PFP legislative whip Lee
Ching-an said the party decided to uphold the revision it helped
shepherd through the chamber during the last session of the previous
legislature in January.</P>
      <P>The decision was taken by a vote among the party lawmakers, Lee
said, adding that the party, which controls 45 seats in the
legislature, would vote in unison during a showdown on the issue the
following day.</P>
      <P>However, Lee added that the party authorities will not threaten
to punish party lawmakers who do not follow the party line, out of
"conviction that party members will abide by the PFP decision
voluntarily."</P>
      <P>The PFP's decision gave the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT),
which initiated the changes and vowed to stick to its guns in the
dispute, a much-needed shot in the arm. The two parties between them
control 112 seats, one short of the simple majority needed to
override the reconsideration request.</P>
      <P>The KMT threatened that day to discipline party lawmakers who
failed to heed the party's order to vote against the Executive Yuan's
request for reconsideration of the revised rules.</P>
      <P>KMT Chairman Lien Chan cut short a trip to Europe and rushed back
to Taipei that evening to make sure the party line is followed by all
of its lawmakers.</P>
      <P>Lien urged the Executive Yuan to avoid a showdown with the
opposition in the legislature at the very beginning of the new
session and withdraw its request before the legislature begins
debating the request Tuesday.

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Otherwise, Lien said, his party will be "forced" to fight against
the request tooth and nail.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure its 67 lawmakers toe the party line, Tzeng
Yung-chuan, acting director of the KMT's policy coordination
committee, said any KMT lawmaker deviating from the party line or
absent, or abstain from Tuesday's legislative vote will be punished.</P>
      <P>The minor opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), declared
meanwhile that it will join the ruling DPP in supporting the
Executive Yuan's request.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang Chu-wen said the revision is ill-thought out
and will widen the gap between the country's rich and poor counties.</P>
      <P>However, Huang urged the Executive Yuan to come up with a
comprehensive plan within two months to revamp the reinstated rules,
which he said are flawed.</P>
      <P>If the Executive Yuan fails to meet the TSU's demand, Huang said,
his party will reconsider its pro-DPP stance in the future.</P>
      <P>The TSU, which has 13 seats in the legislature, will boost the
ruling party's camp to 100 seats, which is only 13 seats short of the
majority needed to push through the reconsideration.</P>
      <P>Both the DPP and Premier Yu Shyi-kun have pulled out all the
stops in their efforts to push through the reconsideration request,
which will annul the revisions passed by the previous legislature.</P>
      <P>The DPP was desperately lobbying KMT lawmakers Monday to vote
across party lines and was seeking the support of 12 independent
lawmakers who might help the party defeat the KMT and the PFP.</P>
      <P>However, independent lawmaker Kao Meng-ting said these political
mavericks are torn over the issue because of the different interests
of their various constituencies and therefore cannot form a united
front.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun went out of his way to canvass support for
the reconsideration, both in and out of the legislature.</P>
      <P>In a news conference Monday evening, the premier said the revised
rules, which oblige the central government to give a bigger share of
revenues to local governments, will disrupt the agenda of his
administration and will not necessarily improve local governments'
coffers.</P>
      <P>Noting that the original rules are not perfect, the premier
argued that the revised rules are much worse and far more
impractical, and he promised to revamp the original rules thoroughly
should the reconsideration request be approved.</P>

      <P>The government will subsidize local and

for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD) Monday.</P>
      <P>To encourage local and foreign enterprises to set up R&amp;D centers

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19   (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With Taiwan experiencing a sluggish
economy, the number of newly registered factories for 2001 totaled
only 3,793, marking a 20-year low, a local daily on Tuesday reported
statistics released by the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) as
indicating.</P>
      <P>The United Daily News reported that the low number of newly
registered factories coupled with the fact that 5,187 factories
closed down last year meant the number of factories in Taiwan dropped
to its lowest level since 1996.</P>
      <P>IDB officials said that the industrial production index declined
by more than 8.2 percent last year, while interest in domestic
investment was also low. Against this background, the number of newly
registered factories for last year was down 33 percent over that of
the previous year.</P>
      <P>The officials also said that with the sharp decline in export
orders and the large exodus of domestic manufacturers, 5,187
factories closed up shop in Taiwan in 2001, representing a rise of
3.84 percent in the figure over the previous year and the highest
number in three years.</P>
      <P>IDB statistics showed that last year represented only the third
time that the number of factory closures outnumbered the number of
newly registered factories -- the other two years being 1996 and 1998
-- with the figure of 1,394 more closures than newly registered
factories marking a new record.</P>
      <P>Looking ahead, IDB officials predicted that with the lack of
interest among domestic manufacturers in making new investments, the
amount of private investment in Taiwan for 2002 could decline by 37
percent over the figure for last year, while the number of newly
registered factories could hit a new low.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PREMIER REITERATES NEED TO RECONSIDER BUDGET LAW AMENDMENTS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun reiterated Tuesday that
he had "no choice" but to request a legislative reconsideration of
amendments to the nation's budget allocation law that were ratified
last month.</P>
      <P>Only hours before the Legislative Yuan was scheduled to vote on
whether to uphold or reconsider the amendments to the Law Governing
the Allocation of Government Revenue and Expenditures, Yu urged
lawmakers to debate the issue "rationally and professionally."</P>
      <P>Reconsideration would mean nullifying the amendments, which were
railroaded through on Jan. 17 during the last session of the previous
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet filed a request with the president on Feb. 6 for a
reconsideration by the current Legislature of the amendments, which
were set to become law Feb. 9, and Yu pledged that the Cabinet will
come up with a more reasonable budget allocation plan within three
months.</P>
      <P>Yu said that if he had not requested reconsideration, the Cabinet
would have been compelled to carry out the changes outlined in the
amendments, which he said would necessitate the 2002 fiscal budget
already being carried out to undergo revisions, as well as disrupt
the central government's monitoring of local financial spending and
actually widen the gap between urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>The amendments would allow local governments to keep a bigger
share of tax revenues, but Yu said that such a move would make it
necessary for the central government to raise additional funds and to
reallocate money originally intended for other programs.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, who helped author the
amendments, again urged lawmakers to vote against reconsideration in
order to help local governments gain greater budgetary autonomy. He
said that many local governments have trouble paying salaries and
that they urgently need the central government to provide resources
to help local construction.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jyn-ping said that if the budget
allocation law has to be amended again, such amendments should be
completed before the 2003 central government fiscal budget is drafted
in May.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FISHERY EXECUTIVES TO MEET WEDNESDAY TO DISCUSS MAINLAND LABOR BAN</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taiwan Provincial Fishery
Association will host a meeting of chief executives of city and
county fishery groups Wednesday to hammer out a strategy to cope with
a mainland Chinese ban on exports of fishery workers to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Tungkang Fishery Association in the southern county of
Pingtung confirmed Tuesday that mainland China has indeed decided to
ban its fishery workers from working aboard Taiwanese fishing boats
after the Chinese New Year holiday.</P>
      <P>"The ban will pose great troubles to our offshore fishing
industry as many local ship owners rely heavily on mainland workers
to operate their fishing vessels," said Chen Kun-yu,
secretary-general of the Tungkang Fishery Association.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, Tungkang and the Suao Fishery Association in
the northeastern county of Ilan are the two local fishing groups
whose members are most reliant on mainland Chinese fishery laborers.</P>
      <P>At present, Chen said, some 1,130 mainland fishermen are staying
aboard special "floating hotels" off the Tungkang fishing port.</P>
      <P>"As most of them still have valid working permits, we'll try to
persuade them to stay there for the time being," he said, adding that
"we are afraid that they won't be able come to Taiwan again once they
return to the mainland."</P>
      <P>Most local ship owners prefer to hire mainland Chinese fishery
workers as they speak the same language and share a common cultural
background, Chen said.</P>
      <P>"Although there are some Indonesian, Philippine, Thai and
Vietnamese fishery workers in the Tungkang area, they can't compete
with their counterparts from mainland China due to the language
barrier and different living habits," Chen explained.</P>
      <P>There have been reports about the mainland Chinese decision to
ban its people from working aboard Taiwanese fishing boats since the
beginning of this year.</P>
      <P>With the assistance of mainland Chinese manpower agencies, Chen
said, the Tungkang association has come to know for certain that the
mainland fishery labor export ban is for real.</P>
      <P>Previous press reports said the temporary export ban was mainly
aimed at forcing Taiwanese ship owners to improve working terms and
living conditions for mainland fishery workers.</P>
      <P>Chen said the Fishery Administration under Taiwan's Cabinet-level
Council of Agriculture (COA) has offered financial subsidies to major
regional fishery associations to build new placement centers for
mainland Chinese and foreign fishery workers.</P>
      <P>For instance, Chen said, his association will hold an open tender
in the near future to select a qualified contractor to build a new
placement center near Tungkang fishing port with a view to offering a
safe and comfortable living environment for mainland and foreign
fishery workers. "The new center is expected to be completed by the
end of this year," he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the COA's Fishery Administration has asked various
city and county governments and fishery associations to assist local
fishing ship owners in employing foreign workers to make up for labor
shortages caused by the latest mainland export ban.</P>
      <P>As most local ship owners have years of experience in cooperating
with mainland fishery workers, they still hope that relevant
government agencies can continue consultations with mainland
authorities on gaining a lifting of the labor export ban or achieving
mutually acceptable alternative measures.</P>
      <P>Fishery sources said about 1,000 fishing boats at major Taiwan
fishing ports have been affected by the mainland labor export ban,
with the northern port of Keelung and the northeastern port of
Nanfangao being hardest hit.</P>
      <P>The sources said about 200 fishing boats have been "stranded" at
Keelung due to a lack of fishery workers. "We need about 800 mainland
fishery workers, but many of them returned to the mainland before the
Chinese New Year holiday," said an executive with the Keelung Fishery
Association.</P>
      <P>Many Nanfangao-based fishing ships are facing similar problems. A
"floating hotel" operator said he managed to persuade 200-plus
mainland fishery workers not to return to the mainland for family
reunions before the Chinese New Year holiday. However, the Nanfangao
area needs more than 2,000 fishery workers.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO FOCUS ON FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS AFTER WTO ENTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>With Taiwan's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) this year, the focus of the island's foreign trade
work will be the signing of bilateral free trade agreements with the
United States, Japan, Singapore and New Zealand, officials said.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that China and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations agreed in November that they would promote a
regional free trade zone and that Taiwan could be marginalized if it
is left out of the free trade agreement.</P>
      <P>Taiwan relies heavily on foreign trade and it is imperative that
Taiwan sign free trade agreements with other nations, the officials
said.</P>
      <P>It is known that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Mainland
Affairs Council (MAC) and the Council of Agriculture (COA) are now
assessing the potential impact of such agreements.</P>
      <P>The COA is worried that the signing of bilateral agreements with
the United States and New Zealand will probably send a second shock
wave through the agricultural sector on the heels of WTO entry.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Economic Affairs said that Taiwan's electronics
and information products mostly go to the United States and that if
free trade agreements are signed, then most exports will benefit from
the removal of tariffs.</P>
      <P>The MAC is concerned about the impact on cross-strait relations
by the formation of a free trade zone between mainland China and
Southeast Asian and Northeast Asian nations. It said that though
Taiwan's promotion of bilateral free trade agreements with nations in
the region will have an impact on agricultural products, overall, the
impact will be more positive than negative.</P>
      <P>P. K. Chiang, vice president of the Legislative Yuan, will attend
a meeting Thursday organized by a private group to discuss the
economic prospects of Japan and Taiwan this year. He is expected to
advocate that the two countries sign a free trade agreement.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CARRIERS SUSPEND MEAL SERVICES ON DOMESTIC ROUTES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Passengers who complain about lousy food on
airplanes now have nothing to grouse about after Taiwan carriers
dropped all in-flight meal services on domestic routes as the
airlines find ways to cut costs amid a nationwide recession.</P>
      <P>According to industry sources, domestic carriers such as Far East
Air Transport Corp. (FAT), Mandarin Airlines, UNI Airlines and
TransAsia Airways have all recently canceled their in-flight meal
services to write off some of their operational losses.</P>
      <P>According to the airlines' estimates, the suspension of the meal
service will save them at least NT$6 million per month, based on a
daily transport load of 10,000 people and an average cost of NT$20
for each meal.</P>
      <P>Many aviation companies also have begun implementing
early-retirement programs with special incentives in line with their
cost-cutting efforts. More than 100 workers applied to retire last
year under a FAT early-retirement plan, marking the largest
streamlining ever by a domestic carrier.</P>
      <P>Although other aviation companies did not implement
early-retirement plans, they saw an average 10 percent reduction in
workforce over the past year. This was achieved by not filling vacant
jobs.</P>
      <P>With the meal services -- once a major attraction for domestic
air passengers -- passing into history, it will be difficult in the
future for passengers to enjoy the advantages brought about by robust
competition, the sources said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM RATE TO BE RAISED</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Bureau of National Health Insurance
(BNHI) plans to raise the premium rate from the current 4.25 percent
to 4.91 percent due to mounting expenditures and heavy deficits,
Chang Hong-jen, CEO and president of the bureau, said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the national health insurance premium rate has
been kept at 4.25 percent since its inception in 1995. But the
demographics of the island have changed, he said, as the proportion
of elderly has increased. Add to this rising medical costs with the
application of hi-tech equipment and the bureau felt that the time
had come to adjust its rate, Chang said. The bureau has been in debt
since 1998.</P>
      <P>Statistics released by the BNHI show that as of the end of 2000,
the number of insured individuals exceeded 21.4 million, with a
coverage rate of 96 percent. Nearly 91 percent of the more than
17,000 medical institutions are participating members of the national
health insurance.</P>
      <P>Over the past seven years, the bureau's revenues from premium
payments grew by an average 4.26 percent annually, while the
expenditures increased by a yearly average of 6.26 percent.</P>
      <P>According to Chang, the accumulated deficit of the past years has
exhausted the bureau's reserve fund and the amount of the reserve has
dropped below the minimum required level.</P>
      <P>Chang added that the bureau may have difficulties paying all the
participating institutions by March or April due to a serious
shortfall in revolving funds.</P>
      <P>In view of the imminent financial difficulties, the BNHI is
seeking to borrow from financial institutions. It is estimated that
the bureau will need at least NT$28 billion in loans to balance its
finances this year.</P>
      <P>Chang said the bureau has no choice but to raise premiums and
increase revenues.</P>
      <P>Under the National Health Insurance Act, the total amount of the
reserve fund must be equal to the total amount of benefits payments
over the most recent one to three months based on actuarial
principles. The ratio of premiums or reserves must be adjusted when
the total amount of the reserve exceeds three months of payments or
falls below one month.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the bureau has submitted a draft for the
adjustment of the ratio of premiums to the Department of Health under
the Executive Yuan. The new ratio will become effective with the
approvals of the Department of Health and the Executive Yuan.</P>
      <P>A major reason for the financial difficulties to the bureau has
been that all local governments have delayed their subsidiary
payments to the BNHI in recent years. Of the NT$33.35 billion owed by
local governments, the Kaohsiung City Government is NT$9.3 billion in
debt and the delayed payments by the Taipei City Government have
accumulated to NT$9.1 billion.</P>
      <P>With the implementation of the new ratio, the monthly premium
payment of a group insurance applicant will be 15.5 percent higher
than the current payment.</P>
      <P>From December 1998, the average premium has remained at NT$1,007.
The insured shares 60 percent of premium and the government shares 40
percent. The premium of the community population -- without salaried
income -- is NT$604, according to statistics compiled by the BNHI.</P>
      <P>With the new ratio, the monthly premium payment of a family of
four will be about NT$250 higher than the current level.</P>
      <P>Chang said that despite the fact that the national health
insurance program has been constantly operating in the red, a recent
survey has shown that public satisfaction with the compulsory social
insurance program was high at 71 percent.</P>

      <P>Hitachi will own 100 percent of Trecenti -- the world's first

    <HEADLINE>ROC EXPECTS TO TAKE DELIVERY OF KIDD-CLASS DESTROYERS BY 2005</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ROC Navy expects to take delivery of
the first two Kidd-class destroyers from the United States by the end
of 2005, military spokesman Maj. Gen. Huang Suey-sheng said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Huang told the media at a tea party hosted by the Ministry of
National Defense (MND) in celebration of the Chinese New Year that
the navy has completed a Kidd-class destroyers procurement plan.</P>
      <P>"We'll include the procurement plan in the MND's 2003 budget,"
Huang said, adding that if all goes smoothly, the first two
Kidd-class destroyers can be delivered to Taiwan by the end of 2005.</P>
      <P>The United States agreed to sell the Republic of China four of
its Kidd-class destroyers last April. With the assistance of the MND,
Huang said, the navy has finalized a relevant systematic analysis and
investment plan.</P>
      <P>"If the plan can receive full support of the Legislative Yuan,
we'll be able to acquire the highly advanced warships by 2005," Huang
said.</P>
      <P>The navy began to prepare for the purchase of Kidd-class
destroyers when current Chief of the General Staff Adm. Li Chieh was
still navy commander-in-chief. As the 172-meter, 8,910-ton warships
have basic battlefield management capabilities, Lee reportedly
intended to organize four naval battle groups, with the four
Kidd-class destroyers as their flagships.</P>
      <P>Lee once said the ROC Navy will be able to carry out deep-sea
patrol and defense missions after acquiring the four Kidd-class
destroyers from the United States.</P>
      <P>The Kidd-class destroyers, powered by four gas turbine engines,
are capable of cruising at a maximum of 33 knots. Military sources
said that although the destroyers are 20 years old, they still have
another 20 to 30 years of service left in them. Moreover, they carry
a price tag only about one-sixth that of a new vessel.</P>
      <P>The destroyers were originally built for use by Iran during the
reign of the Shah, but the U.S. Navy took control of the ships in
1981 and 1982 after Iran's revolutionary Islamic regime took power.</P>
      <P>On Tuesday, Huang also denied that Minister of National Defense
Tang Yao-ming and Chief of the General Staff Li Chieh have been
invited to attend a defense conference to be held March 10-12 in the
southeastern U.S. state of Florida.</P>
      <P>To date, Huang said, neither Tang nor Li has received an
invitation to attend the conference, to be organized by the
U.S.-Taiwan Business Council.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Huang said, the MND will be pleased to see any
meeting that would contribute to stability, security and peace in the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to foreign wire service reports, the upcoming
Taiwan-U.S. defense conference will be a large-scale event rarely
seen after the break in formal diplomatic ties between the two
countries in 1979. The reports said many senior U.S. and Taiwan
defense officials have been invited to address the meeting. Several
U.S. defense contractors, including Boeing, Lockheed-Martin and
Raytheon reportedly will co-sponsor the conference.</P>

    <HEADLINE>EPA REITERATES BAN ON EXPORTS OF WASTE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Administration
(EPA) said Tuesday it has ordered all local environmental agencies to
reject any application for shipping domestic industrial waste or
household trash abroad for permanent disposal.</P>
      <P>The EPA was responding to an appeal by a local environmental
protection group urging the government to prevent a Taiwan company
from dumping factory waste in the South Pacific island nation of the
Solomon Islands.</P>
      <P>Lu Hung-kuang, director of the EPA's Solid Waste Control Bureau,
said the EPA has been keeping close tabs on the reported deal since
it received relevant information last November.</P>
      <P>"The deal apparently has violated international and domestic
regulations," Lu said. "In addition to reminding the local company
not to break the domestic law, we have alerted customs authorities
and environmental police forces to intensify monitoring of relevant
developments."</P>
      <P>Lu said the company in southern Taiwan does not have a license to
handle waste disposal services and has never filed for any
application to export garbage.</P>
      <P>"We already asked customs authorities in January to carefully
inspect Solomon Islands-bound goods exported by the company in
question," Lu explained.</P>
      <P>Quoting the multilateral Basal Convention on cross-border
shipment of waste, Lu said that without the approval of the recipient
country's environmental protection agency, no waste can be exported
to that country.</P>
      <P>According to information received by the ROC Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, Lu said, the Solomon Islands authorities have revoked their
import permit for the Taiwan garbage deal.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOREIGN MINISTER HAILS BUSH'S REAFFIRMATION OF COMMITMENT TO ROC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  19  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>ROC Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene
Chien issued a public statement Tuesday hailing U.S. President
George W. Bush's reaffirmation of security commitments to the people
of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>In a speech to the Japanese Diet Tuesday morning, Bush stated
clearly and firmly that the United States will remember its
commitments to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"We recognize and welcome Bush's reaffirmation of U.S.
commitments to our country," Chien said. "The move betrays Bush's
support for Taiwan's democratization and peace in the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>As Japan is the first leg of Bush's current Asia tour, Chien
said, Bush's reaffirmation of commitments to Taiwan is of great
significance. "The statement highlights solid U.S. support for
democratic Taiwan and the importance the Bush administration has
attached to Taiwan Strait peace and security," he noted.</P>
      <P>Since the ROC and the United States share common values, concepts
and interests, Chien said he is convinced that relations between the
two countries will further strengthen based on mutual trust.</P>
      <P>"The recent strings of Bush statements indicate that the United
States regards Taiwan as its good friend, values Taiwan's democratic
achievements and is concerned about Taiwan Strait security," Chien
said, adding that the ROC government will continue doing its utmost
to upgrade bilateral relations.</P>
      <P>Bush ended its three-day visit to Japan and flew to Seoul
Tuesday afternoon to continue his Asia tour, which will also take
him to mainland China later this week.</P>
      <P>A local political analyst familiar with Taiwan-U.S.-mainalnd
China relations said Bush's reaffirmation of U.S. commitments to
Taiwan in his address to the Japanese Diet was partly aimed at
encouraging diplomatically conservative Japan not to take a hands-off
policy toward Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he said, Bush's statement was also designed to send
messages to Beijing leaders that the basic tone of U.S. China policy
will not change and that the Taiwan Strait issue will not be a main
focus of his mainland visit.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Mainland Affair Council Vice Chairman John C. C. Teng
said at a seminar on investment in mainland China that Bush's
upcoming visit to Beijing is not expected to result in any surprise
changes to the delicate Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations.</P>
      <P>Teng further said mainland China's imminent reshuffle of its
ruling hierarchy will not necessarily lead to changes to its policy
toward Taiwan. According to Teng, 14 mainland provinces have
completed personnel reshuffle.</P>
      <P>Commenting on mainland Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen's recent
remarks that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should establish a
mechanism for economic cooperation, Teng said he hopes mainland
authorities can take concrete steps to materialize Qian's pragmatic
call.</P>
      <P>For its part, Teng said, the ROC government will continue
revising its regulations to pave the way for mainland capital to
enter Taiwan, Taiwan people to take jobs on the mainland and
expansion of direct cross-strait transshipment services.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>In an effort to protect Taiwan's wildlife
and preserve its ecosystems, the Taiwan Forest Bureau (TFB) under the
Council of Agriculture is planning to build a wildlife conservation
park in eastern Taitung County.</P>
      <P>The planned 69,000-hectare Kuanshan Wildlife Conservation Park,
which will include the 0.265-hectare Chiaming Lake at the height of
3,250 meters above sea level, will become a part of an "ecological
corridor" linking the Chilan Mountain Area in northern Taiwan and the
Tanda Mountain Area in central Taiwan via a "green corridor"
extending from north to south through the island's Central Range.</P>
      <P>The Chiaming Lake is Taiwan's sole meteoric lake, which is a
rarity anywhere in the world.</P>
      <P>The plan has won widespread support from the aboriginal tribes
living in the area, with Yenping Township Chief Hu Wu-jen of the
Bunun Tribe calling on his tribesmen to support the policy. The
Kuanshan Area is the traditional home of the Bunun Tribe, one of
Taiwan's major indigenous peoples.</P>
      <P>In line with the building of the wildlife conservation park, the
TFB's Taitung branch will also set up a databank on the area's
animals and plants to ensure the conservation of the area's

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top negotiator with mainland China
reiterated a call Tuesday for a resumption of official dialogue and
interaction across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Quoting a Chinese poem about the arrival of spring, Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), said the
springtime of cross-strait relations has yet to arrive. "We will meet
the spring only after we have weathered the severe winter," Koo said.</P>
      <P>In a "group greeting function" held at SEF headquarters Tuesday
following the Chinese New Year holiday, Koo was asked about the
prospects of a resumption of cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>He said official cross-strait relations seemed to have improved a
little over the past year, evident in Beijing's proposal to establish
an economic cooperation mechanism across the strait and his claim
that both sides have reached "verbal consensus" on various issues.</P>
      <P>Koo said he hopes that this consensus can be upgraded into action
in the new year, and that interaction between the SEF and its
Beijing-based counterpart -- the Association for Relations Across the
Taiwan Strait (ARATS) -- can be normalized.</P>
      <P>SEF-ARATS interaction is important "and inevitable," Koo said,

      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
urged the publishing industry Tuesday to help introduce Taiwan
culture to the international community.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the opening of the 10th Taipei International Book
Exhibition (TIBE), Chen said that the 21st century will be an era of
knowledge-based economy and added that future economic competition
will be based on knowledge.</P>
      <P>He went on to say that "the creation and use of knowledge will be
the key to the success or failure of competition between countries or
industries."</P>
      <P>Now that Taiwan has become a World Trade Organization member, the
president said, the government will make all-out efforts to help
industries transform so as to cope with the upcoming challenges`.</P>
      <P>Describing the publishing industry as the foundation of the
"knowledge industry," Chen encouraged it to introduce excellent
publications on Taiwan culture to foreigners through book fairs.</P>
      <P>TIBE 2002, being held at the Taipei World Trade Center, attracted
1,015 exhibitors from 47 countries.</P>
      <P>The first two days are open to representatives from the

open to the public from Feb. 21-24.</P>
      <P>Along with the book fair, special exhibitions featuring Russian
illustrations and French printing-engraving techniques, called
chalchography, from the Louvre gallery in Paris, are being held.</P>
      <P>Five topical exhibit areas are set aside for international
exhibitors, children's books, general books, comic books and an
e-books forum.</P>
      <P>The main theme pavilion of the exhibition this year features
books from Japan and many noted Japanese writers and cartoonists have

Chunghwa Telecom's server because the site was illegally offering
movies via "streaming rentals" at US$1 each.</P>

Investigation Bureau, movie88.com was originally registered in
Virginia but the operators of the Web domain -- with the name,

"purposely tried to let Taiwan shoulder the blame" for the site.</P>

said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Lee said the MOF will invite officials from local governments,

      <P>Lee made the announcement following the Legislative Yuan's vote
to overturn an earlier amendment -- authored by Taipei Mayor Ma

budget allocation law.</P>
      <P>The Legislative Yuan passed Ma's revision Jan. 18, but the
Cabinet filed a proposal Feb. 6 asking that the Legislature
reconsider the amendment.</P>
      <P>The KMT and the other main opposition party -- the People First
Party -- tried hard over the ensuing few weeks to gain support for a
rejection of the Executive Yuan's request for a cancellation of the
Ma-authored revision, which gives local governments a bigger share of
the government's total revenues.</P>
      <P>However, their efforts failed and Vice Finance Minister Wang

subsidies, which he said is improper in practical terms. Wang said
the general subsidies system is an inevitable measure that helps

    <TEXT>
      <P>Former president Lee Teng-hui called for
the regrouping of Taiwan's political parties Tuesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the commencement of a training camp for his young
followers, the former president said although there are 95 political
parties in Taiwan, only four of them are active ones, namely the
Democratic Progressive Party, Kuomintang, the People First Party and
the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU) of which he is the spiritual
leader.</P>
      <P>Lee said the four parties should reorganize into two groups ,
with one devoted to Taiwan and the other not so-devoted to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A division of political groups in this way will offer the public
an easy choice in elections, and political showdown which has dogged
the country ever since the DPP was swept to power last year will end
for good, Lee said.</P>
      <P>Declaring that Taiwan's economy has come to a critical point this
year, Lee called for the conclusion of free trade pact with the
United States which will offer Taiwan-produced goods a free access to
United States market with lower tariffs and no limitations of quota,
Lee said.</P>
      <P>The TSU will come up with a motion for such a trade pact in the
Legislative Yuan Thursday, Lee went on.</P>
      <P>Fielding questions from his audience, Lee dismiss a young man's
fears that mainland China could annex the island in the future. Lee
told him mainland China will be transformed peacefully by the force
unleashed by its won economic reform before it could use military
force against Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also urged the opposition parties to give President Chen
Shui-bian a free hand in leading the country, rather than blocking
him at every turn.</P>
      <P>The four-day camp, dubbed by Lee's followers as "Lee's School",
has brought together 66 college or university students around the

      <P>China Airlines and EVA Airways flights will
use Narita International Airport instead of Haneda Airport from April
18, when a second runway at Narita is inaugurated.</P>
      <P>To coincide with the move, CAL will increase the number of its
weekly flights between Taipei and Tokyo from the present 21 to 22,
while EVA's weekly flights on the same route will be boosted sharply
from two to 14.</P>
      <P>In addition, EVA and Japan's ANK will also jointly operate seven
flights per week on the profitable route.</P>
      <P>After the severance of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and
Japan in 1972, Tokyo refused to let CAL -- at the time the Republic
of China flag-carrier -- use the New Tokyo International Airport at
Narita, a move designed to ensure that aircraft from mainland China
and Taiwan did not use the same airport.</P>
      <P>After the inauguration of Narita International Airport, Haneda
airport became a domestic-only facility, with the exception of CAL
flights.</P>
      <P>However, CAL in fact profited greatly from the discriminatory
step because many passengers chose to use CAL and arrive and leave
Japan via Haneda rather than Narita -- for obvious reasons. It takes
only 30 minutes to reach Haneda from downtown Tokyo by car, while a
car ride from Tokyo to Narita in Chiba Prefecture takes 90 minutes.</P>

jointly pushed through the changes Jan. 18, managed to get only 109
votes to oppose the Executive Yuan's motion, four short of the simple
majority of 113 votes they needed in the 225-seat legislature.</P>
      <P>The two parties control 114 seats between them at the Legislative
Yuan, but two lawmakers from each party failed to show up for
Tuesday's vote, despite the party whips' repeated calls for their
members to rally behind the party's position.</P>
      <P>The opposition's defeat means the revision to the revenue
allocation rules lapses automatically.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun lauded the outcome of the vote as a
successful result of rational dialogue between the ruling and the
opposition parties. He called it a beneficial situation for the
Legislative Yuan, the Executive Yuan, the country and the people.</P>
      <P>He went to the legislature to thank Legislative Yuan President
Wang Jin-pyng after being informed of the results of the vote.</P>
      <P>For his part, Wang called on Yu to quell the controversy over how
to allocate revenue among central and local government by setting up
a fair mechanism.</P>
      <P>KMT legislative whip Lin Yi-shih said that his party regretted,
but would respect the outcome. He urged the Executive Yuan to
fulfill its promise to revamp the existing rules governing the
allocation of revenues within three months.</P>
      <P>Legislator Tzeng Yung-chuan, the acting director of the KMT's
central policy coordination committee, said the two KMT lawmakers
absent from the vote would be referred to the disciplinary committee
for possible punishment.</P>
      <P>Taipei City Mayor Ma Ying-jeou, the KMT stalwart who inspired his
party to change the revenue allocation rules in the first place, said
he was disappointed with the results but did not regret his failed
efforts.</P>
      <P>Claiming the campaign to address the "flawed" revenue allocation
rules is a continuing war, Ma said Tuesday's setback was only a lost
battle and not the end of the war. It was rather the beginning of
a struggle to break the central government's stranglehold on power
and funds.</P>
      <P>The mayor, who had been calling lawmakers of various parties on
the phone until the last minute to seek their support for the
KMT-initiated changes, said his struggle was not completely in vain,
pointing to the fact that the drawbacks to the existing rules have
been widely discussed in the leadup to Tuesday's vote.</P>
      <P>PFP legislative whip Lee Ching-an blamed the Executive Yuan for
what she called "interference with the legislature's vote by putting
undue pressure on the lawmakers." She did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>As to the two PFP lawmakers who did not show up Tuesday, Lee said
they were absent for "personal reasons" and would be sent to the
disciplinary committee for punishment to the full extent of the party
rules.</P>
      <P>The ruling DPP was pleased with the vote result, but refrained
from being too jubilant over its victory.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Ker Chien-ming said there is "no winner or
loser" in the vote and that his party would prefer dialogue over
showdown votes with the opposition in future disputes.</P>
      <P>Lo Chih-ming, a lawmaker of the Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), a
minor opposition party and a DPP ally in the legislature, said
Tuesday's results indicate that public opinion, not party will,
prevailed in the vote.</P>
      <P>He warned the DPP against complacency over the results, pointing
out that four more lawmakers voted against the reconsideration motion
than those who approved it.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KAOHSIUNG HARBOR AIMING TO PROMOTE CROSS-STRAIT SEA-AIR TRANSPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Kaohsiung,  southern  Taiwan,  Feb. 19 (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Harbor
Bureau (KHB) plans to use the harbor's status as the only
transshipment channel for goods arriving from mainland China to push
for joint cross-strait sea-sea and sea-air transportation, a KHB
source said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>KHB Director Huang Ching-tern said it is most important for
shipping agents to transport goods to consumer markets quickly and
added that Kaohsiung can develop joint sea-sea and sea-air transport
to achieve this goal.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung is Taiwan's only harbor allowed to engage in
cross-strait offshore fixed-site transshipping services. The mainland
ports of Xiamen and Fuzhou perform the same function on the other
side of the strait.</P>
      <P>Despite the sluggishness of the global shipping market, Kaohsiung
harbor performed well in January, with 2,984 ships sailing in and out
of Kaohsiung harbor, an increase of 4.56 percent from the same month
of the previous year, according to KHB statistics.</P>
      <P>The gross tonnage amounted to 52.3 million tonnes, a year-on-year
growth of 3.92 percent, the statistics show.</P>
      <P>A total of 29.96 million tons of bulk cargo was handled at
Kaohsiung harbor in January, up 5.89 percent from the year-earlier
level and a total of 609,014 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) were
handled, up 5.91 percent from last January, according to the KHB
figures.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung harbor handled 7.5 million TEUs during the whole of
last year and the KHB has set this year's goal at 8 million TEUs.</P>

    <HEADLINE>WORKSHOP ON CROSS-STRAIT TRADE OPENS IN TAIPEI</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The First Workshop on Trade Across the
Taiwan Strait kicked off Tuesday in Taipei for three days of
brainstorming and speeches on issues pertaining to the new trade
climate and challenges that Taiwan and mainland China are facing.</P>
      <P>In his address to the opening session, Vincent Siew, former
premier of the Republic of China and current chairman of the Cross
Strait Common Market Foundation, which is sponsoring the workshop,
said Taiwan is now facing new challenges of various types amid the
changing political and economic situations in the world.</P>
      <P>Mainland China is now Taiwan's biggest rival as well as its
greatest challenge in terms of trade and business, and Taiwan can
neither shun nor pretend not to see it, Siew said.</P>
      <P>With the accession of both Taiwan and mainland China to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) at the beginning of this year, further
integration of the trade regimes across the Taiwan Strait has become
an irreversible trend, he added.</P>
      <P>Noting that there are still numerous obstacles and barriers in
the increasingly hustle-and-bustle cross-strait trade, Siew said the
Cross Strait Common Market Foundation is committed to helping bolster
the constructive development of cross-strait trade and business based
on the principles of reciprocity, exchange, peace and co-prosperity.</P>
      <P>Siew noted that both sides should make the most of the
opportunities that WTO membership brings to prosper themselves and at
the same time normalize trade and business relations across the
strait.</P>
      <P>He added that Taiwan and mainland can then talk about the
formation of a free trade agreement which would eventually pave the
way for the two sides to establish a cross-strait common market.</P>
      <P>Scheduled speakers at the three-day workshop include Vice
Economic Minister Chen Ruey-long; Yen Wan-chin, deputy
secretary-general of the quasi-official intermediary Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF); Jan Jyh-horng, director of the Research and
Planning Department under the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), who also doubles as a SEF deputy secretary-general; and Fu
Don-cheng, director of the MAC's Department of Economic Affairs.</P>
      <P>Others scheduled to speak at the workshop include Chang Wu-yueh,
dean of Tamkang University's Institute of Mainland China Studies;
Tseng Fan-cheng, deputy CEO of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co., which is planning to relocate part of its manufacturing
operations to mainland China; and Yeh Kuo-yi, chairman of the
Inventec Group, which already operates a computer processing business
on the mainland.</P>
      <P>Participants to the workshop are mainly graduate school students
and doctorate candidates in Taiwan's major colleges and universities
who are currently studying cross-strait trade and business relations
and related subjects.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN CONSUMER CONFIDENCE UP CONSIDERABLY: MASTERINDEX SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan enjoyed a considerable increase in
consumer confidence between mid 2001 and the end of the year, with
the index for the island of a survey by MasterCard International
Corp. gauging such sentiment surging from 23.8 to 46.2 between the
two periods.</P>
      <P>The MasterIndex survey, conducted twice a year, measures consumer
confidence in 13 markets within the Asia-Pacific region. The latest
survey was completed in December 2001, with a total of 5,457
respondents from across the region providing their input, a company
spokesman said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>In the survey, five variables were analyzed, including the
employment and economic situations, regular income, the stock market,
and quality of life.</P>
      <P>While consumers in Taiwan gave higher scores for all five
variables in the December survey, improved perceptions were most
notable for the economic situation, with the score surging to 52.2
from 24 in the previous survey, and the stock market, with the score
rising from 32.2 to 59.1.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the improved index was a sign of economic
recovery, which he said would definitely help boost consumers'
purchasing power.</P>
      <P>Among the 13 markets, mainland China was the best performer in
the latest MasterIndex survey, with mainland respondents providing
the highest ever index scores for quality of life at 92.1, for
regular income at 90.9, for the economy at 90.6, and for the
employment situation at 76.5.</P>
      <P>South Korea had the second highest index score of 68.1, a
remarkable recovery from the index score of 25.9 in the same survey a
year ago and from 54.4 in the survey conducted in mid 2001.</P>
      <P>The survey report indicated that consumer confidence in Hong Kong
at the end of last year was at an all-time low, dropping to 12.5.
While Hong Kong consumers indicated the most anxiety about their
future quality of life, the economy and employment prospects, the
scores for all five variables dropped from those recorded in previous
surveys.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the responses are based on consumers' thoughts
on the six months ahead, namely for the December 2001 to May 2002
period in the latest survey. The survey is said to be accurate within
plus or minus four percentage points nine times out of ten.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SENIOR COUPLE GLAD TO BECOME CARETAKERS OF LONELY RAILWAY STATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taichung  City,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A writer in his 60s living in
Taichung was thrilled recently that he and his wife were awarded the
opportunity to become the caretakers of a small railway station in
the northern Hakka county of Hsinchu.</P>
      <P>Hohsing Railway Station, located on a bypass of the hilly Neiwan
Route in Hsinchu County, is not an ordinary railway station, at least
in the eyes of Tseng Chuen-chao and his wife, Peng Chih-hui, because
the station was where they first met.</P>
      <P>Tseng, who now runs and owns a chain of mental arithmetic schools
in Taichung City, central Taiwan, wrote a novel titled "Chasing" to
tell the love story of him and his wife, with the railway station of
Hohsing, his hometown, as the "main character."</P>
      <P>In the novel, Tseng recounted how he once as an 18-year-old high
school student chased the passing train, which came only once every
hour, in order not to miss his final exams on a morning in 1954.</P>
      <P>He ran after the train at a superhuman speed and was finally able
to catch it at the next stop, making it to school on time to take his
exams. He also met on the train a girl whom was also from Hohsing and
took the same train to school every morning but whom he had never
talked to until that "rushed" morning.</P>
      <P>From that day, Tseng and Peng became more and more acquainted,
taking the same train to Hsinchu City for school everyday. They have
now been married for 36 years and both love the railway and the
trains.</P>
      <P>The couple are thrilled because they are now allowed to look
after Hohsing Railway Station -- "their railway station" -- which is
currently half-deserted with no personnel from the Taiwan Railway
Administration being stationed there.</P>
      <P>Although trains still pass through and stop at Hohsing Station
everyday on a regular basis, the station presently does not maintain
any ticketing or other services.</P>
      <P>After a contract signing scheduled for Feb. 23, Tseng and Peng
will be the only persons who will look after Hohsing Station -- a
wooden structure built during the period of Japanese occupation with
red tile roof and green walls and surrounded by a white wooden picket
fence.</P>
      <P>Hohsing Station has the only "reversible rails" in Taiwan in its
vicinity which are historically invaluable, as well as a waiting room
that is similar to that of an old-style Japanese railway station.
There are also several cherry trees in the station's backyard which
make the station look much more beautiful while sakura bloom during
spring time.</P>
      <P>Tseng said he and his wife would invite volunteers -- "who must
be lovers of the railway and trains" -- to help keep and maintain the
Hohsing Railway Station in order to give the old station a new lease
on life.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VICE PREMIER TO HEAD TASK FORCE TO DRAFT NEW BUDGET ALLOCATION LAW</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun directed Vice Premier
Lin Hsin-yi Wednesday to head a special task force to draft a new
amendment bill to the Law Governing Government Revenues and
Expenditures within three months.</P>
      <P>Yu issued the directive at a weekly Cabinet meeting in which
Minister of Finance Lee Yung-shan offered a detailed report on the
Cabinet's success in overturning opposition-authored amendments to
the budget allocation law and possible follow-up developments.</P>
      <P>The premier said the Cabinet is now obliged to come up with a new
version of amendments to the allocation law, along with relevant
supporting measures, for public debate and deliberation.</P>
      <P>In drawing up new amendment proposals, Yu said, several key
factors should be taken into account, such as government
restructuring, downsizing of the central government and upgrading of
national competitiveness.</P>
      <P>"We should refer to general practices adopted by other countries
in determining the tax revenues allocation ratios between central and
local governments," Yu said, adding that the Cabinet is determined to
follow the prevailing trend of delegating more power, as well as more
financial and manpower resources, to local governments.</P>
      <P>Moreover, he went on, the new amendments must meet the principle
of fairness and set a standard formula for tax revenues. "The new
budget allocation law should offer grassroots governments enough
financial clout to administer local affairs effectively," he said.</P>
      <P>In addition to appointing Lin as convener of the special task
force, Yu also assigned Lee as the team's executive secretary.</P>
      <P>Members of the team will include Minister of the Interior Yu
Cheng-hsien, Director-General Lin Chuan of the Directorate General of
Budget, Accounting and Statistics, Minister-without-Portfolio Hsu
Chih-hsiung, Central Personnel Administration Chairman Lee Yi-yang
and Chairman Lin Chia-cheng of the Research, Development and
Evaluation Commission.</P>
      <P>Yu said he hopes that the task force can outline a working
schedule within one month and finalize a draft revision bill for
public discussion by mid-May.</P>
      <P>In the previous day's showdown with the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP), an opposition alliance of the Kuomintang and
the People First Party failed to get enough votes to veto the
Cabinet's motion to scrap the recently passed changes to the budget
allocation law. The opposition-proposed changes would have given an
additional NT$150 billion annually to local governments from central
government coffers.</P>
      <P>While the DPP and its ally in the Legislative Yuan -- the Taiwan
Solidarity Union -- were victorious in the vote, the outcome does not
necessarily mean an end to the funding row that has long pitted the
central government against local governments and urban areas against
rural areas.</P>
      <P>Besides drafting a new package of amendments to the budget
allocation law, Lee said the Finance Ministry will also push for new
legislation to allow local governments to levy various local taxes
and service charges on residents to increase their financial
autonomy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VETERAN WRITER PUBLISHES LATEST BOOK AT AGE OF 92</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.   20  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Veteran writer and columnist Hsia
Cheng-ying, better known by his pen name of Ho Fan, has just seen his
latest book -- Another Collection of the Prose of Ho Fan -- roll off
the press. He is 92 years old.</P>
      <P>The book is on display at the ongoing Taipei International Book
Exhibition (TIBE) which opened Tuesday at the Taipei World Trade
Center.</P>
      <P>Ho, who is lauded in Taiwan's literary circles as "a Chinese pen
which never stops" for having written continuously for nearly 70
years, appeared at a book-signing and speech event devoted to him and
his book at TIBE Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Ho began as a professional writer at the age of 24 in 1934 in
Beijing, becoming a regular columnist for the Beijing Daily News in
1945.</P>
      <P>He continued his prose and column writing with the United Daily
News after moving to Taiwan in the early 50s with his wife, Lin
Hai-yin -- also a renowned writer -- who died in her 80s two months
ago.</P>
      <P>During his 31-year career as a columnist, Ho has written 5,500
columns for a total of more than 5 million words. Besides writing
columns, prose and short stories, he also translates.</P>
      <P>During Wednesday's speech, which was attended by Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou and many of his literati friends, Ho said the publication
of his latest book is proof that an author's writing career can be
"as long as his life."</P>
      <P>Ma said he has been a devoted reader of Ho since his younger
years and made special reference to a column written in 1973 in which
Ho said that "sports and exercise are most nutritious," describing it
as a "new and inspiring idea" even decades later.</P>
      <P>China Times President Huang Chao-sung said Ho, to him, is best
remembered for his crisp translations of the columns written by Art
Buchwald, the Pulitzer Prize-winning U.S. syndicated columnist. Ho's
writing style has been influenced by Buchwald's brand of political
satire, Huang noted.</P>
      <P>Other literary friends of Ho who were also present at the
function included Mandarin Daily News Chairman Lin Liang and National
Taiwan University English Professor Chi Pang-yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>2ND MAINLAND CHINESE TOUR GROUP TO ARRIVE NEXT WEEK FROM U.S.</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Feb.  19 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A tour group composed of mainland
Chinese nationals with permanent residency in the United States is
scheduled to leave here Feb. 28 for a sightseeing trip to Taiwan,
travel sources said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>It will be the second such group to visit Taiwan since the
Republic of China government opened its doors to overseas mainland
Chinese citizens traveling in groups at the beginning of this year.
The first group, composed of elderly mainland Chinese residents of
Japan, visited Taiwan Feb. 5-9.</P>
      <P>The San Francisco-based Phoenix Travel Agency has cooperated with
Taipei's Richmond Travel Agency in organizing a six-day, five-night
tour package for the 12-member group.</P>
      <P>A Phoenix spokesman said members of the group include people
working in the high-tech industries and banks as well as social group
volunteers and housewives. "All of them have permanent residency in
the United States and have passed qualification screening by Taiwan's
representative office here," he said. "And our Taipei partner has
asked the Taipei Association of Travel Agents to apply for travel
permits for our customers with the Taiwan authorities."</P>
      <P>In addition to touring Taiwan's major tourist attractions and
historic relics, the spokesman said, the mainland visitors also hope
to see for themselves Taiwan's general lifestyle, social customs and
cultural development.</P>
      <P>"We have arranged for them to visit noted sightseeing spots in
northern and central Taiwan, including the National Palace Museum in
suburban Taipei and scenic Sun Moon Lake in Nantou County," he added.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to boost exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait, Taiwan began Jan. 1 to allow mainland citizens with permanent
foreign residency or mainland students studying abroad to make
pleasure trips to the island, as long as they travel in a group at
all times.</P>

      <P>The Export Processing Zone (EPZ)
Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is planning to
export Taiwan's EPZ know-how and related facilities in an attempt to
create a "second spring" for the sector that used to be the island's
golden goose.</P>
      <P>The EPZ Administration co-founded the Taiwan International
Industrial Cooperation and Development Association with a number of
private firms for the purpose of exporting the EPZs' extensive
experience in industrial processing to developing countries.</P>
      <P>Addressing a ceremony to mark the establishment of the
association, EPZ Administrator Chou Yen said the EPZs have earned
immeasurable foreign exchange for Taiwan over the past 35 years,
during which business turnover in the island's three major EPZs has
reached NT$6.4 trillion (US$182.8 billion).</P>
      <P>With the business climate changing domestically and globally, the
EPZs are past their prime and their operations are facing new
bottlenecks, Chou said, adding that by reinvigorating their
operations, the EPZs can seek to export their manufacturing know-how
and sell related production facilities to nations in Southeast Asia
and Central and South America, where small- and medium-sized
enterprises are mushrooming.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan International Industrial Cooperation and Development
Association, with more than 100 enterpreneurs as its members, will
sponsor regular seminars and meetings on international industrial
cooperation to help Taiwan manufacturers find foreign buyers for
their technologies, expertise and facilities.</P>

      <P>The semi-official China External Trade

trade-promotion groups to take part in overseas exhibitions and fairs
this year to help explore foreign markets for Taiwan goods.</P>
      <P>CETRA officials said Wednesday that the council will also
dispatch five large delegations to countries in Latin America, the
Middle East, East Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States and
Japan in the first half of this year to promote Taiwan-made products.
They estimated that all these activities may help chalk up orders
worth US$3.2 billion for Taiwan businesses.</P>
      <P>The Board of Foreign Trade (BOFT) reported a day earlier that
thanks to Taiwan's Jan. 1 entry into the World Trade Organization and
a global economic recovery, Taiwan exports are expected to expand by
5.38 percent in 2002.</P>
      <P>Although the island's January outbound shipments to the United
States, Japan, East Europe and the European Union all registered
drops of more than 10 percent from a month ago, the BOFT said exports
to Hong Kong posted growth of 39.5 percent last month.</P>
      <P>The BOFT said Hong Kong was Taiwan's largest overseas market for
the past consecutive three months due to its status as the major
transshipment hub for the booming indirect trade between Taiwan and
mainland China.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT AND PFP MAY PRESENT NEW VERSION OF REVISED FINANCE ALLOCATION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou said Wednesday
that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP)
will come out with a new version of the revised finance allocation
law, "likely" before the Executive Yuan submits its own version to
the legislature.</P>
      <P>Referring to Premier Yu Shyi-kun's promise that the Executive
Yuan will submit a draft of the revised tax revenues allocation law
to the legislature within three months, Ma, whose previous revisions
were kicked out a day earlier, claimed that the latest opposition
machination is being taken to prevent possible manipulation of the
administration. He did not elaborate.</P>
      <P>While the allocation of tax revenues between the central and
local governments has long been a controversial issue, the previous
legislature railroaded through a revised allocation bill promoted by
Ma during its last session in January.</P>
      <P>Upon assuming office in early February, Yu submitted a motion to
the Legislative Yuan requesting a reconsideration of the revision,
which was approved after a vote in which the opposition was unable to
get enough votes to gain the required absolute majority. With only
109 votes, the opposition camp was four votes short of the 113 it
needed.</P>
      <P>However, Ma said he might be willing to support a
Cabinet-initiated revision under certain conditions.</P>
      <P>First, he said, the central government should provide more
financial resources to the local governments than the allocations
defined in the revised allocation law approved last January.</P>
      <P>He added that the local governments should be able to manage at
least 70 percent of the tax revenues that they receive instead of the
current ratio of 50 percent, and that the revenues of local
governments must not be cut.</P>
      <P>Ma said that the overridden revised law would have required the
central government to set aside an additional NT$54.3 billion from
tax revenues to distribute to the local governments.</P>
      <P>The mayor said that enriching the financial resources of the
local governments and allowing them more freedom in their financial
management should be the criteria for drafting a revision.</P>
      <P>While the legislature's approval of the motion of reconsideration
was interpreted by many as a sign of the fading of Ma's limelight as
the "first knight" of the KMT, the mayor said that the maneuver in
the Legislative Yuan was only the practice of a constitutional
system. The outcome had nothing to do with him personally, he
claimed.</P>
      <P>However, he admitted that he "could be related to the
controversy" surrounding the revised law. "The revised bill might not
have created such considerable attention if it had not been raised by
me," he said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CABINET APPROVES RULES ON LAND ACQUISITION BY FOREIGN INVESTORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet approved Wednesday a package of
regulations governing land acquisition by foreign investors in major
construction projects and farms in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The Cabinet adopted the new package to facilitate implementation
of the revised Land Law, which allows foreign companies to invest in
Taiwan's real estate market in line with the government's efforts to
promote economic liberalization and globalization. Revisions to the
Land Law were passed last October.</P>
      <P>The new package will take effect after it is promulgated next
week. The Cabinet only needs to serve notice to the Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Under the new regulations, foreigners will be able to invest in
construction of tourist hotels, amusement and recreational
facilities, stadiums, high-rise residential apartments, public
facilities, new townships, and new communities. They will also be
allowed to invest in high-tech farms and animal husbandry in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The new regulations are expected to help make best use of
Taiwan's land resources and boost the island's overall economic and
agricultural development through the introduction of foreign capital

      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Wednesday he

      <P>Noting that the central and local governments have long been
squabbling over tax revenue allocation, Chen said major domestic
political forces must sit down to consult and jointly work out a
more reasonable, more fair, more transparent allocation formula for
the common well-being of local people.</P>
      <P>Chen further said he hopes that the result of Tuesday's

(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's institutes of higher learning and
the ministries overseeing them must embrace a system of integration
and innovation to enhance their competitiveness, former Vice Premier
Liu Chao-shiuan said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the need for Taiwan's 130 colleges and universities
to continue their pursuit of excellence, Liu, who currently heads a
Ministry of Education (MOE) task force promoting such academic
excellence, lamented that the quality of Taiwan's higher education
has failed to keep up with the increase in the number of schools.</P>
      <P>Liu said that the MOE's subsidies for the universities have
continued to decline as the number of schools vying for a piece of
the budget has gone up.</P>
      <P>He proposed that the schools should integrate with each other and
within themselves through mergers and the establishment of
cross-disciplinary research teams. This would help pool talented
human resources and provide Taiwan with world-class academics, he
said.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he added, the National Science Council (NSC), which
subsidizes innovative research projects but cannot maintain them in
the long run, and the Ministry of Education, which has the resources
to provide long-term subsidies but has a more rigid overall
mechanism, should integrate with each other to become a powerful
government agency in charge of promoting science and education.</P>
      <P>The former NSC chairman and National Tsinghua University
president said that universities are where innovative talent is
nurtured and that any nation pursuing economic progress must begin
with the development of "universities of excellence."</P>

    <HEADLINE>APPROVAL SOUGHT FOR RELOCATION OF 8-INCH WAFER FABS TO MAINLAND CHINA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As the government seems set on allowing
Taiwan chip makers to relocate their eight-inch wafer plants to
mainland China, although under strict restraints, the local
semiconductor industry has urged the government to dispense with what
it sees as "unnecessary interference."</P>
      <P>Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers Association
Chairman S.H. Hsu said Tuesday that the government should discuss the
issue with the local industry in order to meet their needs before
hammering out relevant measures and policy.</P>
      <P>As major Taiwan chip makers already have or are preparing to
acquire the technology to produce 12-inch silicon chips, Hsu said
moving the eight-inch wafer plants to the mainland will not have a
negative impact on the Taiwan industry and that the government does
not need to worry about Taiwan's competitiveness being hurt by
relocating outdated technologies.</P>
      <P>Citing statistics provided by the Taiwan Semiconductor
Association, Hsu said all Taiwan-based chip makers will shift to the
12-inch technology level within five years, creating more than 5,000
jobs on the island. He claimed that no adverse effects will be
produced, even if all the chip makers cease the operations of their
eight-inch wafer plants by that time.</P>
      <P>Representatives of the Taipei Computer Association also urged the
government to promote its "active opening, effective management"
mainland investment policy.</P>
      <P>During a meeting with Economic Affairs Minister Christine Tsung
on the same day, association chairman C.J. Huang and executives of
leading computer firms such as Acer Inc. and RITEK called on the
government to step up its pace to achieve the policy goal.</P>
      <P>Stressing that cross-Taiwan Strait economic integration will be a
vital strategy for Taiwan firms hoping to gain the upper hand in the
world market, they suggested the government set up a comprehensive
network to provide mainland-based Taiwan businessmen with efficient
trade information and services and to help them in market
distribution and business management with e-solutions.</P>
      <P>Huang also voiced his support for a final government decision to
allow the relocation of eight-inch wafer plants to the mainland. He
said, Premier Yu Shyi-kun should make the move swiftly because, he
said, it will benefit the whole country and the industry.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN FIRMS CONCERNED OVER DUMPING OF MAINLAND CHINESE GOODS: SURVEY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan firms are concerned over the
possible dumping of mainland Chinese products in the domestic market
and over the establishment of direct links with the mainland in the
wake of World Trade Organization (WTO) entry, according to a recent
survey.</P>
      <P>The results of the survey released Wednesday by the Chinese
National Federation of Industries (CNFI) show that the largest ratio
of local firms surveyed -- 49.5 percent of the total -- hope to get
government help to avoid what they see as "likely dumping" of
mainland products in Taiwan, while 48.5 percent hope to see direct
trade, transport and postal links set up across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The third most important issue for Taiwan firms, aired by 46.9
percent of the respondents, is that the government should provide
sufficient customs information for mainland-based Taiwan businesses,
while 45.9 percent wish the government to offer detailed and timely
information on cross-strait trade regulations, according to the
survey.</P>
      <P>At the same time, 43.8 percent of the respondents expect the
government to help collect trade information on the mainland market
and to help them explore overseas markets.</P>
      <P>As to the question of what benefits WTO entry will produce for
the local business community, 49.7 percent said the major advantage
is the reduction in customs duties, ahead of 38.2 percent who said
the main benefit is an upgraded international status.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, 79.2 percent said they believe the leading
disadvantage is that competition in the domestic market will become
strong, while 64.5 percent said they are worried about the reshipping
of products made by Taiwan companies in the mainland.</P>
      <P>CNFI Chairman K.C. Lin said the survey results indicate that
Taiwan-based businesses must strengthen their marketing and
innovation, and must slash their production costs if they want to
ride out the impact of WTO membership.</P>
      <P>The poll of 393 CNFI member companies was conducted from Jan.
10-25, with 201 valid questionnaires recovered. The CNFI carried out
the poll to gain a better understanding of the difficulties facing
the local business community following Taiwan's WTO entry and to help
serve as a reference for the government when drawing up relevant
measures and policies.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's current account surplus reached a
record high of US$19.082 billion last year, the Central Bank of China
(CBC) reported Wednesday.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the island's current account surplus for the
fourth quarter of 2001 also registered a historical high of US$7.062
billion since 1988, which the CBC said is an indication that Taiwan's
international payments remain in good shape.</P>
      <P>J. C. Yeh, vice director of the CBC's Economic Research
Department, attributed the quarterly high of Taiwan's current account
surplus to a huge trade surplus of US$7.158 billion incurred from
large falls in inbound shipments, coupled with sharp growth in
remittance from aboard and a noticeable drop in travel expenditures
overseas in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks against the
United States.</P>
      <P>The major reason behind Taiwan's record high of yearly current
account surplus last year, Yeh said, was the CBC's increase of its

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN'S ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE WILL IMPROVE THIS YEAR: P.K. CHIANG</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan Vice President P.K. Chiang
said Wednesday that Taiwan's economy is certain to recover this year
from the record low figures of the year before.</P>
      <P>He noted that Taiwan relies on foreign markets for 50 percent to
60 percent of its economic growth, and added that as Japan's
prospects this year will be better than in the past few years, the
island is expected to improve as well.</P>
      <P>Chiang, a former chairman of the Council for Economic Planning
and Development, made the remarks while delivering a speech on
Taiwan's present and future economic situation at the invitation of
the "San San Society," formed by local firms doing business with
Japan.</P>
      <P>He said that many government and private economic institutions,
including the Academia Sinica and the Taiwan Economic Research
Institute, have forecast a real growth rate ranging from 2.03 percent
to 3.08 percent for Taiwan this year.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chiang pointed out that some challenges remain for
Taiwan this year, such as a slowdown in the recovery of the world
economy, the effect originating from capital flight from Taiwan to
mainland China and the rise of regionalism.</P>
      <P>He urged the government to give priority to economic development,
take steps to improve the investment environment, promote financial
reform, restore investment confidence of enterprises and improve
financial operations to cope with the difficult situation.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP CHIEF DEFENDED HIS SUPPORT OF REJECTION OF ALLOCATION REVISIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kaohsiung mayor and Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) chairman Frank Hsieh said central government leaders
promised him that local governments would be given more power and
funds after he supported the Executive Yuan's request to reject
revisions to revenue-allocation rules which would have been
beneficial to his city.</P>
      <P>Emerging from a weekly conference of the Executive Yuan, Hsieh
said that central government leaders also promised to finance
Kaohsiung's development.</P>
      <P>He said he hopes the Executive Yuan will revamp the existing
revenue-allocation rules now that controversial changes to it have
been vetoed in a vote at the legislature Tuesday evening.</P>
      <P>Hsieh was feeling the heat after the administration led by his
party wanted to get rid of the opposition-initiated changes under
which Kaohsiung City was expected to get some NT$10 billion more from
the central government.</P>
      <P>Hsieh decided to follow the party line on the issue and backed
revoking the revisions.</P>
      <P>He argued that any windfall from the revisions could be difficult
to realize since the opposition-controlled legislature still might
reverse the revisions and ultimately cut Kaohsiung's share.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Lin Chin-hsing, a DPP lawmaker from Kaohsiung City,
called on the Executive Yuan Wednesday to come up with a new version
of an amendment under which local governments will get more funds
than they will be given under the now-rejected revisions.</P>
      <P>Another DPP legislator from Kaohsiung City, Chen Chi-mai, said
many other DPP lawmakers from the city agreed with him that they
should introduce a proposal in the Legislative Yuan to change the
revenue-allocation rules to give local governments not only enough
funds but also the full power to govern.</P>
      <P>Claiming that decentralization is the global order of the day,
Chen said revamping the revenue-allocation rules should be done in
line with the government's reform campaign.</P>
      <P>The major opposition Kuomintang (KMT), which initiated the
original changes, vowed Wednesday to monitor the Executive Yuan
despite the party's failure to sustain the revision in the
legislature Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The KMT whip at the Legislative Yuan, Lin Yi-shih, said Wednesday
that the ball was now in the Executive Yuan's court and his party
would wait and see what changes the Cabinet will propose.</P>
      <P>However, the KMT Taipei mayor, Ma Ying-jeou, who inspired his
party to change the allocation rules, said the KMT and its political
ally, the People First Party (PFP), might put forward their own
proposal for changes if the government disappoints them.</P>
      <P>The PFP, which helped the KMT pass the revisions near the end of
the last session of the legislature last month, had no comment
Wednesday about Tuesday's setback.</P>
      <P>Its chairman, James Soong, was quoted as saying that what matters
is not the results of the vote, but how to work out a fair and
transparent mechanism to divide revenues among governments of various
levels.</P>
      <P>PFP Legislator Lee Ching-an said Soong preferred more
comprehensive changes to the existing rules but was forced to throw
the weight of his party behind the KMT after finding that there was
no other way to resolve the dispute.</P>

    <HEADLINE>A COMPETITIVE TAIWAN NEEDS FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS: FORMER ROC PREMIER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  20  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan should improve its relations with
mainland China and sign a greater China free trade agreement to
maintain the island's global competitiveness, former Premier Vincent
Siew said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Siew said at a workshop seminar on cross-Taiwan Strait commerce
that Taiwan's World Trade Organization accession is only the first
step in maintaining its edge.</P>
      <P>If Taiwan cannot sign a free trade agreement with mainland China
and Hong Kong or with other countries in the region but mainland
China is successful in doing so, then the island will be
marginalized, and its future development will be affected immensely,
he added.</P>
      <P>Siew, who is currently chairman of the Cross-strait Common Market
Foundation, said that the United States is already assessing the
possibility of signing a free trade accord with Taiwan, while senior
officials from New Zealand, Australia and Singapore have voiced
support for similar plans.</P>
      <P>Touching on U.S. President George W. Bush's visit to mainland
China Thursday, Siew said that he believes an amelioration of
relations between the United States and mainland China will help
Taiwan and the mainland engage in beneficial interactions, making the
region more stable.</P>
      <P>He said that the mainland's next generation of top leaders are
mostly technocrats who will be more pragmatic, and that he expects
future cross-strait relations to be handled in a pragmatic manner.</P>
      <P>Siew added that he believes relations between Taiwan and the
United States will not be affected by Bush's visit, as indicated by a
statement that the U.S. president made in Japan that "America will
remember our commitments to the people on Taiwan."</P>

      <P>Taiwan businessmen in mainland China are
hopeful they can cross the Taiwan Strait using the "mini three links"
between the islands of Kinmen and Matzu and the mainland ports of
Xiamen and Mawei.</P>
      <P>Some 302 Taiwan businessmen working in the mainland used the
links to return to Taiwan for the Lunar New Year holiday, but Tsai
Ing-wen, chairwoman of the Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC), said that trip was "only a single case" and not the start of a

      <P>However, Liao Yun-yuan, director of the Trade and Service
Department of the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), who met the
Taiwan businessmen upon their arrival at Liaolowan Port in Kinmen,
said that they all expressed their satisfaction with the method of
cross-strait travel.</P>
      <P>Therefore, he went on, many Taiwanese businessmen now doing
business in the mainland will propose that they be allowed to use the
mini-links until direct links between Taiwan proper and the mainland

      <P>The proposal is expected to be made at a seasonal gathering

      <P>Normalization of economic and trade

Taipei government, Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Chairwoman Tsai
Ing-wen said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Tsai made the remarks while speaking at the opening of a seminar

relations organized by the Cross-Strait Common Market Foundation.</P>
      <P>Tsai said that Taiwan and the east coast of mainland China have
been playing a very important role in the world's economy.</P>
      <P>However, she admitted that problems regarding cross-strait
economic and trade issues are the "most difficult, most complicated
and most unique" ones that remain unresolved.</P>
      <P>As normalization of cross-strait economic and trade ties is the
government's policy, Tsai noted that proper handling of cross-strait
political relations is required, together with an early establishment
of a proper communication mechanism.</P>
      <P>Only through a stable political environment and a proper

Liu Tu-hsing, the president of the paper, said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Liu said the difficult decision was made reluctantly by the

last three years.</P>
      <P>"It is more a pause than an end," Liu stressed, adding that the

      <P>He promised to fully refund the paper's subscribers and offer its
employees severance pay according to the Labor Standards Law.</P>
      <P>The paper, founded with much fanfare in 1999, was the only full

state-of-the-art presses and pagination systems.</P>
      <P>Although the newspaper expected to break even after its first

    <HEADLINE>TIME NOT YET RIPE TO DISCUSS PRESIDENT CHEN'S TRAVEL PLAN: MOFA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The time is not yet right to talk about
whether or not President Chen Shui-bian will make an overseas visit
in May, a senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) official said
Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chen-hsiung, director of the MOFA's Department of African
Affairs, was commenting on a newspaper report that President Chen is
scheduled to visit three of the Republic of China's diplomatic allies
in Africa -- Liberia, Sao Tome and Principe, and Senegal -- in May.</P>
      <P>"We are still evaluating the president's travel plan, and no
definite decision has so far been made," Lee said, adding that the
MOFA would unveil all the details at an opportune time once the plan
is finalized.</P>
      <P>Noting that high-level diplomacy is conducive to the
consolidation of formal diplomatic ties, Lee said it is the
government's established policy to arrange for President Chen to
visit the ROC's diplomatic allies from time to time.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Lee said, the president's overseas trips usually
involve many issues that need careful assessment, including the
effects of the visit as well as the working schedules of Chen and the
host countries.</P>
      <P>The ROC has eight diplomatic allies in Africa -- Burkina Faso,
Chad, Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, and
Swaziland.</P>
      <P>President Chen visited three African allies -- Burkina Faso, Chad
and Gambia -- in his first overseas trip as the ROC head of state in
August 2000. And top leaders of all of the ROC's eight African allies
have visited Taiwan since Chen took office in May 2000.</P>
      <P>According to a report carried in the Thursday issue of the
Chinese-language United Daily News, President Chen will visit
Liberia, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal in May, as well as Malawi if
time allows.</P>
      <P>The report said Chen may make a transit stop in a European city
en route to Africa. The Vatican is the only European country that
maintains formal diplomatic ties with the ROC. Vice President Annette
Lu succeeded in making a transit stop in Paris on her way to Gambia
last December and a two-night transit stay in Vienna and Paris on her
way home from Gambia.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TECO OFFICIAL COMMENTS ON BUSH'S BEIJING VISIT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>New  York, Feb. 20 (CNA)
(By David Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The director of the Information Division
of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in New York expressed the
hope in an editorial published Thursday in the Republican-American
that while Beijing and Washington work to improve their relations,
such improvements will not come at Taiwan's expense.</P>
      <P>Commenting on President Bush's visit to Beijing, William J. Yih
wrote in the daily published in Connecticut that Taiwan treasures its
relationship with the United States, pointing out that while Taiwan
has voiced its continued strong support for the U.S.-led
international campaign against terrorism since the Sept. 11 attacks,
Beijing's support for anti-terrorism efforts has been more
"ambiguous."</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Yih said, Beijing refuses to renounce the use of
force against Taiwan, and "has strengthened its forces in the Taiwan
Strait and targeted increasingly sophisticated weapons systems at the
island."</P>
      <P>Unlike mainland China, Yih noted, Taiwan is willing to engage in
cross-strait dialogue without imposing preconditions, saying that
Beijing insists that Taiwan must acknowledge its "one-China
principle" before discussions can take place, while "Taiwan believes
any agreement should have the support of the people through a
democratic process."</P>
      <P>Yih said he is hopeful that the U.S. can contribute to an easing
of tensions and increased stability in the region by encouraging
cooperation across the strait.</P>
      <P>"By adhering to the Taiwan Relations Act and not restating the
`Three Nos' affirmed by former U.S. President Clinton as a concession
to Beijing, the United States can promote peaceful dialogue," he
added.</P>
      <P>One of the most effective ways that the United States might
pursue this objective, Yih wrote, is by encouraging international
organizations to include Taiwan as a member.</P>
      <P>Pointing to the recent admission into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) of mainland China and Taiwan as full-fledged
members, Yih said that "their concurrent accession created another
forum in which leaders from opposite sides of the Taiwan Strait will
have a chance to meet and interact on a level playing field."</P>
      <P>Yih concluded his article by expressing the hope that President
Bush will take advantage of his trip to Beijing "to discourage
intimidation of Taiwan and encourage the improvement of cross-strait
relations."</P>

(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Sampo Corp. of Taiwan and the Haier
Group Company in mainland China have signed a strategic alliance
agreement for full cooperation from production to marketing, a
spokesman of the Sampo headquarters in Taipei said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the two companies will share sales
channels, supply OEM (other equipment manufacturer) products,
exchange purchasing information and make joint investments.</P>
      <P>Sampo is one of Taiwan's leading manufacturers of home
appliances, consumer electronics and telecommunications products. The
Shantung-based Haier Group is the biggest telecommunications and
electronics manufacturer in mainland China, with 60 billion renminbi
(US$7.25 billion) in sales last year.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said that the strategic alliance with Haier is part
of Sampo's global deployment plan for the next three years. In
addition to tailor-made LCD television sets and DVD players for the
mainland market, Sampo is supplying the Haier Group with compressors
for air conditioners and passive components for mobile phone sets.</P>
      <P>He said that the Haier Group, with its products sold in over 160
countries, is keen to explore the Taiwan market. The mainland company
first made a patent rights registration with the authorities in
Taiwan in 1996. While familiarizing itself with the market climate in
Taiwan, the Haier Group has also placed orders for mobile phone
peripherals and other information products with Taiwan manufacturers.</P>
      <P>Sampo is planning to sell 20-inch television sets produced by the
Haier Group in the Taiwan market under the Sampo brand name in the
near future, according to the spokesman.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOUR TAIWAN UNIVERSITIES HOPE TO USE CALIFORNIA UNIVERSITY MODEL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>San  Francisco,  Feb.  20 (CNA)
(By Neil Lu and Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Four prestigious universities in
Taiwan are hoping to emulate the University of California (U of C)
cooperative education system to raise the level of higher education
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>A delegation of Taiwan university presidents and a ranking
education official have been visiting the U of C headquarters in
Oakland, and the University of California campuses at Berkeley and
San Francisco over the past few days, hoping to use the U of C
university system as a reference for Taiwan's advanced education.</P>
      <P>The visiting academics were Vice Minister of Education Lu Mu-lin,
National Chiao Tung University President Chang Chun-yen, National
Central University President Liu Chao-han, National Yang Ming
University President Wu Yen-hua, and National Tsinghua University
President Frank H. Shu.</P>
      <P>The four presidents are all members of the Academia Sinica, the
Republic of China's highest academic research institute, and are
highly respected in academic and educational fields. They said that
the four Taiwan universities excel in their respective areas, and
would complement each other if a unified university system could be
set up similar to the one in California. Cooperation would add much
to research and teaching at advanced educational facilities in
Taiwan, they added.</P>
      <P>Where the headquarters of the proposed Taiwan university system
would be has yet to be decided. Likewise, who would head the system
is still open.</P>
      <P>Vice Minister Lu pointed out that if the four universities wanted
to form a public university system, they would have to meet the legal
requirements for such a move. President Chang stressed that the four
universities have started planning for a university system and will
work together to jump whatever legal hurdles stand in their way.</P>
      <P>The four presidents said that there are several cooperation
projects in the works, but that they will not make the details of
them public until concrete discussions have been made regarding their
implementation.</P>
      <P>The presidents said that their goal is to establish a world-class
university system in Taiwan, on par with the best schools in the
world. They said that there will be basic changes to Taiwan's
advanced educational system, and the function of universities will be
clearer, with those schools that produce students who excel
academically becoming even better.</P>
      <P>But they also pointed out that the four schools could not copy
the U of C system completely; for instance, they would not be
receiving blanket funding from the state as is the case in
California.</P>
      <P>Frank H. Shu, a world-renowned astrophysicist who took over the
helm of National Tsinghua University this month after serving in the
U of C system for more than three decades, said that among all U.S.
state universities, the U of C system is one of the most successful
and Taiwan can learn from it.</P>
      <P>The delegation, which left for the U.S. last Sunday, is scheduled
to return to Taiwan Saturday.</P>

said, however, that the reopening of cross-Taiwan Strait talks

Taiwan businessmen.</P>
      <P>As to the question of whether the current visit by U. S.

    <HEADLINE>MINISTER VOWS TO HELP RESOLVE RESIDENCY ISSUE FOR NORWEGIAN COUPLE</HEADLINE>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Minister of the Interior Yu
Cheng-hsien paid a visit to Bjarne Gislefoss, co-founder of the Puli
Christian Hospital, and his wife Thursday in the central Taiwan
county of Nantou, to show his concern for their residency issue.</P>
      <P>The elderly Norwegian couple have stayed in Taiwan for 50 years
to offer medical services in remote mountainous regions, but they
still have not obtained permanent residency due to the Republic of
China's stiff immigration laws.</P>
      <P>Yu said he will push relevant government agencies to come up with
an amendment to the existing immigration laws during the current
legislative session to help resolve residency issues for several
prominent foreigners, like Gislefoss and his wife, who have devoted
the prime of their lives to serving Taiwan people.</P>
      <P>Under current Taiwan law, only foreigners who have legally and
continuously lived in Taiwan for seven years and who have spent over
270 days per year on the island are eligible to apply for permanent
residency.</P>
      <P>In the past, Yu said, the government imposed stringent
restrictions on permanent residency applications by foreign nationals
due to national security considerations.</P>
      <P>"But times have changed. I think such strict restrictions should
be properly eased," Yu said, adding that he will push for the
completion of revisions in the immigration laws during the present
legislative session.</P>
      <P>Before the law is amended, Yu said he will ask local police
authorities to assist the Norwegian couple in handling tedious
formalities regarding extending their residency permits.</P>
      <P>Gislefoss, 79, a trained doctor, first came to Taiwan in 1952 to
work at Taipei's Mackay Memorial Hospital. In 1954, he traveled to
South Korea to head an orphanage there and returned to Taiwan in 1965
to help found the Puli Christian Hospital. He has since dedicated
himself to offering medical services for aboriginal and
underprivileged people in central Taiwan. In 1966, he also founded a
care center for local polio patients.</P>
      <P>Alfhild Jensen Gislefoss, 84, also a medical professional, has
dedicated herself to serving local people since she came to Taiwan in
1962 to introduce new anesthetic technology to Christian hospitals
around the island. She married Gislefoss in Taiwan in 1963.</P>
      <P>As the couple have to travel abroad frequently to raise funds for
the Puli hospital and polio victims' care center, they have so far
been unable to acquire permanent residency in Taiwan. Nevertheless,
the couple have received many awards from both the ROC and Norwegian
governments for their devoted services to the people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Last month, opposition Kuomintang Legislator Apollo Chen said he
will propose an amendment bill to allow foreigners who have stayed in
Taiwan legally for over 20 years and who have spent over 183 days per
year during 10 of those years on the island to be eligible to apply
for permanent residency.</P>

    <HEADLINE>UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN NATIONS CAN PROMOTE PEACE: ROC VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
said in a recent interview with a U.S. magazine on foreign affairs
that countries of the world should attempt to understand and respect
each other to eliminate hatred and war.</P>
      <P>Lu said in an interview with Washington International
(www.washingtoninternational.com) that the attack on the World Trade
Center in New York and the Pentagon shows that there is no such thing
as absolute wealth or power in the world.</P>
      <P>She said that any attempts to focus solely on developing military
armaments and ignoring mutual understanding, respect, cooperation and
sharing -- which are "essential in social and international
relations" -- will only lead to war and hostility.</P>
      <P>"This is why I have promoted `soft power,' which includes human
rights, democracy, peace, love and high technology," she said. "The
ultimate goals of the war against terrorism should be to eliminate
antagonism and reduce differences between the Muslim and Christian
worlds and to bridge the gap between their spiritual and material
matters."</P>
      <P>The vice president said, "As long as we have love and peace in
our hearts, and as long as we exercise our `soft powers,' we can
bring the Eastern and Western Hemispheres into peaceful coexistence,
cooperation and sharing, without antagonism or war."</P>
      <P>Touching on her transit through the United States en route to
visiting ROC allies in Central and South America, Lu said, "It is
hard to imagine that a head of state coming from a country that
enjoys democracy, freedom and peace should be restricted so much in
the United States."</P>
      <P>She said that she appreciates the Taiwan policy review initiated
by U.S. President George W. Bush upon taking office that allowed her
and ROC President Chen Shui-bian to be accorded better receptions
than they received previously in transit.</P>
      <P>"Regretfully, however, during my transit stay in the United
States, I was not able to contact the international media," she said.
"The United States is a country that upholds freedom of speech. I do
hope very much that I will have the chance to meet with the media
during my next visit to the United States."</P>
      <P>On her being the first woman to become a vice president of the
ROC, Lu said that President Chen asked her to be his running mate so
that she could join him in managing national affairs. Therefore, she
said, the people have expected her to assist the president, listen to
their opinions and address their problems.</P>
      <P>Lu said that she expects more women will participate in politics
to help achieve the goal of a "feminization of politics."</P>
      <P>"I am proud that I, as a woman, was elected vice president and
have been able to win the trust of the people," she said, adding that
the people's smiles are her "greatest comfort."</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Buddhist Master Hsin Yun left for mainland
China Thursday to escort an invaluable Buddha finger relic to Taiwan
for exhibition.</P>
      <P>Hsin Yun, founder of the Fokuangshan Buddhist Temple complex in
the southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung, said prior to his departure
that the Buddha relic can help "purify human hearts" and "improve
social customs."</P>
      <P>"It is not expected to avert misfortune, but it can help devout
Buddhist followers attain peace of mind," Hsin Yun said. "It's a
sacred symbol of Buddhism and an invaluable spiritual asset."</P>
      <P>Hsin Yun, accompanied by a number of local Buddhist followers,
will travel to the Famen Temple in the northwestern mainland province
of Shaanxi to escort the Buddha finger relic to Taiwan. The article
is reputed as the only real Buddha finger relic ever found.</P>
      <P>Hsin Yun said he hopes local people will welcome the arrival of
the treasured Buddhist relic with calm and reason. The Buddhist
master, who recently expressed his distaste for the island's
prevailing lottery mania, said he would not like to see local people
become "wild" over the relic.</P>
      <P>The removal of the Buddhist relic to Taiwan for exhibition is
widely seen as a great event in the Buddhist community. A television
company will broadcast the whole process live via satellite. More
than 400 Buddhist followers, including 87 mainland Chinese monks,
will escort the relic to Taiwan aboard two chartered planes.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Relations between Taiwan and the United

President George W. Bush took office and Bush's current mainland
visit is unlikely to affect the two-way ties, a presidential aide
said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Secretary-General of the Presidential Office Chen Shih-meng said
the U. S. has repeatedly assured Taiwan that Bush will stick to his
commitments to help protect Taiwan and he will not do or say anything
that could damage Taiwan's interests while visiting mainland China.</P>
      <P>According to Chen, the main purpose of Bush's mainland trip is to
thank Beijing for its cooperation in the U.S.-led anti-terrorist war
following last year's Sept. 11 terror attacks on Washington and New

      <P>Meanwhile, Chang Shiao-yue, spokeswoman for the Ministry of

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian has shelved the
idea of forming a national security alliance in the Legislative Yuan
due to the outside world's misinterpretation and misunderstanding, a
presidential aide said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Secretary-General of the Presidential Office Chen Shih-meng said
President Chen's idea to set up the group was aimed at establishing a
stable majority of "middle of the road" forces in cooperation with
the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in the legislature to secure
political stability for the country.</P>
      <P>But the idea has been misinterpreted by the outside world as a
means of "battling against" the opposition camp -- namely the
Kuomintang and the People First Party -- which controls a fragile
majority in the 225-seat legislature, he said, adding that the
situation has led President Chen to decide that now is not the right
time to push for the alliance.</P>
      <P>Chen also said that the government should hold a public debate to
decide whether it should allow Taiwan-based chip-makers to relocate
their eight-inch wafer plants to mainland China.</P>
      <P>He said it is a restrictive request to demand that the government
make a final decision on the far-reaching issue within a month.</P>
      <P>The Taiwan semiconductor sector has high expectations that the
government will allow them to move their old facilities for
manufacturing eight-inch silicon wafers to the mainland as part of
their global market deployment now that the government has decided to
ease restrictions on mainland-bound investment following the
recommendations of the Economic Development Advisory Conference in

    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of Taiwanese in the United
States urged former President Bill Clinton Wednesday not to lend a
hand to Beijing's campaign for reunification with Taiwan when he
attends a rally of a pro-Chinese unification group in Sydney on
Friday.</P>
      <P>Wu Ming-chi, president of the Washington-based Formosan
Association for Public Affairs (FAPA), which advocates Taiwan
independence, said Clinton should not attend the rally and should not
make any speeches harmful to the interests of Taiwan at the event
should he decide to attend.</P>
      <P>U.S. President George W. Bush, who is in mainland China on an
official visit, pointed out before departing for Asia that Taiwan is
Washington's good friend, and reconfirmed the United States'
commitment to Taiwan's safety in a speech in Japan Monday, Wu said.
Clinton should not embarrass the incumbent president by speaking
otherwise, Wu said.</P>
      <P>Reminding Clinton that he himself had said during his time in
office that any change in Taiwan's status should be approved by its
people, Wu urged the former president to hold his ground in Sydney.</P>
      <P>As the pro-unification group is an organization established to
cater to Beijing's political agenda, Clinton should not stoop to pave
the way for Beijing's designs against Taiwan, Wu added.</P>
      <P>"The FAPA firmly opposes any U.S. president who plays into the
hands of Beijing by serving as its mouthpiece," Wu said.</P>
      <P>Several FAPA members delivered a petition signed by about 300

      <P>The ROC government will go forward with its
"active opening, effective management" economic policy toward
mainland China and implement consensuses reached at the Economic
Development Advisory Conference (EDAC) last August to meet challenges
resulting from Taiwan's World Trade Organization's (WTO) admission,
Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Since both sides of the Taiwan Strait are now full members of the
WTO, Yu said that cross-strait trade and exchanges will grow and that
the increased contact will require Taiwan and the mainland to respect
and have faith in one another.</P>
      <P>The premier called on both sides of the Strait to put aside their
differences and enter into discussions on issues that are important
for future stability.</P>
      <P>He said that the two sides resolve issues such as ways to promote
cross-strait economic cooperation, strengthen investment protection
agreements, foster the "mini three links" and come to a conclusion
about the controversial notion of whether agreement was ever reached
in 1992 on the definition of "one China."</P>
      <P>Yu urged Taiwanese businessmen on the mainland to join hands with
the government to strengthen Taiwan. He said that tapping the vast
market across the Strait was acceptable business but added: "Only by
having a strong Taiwan will you be able to work outside of the
country without people casting aspersions on your operations."</P>
      <P>Yu also promised that the government will continue to improve the
investment climate, undertake construction of needed infrastructure
projects, strengthen research and development programs in high-tech
industries and upgrade the enterprises' competitiveness.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks while addressing an annual gathering of

(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Kaohsiung Harbor
Bureau (KHB) is looking for lifting management fees for containers in
transshipment in order to regain its ranking as the world's
third-largest container harbor after being overtaken by Pusan in
South Korea last year, KHB officials said Thursday.</P>
      <P>The Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) has
turned down a suggestion by the KHB that the ministry stop levying
fees for the management of the handling of transshipping containers
to make the harbor more attractive to shippers.</P>
      <P>KHB officials said that they will collect more detailed
information for the ministry in the issue of fees but said that they
will also continue to push for the lifting of management fees.</P>
      <P>The number of containers loaded and unloaded in South Korea's
Pusan Harbor surpassed that of Kaohsiung Harbor in 2001, making Pusan
the world's third-largest container harbor, replacing Kaohsiung, the
KHB said. Kaohsiung has slipped to fourth.</P>
      <P>Kaohsiung Harbor handled 7.54 million TEUs during the whole of
last year, less than Pusan harbor's 7.9 million.</P>
      <P>Hong Kong and Singapore are the world's largest and
second-largest container harbors, respectively.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN APPRECIATIVE THAT BUSH HAS NOT MADE HARMFUL REMARKS: ROC FM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China is appreciative that
U.S. President George W. Bush has not made any remarks harmful to ROC
interests during his ongoing trip to mainland China, ROC Minister of
Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Chien noted that although the United States and mainland China
appear to have achieved consensus on certain issues, Bush and
mainland Chinese President Jiang Zemin were approaching the issue of
Taiwan differently, each putting forward their own interpretations.</P>
      <P>Chien said that this corresponded entirely with the information
that Taiwan received before the meeting between Bush and Jiang.</P>
      <P>He said that the ROC government affirms Bush's comment that the
Taiwan issue must be resolved peacefully and that the U.S. government
will continue to abide by the Taiwan Relations Act, which requires
Washington to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself.</P>
      <P>Chien said that Bush's trip to Asia was significant in promoting
stability, prosperity and security across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He added that the ROC government hopes Washington will elevate
the level of its relations with Taipei at the same time that it
improves relations with Beijing so that a "win-win" situation can be
created on the basis of democracy, human rights, economic prosperity,
peace and security for all.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union (TSU), which
regards former ROC President Lee Teng-hui as its "spiritual leader,"
openly urged Bush to take the occasion of his trip to demand that
mainland China respect human rights, put a stop to religious
prosecution, let Taiwan gain independence and maintain friendly
cross-strait ties.</P>
      <P>TSU spokesman Lin Chih-chia also urged mainland China to abandon
communism and embrace democracy.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC PRESIDENT OFFERS TO RECONVENE ADVISORY GROUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Thursday that the government is offering to reconvene the
presidential advisory group that met previously and which was
intended to bridge political parties to make recommendations on
cross-Taiwan Strait issues.</P>
      <P>Chen said at a seminar of heads of Taiwanese business
associations in mainland China that he hopes the parties will agree
to participate in the President's Advisory Group on Cross-Taiwan
Strait Relations, an ad hoc team that in the first few months of his
presidency managed to form a basic consensus that served as reference
for his cross-strait policy.</P>
      <P>During those earlier meetings, neither of the two major
opposition parties agreed to attend the advisory committee or take
part in any of its activities.</P>
      <P>Headed by Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh, the group
announced its "three acknowledgments and four recommendations" after
its seventh meeting on Nov. 26, 2000, including a suggestion that
Chen should promote cross-strait relations, resolve bilateral
disputes and respond to Beijing's "one China" stance in line with the
ROC Constitution.</P>
      <P>If the ruling and opposition parties are willing, the president
said that he hopes the advisory group will reconvene to formulate
further recommendations on cross-strait issues that are consensuses
of the various political parties and can be agreed upon by all the
people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Economic Development Advisory Conference held
in August last year urged the government to consolidate the
consensuses of the ruling and opposition parties as soon as possible,
to resolve the differences surrounding the issue of the "1992
consensus," to define cross-strait relations in accordance with the
ROC Constitution, to set aside political contentions and to negotiate
quickly with mainland China on the "three links" issue as well as
other issues that concern the welfare of the people.</P>
      <P>The president said that his government has continuously offered
gestures of good will and sincerity to the other side of the Taiwan
Strait and replaced the previous administration's "no haste, be
patient" policy on investments in mainland China with one of "active
opening, effective management."</P>
      <P>All of this was done with the hopes of maintaining harmony and
bilateral exchanges, and in the pursuit of normalized development in
cross-strait relations, he added.</P>
      <P>Chen said that Taipei and Beijing should engage in proactive
dialogue and cooperation instead of passive resistance and
confrontation.</P>
      <P>Taiwan welcomes any actions or remarks from mainland China that
are conducive to maintaining cross-strait stability, he said, adding
that as along as the two sides have good will and sincerity, and
carry out exchanges and dialogue pragmatically, there will surely be
improvements in bilateral relations that will lead to reconciliation
and everlasting peace.</P>

    <HEADLINE>SPEAKER RULES OUT PARTICIPATING IN PROPOSED COORDINATION GROUP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  21  (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng
ruled out the possibility Thursday that he would join a proposed
coordination group between the legislature and the office of the
president.</P>
      <P>As head of the legislature, a position which is essentially
supposed to monitor the administration, Wang said it
would be inappropriate for him to join a group designed to work out
policy acceptable to the Presidential Office while chairing the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Except for what was reported in the newspapers, Wang said he has
no idea of the coordination group which is said to be made up of
Cabinet members, heads of counties and cities and heads of major
think tanks, to replace the so-called "nine-member panel" which is
the supreme policy-making body consisting of DPP leaders in the
legislature, Cabinet and presidential office.</P>
      <P>Wang said lawmakers of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party
(DPP) who are charged with steering the Cabinet's agenda through the
legislature would not breach the basic principles of democracy by
serving in the coordination group, but as head of the legislature --
and a member of the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) -- this would not be
possible for him.</P>
      <P>He said he is more than willing to offer his opinions on
political issues to the ruling authorities if asked, but would not
join the proposed coordination group.</P>
      <P>He also denied that President Chen Shui-bian is flirting with the
idea of forming a non-partisan panel with Wang as its head to sort
out differences among the Legislative Yuan, Executive Yuan and the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Wang said these reports are absolutely groundless.</P>
      <P>Wang made the comments while answering questions from journalists
on the sidelines of a KMT New Year's party.</P>
      <P>In a related development Thursday, People First Party lawmaker
Lee Ching-an criticized the idea of forming such a coordination group
as not complying with the law, just as the nine-member panel lacks
proper legal foundation.</P>
      <P>But DPP lawmaker Wang To said the nine-member panel does not
contravene the law as there is nothing on the books specifically
referring to it.</P>
      <P>He said that the coordination group, which would be formed by
expanding the nine-member panel, would broaden the basis of
communication between the ruling and opposition parties and thereby
help the government to carry out its agenda.</P>

    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 21 (CNA)
(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian consulted Academia
Sinica President Lee Yuan-tseh on ways to revive what was to be a
non-partisan panel to advise Chen on policy toward mainland China,
a president's national policy adviser said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Hsiao Hsin-huang, who was also spokesman for the President's
Adivisory Group onCross-Taiwan Stait Relations set up in
August, 2000 to offer opinions to the president on mainland Chinese
policy, said Chen spoke with Lee before the Chinese New Year in hopes
of reactivating the now-defunct panel by bringing in representatives
of opposition parties.</P>
      <P>Given that the political situation in Taiwan has changed greatly
after the December 2001 elections of lawmakers, Hsiao said the
president thought that the opposition would no longer reject the idea
of joining a multi-party presidential advisory panel.</P>
      <P>The main opposition parties refused to attend any of the past
meetings.</P>
      <P>The president's proposal to reconvene the cross-party task force
Thursday left the major opposition Kuomintang (KMT) cold.</P>
      <P>KMT spokeswoman Kuo Shu-chung said her party will reserve
response "until it is clear whether the president is trying to sell
snake oil or if he is in fact offering the real deal."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile Su Chi, the former chairman of the Mainland Affairs
Council and a researcher at the KMT-run think tank the National
Policy Foundation, criticized the president as fighting against an
imaginary enemy.</P>
      <P>"The problem with the president is the widely divergent opinions
toward mainland China within his own party," Su said, adding that
this problem must be solved by Chen himself rather than any task
force outside the DPP.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OVER 2,400 LOCAL WORKERS HAVE BENEFITED FROM INCENTIVE PROGRAM: CLA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 2,400 domestic laborers have
benefited so far from an incentive program implemented last September
by the Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) to promote the employment of
local laborers in traditional industries, according to CLA
statistics.</P>
      <P>CLA officials said that the program was put in place in order to
encourage traditional industries to hire more local laborers as well
as to help solve the labor shortage problem in these industries.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the program, the CLA gives employers in
traditional industries NT$60,000 (US$1,709.4) for each domestic
laborer they employ continuously for six months, providing an
additional NT$10,000 for each month that they retain the employee
thereafter.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CLA has stiffened the punishment for employers who
hire foreign laborers illegally. The employers are subject to fines
of between NT$150,000 and NT$750,000 (US$4,273.5 and US21,367.5) for
hiring foreign laborers without getting prior approval, and they are
subject to imprisonment of up to three years if they violate the
regulations again within five years.</P>
      <P>The CLA said it made the move to prevent the illegal hiring of
foreign laborers in order to protect the rights and interests of
local workers.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>A boatload of mainland Chinese men were
nabbed off an isle near Penghu Island Thursday before allegedly
trying to sneak into Taiwan territory, coast guard forces in the
southern county of Chiayi reported Friday.</P>
      <P>Acting on a tip, members of the Chiayi coast guard searched the
offshore areas around Penghu in the Taiwan Strait on Thursday night
and discovered a mainland Chinese fishing boat, the Minjinyu 5782,
which was about to anchor at a makeshift pier on the isle of Chimei.</P>
      <P>After boarding the small fishing craft, the Chiayi maritime
police discovered 43 mainland Chinese on board the vessel which is
designed to carry between eight and 10 people along with fishing gear
and catch.</P>
      <P>Some of the mainland Chinese men, ranging in age from 17 to over
50, were wearing business suits and did not have the darkened skin
characteristic of fishermen, although they claimed that they were
fishermen, according to maritime police.</P>
      <P>Finding neither fishing gear nor catch on the boat, the Chiayi
police took all of the mainlanders back to the headquarters of the
Chiayi coast guard for questioning overnight.</P>
      <P>Of the total, four men could not produce any identification
papers to prove their status. When the police asked one of them
whether he knew how to fish and also why he was wearing a business
suit, the man gave no reply and only smiled timidly.</P>
      <P>The police discovered that most of the mainlanders are from
Fujian Province or Guizhou Province.</P>
      <P>The maritime police handed the 43 mainlanders to the Chiayi
intelligence authorities for further questioning out of concerns that
they might be spies who had tried to sneak into Taiwan to collect
intelligence information.</P>

    <HEADLINE>OPPOSITION LAWMAKER ORGANIZES NEW CROSS-STRAIT FORUM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator John
Chang said Friday he is pushing for the establishment of a new
cross-party forum on issues related to the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the problems faced by Taiwan investors
in mainland China, Chang said he intends to invite lawmakers from
both the ruling and opposition parties to join the proposed forum
which he said would serve as a conduit for dialogue and communication
between government officials and Taiwan business people with
interests in mainland China.</P>
      <P>Chang, a former minister of foreign affairs and secretary-general
to the president during the era of KMT rule, said the government's
current "active opening, effective management" policy on cross-strait
trade and economic relations is self-contradictory.</P>
      <P>"My opinion is that the government should replace `effective
management' with `pragmatic management' in order to offer local
entrepreneurs even greater freedom in tapping into the vast mainland
Chinese market," Chang said.</P>
      <P>In addition, Chang said, the government should scrap its obsolete
practice of meeting with senior executives of Taiwanese trade
associations in mainland China only during the three major Chinese
festivals -- the Spring Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival and the
Mid-Autumn Festival.</P>
      <P>"The government should exercise more flexibility in arranging
meetings with mainland China-based Taiwan business and industry
executives," Chang said.</P>
      <P>"Relevant government agencies should maintain regular and
frequent contacts with our business people with interests on the
mainland in order to better understand their needs and tailor
cross-strait policies to meet their reasonable demands in time," he
added.</P>
      <P>Against this backdrop, Chang said, he is organizing a new forum
in the Legislative Yuan to serve as a bridge for increased
communications between the government and mainalnd China-based Taiwan
entrepreneurs.</P>
      <P>"I hope legislators from the various political parties will join
the forum to help smooth dialogue between the government and the
business community," he said.</P>
      <P>A number of legislators from the KMT, the ruling Democratic
Progressive Party and the opposition People First Party attended
Friday's seminar to exchange views with Taiwan investors in mainland
China on feasible measures to improve cross-strait economic
relations.</P>
      <P>Many businesspeople present on the occasion said that their
operations on the mainland have become increasingly difficult since
mainland China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) late last
year.</P>
      <P>Chang Han-wen, president of the Dongguan Taiwanese Business
Association in southern China, said mainland China has been actively
assisting its small- and medium-sized enterprises to expand
operations since its WTO accession.</P>
      <P>"Such moves have threatened the survival of Taiwan-funded
businesses there. Some mainland firms have even hired management
personnel from Taiwan-financed companies to enhance their competitive
edge," Chang complained, adding that the government should play a
more active role in helping integrate the resources of
Taiwan-financed firms to maintain their niches in the critical
mainland market.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ECONOMICS MINISTER SUPPORTS TAINAN ORCHID CULTURING ZONE PROJECT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Tainan, Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Economics Minister Christine T.Y. Tsung and
Fan Cheng-chung, chairman of the Council of Agriculture, both support
the Tainan orchid culturing zone development project, according to
Tainan County Magistrate Su Huan-dji.</P>
      <P>Su said that Tainan County Government and the Taiwan Sugar Corp.
plan to jointly develop a 500-hectare orchid growing plantation in
Ho-pi in Tainan County. The Council of Agriculture has agreed to
provide financial support for the project.</P>
      <P>Orchid plantations have become a profit-making side business of
the state-owned Taiwan Sugar Corp. The Taiwan Sugar Corp. Orchid
Propagation Center (TSCOPC) has earned handsome amounts of foreign
exchange with its phalaenopsis, dendrobium and oncidium plants
cultured at its computer-controlled greenhouses.</P>
      <P>A pioneer in culturing, mass producing and marketing orchid
plants, the TSCOPC first introduced the greenhouse technology from
the Netherlands in 1987, and has since succeeded in culturing a great
variety of species.</P>
      <P>With the popularity of orchid plants from Taiwan in the Japanese,
European, Northern American and mainland Chinese markets, the TSCOPC
is planning to cooperate with Tainan County Government to develop an
orchid culturing zone with research facilities in Ho-pi, where the
weather is best suited for horticulture.</P>
      <P>Orchid growers in Taiwan will sponsor the eighth Asia-Pacific
Orchid Conference in the spring of 2004. Taiwan's orchid plants have
won numerous prizes at the international event which has been held
every three years since the first conference in Japan in 1984. Japan,
Indonesia, Australia and Thailand have each hosted the conference
since its inception.</P>
      <P>While many orchid nurseries around the island are opened to the
public, orchid growers have also presented their precious species at
exhibitions around the island.</P>
      <P>From March 9-17, the Taiwan Orchid Growers Association, the
Council of Agriculture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Tourism
Bureau and Tainan County Government will jointly sponsor the Taiwan
International Orchid Show 2002 at the Tainan Beru Exhibition Center.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TRAFFIC CONTROLS TO BE IMPOSED OVER ARRIVAL OF BUDDHIST RELIC</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Taipei city government announced Friday
that traffic controls will be imposed on several major thoroughfares
Saturday afternoon due to the arrival of a treasured Buddhist relic
-- a finger purported to have come from Sakamuni Buddha some 2,500
years ago.</P>
      <P>The relic, which is kept at the Famen Temple in Xian, in the
northern mainland Chinese province of Shaanxi, will arrive in Taiwan
Saturday under the escort of a large number of Buddhist faithful from
both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As the relic will be sent directly from Chiang Kai-shek
International Airport to National Taiwan University's domed stadium
for a three-day exhibition, the Taipei City Police Headquarters
(TCPH) said traffic controls will be imposed on major streets along
its route, including Hsinsheng S. Road, Jenai Road and Hsinhai Road.</P>
      <P>The controls will remain in place from 3 p.m. through 5 p.m., a
TCPH official said, adding that drivers are advised to detour during
the period to avoid possible traffic jams as throngs of local
Buddhist followers are expected to turn out to greet the relic.</P>
      <P>Buddhist Master Hsin Yun, founder of the Fokuangshan Monastery in
the southern Taiwan county of Kaohsiung, led a 300-member delegation
to mainland China Thursday to escort the relic to Taiwan for
exhibition in Taipei and other places around the island for 40 days.</P>
      <P>Prior to his departure, Hsin Yun said he is convinced that the
exhibition of the Buddhist treasure in Taiwan will help "purify human
hearts, cleanse social morals and bring peace to the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Noting that the relic is an invaluable symbol of Buddhism and a
spiritual asset, Hsin Yun said its arrival will mark a new milestone
in cross-strait religious exchanges.</P>
      <P>Hsin Yun further said he hopes local people will welcome the
arrival of the relic with calm and reason. The Buddhist master, who
recently expressed his distaste for the island's prevailing lottery
mania, said he would not like to see local people become "wild" over
the relic.</P>
      <P>According to religious documents, Sakamuni Buddha died in 485
B.C. and the finger was brought to China some 200 years later. It is
reputed to be the only real Buddha finger relic ever found.</P>
      <P>The finger was sealed in a basement of the Famen Temple's pagoda
in 874 by order of an emperor from the ancient Tang Dynasty. Since
then it was not seen in public until 1986, when the Shaanxi
provincial government cleared the rubble of the temple's pagoda,
which collapsed in 1981 amid torrential rains.</P>
      <P>In 1998 the Fokuanshan Monastery brought back from Thailand a
tooth believed to be one of only three Buddha teeth preserved in the
world. The tooth had been held in India since being smuggled out of
Tibet during China's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN APPRECIATIVE OF BUSH'S REAFFIRMATION OF TRA</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Republic of China Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (MOFA) reiterated its appreciation Friday of U.S. President
George W. Bush for his repeated reaffirmation that the U.S.
government will continue to abide by the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>Bush said again Friday at the prestigious Tsinghua University in
Beijing that the U.S. government will continue to abide by the TRA,
making him the first U.S. president to publicly underline the TRA
twice in a single state visit to mainland China.</P>
      <P>In his responses to questions raised by Tsinghua students after a
20-minute speech, Bush reiterated the U.S. policy that the Taiwan
issue should be resolved peacefully and that cross-Taiwan Strait
differences should be settled via peaceful dialogue.</P>
      <P>Bush said the United States has for long supported the "one
China" policy, but the U.S. government will also continue to abide by
the TRA, which requires Washington to provide Taiwan with the means
to defend itself.</P>
      <P>Foreign Affairs Minister Eugene Chien said the ROC government
hopes Washington will elevate the level of its bilateral relations
with Taipei at the same time that it improves ties with Beijing.</P>
      <P>Chien said the Bush Administration has on several occasions over
the past month expressed important and prominent messages that the
Taiwan Strait dispute should be resolved peacefully and that Bush has
mentioned during his current Asian trip that Taiwan is "one of the
good friends" of the United States.</P>
      <P>Bush's explicit goodwill toward Taiwan, including the repeated
mentioning of the TRA, makes him "very different" from his
predecessors, according to Chien.</P>
      <P>In a joint news conference with mainland Chinese President Jiang
Zemin held in Beijing Thursday, Bush said that the position of the
U.S. government on the issue of Taiwan "has not changed over the
years."</P>
      <P>"We believe in the peaceful settlement of this issue." Bush said.
He went on to say that the United States will continue to support the
TRA, adding that "we will urge that there be no provocation."</P>
      <P>Chien noted that MOFA has been closely monitoring all
developments related to Taiwan and the development of cross-strait
relations during Bush's current three-nation Asian trip, which
brought him to Beijing, the last leg of the trip, Thursday for a
two-day visit.</P>
      <P>According to MOFA officials, Washington will brief Taiwan on the
development of situations related to Bush's current Asian trip after
Bush and his entourage return to the United States.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, commenting on Bush's Friday remarks pertaining to
Taiwan, Huang Chih-fang, director-general of the Department of Public
Affairs under the Presidential Office, said the ROC Presidential
Office thinks the U.S. government's stance toward Taiwan has remained
unchanged and is fully confident in Taipei-Washington relations.</P>

    <HEADLINE>VP TOUTS INVESTMENT IN ALLIES TO HELP MITIGATE WTO IMPACT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu, northern Taiwan, Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu
said Friday that Taiwan's agricultural sector "could consider
relocating" part of their operations to Republic of China diplomatic
allies to help mitigate the impact of World Trade Organization (WTO)
accession.</P>
      <P>According to Lu, Taiwan's farmers should consider leaving their
homes and moving to allied countries if they find it difficult to
keep their heads above water amidst the increased competition that
comes as a result of WTO membership.</P>
      <P>To enable these farmers to restart their businesses abroad
smoothly, Lu said the ROC government and the allied countries'
governments could provide "joint financing" by allocating budgets for
"special programs." She did not elaborate and gave no indication as
to how this could be achieved, but she expressed hope that her "plan"
will be proposed, drafted, legislated and made available to Taiwan
farmers in six months.</P>
      <P>She also said she does not think mainland China is an ideal place
for Taiwan businesses to invest, claiming that "if the WTO's adverse
effects has an impact of 1 on a scale of 100 to Taiwan, investment on
the Chinese mainland has an impact of 10."</P>
      <P>Lu made special reference to the heated discussion on whether to
allow Taiwan's semiconductor manufacturers to relocate their 8-inch
silicon wafer fabrication plants to the mainland, saying that the
government of Hsinchu -- home to most of Taiwan's high-technology
industries -- should have in-depth brainstorming sessions with its
people over the issue.</P>
      <P>Lu was accompanied by Hsinchu Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin during
her whirlwind tour of Hsinchu County, an important agricultural
county with prominent high-technology industries and a mainly Hakka
agricultural sector.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CLOUD GATE DANCE THEATER HAS INTENSIVE OVERSEAS PROGRAM FOR  2002</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22 (CNA)
(By Lillian Lin)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Choreographer Lin Hwai-ming and his Cloud
Gate Dance Theater will have a busy year, with 41 performances in
Hong Kong, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico and Shanghai in
the coming months, a spokesman for the dance group said Friday.</P>
      <P>The Cloud Gate dancers will present Lin's "Songs of the
Wanderers" -- which premiered in 1994 -- and the 1998 creation "Moon
Water", which received critical international acclaim, the spokesman
said.</P>
      <P>With the performances abroad scheduled until the end of 2004, the
Cloud Gate will have fewer opportunities to perform at home, although
it will give a series of performances at the National Theater in
Taipei, and the cultural centers in Taichung, Tainan and Kaohsiung in
March and April, Lin said.</P>
      <P>The local performances will feature "Songs of the Wanderers" and
"Burning the Jupiter Branches."</P>
      <P>Lin said that since 1994, the Cloud Gate dancers have given 120
performances of the "Songs of the Wanderers" in 25 cities around the
globe. Considering it a long-running production, Lin said that "Songs
of the Wanderers" is like a gift from Buddha for mankind, and that as
the choreographer, he is only the "media" used to convey the heavenly
message.</P>
      <P>Lin said that he was enlightened by the progress of Prince
Siddhartha in summer of 1994 after a trip to Bodhgaya where the
Buddha attained his enlightenment under a bodhi tree. The process of
creating the 90-minute "Songs of the Wanderers" was like a "spiritual
journey," he added.</P>
      <P>As one of the most renowned choreographers in Asia, Lin is
talented in blending traditional Chinese theater elements with
Western dance techniques.</P>
      <P>The Cloud Gate founder and artistic director has also won
international acclaim because he is able to incorporate Chinese
philosophy with dancers' movements in his productions such as "Moon
Water," a poetic rendition of the Taoist philosophy of real vs.
unreal, "Nine Songs," a production inspired by ancient ritual verses,
and the epic dance saga "Portrait of the Families," telling the
Taiwanese experience in the past century.</P>
      <P>Lin said that the Cloud Gate took an unconventional road when it
was founded in 1973. Without any support from the government at the
beginning, the group still managed to present new repertoires every
year. The group almost succumbed to financial crisis in the late
1980s when it was unable to tour. It was only able to resume
performing in the 1990s when the government decided to provide
subsidies.</P>
      <P>The 55-year-old choreographer said that the audience will find
the group becoming ever more mature in its performances and added
that he has a deeper appreciation every time he watches his dancers
performing "Songs of the Wanderers."</P>

    <HEADLINE>SCHOLARS CALL FOR GOVERNMENT ACTIONS TO COOL LOTTO FEVER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of scholars and consumer rights
activists urged relevant government agencies Friday to take actions
to cool down the prevailing lottery mania on the island.</P>
      <P>They made the appeal at a seminar sponsored by the ROC Consumers
Foundation to discuss the impact on local society of the recently
launched public welfare computerized lottery.</P>
      <P>Yu Ming-kuo, chairman of the Consumers Foundation, said he
himself doesn't oppose the issue of public interest lottery. "But we
should improve relevant rules of the game to prevent it from letting
the poor become even more impoverished while creating only a few
"nauveau riches."</P>
      <P>Hsu Wen-ching, chief executive of the Media Watch Foundation,
said since the lottery bears the words "public welfare," all of the
income from the ticket sales should be contributed to social welfare
programs. "No profit-making actions should be allowed in the deal,"
she asserted.</P>
      <P>Hsu went on to say that local media truly have given too much
coverage to lottery-related events, with some newspapers and
magazines even having opened special columns to provide
information on the lottery.</P>
      <P>"I hope the Government Information Office (GIO) can immediately
demand news organizations that have given improper reports on
lottery events to make corrections," Hsu said, adding that the
government should also review whether the lottery should be
continued or scrapped.</P>
      <P>Wu Chung-chi, honorary chairman of the Consumers Foundation,
said he is convinced that the deterioration of uneven wealth
distribution has helped fuel the current lottery fever.</P>
      <P>"My observation is that lottery ticket sales will continue to
increase in the future and would eventually affect domestic
production and consumer spending," Wu said. "I personally doesn't
support suspension of the lottery, but I think that the frequency of
lottery draw should be reduced."</P>
      <P>Yu Ying-feu, convener of the Consumers Foundation's media
commission, said current law bans advertisements (ads) of any
gambling games. He expressed doubts about the legality of news media
carrying lottery-related ads.</P>
      <P>In his view, Yu said although the so-called "public welfare"
lottery has allowed both the government and ticket dealers to make
quick bucks, it has also created many social problems. He said all
proceeds from ticket sales should be used to finance public interest
programs and that the general public should closely supervise the
flow of lottery profits.</P>
      <P>In response, Cha Tai-ming, a GIO section chief, said news media
are obligated to report on lottery-related news events.
"Nevertheless, they should refrain from reporting relevant stories in
a sensational style or manner."</P>
      <P>Cha said since the new lottery is designed for collecting funds
for social welfare programs, local news media are eligible to
carry relevant ads. "As for the lottery future development, it
needs extensive discussion by various social quarters."</P>
      <P>Huang Tien-mu, a division chief with the Bureau of Monetary
Affairs, said the present version of lottery was launched after more
than 10 years of research and with the approval of the Legislative
Yuan. "Its legality and legitimacy are unquestionable," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Huang added that the bureau has ordered Taipeibank, which is
authorized to operate the new lottery, to strengthen publicity of
the "welfare" purposes of the lottery and make all necessary
improvements based on public opinion to minimize adverse impact on
society and economy.</P>
      <P>Yang Jui-tung, a Taipeibank manager, said it's still premature
to judge the impact of the lottery since only nine issues have so
far been drawn. "We need more time to evaluate its various
effects before making a final decision on its fate."</P>
      <P>Since the lottery was launched on Jan. 17, lotto fever has
taken the island by storm. Total ticket sales have exceeded NT$15
billion so far.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LAWMAKERS OPPOSE HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUM HIKE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of ruling Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) lawmakers voiced opposition Friday to a Department of
Health (DOH) plan to raise the premium rate for the National Health
Insurance Program (NHIP).</P>
      <P>The DPP legislators, including Chang Ching-fang, Lin Chin-hsing,
Chen Chung-hsin and You Ching, said the DOH should first resolve the
so-called "pharmaceutical prices black hole" issue before
considering raising the insurance premium rate.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers claimed that large domestic hospitals have usually
made big profits from differences in pharmaceutical prices set by
the DOH's National Health Insurance Bureau and pharmaceutical makers.</P>
      <P>Chang said local hospitals usually apply for the bureau's
payments for pharmaceuticals given to the patients based
on the officially set prices. In reality, he said, those hospitals
usually need not pay that much to drug makers.</P>
      <P>In his estimate, Chang said, the gap can reach NT$20 billion
annually. "Due to the bureau's poor management, the phenomenon has
become rampant. It like a 'black hole' in the bureau's
operations," he claimed.</P>
      <P>Chang said the DOH should first ask the insurance bureau to
improve the situation before considering any premium rate hike. He
said the DPP legislative caucus has asked DOH Administrator Lee
Ming-liang to report on the issue next Monday.</P>
      <P>The DOH said earlier this month it plans to raise the health
insurance premium rate from current 4.25 percent to 4.91 percent
from July 1 this year to help make its ends meet. The DOH said the
insurance bureau has incurred heavy deficits due in part to low fees
and local governments' failure to pay premiums in accordance with
official regulations.</P>

      <P>Chen also said the prize, organized by the Ministry of the
Interior for the fifth time this year, is aimed to hold the winners
up as examples for other mentally and physically challenged
individuals, to inspire them to be self-reliant.</P>
      <P>Although the welfare of the mentally and physically challenged is
high on the government's agenda, Chen said, the government is
"limited in its means of protecting the county's mentally and
physically challenged" and he called the private sector to do its
part in improving the living standards of the mentally and physically
challenged.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BRACES FOR MAINLAND BAN ON EXPORTS OF FISHERMEN (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>As Taiwan rapidly returns to its usual
hustle and bustle after the Chinese New Year holiday last week,
perhaps only in one area -- the fishing industry -- has the hope for
a better year yet to be made certain.</P>
      <P>Recently at the port of Patoutzu, located in northern Taiwan's
Keelung Harbor, Captain Chiu Jung, who had just returned from fishing
off Tainan County for two months, was caught off-guard when he
learned that mainland China has apparently decided to impose a ban on
allowing mainland fishermen to work aboard Taiwanese vessels.</P>
      <P>On his 180-ton ship, only Chiu and the chief engineer are from
Taiwan, while there are eight mainland fishermen, including first
mate Lin Xuezai from Pingtan County in Fujian Province.</P>
      <P>The 58-year-old captain knitted his brows when he heard the news,
asking: "What are we going to do without the mainland fishermen? All
we'll be able to do is moor the boat."</P>
      <P>Taiwan fishing boats rely heavily on mainland fishermen, mainly
because they share the same language and culture and have similar
living habits, in addition to the fact they are cheaper to employ and
are more willing to endure hardship than their Taiwan counterparts.</P>
      <P>Chiu, who began fishing at a young age, knows best. "Young people
from Taiwan couldn't take the hardship. Just not being able to shower
for one or two weeks while working at sea would scare them away," he
claimed.</P>
      <P>For mainland fisherman Lin, who was promoted to first mate a
decade ago because of his hard work and diligence, the experience of
working with Taiwan fishermen for more than 10 years has been a
worthwhile one.</P>
      <P>Lin spent 80,000 renminbi (around US$9,732.36) to build a new
two-story home two years ago in Pingtang for his wife and three
children. He now has savings of more than 20,000 renminbi (around
US$2,433.09). It is stories like Lin's that have attracted more
fishermen from the mainland to follow suit.</P>
      <P>Taiwan shipowners began to hire foreign fishermen to relieve a
shortage of local fishermen about two decades ago. But they gradually
shifted to mainland fishermen because of the convenience of similar
language and culture in the early 1990s after the Republic of China
government gave the green light to employing mainland fishermen under
special regulations, as the ROC still bans mainland laborers from
working in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>But the almost decade-long practice, which is deemed beneficial
to both sides of the Taiwan Strait, is now in jeopardy, as Beijing's
Xinhua News Agency reported recently that six mainland official
agencies had annonced the ban on the export of mainland fisherman to
Taiwan from Feb. 1, saying that the measure was taken because the
"legal rights" of mainland fishermen have been abused and that no
effective solutions are in sight.</P>
      <P>The measure calls for the suspension of employment of all
mainland fishermen working on Taiwanese vessels, their registration
with related mainland authorities and their return to the mainland as
soon as their contracts with Taiwan ship owners expire.</P>
      <P>The ban is expected to have the greatest effect on Taiwan's
coastal fishing operations, as contracts for mainland fishermen in
this area are usually one year in duration, while contracts for
mainland fishermen engaged in deep-sea operations are usually between
two and three years in length.</P>
      <P>Mainland China allegedly implemented the ban because of unfair
treatment received by mainland fishermen here. Mainland fishermen are
not allowed to come ashore in Taiwan and have to stay in floating
hostels anchored near the island. The hostels are often converted
from disused or dilapidated fishing vessels. When Taiwan ships go out
fishing, they come alongside these hostels to take on crew. When the
ships return, they first drop off the mainland fishermen at the
hostels before discharging their catches and anchoring at port.</P>
      <P>The practice has long been criticized because the mainlanders are
forced to stay in cramped quarters, unable to come ashore like their
counterparts from Southeast Asian nations, except during typhoons or
other emergencies.

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN BRACES FOR MAINLAND CHINA BAN ON EXPORTS OF FISHERMEN (II)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>To improve the living conditions of the mainland fishermen, the
Department of Fisheries Administration under the
Cabinet-level Council of Agriculture (COA) has started the
construction of fishermen's hostels in Suao, Keelung, Taichung and
Hsinchu since last year, with the one in Suao, northeastern Taiwan,
expected to be completed in a few months.</P>
      <P>The mainland clamped the ban ostensibly to protect the "legal
rights" of the mainland fishermen, citing the cases of clashes,
scuffles and even the murder of mainland fishermen by a Taiwan
captain in 1999 while working in Taiwan ships, saying that the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait have yet to establish an effective
communication channel, so that problems cannot be resolved in a
timely and appropriate manner.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Department of Fisheries Administration
under the COA show that Taiwan fishing boat operators employ between
25,000 and 30,000 mainland fishermen each year, while also employing
between 5,000 and 10,000 fishermen of other nationalities on
average.</P>
      <P>Fishery officials estimate that mainland China earns more than
US$144 million in foreign exchange annually from this source, based
on the calculation that each mainland fisherman gets paid about
US$300 a month.</P>
      <P>The officials said that currently, the ratio of mainland or
foreign fishermen to local fisherman is about three to one, meaning
that for every four crew members aboard a Taiwan fishing vessel, only
one is from Taiwan.</P>
      <P>This ratio demonstrates that Taiwan relies heavily on mainland
fishermen to relieve its serious shortage of hands and also helps
improve the economy of mainland fishermen, which the officials said
is mutually beneficial to both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>What, then, is Beijing really grinding at by imposing a ban in a
situation that seems to be mutually beneficial? Some have speculated
that the ban is actually a double-dealing strategy to try to win
salary raises and fringe benefits for the mainland fishermen.</P>
      <P>This speculation seems to be borne out by the visit of a mainland
delegation of brokers for mainland fishermen in December to sound out
the possibility of raising salaries. The delegation reportedly called
on local brokerages and heads of deep-sea fishing companies and told
them that if monthly salary could be increased by US$100, then
everything would be fine.</P>
      <P>However, the request was flatly refused, with local owners saying
that they would not budge because they already raised the pay for
deep-sea fishermen just last year.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the ban, an editorial in the mass-circulation
United Daily News said that Fujian Province is geographically near
Taiwan and shares the same religious beliefs, while intermarriages
between Taiwan fishermen and mainland brides are fairly common and
friends and relatives of the mainland brides are often hired to work
on Taiwan ships.</P>
      <P>The editorial said that it may not be easy for the mainland to
implement the ban, saying that the mainland labor force has
assimilated into Taiwan's fishing sector "naturally," taking over the
fishing and other chores such as gear maintenance.</P>
      <P>They also pointed out that as mainland officials cannot even ban
its people from sneaking into Taiwan and Japan illegally, they are
unlikely to be able to stop its fishermen from working in Taiwan
ships.</P>
      <P>If the ban is implemented, they said unemployment in Fujian
Province will increase, while its foreign exchange revenues will
suffer. The ban will not stop the busy traffic of mainland fishermen
coming to Taiwan ships, but will only aggravate the working
conditions of illegal mainland fishermen, they continued.</P>
      <P>They said that the cheap labor available in the mainland,
together with the advantages of Taiwan's technology, capital and
marketing, is complementary to the fisheries on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait, adding that the cross-strait fishery industry has
developed to the point where nothing can stop the merging process and
that any attempt to drive a wedge between the two sides will only
prove futile.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22   (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Faced with the impact of the ban, fishery officials said that
they will diversify the source of fisherman on Taiwan boats by
speeding up the process of introducing more foreign fishermen from
Southeast Asian countries, such as Vietnam, Indonesia and the
Philippines on the one hand, while the Department of Fisheries said
it will try to lure local people to go to sea on the other.</P>
      <P>Department officials said they will soon unveil a plan to
subsidize local fishermen NT$10,000 (US$284.9) a month for six months
to work on Taiwan fishing boats. Initially, the incentive project
hopes to train 200 local people to work on Taiwan fishing ships.</P>
      <P>A local fishermen's group responded by saying that this may only
prove to be a short-term solution. Kuo Sheng-wen, president of a
Pingtung association to promote fishermen's rights, said that the
difficulty in recruiting local fishermen is that they cannot endure
the hardships at sea, while the subsidy measure will be prone to
fraud and not feasible.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, reports said that there are new cooperation models
being set up since the ban, with brokers on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait arranging for mainland fishing boats to ferry mainland
fishermen to the high seas where they can be hired by Taiwan ships
for short-term fishing operations.</P>
      <P>Coast Guard Administration officials have reported that a score
of mainland fishermen were arrested off the coast of Taitung County
earlier this week in just such an operation.</P>
      <P>Urging local Shipowners not to act rashly, fishery associations
said that this model of "cooperation at sea" is unprecedented and
they expressed worry that the mainland fishermen employed in this way
will have no protection at all, while resolution of disputes will
become even more complex.</P>

      <P>The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) has
decided to shorten the screening time for foreign fishermen to work
on Taiwan fishing boats by one day following mainland China's recent
decision to ban its fisherman from working on Taiwan vessels.</P>
      <P>As Taiwan ships rely heavily on mainland fishermen, Beijing's
move has caught many ship owners in Taiwan off guard. The ROC
government is now trying to assist local companies by encouraging
them to find workers from other countries to fill in for those that
would have come from mainland China.</P>
      <P>The CLA said that according to foreign labor regulations, the
introduction of foreign laborers must not come at the expense of
local laborers. The regulations further state that before applying
for foreign laborers, ship owners should first place ads for three
days to recruit people, and after a 14-day recruiting period, they
can begin the application process with the relevant government
agencies to hire the workers that they have selected.</P>
      <P>The screening time for the applications is usually five day, but
the CLA has decided to reduce this to four days.</P>
      <P>The CLA is also suggesting that the shipping industry could
introduce foreign fishermen in groups through the Council of

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 22 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy is predicted to grow 2.29
percent this year, the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and
Statistics (DGBAS) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>A previous DGBAS economic forecast made in November last year
estimated that the gross domestic product would reach 2.23 percent in
2002 after suffering its first-ever decline in 2001.</P>
      <P>According to government statistics, the economy contracted by
1.91 percent last year, better than the negative 2.68 percent
originally predicted.</P>
      <P>DGBAS head Lin Chuan said that private sector investment remains
the key to economic growth.</P>
      <P>He noted that although the government spent an additional NT$60
billion (US$1.7 billion) in public infrastructure development last
year, private sector investments underwent a NT$420 billion (US$12
billion) year-on-year plunge.</P>
      <P>For Taiwan's economy to recover, the investment environment would
need to be improved so that private investments can return to their
previous level and work together with the government's extra public
spending to good effect, he added.</P>
      <P>According to the DGBAS, because Taiwan's unemployment problems
are expected to remain difficult to overcome in the short term,
private sector spending will remain restricted, with annual growth in
private sector spending likely to rebound slightly this year to 2.58
percent, from last year's 1.37 percent.</P>
      <P>The DGBAS noted that major countries have already lowered their
interest rates, adopted tax cuts or increased public spending to
stimulate the economy, but recovery has been weak despite being
stable.</P>
      <P>Domestically, the DGBAS continued, the stock market has bottomed
out, and the decline in industrial production has been arrested.</P>
      <P>Together with a more relaxed currency policy and
better-than-expected private sector spending, the economic growth
rate for the fourth quarter of 2001 was able to reach negative 1.87
percent, 0.81 percentage points higher than the original prediction
of negative 2.68 percent, DGBAS added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>9.2 PERCENT OF TAIWANESE SUPPORT `ONE COUNTRY, TWO SYSTEMS': POLL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Only 9.2 percent of the respondents to a
recent poll conducted by Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) said
that they support Beijing's "one country, two systems" formula, 69.2
percent opposed and the remaining were indifferent to the idea.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, which routinely polls the population on the
issue, this figure was the lowest ever recorded since the Democratic
Progressive Party administration took over the reins of government in
May 2000.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman John C.C. Deng said that this means there is
"no market" for the formula in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Deng said that a resumption of cross-Taiwan Strait dialogue and
the peaceful resolution of differences are Taiwan's long-standing
positions. He added that Taiwan hopes Beijing will respond to the
island's various suggestions positively even as it improves relations
with Washington.</P>
      <P>According to the MAC, the percentage of respondents who supported
"one country, two systems" was 12.2 percent in May 2000, 16.1 percent

    <HEADLINE>CONSUMER CONFIDENCE INDEX RISES FOR THIRD CONSECUTIVE MONTH</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Edward Chen)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan consumer confidence index in
February reached 75.95 points, a level equaling that of July, 2000,
the Taiwan Research Institute (TRI) announced Friday.</P>
      <P>A TRI official said that Taiwan's political situation has
gradually stabilized since the new Legislative Yuan was inaugurated
Feb. 1, while relations between the Executive Yuan and the
Legislative Yuan and the mayoral elections in Taipei and Kaohsiung
will be two key factors affecting Taiwan's political situation in the
future.</P>
      <P>He said that the international economic situation has also
improved. According to a survey conducted by MasterCard International
Group in December, 2001, the Asian consumer confidence index in
general was also on rise, especially in mainland China, with an index
of 84.8 compared with 46.2 in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>All these signs, he went on, indicate that consumer confidence in
Taiwan is increasing.</P>
      <P>The TRI recommended that the government concentrate its efforts
on economic construction and development in the coming ten months in
the lead-up to the year-end Taipei and Kaohsiung mayoral elections.</P>
      <P>The statistics also show that the stock investors' confidence
index has reached a level similar to that prior to the presidential
election of March 18, 2000.</P>
      <P>The index soared to 97.40 points, or an increase of 0.7 points
over the previous month, representing an increase of 23.1 points over
the previous year's level, the TRI said.</P>

    <HEADLINE>'MINI THREE LINKS' TARGET OF CRITICISM AT SEMINAR (1)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Kinmen public opinion leaders and local
government officials and business executives were critical of the
"mini three links" at a symposium Friday, blaming the government's
conservative policy which they said has failed to help improve the
island's economy.</P>
      <P>Speaking at the gathering held by a Control Yuan assessment task
force to assess the "mini three links," which have been in effect for
just over a year, New Party lawmaker Wu Cheng-tian said that the
program has been superficial and was well below high public
expectations for economic prosperity because of the conservative
mindset of the government.</P>
      <P>According to Wu, Kinmen's economy has been hard hit by rising
unemployment as a result of the military's streamlining reform. But
he added that the limiting measures made by the Mainland Affairs
Council (MAC) have reduced the program so that it is mostly symbolic.
The "mini three links" have not substantially benefit the island's
economy, which he said used to depend on the large number of troops
station there.</P>
      <P>Should the government allow people and cargo from Taiwan to
freely proceed to mainland China via Kinmen, Wu said, the frontline
island would replace Hong Kong as a major transshipment hub of the
indirect trade between Taiwan proper and mainland China.</P>
      <P>That would also improve Kinmen's economy and help Taiwan
businessmen operating in the mainland save money and travel time,
because in Xiamen alone, a port city in mainland China's Fujian
province opposite Kinmen, there are about 6,600 Taiwan-funded
companies, he added.</P>
      <P>Now that the central government is strapped with serious
financial burdens, Wu said the government should adopt an open-door
policy to help Kinmen improve its economy.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 1, 2001, the MAC unilaterally announced the establishment
of the direct trade and transport links between Taiwan-controlled
Kinmen and Matsu islands with Xiamen and Fuzhou ports in Fujian
province as a goodwill gesture toward mainland China and as a means
of helping revive the economies on the two frontline islands.</P>
      <P>But the effect of the so-called "mini three links" has been
limited due to the lack of cooperation from the mainland.</P>
      <P>Hsu Yu-chao, deputy speaker of the Kinmen County Council, bluntly
called the "mini three links" a failure, accusing executive
government agencies of not consulting with local public opinion
leaders in advance.</P>
      <P>Hsu said nearly 10,000 passengers have headed from Kinmen for
mainland China over the past year and have spent at least NT$100
million (US$2.85 million) in the process. But only 900 mainland
Chinese citizens, mostly elderly people born in Kinmen, have travel
to Kinmen with the county government footing the bill, Hsu noted,
warning that Kinmen's economy may be dragged down in the long term.</P>
      <P>In addition, Hsu claimed that the MAC's rule that Taiwan
residents must have their households registered on Kinmen for at
least six months before they can directly travel to mainland China is
superfluous. The measure has only created a large "ghost population"
on Kinmen, while criminal elements and gangsters may sail freely
between the two sides.

    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  22  (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Chu Chao-liang, public prosecutor-general of the Kinmen District
Prosecutors' Office, said the public is confused and that language
used by the government has led them to believe that petty trade on
the beaches is legal. He said easing the current rules is the
solution to the problem. This, he said, will help introduce legal
trading practices.</P>
      <P>C. M. Hsu, chairman of the Kinmen Chamber of Commerce, complained
that the "mini three links" are like a balloon only for display to
foreigners, which has not helped the island a bit. He proposed
leaving the door open for imports from mainland China and imposing no
customs duties to regulate the trade between the two sides.</P>
      <P>Echoing Hsu's view, Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng favored
zero customs tariff for mainland Chinese products and advocated
developing Kinmen into a cross-Taiwan Strait postal exchange center.
He urged the government to adopt an open-door policy to meet public
demand.</P>
      <P>MAC Vice Chairman John Teng said the council will submit a
comprehensive assessment report on the "mini three links" to the
Control Yuan by the end of this month after compiling suggestions
from all parties. Despite widespread criticism from the public, he
praised the program and pointed out that Kinmen and Matsu residents
now can travel safely and legally to mainland China under the
framework of the links.</P>
      <P>C. L. Lin, head of the Control Yuan task force, said that the
differing views showed that there is a huge gap between policy and
practice. He said his ad hoc group will work out a report based on
all the suggestions aired in the meeting to serve as references for
the government and seek solutions to the exiting problems.</P>

 to attend the summit, which is being organized by the U.S.-ROC
 (Taiwan) Business Council.</P>
      <P>Speculation in local reports is that discussions might focus on
 arms sales procedures and Taiwan's defense needs in the years ahead.</P>

    <HEADLINE> CABINET URGED TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATIONS WITH DPP CAUCUS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet should strengthen contacts and
 communications with the ruling Democratic Progressive Party's (DPP's)
 legislative caucus to prevent rifts within the current governing
 team, a DPP heavyweight said Saturday.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Wang Tuoh made the suggestion after several
 DPP lawmakers publicly on Friday criticized the Bureau of National
 Health Insurance's plan to hike premiums from July.</P>
      <P>Wang said the Cabinet should learn a lesson from the event. In
 the future, he said, the Cabinet should consult with the DPP
 legislative caucus before it makes any major policy adjustments to
 avoid giving the impression that the ruling team is divided over
 major policy issues.</P>
      <P>The veteran lawmaker said the current communication mechanism
 between the Cabinet and the DPP legislative caucus should be expanded
 to include members of the DPP's Central Policy Coordination
 Commission. "And the team should meet regularly and frequently to
 facilitate policy consultations and forge intraparty consensus," he
 added.</P>
      <P>At present, Wang himself and Executive Yuan Secretary-General Lee
 Ying-yuan are responsible for communications between the DPP caucus
 and the Cabinet. The DPP is now the largest party in the Legislative
 Yuan, controlling 87 seats in the 225-member chamber.</P>
      <P>A group of DPP lawmakers, including Lin Chin-hsing, Chang
 Ching-fang, You Ching, Chen Sheng-hung and Chen Chung-hsin, voiced
 their strong opposition to the health insurance bureau's plan to
 raise premium rates for full-time workers from the current level of
 4.25 percent of their monthly salary to 4.91 percent by July. If the
 plan is approved by the Legislature, workers will have to pay between
 NT$20 and NT$67 more in health fees each month.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers said the bureau should do more to root out
 inefficiency in the nation's healthcare system before coming up with
 any proposals to hike insurance premiums. They said many factors have
 contributed to inefficiency in the healthcare system, including
 unnecessary medical examinations and prescriptions as well as billing
 fraud.</P>
      <P>Lin claimed that it has become a common practice for local
 hospitals and clinics, including state-run facilities, to report
 medical expenses that are far higher than the actual amount spent.
 "The insurance bureau should take immediate steps to stop such
 practices in order to save medical resources," he added.</P>
      <P>Lee Ming-liang, administrator of the Department of Health, which
 administers the health insurance bureau, will meet with DPP
 legislative caucus members Monday to discuss the proposed rate hike
 issue.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUSH HAS ABANDONED THREE JOINT COMMUNIQUES WITH BEIJING: ROC VP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
 said Saturday that U.S. President George W. Bush has abandoned the
 three U.S. joint communiques with mainland China through his actions.</P>
      <P>Lu said at a seminar on the future of Taiwan in the wake of the
 upcoming 30th anniversary of the Shanghai Communique that Bush's
 "prudent, precise and consistent" statements on the Taiwan issue as
 well as his refusal to reiterate the three communiques during his
 just-concluded visit to Beijing and his vocal support of Washington's
 support for the Taiwan Relations Act on mainland soil are all worthy
 of respect.</P>
      <P>She said she is "glad" that Bush expended effort trying to
 maintain Taiwan's dignity and security without harming Taiwan's
 interests.</P>
      <P>Lu pointed out that to Beijing's disappointment, Bush stressed
 during his visit in mainland China his hope for a "peaceful
 resolution" to the Taiwan issue instead of advocating "peaceful
 reunification" between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The vice president added that if Bush can use his actions to
 abandon the three communiques, maybe Taiwan can also abandon its
 domestic disputes on the independence-versus-unification issue and
 let go of the "burden" of Beijing's "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>At the same seminar, an official of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
 Foundation (SEF) said that the three communiques between Beijing and
 Washington have already become relatively "empty" words over the
 years.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Andes Yen said that Taiwan should
 consider whether it should next work toward the goal of abolishing
 the three communiques.</P>
      <P>However, he warned that a risk that should be assessed is whether
 a replacement to the three communiques might be even more damaging to
 Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Joanne J.L. Chang, a research fellow at Academia
 Sinica's Institute of European and American Studies, said that the
 three communiques are a product of the Cold War era.</P>
      <P>She said that the United States had previously assumed that
 making concessions on its Taiwan policy could lead to progress in
 Taipei-Beijing relations, but events after former U.S. President Bill
 Clinton announced his "three noes" policy have demonstrated that
 Beijing's policies toward Taiwan have not changed because of those
 concessions.</P>
      <P>Chang added that Bush's unambiguous statements in support of
 Taiwan can be expected to lead other nations in a similar change in
 attitude in favor of the island.</P>

 the request of the Senate's Finance Committee and that a report on
 the matter will be sent to the committee before Oct. 17 this year.</P>
      <P>In a letter to the ITC, the Senate's Finance Committee said that
 the United States is excluded from some trade agreements signed among
 the world's major trade nations that are beneficial only to the
 development of the signatories' economies.</P>
      <P>The letter continued that this does harm to U.S. efforts in
 expanding trade and goes against U.S. interests.</P>
      <P>The Finance Committee said that it is aware that Taiwan's
 successful admission into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will
 strengthen Taiwan's role in the multilateral trade system.</P>
      <P>In its probe, the ITC said it will also make an evaluation on the
 removal of trade obstacles between the two countries according to

 Secretary-General Lin Fong-cheng said Saturday that his party will
 cooperate with the People First Party (PFP) to field a candidate for
 the mayoral election in Kaohsiung this year.</P>
      <P>Lin told reporters that among the most important tasks for his

 Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>Since Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT has indicated his
 intention of seeking re-election, Lin said that the party plans to
 cooperate with the PFP to find a qualified candidate for the
 Kaohsiung mayorship.</P>
      <P>He said that if the PFP has any good possible candidates for the

      <P>Taiwan's online shopping market continued
 to expand over the past few years, experiencing an average annual
 growth rate of 124 percent between 1997 and 2001, according to a
 report earlier this year by the Marketing Information Center (MIC)
 of the Institute of Information Industry (III).</P>
      <P>The survey indicated that Taiwan's online shopping market totaled
 NT$8.98 billion in value in 2001, up from only NT$360 million in
 1997. The market increased to NT$631 million for 1998, and to NT$1.63
 billion for 1999.</P>
      <P>Although the dot.com business sector as a whole experienced a
 great setback during the past two years, e-business continued to grow
 in Taiwan. In 2000, the online shopping market value amounted to
 NT$3.95 billion, growing 142 percent over the previous year's level,
 before increasing by 127 percent for a total value of NT$8.98 billion
 for 2001, according to the survey.</P>

 communications products, consumer electronic products, cosmetics and
 books enjoyed good business.</P>
      <P>While the average amount spent per person engaged in online
 shopping was NT$4,242 for the whole year last year, a heavy buyer
 with an annual income averaging NT$385,000 could spend over

    <HEADLINE>GOV'T URGED NOT TO OVERLY SIMPLIFY BUSH'S MESSAGE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Opposition Kuomintang (KMT) Legislator
 John Chang, also a former minister of foreign affairs, said Saturday
 that the government should not overly simplify the message given by
 U.S. President George W. Bush during his just-concluded Asia tour.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a seminar on the possible impact of Bush's Asia
 tour, which took him to Japan, South Korea and mainland China, Chang
 said Bush's clear statement of support for Taiwan during his
 three-nation visit does not mean any changes in fundamental U.S.
 policy on the Taiwan Strait issue.</P>
      <P>Noting that Bush's Feb. 21-22 mainland China visit was primarily
 aimed at mending rifts and improving relations with Beijing, Chang
 said the basic U.S. policy of "one China, cross-strait dialogue, and
 maintaining the status quo" between the two sides of the Taiwan
 Strait has remained intact.</P>
      <P>"Bush's expression might be more straightforward than his
 predecessors, such as Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, the basic tone
 of U.S. policy toward Taiwan remains unchanged," Chang stressed.</P>
      <P>During his Asia tour, Bush had on many occasions reaffirmed U.S.
 commitments to Taiwan, including affirming explicit support for the
 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) which says America should help Taiwan
 defend herself if provoked.</P>
      <P>On Friday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Eugene Chien issued a
 statement praising Bush for his clear support for Taiwan. "This is
 the first time over the past 20 years or so that an American
 president has publicly mentioned while visiting mainland China that
 the United States should abide by the TRA," Chien said after
 Bush's speech at Tsinghua University in Beijing earlier in the
 day.</P>
      <P>However, Chang reminded senior officials of the current
 Democratic Progressive Party government that as the United
 States has not changed its basic principles for handling Taiwan
 Strait issues, Taiwan should always maintain independence and
 self-reliance in its engagements with America.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, National Taiwan University
 professor Ming Chu-cheng said Taiwan issue was not a main focus
 of Bush's Asia trip. "Bush mainly intended to seek Asian support for
 his anti-terrorism and anti-'axis of evil' campaign," he noted.</P>
      <P>In his view, Ming said although Bush managed to reach consensus
 with mainland China on anti-terrorism issue, he failed to come to
 terms with Beijing learders on many other topics, including the
 so-called Taiwan issue.</P>
      <P>"The future development of Taipei-Washington-Beijing relations
 needs further observation and scrutiny," Ming added.</P>

    <HEADLINE>ENVIRONMENT CHIEF DEFENDS DECISION IN INCINERATOR BIDDING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's top environmental protection
 official said Saturday that the entire bidding process for the
 construction of an incinerator in Ilan County was transparent and
 legal despite doubts of impropriety raised by an opposition lawmaker.</P>
      <P>Hau Lung-bin, head of the Environmental Protection Administration
 (EPA), said that he had to invoke a special clause in the public
 procurement law to allow the blacklisted Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
 to submit a tender because failure to do so would have forced the
 government to negotiate with a single local company over the
 already-delayed project.</P>
      <P>The Japan-based company, which eventually won the bid for the
 NT$2.2 billion (US$62.7 million) incinerator project, was banned last
 Dec. 7 for a year by the Public Construction Commission from taking
 part in any bidding for public projects in Taiwan after refusing to
 examine and repair a leak in a natural gas storage tank it built for
 the state-run Chinese Petroleum Corp.</P>
      <P>Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has since agreed to repair the leak.</P>
      <P>Hau said that he made the decision to include Mitsubishi in the
 bidding in the interest of promoting competition, maintaining the
 principle of fairness in public procurement and resolving the garbage
 issue in Ilan.</P>
      <P>EPA officials said that Hau's decision saved the country
 approximately NT$300 million (US$8.5 million) because the local
 company bidding for the same project insisted on a higher price.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, bidding for the project failed three times
 prior to Mitsubishi's participation because only one company tendered
 a bid in each instance. After the third bidding, the EPA tried
 without success to negotiate with a local company for an acceptable
 price.</P>
      <P>Earlier, opposition People First Party legislator Hsieh
 Chang-chieh said the special clause of the public procurement law
 invoked by Hau can only be used by a senior Cabinet official under
 special circumstances such as those involving patented technology,
 but other incinerator projects in Taiwan have proven that several
 local companies are capable of doing the construction work as well.</P>
      <P>Hsieh said that Hau's explanation for allowing Mitsubishi Heavy
 Industries to participate in the bidding without the approval of the
 Public Construction Commission was "difficult to accept" and appeared
 to be merely an excuse to open a "backdoor" for the company.</P>
      <P>According to the EPA, it had first sought the counsel of the
 commission but received a response suggesting that the decision
 should be made by the EPA chief.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Buddha's phalanx sarira, the only
 phalanx relic of Sakyamuni Buddha found in the world, was brought to
 Taipei from Xian, Shaanxi Province, Saturday aboard a chartered
 Dragonair plane via Hong Kong.</P>
      <P>Shortly after its arrival at Chiang Kai-shek International
 Airport, it was escorted to the domed stadium of National Taiwan
 University in downtown Taipei under tight security for display
 through Feb. 26.</P>
      <P>Tens of thousands of Buddhist followers greeted the phalanx
 sarira along the streets when the decorated car taking it reached
 downtown Taipei.</P>
      <P>The phalanx sarira had been kept at Xian's Famen Temple for more
 than 1,000 years without outside knowledge until the collapsed temple
 was unearthed in 1987.</P>
      <P>It was the second time that the Famen Temple has allowed
 the foreign exhibition of the phalanx sarira. In 1996, it was
 exhibited in Thailand.</P>
      <P>Some 400 Buddhist followers, led by Foguangshan Monastery founder
 Master Hsing Yun, escorted the phalanx sarira to Taiwan from Xian by
 two chartered planes. They included Kuomintang Vice Chairman Wu
 Po-hsiung and former Justice Minister Liao Cheng-hao.</P>
      <P>Several mainland Chinese religious leaders and officials in
 charge of religious affairs also came to Taiwan together with the
 relic which will also be displayed in Sanhsia, Taipei County,
 Taichung, Nantou County and Kaohsiung before being sent back to the
 Famen Temple March 31.</P>
      <P>Master Hsing Yun said that he believes the exhibition of the
 phalanx sarira in Taiwan will help purify human hearts, cleanse
 social morals and bring peace to the Taiwan Strait. He described it

    <TEXT>
      <P>A visit by Minister of National Defense
 Tang Yiau-ming to the United States to attend a U.S.-Taiwan defense
 industry summit hinges on whether the U.S. government will grant Tang
 a visa, a Ministry of National Defense (MND) official said Saturday.</P>
      <P>The Republic of China's defense head confirmed Friday that he has
 received an invitation to attend the summit meeting scheduled for
 March 10-12 in St. Petersburg, Florida.</P>
      <P>"Tang would like to attend the meeting, but it remains unclear
 whether the U.S. government will issue Tang a visa," said the MND
 official who preferred to remain anonymous.</P>
      <P>Since the United States switched diplomatic recognition from
 Taipei to Beijing in 1979, only one ROC defense minister has managed
 to set foot on U.S. soil during his term in office, namely Tang's
 predecessor Wu Shih-wen, who made a transit stop in New York late
 last year on his way home after a visit to Central America.</P>
      <P>Basically, the MND official said, Tang looks forward to attending
 any international meeting that enables him to explain the ROC's
 defense policy, promote international defense technology exchanges,
 and contribute to peace, stability and security in the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>According to the official, both the organizers of the meeting and
 relevant ROC government agencies are talking with U.S. authorities
 about issues regarding a visa for Tang.</P>
      <P>The U.S. State Department has so far declined to comment on
 whether it will issue Tang a visa. A State Department official said
 Friday that if Tang files a visa application, the department will
 handle the issue based on U.S. laws and policy considerations.</P>
      <P>If Tang can secure a visa to attend the meeting, political
 observers said, it would mark a substantial breakthrough in
 Taiwan-U.S. relations.</P>
      <P>Foreign wire service reports said the upcoming defense meeting is
 being organized by the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council. Major U.S.
 defense contractors, including Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon,
 reportedly will co-sponsored the conference. U.S. State Department
 and Pentagon officials in charge of Asia-Pacific and Taiwan-related
 affairs have been invited to address various panel sessions.</P>
      <P>Along with Tang, the ROC's Chief of the General Staff Adm. Li
 Chieh has also been invited to attend the meeting.</P>
      <P>Political analysts said the meeting is of great significance as
 it will take place barely a month after U.S. President George W. Bush
 reaffirmed Washington's security commitments to Taiwan during his
 just-concluded Asia tour that took him to Japan, South Korea and

    <TEXT>
      <P>More than 100 Taiwanese
 expatriates in Australia demonstrated in Sydney Saturday over former
 U.S. President Bill Clinton giving a speech at a conference promoting
 the unification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>The demonstrators converged at the venue of the conference on the
 promotion of peaceful reunification of Taiwan and mainland China when
 Clinton was speaking.</P>
      <P>The protesters waved banners and posters while chanting slogans
 -- "Taiwan is not a province of the People's Republic of China" and
 "Taiwan is an independent sovereign state."</P>
      <P>The protesters said Clinton should not have addressed the
 conference, organized by the Australian Council for the Promotion of
 Peaceful Reunification of China, a pro-Beijing organization.</P>
      <P>Chen Shou-shung, president of the Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce
 in Australia, which organized the demonstration, said Clinton should
 respect the choice of the people of Taiwan as demonstrated in last
 December's legislative elections when a political party known for its
 pro-unification stance won only 3 percent of the vote.</P>
      <P>The results of the elections also showed that the people of

    <HEADLINE>ROC  VP  HAILS  BUSH'S  REFUSAL  TO REITERATE '3 COMMUNIQUES'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 23 (CNA)
(By Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette Lu
said Saturday that U.S. President George W. Bush has abandoned the
three U.S. joint communiques with mainland China through his actions.</P>
      <P>Lu said at a seminar on the future of Taiwan in the wake of the
upcoming 30th anniversary of the Shanghai Communique that Bush's
"prudent, precise and consistent" statements on the Taiwan issue as
well as his refusal to reiterate the three communiques during his
just-concluded visit to Beijing and his vocal support of Washington's
support for the Taiwan Relations Act on mainland soil are all worthy
of respect.</P>
      <P>She said she is "glad" that Bush expended effort trying to
maintain Taiwan's dignity and security without harming Taiwan's
interests.</P>
      <P>Lu pointed out that to Beijing's disappointment, Bush stressed
during his visit in mainland China his hope for a "peaceful
resolution" to the Taiwan issue instead of advocating "peaceful
reunification" between Taiwan and mainland China.</P>
      <P>The vice president added that if Bush can use his actions to
abandon the three communiques, maybe Taiwan can also abandon its
domestic disputes on the independence-versus-unification issue and
let go of the "burden" of Beijing's "one China" principle.</P>
      <P>At the same seminar, an official of Taiwan's Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) said that the three communiques between Beijing and
Washington have already become relatively "empty" words over the
years.</P>
      <P>SEF Deputy Secretary-General Andes Yen said that Taiwan should
consider whether it should next work toward the goal of abolishing
the three communiques.</P>
      <P>However, he warned that a risk that should be assessed is whether
a replacement to the three communiques might be even more damaging to
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Joanne J.L. Chang, a research fellow at Academia
Sinica's Institute of European and American Studies, said that the
three communiques are a product of the Cold War era.</P>
      <P>She said that the United States had previously assumed that
making concessions on its Taiwan policy could lead to progress in
Taipei-Beijing relations, but events after former U.S. President Bill
Clinton announced his "three noes" policy have demonstrated that
Beijing's policies toward Taiwan have not changed because of those
concessions.</P>
      <P>Chang added that Bush's unambiguous statements in support of
Taiwan can be expected to lead other nations in a similar change in
attitude in favor of the island.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. SHOULD STRENGTHEN TAIWAN RELATIONS ACT: ROC VICE PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  23  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Vice President Annette
Lu said in Taipei Saturday that the ROC government should urge the
United States to strengthen the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).</P>
      <P>She made the remarks while speaking at a seminar organized by the
National Development Foundation on Taiwan's past and future 30
years after the signing of the Shanghai joint communique between the
United States and mainland China.</P>
      <P>Lu said that U.S. President George Bush did not hurt Taiwan's
interests during his recent visit to mainland China and added that
he even moved to protect Taiwan.</P>
      <P>She expressed her heartfelt thanks and respects to Bush for his
friendly moves, and went on to say that Bush's statements opened a
"window of hope" for Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Bush openly described Taiwan as a "good friend" before his
departure for Beijing and stressed that the U.S. would not only
defend the security of itself, but also that of friendly countries,
including Taiwan, Lu said.</P>
      <P>Regarding cross-Taiwan Strait disputes, she continued to say that
Bush wanted to see a "peaceful resolution" rather than a "peaceful
reunification."</P>
      <P>Lu said that Bush also expressed his hope that nation-wide
elections will be held in mainland China some day and stressed that
mainland Chinese people have rights to decide their own future.</P>
      <P>She asserted that Bush was the first U.S. president who had ever
raised the Taiwan Relations Act during an official visit to Beijing.</P>
      <P>Lu noted that Bush's remarks regarding the Taiwan issue were
"prudent, precise and consistent," fully displaying his respects for
Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The vice president said that an important mission of Bush's
Beijing trip was to promote "peaceful evolution of China."</P>
      <P>She said that the ROC government should take positive action to
urge the U.S. to beef up and renovate the TRA so as to cope with the
new global situation.</P>
      <P>Lu said that Taiwan, located on a vital strategic point in the
Asia-Pacific area, should continue pursuing the universal value of
freedom and democracy while promoting the formation of an
"Asia-Pacific democratic alliance" to counter mainland China's
conspiracy to isolate Taiwan.</P>
      <P>As the Bush administration was reluctant to talk about the three
joint communiques signed by the U.S. and mainland China, Lu said that
the people in Taiwan should also stop their contention regarding
independence and unification.</P>
      <P>Lu said that the people should stand firm on Taiwan while
extending their views to mainland China and the world fairly, and
should strive to develop Taiwan into an "island of the world." She
also called on the U.S. government to make equal and parallel
treatment toward Beijing and Taipei.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Industrial Technology
Research Institute (ITRI) is helping to create a set of standards for
information appliance design and production to promote Taiwan's
leadership in the fast-growing industry, ITRI sources said Monday.</P>
      <P>According to the ITRI Computer and Communications Research
Laboratories (CCL), these standards will be finalized after a
industry-wide meeting in March to be held under the guidance of the
National Information Infrastructure Committee, an ad hoc
inter-ministerial steering committee that meets monthly to monitor
the development of Taiwan's national information infrastructure.</P>
      <P>Acer Group Chairman Stan Shih serves as the convener of a
standard-formulating committee involving the CCL and various local
high-tech companies. The committee has met 12 times in the past three
months, determined that smart handheld devices will be the flagship
IA products for Taiwan and drafted standards for them.</P>
      <P>CCL Director Lin Pao-shu said these standards are urgently needed
in the post-PC era because a lack of them will hamper IA's long-term
development.</P>
      <P>Wang Fu-ching, deputy director of the CCL, said that his lab aims
to help Taiwan become the global leader in IA design and
manufacturing before 2006. To reach that objective, standards that
are in line with international technological trends and an
environment favorable to the IA industry are necessary, he added.</P>
      <P>The ITRI is a national-level non-profit research organization
that develops industrial technologies and transfers them to domestic
private enterprises to boost their global competitiveness.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DPP LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS BACKS DOH HEALTH-INSURANCE PAYMENT SYSTEM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  25 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The ruling Democratic Progressive Party's
(DPP's) legislative caucus said Monday it supports a Department of
Health (DOH) plan to revise the National Health Insurance Act to
correct flaws in the current insurance premium payment system.</P>
      <P>DPP legislative whip Wang Tuoh made the remarks after DOH
Director-General Lee Ming-liang delivered a report to the DPP caucus
on the agency's plan to improve the financial status of Taiwan's
cash-strapped National Health Insurance (NHI) program.</P>
      <P>In his report, Lee said the DOH's Bureau of National Health
Insurance (BNHI) has drafted a bill revising the health insurance act
to make the premium payment system "more reasonable and fair."</P>
      <P>Noting that the spirit of the national health insurance program
lies in the rich helping the poor, Lee said the current payment
system unfairly allows people with high incomes to pay a lower
premium rate than those with low incomes in certain cases.</P>
      <P>"Worse yet, under the current system, premiums for civil servants
are calculated based on only 55 percent of their full-time monthly
salary, while premiums for employees in the private sector are a
ratio of their full-time salary," Lee noted.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, he said, unemployed people sometimes find themselves
paying more in premiums than those with steady jobs under the present
payment system.</P>
      <P>"It is our primary concern to mend these unfair flaws in the
current health-insurance payment system," Lee told members of the DPP
legislative caucus.</P>
      <P>He further said the DOH has referred the amendment bill to the
Cabinet for further review. The bill will then be sent to the
Legislative Yuan for deliberation and approval.</P>
      <P>"We hope that both DPP and opposition lawmakers will support the
revision bill to remove the unfairness in our current payment
system," Lee said, adding that the move would enable the BNHI to
increase its annual revenues by NT$20 billion (US$571.43 million) to
NT$30 billion.</P>
      <P>In response, DPP whip Wang said his party caucus will do its
utmost to help the amendment bill clear the legislative floor as soon
as possible.</P>
      <P>Aside from drawing up the amendment bill, the BNHI also proposed
a hike in the premium rate from the current 4.25 percent of the
monthly salary to 4.91 percent. According to this plan, the rate hike
should be implemented from July this year. The plan had drawn strong
opposition from some DPP lawmakers, so the DPP caucus thus invited
Lee to give a detailed report on the agency's plan.</P>
      <P>After listening to Lee's report, Wang said the plan might be
shelved, at least for the time being. In addition to removing the
three flaws in the current payment system, Wang said, the BNHI should

(By Chen Wen-ho and Fang Wen-hung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Beijing's continued backing of overseas
movements promoting the unification of Taiwan and mainland China will
only disrupt the tranquility of overseas Chinese communities, which
are well aware of how the two political systems compare with each
other, a senior Republic of China official said Sunday.</P>
      <P>Wu Hsin-shing, vice minister of the ROC Overseas Chinese Affairs
Commission, said in Sydney, while in transit to New Zealand, that
Beijing should not try to introduce the political differences that
exist between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait into overseas
Chinese communities, which he said "forces them to choose sides."</P>
      <P>He said that Beijing's pro-unification work abroad only raises
antagonism and does nothing to promote liberalization and
democratization in the mainland.</P>
      <P>The people of Taiwan hope that the mainland can speed up a
"peaceful transformation" to a free and democratic country, Wu said,
adding that existing political differences between Taiwan and the
mainland will "naturally resolve themselves" once the mainland
embraces freedom and democracy.</P>
      <P>He also said that the issue of Taiwan seeking independence does
not exist, because the Republic of China has in fact been an
independent and sovereign nation for 91 years.</P>
      <P>The only issue is the race to see whose political system is
better and which one respects the rule of law and the people, he

(By Maubo Chang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun vowed Monday to
"develop an economy with local characteristics" to sustain the
country's growth in the face of the relentless tide of globalization.</P>
      <P>In his first annual report to the legislature on his
administration's agenda, the premier said globalization and
localization are the two leading factors dictating the country's
economic competitiveness.</P>
      <P>He said Taiwan cannot maintain its economic development by simply
keeping its economic edge of the past, but must find a new
dynamic that will help keep its head above water amidst the tide of
globalization. This, he said, can be done by "building an economy
with local characteristics."</P>
      <P>Yu promised to turn the island's cultural diversity and wide
geographic differences into valuable economic resources and engines
for uninterrupted development.</P>
      <P>As to the debt-saddled National Health Insurance program, the
premier stopped short of asking for a hike in premiums as demanded by
the National Health Insurance Bureau, which manages the program, but
he promised to come up with a second-generation insurance program to
replace the current one.</P>
      <P>He reiterated President Chen Shui-bian's "active opening,
effective management" statement as the supreme guidance in the
government's economic policy toward mainland China.</P>
      <P>Direct trade and transportation links with mainland China will be
launched in line with the country's market-opening program according
to World Trade Organization rules, Yu said in his report, which he
will deliver to the legislature Tuesday.</P>
      <P>The report also offers a glimpse into his agenda for other areas,
including:</P>
      <P>-- strengthening the election and recall systems, pushing for a
mechanism for referendum and initiatives to give citizens the power
to veto or propose legislative measures and doing away with the
election of township heads;</P>
      <P>-- contributing to the international crackdown on terrorism,
helping to improve the security and peace in the Asia-Pacific region;</P>
      <P>-- balancing the government's budget within five to ten years,
fairly dividing revenues among governments at various levels; and</P>
      <P>-- winning the public's trust in the government by vigorously
bearing down on corruption.</P>

(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taiwan airliner announced Monday that it
is inaugurating all-cargo flights to Macau Tuesday.</P>
      <P>A spokesman for TransAsia Airways said that with the rapid growth
of cross-Taiwan Strait trade, revenue from its Taiwan-Macau route
accounted for 46 percent of the airline's revenue last year, which
prompted the decision to inaugurate the all-cargo flights.</P>
      <P>The spokesman said the airline estimates that with the
inauguration of the new flights, the company's cargo revenue could
surge to NT$400 million (US$11.38 million) this year from the
NT$250 million (US$7.12 million) generated last year.</P>
      <P>TransAsia Airways signed an agreement with a Macau forwarder
Monday and said that it is converting its ATR 74-seat passenger
planes to 6.5-ton cargo planes that will ply the route with 12
flights per week.</P>
      <P>TransAsia Airways Chairman Tony Fan said that the company
previously used the bellies of its Airbus A320 and its A321
passenger planes to carry cargo to Macau. The volume of cargo was
5,175 tons in 1999, which had increased 49 percent to 7,687 tons as
of 2000, he added.</P>
      <P>Although economy was sluggish in 2001, there was still a 13
percent growth on the Taiwan-Macau route, suggesting great potential,
he noted.</P>
      <P>Fan said that although the ATR cargo plane has limited cargo
capability, it is economically efficient and will allow flowers from
Kunming, in southwestern mainland China's Yunnan Province, to be sold
in Taipei's flower market the morning after shipping, while key parts
and components produced in Taiwan's Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park can be delivered to Kunshan, Shanghai, and on display in retail
outlets the next day.</P>

continue to evaluate all propositions while taking such factors as
current international events, cross-Taiwan Strait relations and the
opinions of foreign governments into consideration.</P>
      <P>Chang said that the MOFA has not yet approached any foreign
governments to consult them on the issue.</P>
      <P>Late Monday, she said that if any changes are implemented in the
future, the move should not be seen as a form of provocation
regarding cross-strait relations.</P>
      <P>Chang said that in the event of such an across-the-board name
change, the government will "naturally" first seek to use the
official name of the Republic of China. If the official name cannot
be used, the government will not rule out considering other
appropriate names including "Taiwan," she added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, she clarified that the ministry has not instructed the
ROC representative offices in the United States to change their names
to include the word "Taiwan."</P>
      <P>According to a public opinion poll conducted by the MOFA in
August 2000, approximately 50 percent of the respondents said that
they prefer the name "Taiwan Representative Office" over "Taipei
Representative Office" if "the Republic of China" cannot be used in
the name.</P>
      <P>In two subsequent polls carried out in July and November 2001,
the percentage of respondents in favor of using the name "Taiwan
Representative Office" increased to approximately 70 percent.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PENTAGON TO SEND STAFF TO TAIWAN IN MARCH TO DISCUSS SUB DEAL DETAILS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Ministry of National Defense (MND)
declined to make any comment Tuesday on a report that the United
States will present options to Taiwan in the spring for their
conventional submarine deal.</P>
      <P>The magazine U.S. Defense News reported in its latest issue that
U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Peter T.R. Brookes told
the weekly in an interview that the Pentagon had received offers from
various weaponry manufacturers regarding its plan to sell eight
diesel-powered submarines to the Republic of China.</P>
      <P>Brookes further said that the Pentagon was studying all the
offers presented by prospective defense contractors and that U.S.
naval authorities will refer all available options to Taiwan this
spring for the island to make a final choice.</P>
      <P>The MND would not confirm the report on the grounds that it is
the ministry's established policy to refrain from making any comments
on its military procurement plans.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chief of the General Staff Adm. Li Chieh said
earlier this month in an interview with the local news media that
U.S. authorities would send staff to Taiwan in March to discuss
issues related to Taiwan's submarine procurement plan.</P>
      <P>Li said the U.S. government would take full charge of seeking
prospective contractors as well as handle submarine construction
matters.</P>
      <P>"The U.S. government has invited prospective suppliers to present
their design and manufacturing blueprints through its official Web
site," Li said, adding that Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding
Corp. has also expressed its intention of joining in the bidding.</P>
      <P>Earlier this month, Li said, U.S. authorities informed the ROC
Navy that they had completed an extensive evaluation of options put
forth by interested contractors and would send representatives to
Taiwan next month to discuss further details with ROC naval
authorities.</P>
      <P>The Bush administration agreed to sell Taiwan eight conventional
submarines last year to help beef up the island's naval defense
capabilities in the face of mainland China's mounting military
threat. Although the United States has not produced diesel submarines
for a long time, it has vowed to make every possible effort to assist
Taiwan in acquiring the advanced vessels.</P>

    <HEADLINE>U.S. GOV'T URGED TO KEEP PRESSURE ON BEIJING ON RELIGIOUS FREEDOM</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Washington,  Feb.  25  (CNA)
(By Nelson Chung)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The U.S. Commission on International
Religious Freedom on Monday welcomed the U.S. president's speech in
Beijing last Friday emphasizing religious freedom and human rights,
but strongly urged Washington to keep the pressure on Beijing to stop
its crackdown on spiritual and religious groups.</P>
      <P>"President George W. Bush told the Chinese people the truth:
Religious believers are not a threat to China's public order -- they
build civic society," Felice Gaer of the commission's executive
committee said.</P>
      <P>"It was important that the president's talk was carried live on
Chinese television. The Chinese people need to know that America's
interest in religious freedom and other human rights is part of who
we are as a people, and it's a worldwide concern that China has
pledged to respect," Gaer noted.</P>
      <P>"We sincerely hope," she added, "that Chinese officials at all
levels will take President Bush's words to heart and end their
deepening campaign of repression against the Falun Gong, unregistered
Protestant and Catholic Christians, Tibetan Buddhists, and Uighur
Muslims -- a campaign that has resulted in tens of thousands being
sent to detention camps and scores being brutally murdered in
official custody."</P>
      <P>"As the United States deepens its relationship with Beijing, we
strongly urge the U.S. government to keep the pressure on China to
stop these atrocious violations," she added.</P>
      <P>In a January 31 letter to President Bush, the commission
recommended that he "obtain assurances from the Chinese government
that you will be given an opportunity to address the Chinese people
directly by live, uncensored broadcast in a major speech on
fundamental human rights and freedoms, particularly freedom of
religion and belief."</P>
      <P>The commission also issued recommendations regarding mainland
China on Feb. 13 urging the U.S. government to press Beijing to end
its crackdown on religious and spiritual groups, to reform its
repressive legal framework, to affirm the universality of religious
freedom and mainland China's international obligations, and to foster
a culture of respect for human rights.</P>
      <P>Among its specific recommendations, the commission wrote that the
U.S. government "should seek expanded opportunities to speak frankly
and directly to the Chinese people to express why the U.S.
government, on behalf of the American people, is concerned with
violations of internationally recognized human rights, including
freedom of religion or belief."</P>
      <P>The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom was
created by the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to give
independent recommendations to the executive branch and to Congress
on policies to promote international religious freedom.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun said Tuesday that if
the Republic of China is to apply to re-join the United Nations under
the name "Taiwan," a national consensus will be necessary.</P>
      <P>Yu said at a legislative interpellation session that applying to
enter international organizations is a continued goal of the
administration.</P>
      <P>However, he said that because ROC diplomatic allies in the United
Nations are few in number, any attempt to join the United Nations
using the official name the Republic of China would be "difficult."</P>
      <P>If using the official name proves to be unfeasible, then the
government will consider using another name such as "Taiwan" if there
is a widespread consensus, he added.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, in response to an opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union
lawmaker's proposal to introduce a bill allowing only ROC citizens
born in Taiwan to run for president or vice president, Yu said the
government does not have this kind of policy and must respect the
opinions of the various political parties as well as those of the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Implementing such a measure would have to take into account the
domestic situation because of the presence of varying opinions on the
issue in society, he said, adding that the government needs half a
year to evaluate the proposal.</P>
      <P>In regard to reports that the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) might
give up its controversial party assets, Yu said that he is "glad" to
see the KMT display such a constructive attitude. However, he
stressed that such party assets should be handled according to the
law.</P>
      <P>Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan said that related draft bills

    <HEADLINE>U.S. VISIT NOT TO TOUCH ON ARMS PROCUREMENT: DEFENSE MINISTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China Minister of National
Defense Tang Yiau-ming said Tuesday the focus of his planned visit to
the United States in March is to explain the ROC's defense structure
and policies.</P>
      <P>"During my visit, I have no plans to touch on any issues related
to specific arms procurement projects or the possibility of Taiwan
joining the U.S. Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system," Tang
stressed.</P>
      <P>The ROC's first Taiwan-born defense minister made the remarks in
response to an inquiry by opposition Taiwan Solidarity Unity (TSU)
Legislator Ho Min-hau about the main purposes of Tang's planned visit
to the United States in March to attend a Taiwan-U.S. defense
industry summit meeting.</P>
      <P>Noting that national security is key to social stability, Tang
said that as the minister of national defense, he is obligated to
help the U.S. government and its private sector understand Taiwan's
defense policies and strategies.</P>
      <P>Asked whether the upcoming Taiwan-U.S. defense summit would
discuss the TMD or any Taiwan arms procurement issues, Tang said none
of those issues are on his agenda.</P>
      <P>Tang instead said that since Taiwan is always under threat of
missile attack from mainland China, the ROC military must be prepared
to protect the 23 million people of Taiwan.</P>
      <P>He also said that it is a general practice in democratic
countries to refrain from publicly discussing any unfinished military
development plans. The ROC follows these guidelines, Tang said,
adding: "The Ministry of National Defense needs room to protect the
interests of our people."</P>
      <P>As the U.S.-proposed TMD is still in the experimental stage, Tang
said it would be premature to estimate any possible cost for Taiwan
should it be asked to join the program.</P>
      <P>The U.S.-Taiwan Business Council, the chief organizer of the
March 10-12 defense industry summit in St. Petersburg, Florida, has
sent an invitation to Tang to attend the conference, but it remains
unclear whether the U.S. Department of State will grant Tang a visa.</P>
      <P>If Tang manages to secure a U.S. visa, he will be the first ROC
defense minister to visit America during his term of office since the
two countries terminated diplomatic ties in 1979. The only exception
was Tang's predecessor, Wu Shih-wen, who made a transit stop in New
York late last year on his way home after a visit to Central America.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, an earlier news report said Tang is also scheduled to
visit the United States in August. At Tuesday's legislative session,
opposition Kuomintang Legislator John Chang, who once served as the
ROC's minister of foreign affairs, said he is almost certain that if
Tang had planned to go to the United States in August, the intense
media scrutiny ahead of the trip had already scuttled the plan.</P>
      <P>Due to Beijing's persistent diplomatic embargo of Taiwan, Chang
said, the ROC government must handle all issues relating to foreign
affairs with prudence and pragmatism.</P>
      <P>"'Do more and speak less should be our government's top working
guideline in handling external affairs," Chang said, adding that the
premature leaking of Tang's possible August U.S. visit betrayed the
current Democratic Progressive Party government's inexperience in
dealing with diplomatic affairs.</P>
      <P>In Chang's view, he said, even if Tang manages to visit the
United States in August, U.S. authorities would very likely downgrade
its reception of Tang under pressure from Beijing.</P>
      <P>The defense ministry, however, nor any other government agency
has ever confirmed the media reports regarding Tang's possible visit
to the United States this August.</P>

      <P>The international oil giant Exxon-Mobil is
negotiating with the Chinese Petroleum Corp. (CPC) to use Taiwan's
refineries to process its oil, according to CPC Chairman Regis C.W.
Chen.</P>
      <P>Chen said that the Exxon-Mobil has submitted an application to
the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) for a license to import oil
products, as the domestic oil products market has been opened to
imports starting this year.</P>
      <P>The CPC chairman said that international oil companies operating
in Taiwan may become competitors as well as partners.</P>
      <P>Taking the Exxon-Mobil as an example, Chen said the international
oil giant is negotiating with the CPC, hoping the state enterprise's
oil refineries can process its products. In the meantime, Exxon-Mobil
is also discussing a joint venture project with the Pan Overseas
Corp.</P>
      <P>After the MOEA's announcement in late December that it would
liberalize Taiwan's oil products market, a Pan Overseas spokesman
said that the company's newly built oil tanks at Taichung Harbor
would be in use early this year and the company will try to win
supply contracts from gas stations around the island.</P>
      <P>Currently, the CPC is the biggest oil products supplier to
domestic gas stations. With around 1,600 gas stations around the
island being supplied with CPC oil products, it has a 40 percent
market share.</P>
      <P>Formosa Petroleum Corp., which grossed NT$130 billion from oil
products last year, has contracts with more than 500 domestic gas
stations, making it the second-largest supplier in the country. A
company spokesman said recently that the company intends to win 50
percent of the market share before the end of this year.</P>

      <P>The future of Taiwan could one day be in

issue and one lawmaker is trying to lay the foundation for such a
vote to take place.</P>
      <P>Lawmaker Tsai Trong-rong of the ruling Democratic Progressive

his colleagues at the 225-seat Legislative Yuan advocating the
passage of the "public referendum bill" in the current session of the
legislature, which opened Feb. 1.</P>
      <P>Tsai said the right to determine the future of a nation by the
people through a fair and open vote is the mandate of a democratic
nation and the widespread support from lawmakers with different
political affiliations is a reflection of public opinion. He said
that he will continue seeking non-partisan backing from all lawmakers
and hopes the bill can be passed into law this session after being
put into the legislature's agenda.</P>
      <P>According to Tsai, the 114 lawmakers included members from the
DPP, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, the Kuomintang, the People First

      <P>Tsai said that this is the right direction for the country to
follow in its further democratization, adding that it was unlikely

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT TO CHAIR INAUGURATION OF RESTRUCTURED DEFENSE MINISTRY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian will preside over
the inaugural ceremony for the restructured Ministry of National
Defense (MND) Friday, a senior official said Tuesday.</P>
      <P>MND Administrative Deputy Minister Vice Adm. Kao Yang told a news
conference that the MND has completed planning and preparatory work
for the restructuring in line with the Ministry of National Defense
Organization Law and the Statute on Organization of the General Staff
Headquarters (GSH), both of which will take effect Friday.</P>
      <P>According to the two new acts, the GSH will come under the MND
jurisdiction to materialize the government's goal of integrating
military command and administration. In the past, no clear laws
regulate the MND and GSH structures and their relations and
respective functions.</P>
      <P>"The ultimate goals of implementing the two new laws include
'nationalizing' the armed forces, having the military led by
civilians and integrating military command and administration,"
Kao explained.</P>
      <P>Under the two new laws, the GSH will serve as the defense
minister's staff agency regarding military command as well as the
command unit of combined services operations.</P>
      <P>The new laws also authorize the MND to set up a bureau
to take charge of procurement or acquisition of all weaponry systems
and military equipment. But the Legislative Yuan has yet to complete
legislation of a law regulating the bureau's organization. "The new
bureau is not expected to become fully operational until Feb. 1,
2003," Kao said.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, military spokesman Maj. Gen.
Huang Suey-sheng said the MND restructuring is the ROC's yet another
major military reform step following the first-phase troops
reduction plan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BUDDHA'S FINGER RELIC MOVED TO SANHSIA TEMPLE FOR EXHIBITION</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Buddha's finger relic, which was
brought to Taipei for exhibition from Xian, mainland China Feb. 23,
was moved to the Chinguangming Temple in Sanhsia, Taipei County,
Tuesday for exhibition until March 3.</P>
      <P>The four-day exhibition at the domed stadium at National Taiwan
University (NTU) in downtown Taipei attracted some 300,000 visitors,
according to organizers.</P>
      <P>The finger relic, apparently the only one left by the Buddha some
2,600 years ago, was unearthed in 1987 when researchers excavated a
cell under the half-collapsed Famen Temple of Xian City.</P>
      <P>The cell had been sealed for more than 1,110 years since Emperor
Hsi Tsung of the Tang dynasty.</P>
      <P>The relic was brought to Taipei with the consent of the mainland
Chinese authorities. Some 400 Buddhist followers escorted it to
Taipei via Hong Kong aboard two chartered Dragonair planes.</P>
      <P>Master Hsing Yun of the Kaohsiung-based Foguangshan Monastery,
expressed the hope that the exhibition of the Buddha's relic in
Taiwan will bring peace and prosperity across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Before the finger relic was moved to the Chinguangming Temple, a
solemn Buddhist ceremony was held at the NTU domed stadium with
Master Hsing Yun presiding.</P>
      <P>The finger relic will also be exhibited at the Foguangshan
Monastery in Kaohsiung March 3-14, in Taichung March 15-17, in Nantou
County March 17-26 and again at the Foguangshan Monastery March
26-31. It will be returned to Xian March 31.</P>
      <P>A group of mainland Chinese monks and officials in charge of
religious affairs came to Taiwan along with the relic. They visited
the Dharma Drum Monastery in suburban Taipei Monday and the Buddhist
Compassionate Relief Tzu Chi Association in Hualien Tuesday.</P>
      <P>They will continue visiting other leading Buddhist establishments
in Taiwan, including Foguangshan in Kaohsiung and Chungtai Temple in
Nantou, before leaving Taiwan March 2.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>There were 303,567 foreign workers in
Taiwan as of the end of January, down 1,038 from December of last
year, according to the latest statistics released by the Council of
Labor Affairs (CLA).</P>
      <P>The CLA said the government has adopted measures to reduce the
number of foreign workers in Taiwan and those working in the
construction and manufacturing sectors have dropped noticeably;
however, the number of foreign maids and caregivers has continued to
grow.</P>
      <P>In the construction sector, 28,521 alien workers were employed in
government public works projects last month, down 1,098 from
December, while the number in private-sector construction projects
fell by 1,044 to 2,358, according to the tallies.</P>
      <P>In the manufacturing sector, there were 50,250 foreign laborers
employed in major investment projects in January, down 269 from the
previous month. But the number of foreign caregivers and maids
increased by 955 at the same time.</P>
      <P>The CLA forecast that the number of foreign fishermen working for
Taiwan fishing vessels may slightly increase in the near future after
mainland China recently banned its seamen from working on Taiwan
ships. Currently, there are more than 1,000 foreign fishermen working

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER SPEAKS OF EXPECTATIONS FOR TAIWAN IN FIRST OFFICIAL REPORT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun outlined the direction
of his government Tuesday as he spoke of his ideals on a new
political environment, a new economy, a new society and the cultural
identify that is Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Yu made the remarks when he gave his first administrative report
in the legislature after taking office as premier this month.</P>
      <P>Yu also expressed the hope that the executive and legislative
branches could communicate and work out their differences in a
rational way, quoting the words by the late U.S. President John F.
Kennedy: "Our problems are man-made; therefore, they may be solved by
man."</P>
      <P>The premier said that he hopes to "replace luxury with thrift,
extravagance with modesty" in his Cabinet, and government reforms
will be his top priority. He said that several such key programs will
include a revised draft law on the organization of the Executive Yuan,
the adjustment of the timing of various elections to reduce their
numbers, and the privatization of state-owned enterprises.</P>
      <P>On the economy, Yu also said that bills related to the
consensus reached in a national economic conference last August
will be sent to the legislature as soon as possible. After the bills
clear the legislature, he said, the nation should be better tuned for
future challenges.</P>
      <P>He also mentioned four core industries: semi-conductor related,
LCD manufacture, biotechnology and digital related, saying that the
government is confident that the production value of the
semi-conductor and LCD-related industries will hit NT$1 trillion
(US$28.49 billion) in a few years, while the production value of the
biotechnology and digital industries will reach NT$250 billion
(US$7.12 billion) and NT$300 billion (US$8.54 billion) within six
years, respectively.</P>
      <P>Yu also envision a society based on cooperation between men and
women, rich and poor, various parties and ethic groups, saying that
the government will build a "nuclear-free" land and a sound social
security system, including pensions for the old, welfare for the
jobless as well as a system of support for women and children in
need..</P>
      <P>On the culture that makes Taiwan special, he promoted the ideals
of humanistic values and life-long learning, stressing that a
high-quality living environment is crucial to meet the challenges of
being a member of the global neighborhood.</P>
      <P>On cross-strait relations, Yu said he was happy to see that
mainland China is more willing to deal pragmatically with the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>He said that to promote positive exchanges between the two sides
of the Taiwan Strait, the government has continued to extend olive
branches over the past months, and it is happy to see a recent
softened tone by Beijing, showing that it is facing the fact that the
DPP is the ruling party instead of shunning it because of its past
advocacy of independence for the island.</P>
      <P>The premier again urged both sides to work for the mutually
beneficial aims of peace and cooperation. He suggested that both
sides send officials to exchange views on matters of mutual concern,
which should give some impetus for the renewal of stalled
cross-strait talks.</P>
      <P>The premier stressed that with both sides joining the World Trade
Organization and facing global competition, Taiwan has consistently
advocated cross-strait understanding and respect. In this way, he
said, there is a chance to solve bilateral disputes using the process
and interpretation of the result of the 1992 talks, which paved the
way for the first high-level discussions the following year after
more than five decades of deadlock across the Strait.</P>
      <P>On Beijing's successful bid to host the 2008 Olympic Games and
its determination to upgrade its national image through the Games, Yu
said that Taiwan will undertake a six-year national construction
project, hoping that the world will see the economic prosperity of
the nation that enjoys a pluralistic society that live in tolerance
of others as the world will gradually turn its attention to Asia in
the run-up to the 2008 summer Games, Yu said.</P>
      <P>On United States' President George W. Bush's just-concluded Asian
trip, and his remarks that the United States will remember its
commitment to the people of Taiwan, Yu expressed his appreciation,
adding that Taiwan will make positive contributions to peace in the
Taiwan Strait and add to regional prosperity.</P>

      <P>Rising unemployment and a flagging economy

    <HEADLINE>GOVERNMENT URGED TO REVISE LAW TO ALLOW IMPORTS OF MAINLAND BOOKS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A group of opposition People First Party
(PFP) legislators urged the government Tuesday to revise current laws
to allow for the import of mainland Chinese publications,
particularly academic books.</P>
      <P>The lawmakers, including Pang Chien-kuo, Chin Hui-chu and Lee
Ching-hua, made the call at a news conference after a number of
mainland publications imported by Taipei-based Ask Ford Book Store
for exhibition at the just-concluded Taipei international book fair
were withheld by Taiwan customs.</P>
      <P>Under the existing regulations governing relations between the
people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, mainland publications
cannot enter Taiwan without prior government approval.</P>
      <P>Chin said the restriction has become outdated in the wake of
Taiwan's and mainland China's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO).</P>
      <P>"The government should amend the law to pave the way for the
legal import of mainland Chinese publications, especially academic
books, to boost cross-strait cultural and academic exchanges," Chin
urged. "The government need only make some exceptions under the
principle of free imports."</P>
      <P>Pang claimed that the current mainland book import ban no longer
meets actual demands and has become an obstacle to the development of
knowledge-based economy.</P>
      <P>Despite the ban, Pang added, many mainland academic books have
long found their way into Taiwan.</P>
      <P>"The government should not continue turning a blind eye to the
phenomenon and should instead take steps to formally legalize imports
of mainland Chinese publications," he said.</P>
      <P>Pang said the Government Information Office should be authorized
to draft a package of regulations to govern imports of mainland
publications, films, radio and television programs.</P>
      <P>Pang said he and his PFP colleagues have drafted a revision to
the current statute governing cross-strait civilian exchanges to
allow for the free import of mainland publications.</P>
      <P>"The bill has received the endorsement of 16 lawmakers from
different political parties and we'll continue seeking support from
as many other legislators as possible," he added.</P>

      <P>"Let's exchange fireworks, not gunfire
across the Taiwan Strait," Kinmen County Magistrate Lee Chu-feng
proclaimed Tuesday as he officiated at a ceremony featuring
simultaneous displays of fireworks on Kinmen and in the mainland
Chinese port city of Xiamen.</P>
      <P>People from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait for the first time
jointly observed the annual Lantern Festival by setting off fireworks
simultaneously on either side of the narrow stretch of water
separating the island of Kinmen from Xiamen.</P>
      <P>The idea for the displays was initiated by the Xiamen city
government and received enthusiastically by Lee.</P>
      <P>The Xiamen officials originally proposed that the two places set
off fireworks simultaneously on the eve of the Lunar New Year, which
fell on Feb. 11, but their Kinmen counterparts suggested instead that
the event be postponed until the Lantern Festival in order to allow
plenty of time for the requisite arrangements to be made.</P>
      <P>Some 1,500 fireworks were set off on Kinmen in the two-hour
display, while about 4,000 fireworks were sent up in Xiamen.</P>
      <P>In addition to the fireworks displays, the Kinmen county
government also sponsored a lantern exhibition in Kinmen and a
traditional Chinese puppet show performed by the troupe of mainland
classic puppet master Huang Yi-chueh, according to Kinmen officials.</P>

announced Tuesday his plan to run for the chairmanship of the ruling
Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).</P>
      <P>Praising the contribution made by incumbent DPP Chairman Frank
Hsieh, Lee said he is willing to promote the traditional values
treasured by the DPP -- justice, morality and vision -- in his
participation in the race for the party's top post.</P>
      <P>The former Keelung mayor lost his re-election bid to the
Kuomintang's Hsu Tsai-li last December.</P>
      <P>Lee also called on members of the ruling party to vote for a
service-oriented new leader and to step up their efforts to cultivate
a political elite in order to maintain the party's competitiveness in
Taiwan's political arena.</P>
      <P>In response to a reporter's question as to whether President Chen
Shui-bian is aware of his bid to run, Lee said he has written to the
president to inform him of his decision.</P>

added that he strongly believes that the president will remain
neutral on matters related to party affairs and personnel. Chen and
Lee belong to the same faction within the DPP.</P>
      <P>Lee added that any new head of the DPP, as long as he is elected
through democratic process by party members, will enjoy full backing
from the party. He said he will continue to seek support from all the

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian offered his
appreciation to Belize Tuesday for the Central American nation's
long-term support for the Republic of China in the international
community.</P>
      <P>Belize has demonstrated firm and steady support for the ROC's bid
to rejoin the United Nations and take part in activities of other
international organizations, Chen said when he met with visiting
Belize Prime Minister Said W. Musa, who arrived in Taipei late Monday
for a four-day state visit.</P>
      <P>Chen lauded Belize for its continuous development and progress
over the past decade. Bilateral exchanges between Taiwan and Belize
have become even more solid and frequent since Musa assumed office,
Chen added.</P>
      <P>Under Musa's capable leadership, the People's United Party (PUP),
of which Musa is the chairman, won a landslide victory in 1998
parliamentary elections, Chen noted, adding that the party will be
given a new overwhelming mandate by the Belize people in elections
slated for next year.</P>
      <P>Chen also expressed his willingness to visit Belize. In return,
Musa extended a personal invitation, saying that he hopes Chen will
visit Belize this year, and the earlier the better.</P>
      <P>Musa said he called on Chen in his capacity not only as the
Belizean prime minister, but also as chairman of the Organization of
Eastern Caribbean States, which met for a leadership summit last
month.</P>
      <P>During the summit, according to Musa, subjects concerning
economics and environmental protection, as well as anti-terrorism,
were mooted and the Eastern Caribbean political leaders resolved that
small countries like those the group comprises should cooperate among
themselves to overcome the economic difficulties they face.</P>
      <P>Musa expressed gratitude to Chen for the aid that Taiwan has
provided Belize over the years and said that Belize will continue to
support Taiwan in its efforts to join the UN and other international
organizations.</P>
      <P>Earlier in the day, Musa met with Vice President Annette Lu, also
at the Presidential Office, for a brief meeting.</P>
      <P>During the meeting, Lu told Musa that she has been encouraging
Taiwan businesses to relocate some of their manufacturing operations
to Taiwan's allies in Central and South America in an attempt to
mitigate the adverse impact that Taiwan is sustaining in the wake of
the island's entry to the World Trade Organization at the beginning
of this year.</P>
      <P>In response to Lu's ideas, Musa said the Belizean government has
long adopted a hands-off policy toward foreign investment and is
particularly welcoming to Taiwan businesses wishing to transfer their
capital and production know-how to Belize.</P>
      <P>Musa said Lu's proposal is not only feasible, but also a
"win-win" approach for both Taiwan and Belize.</P>

      <P>The party caucus of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) was inaugurated Tuesday with its party whip
claiming that the fourth-largest party in Taiwan will not be a
"subordinate party" of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng, Legislative Vice
President P.K. Chiang, Premier Yu Shyi-kun and Vice Premier Lin
Hsin-yi, as well as officials from the ruling and opposition parties,
attended the inauguration tea party held in the legislature.</P>
      <P>TSU whip Hsu Teng-kung said that although the TSU is "not
subordinate" to the ruling party , it will rally behind the party if
its proposals are beneficial to the nation.</P>
      <P>DPP whip Ke Chien-ming noted that the DPP and the TSU fought
hand-in-hand in the legislative presidential and vice presidential
battle, as well as in the review of the allocation law regarding
government revenues and expenditure, and said there could be more
cooperation on bills and policies.</P>
      <P>The TSU, founded last August by former Minister of the Interior
Huang Tsu-wen, took 13 seats in the 225-seat legislature in last
December's election.</P>
      <P>Former President Lee Teng-hui, the "spiritual leader" of the TSU,
said last year that he would form a party to help the then-minority
government form a majority for political stability, which is why
critics have questioned if the TSU party line is merged with that of
the DPP.</P>
      <P>TSU Chairman Huang said that in order to implement its goals to
stabilize politics, stimulate the economy, cement democracy and
strengthen Taiwan, the TSU had proposed a motion to halve the number
of legislative seats and hoped that it would get cross-party support.</P>
      <P>Premier Yu said that although the TSU is not a large party,
interpellations by TSU legislators Liao Ben-yen and He Min-hao that
day were like "shock training" for him.</P>
      <P>He expressed the hope that the TSU will show "mercy" in dealing

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT RENEWS CALLS FOR NORMALIZATION OF CROSS-STRAIT TIES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian said Tuesday that
normalization of relations is the road the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait must take and that the process could start with normalization
of economic ties.</P>
      <P>In a teleconference address to Asian studies professors and
graduate students at Harvard University and several other U.S.
institutes of higher learning, Chen said his administration is
willing to send representatives to mainland China to exchange views
on a range of issues that concern both sides.</P>
      <P>Those issues can include normalization of cross-strait economic
and trade ties, investment protection agreements, the "three
mini-links" and the controversies surrounding the interpretations of
the process and results of the 1992 talks between the two sides, Chen
said.</P>
      <P>"If China wishes to send representatives here first," Chen went
on, "we will warmly welcome them and make all necessary
arrangements."</P>
      <P>Chen said he believes that only through dialogue and contact can
the two sides avoid suspicion and misjudgments and resolve
differences.</P>
      <P>"Therefore, I urge that there should be `more economics, less
politics; more contact, less misunderstanding; and more trust, less
suppression' between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait," Chen said.</P>
      <P>He further said the accession of Taiwan and mainland China to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) has opened up an ideal platform for
cross-strait dialogue.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, he went on, the WTO is not the only stage upon
which the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can talk. He said that as
long as the top leaders of the two sides have willingness, sincerity
and creativity, they can talk on any topics of mutual interest under
the principles of "democracy, parity, peace and no preconditions."</P>
      <P>The teleconference was organized by the Fairbank Center for East
Asian Research, Harvard University. In addition to delivering a
speech on the Republic of China's political situation, ROC-U.S.
relations and cross-strait ties, Chen also took questions from the
20-plus American scholars and graduate students present.</P>
      <P>Responding to a question about his possible response if U.S.
President George W. Bush were to offer military and financial aid to
assist Taiwan in seeking independence, Chen said the ROC government
is fully aware that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has long been steadfast
and consistent and will not be subject to any fundamental changes
simply because of the change of ruling party.</P>
      <P>Chen further said the ROC government also understands that there
are critical differences between America's "one China" policy --
which calls for peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues -- and
Beijing's "one China" policy -- which stresses peaceful unification
of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>As the ROC's popularly elected president, Chen said he is
obligated to safeguard national sovereignty, dignity and security in
accordance with the nation's Constitution and to pursue the common
well-being of all ROC citizens.</P>
      <P>Noting that respecting people's free choice is a norm of
democratic countries, Chen said he is convinced that the U.S.
government and people would certainly respect the final decision of
the people of Taiwan on the island's future.</P>
      <P>Asked whether Taiwan's recent decision to add the words "Issued
in Taiwan" to the cover of the ROC passport is a gradual move toward
independence, Chen said the measure has nothing to do with promoting
Taiwan independence.</P>
      <P>The addition is mainly designed to make the ROC passport more
distinguishable from the passports issued by the People's Republic of
China (PRC), mainland China's official title, Chen explained.</P>
      <P>While traveling abroad, Chen said, many ROC nationals have
suffered inconveniences and humiliation at the hands of foreign
immigration officials because they were mistaken for PRC citizens.</P>
      <P>"As a responsible democratic government, we can't overlook
complaints from our people," Chen said, adding the addition of the
words "Issued in Taiwan" on the passport cover just depicts the facts
and has nothing to do with independence.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER RENEWS CALL FOR CROSS-STRAIT EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL VISITS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun called Tuesday for
Taiwan and mainland China to exchange officials to discuss matters of
mutual concern, which should give some impetus to the renewal of
stalled cross-Taiwan Strait talks.</P>
      <P>In order to implement the exchanges, Yu said, the two sides
should first talk about the issues of who, where, when and how and
make certain that the visits are conducted according to the
principles of equality and goodwill.</P>
      <P>Yu said during a legislative interpellation session that he has
no opinion about the level of the officials who should be allowed to
visit the other side.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the premier defended the Executive Yuan's recent
approval of an amendment to the Statutes Governing Relations Across
the Taiwan Strait that formally excludes Outer Mongolia from the
Republic of China's maps of the "Mainland China Area."</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan approved the amendment, proposed by the
Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Jan. 31, agreeing that the revised
ROC-defined "Mainland China Area" indicates "the area under the
control of the mainland Chinese authorities," instead of "the area
under the control of the mainland Chinese authorities and Outer
Mongolia."</P>
      <P>However, some legislators said the amendment is tantamount to
Taiwan's recognition of Outer Mongolia as an independent nation and a
move that runs counter to the ROC Constitution, which claims Outer
Mongolia as ROC territory.</P>
      <P>Yu said removing Outer Mongolia from the map and definition of
the "Mainland China Area" does not involve the issue of whether
Taiwan recognizes Outer Mongolia or not.</P>
      <P>The initiative was only designed for the convenience of Taiwan
exchanges with Outer Mongolia, Yu noted.</P>
      <P>Answering questions on the issue, Mainland Affairs Council
Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen stressed that related stipulations in the ROC
Constitution remain unchanged and will not be altered as a result of
the approval of the amendment.</P>

    <HEADLINE>PRESIDENT CHEN REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO SWEEPING REFORMS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 26 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Republic of China President Chen Shui-bian
said Tuesday that consolidating Taiwan's democracy will be his
administration's next goal.</P>
      <P>"In an effort to advance Taiwan's politics, economy and society,
my administration's primary work is to actively promote government
re-structuring," Chen said in a teleconference speech to 20-plus
professors and graduate students from several noted U.S.
universities, including Harvard University.</P>
      <P>Chen said his administration will do its utmost to "streamline
government's structure, improve administrative efficiency and enhance
its ability to handle international political and economic crises in
order to establish a small, beautiful and highly capable
government."</P>
      <P>Noting that last December's legislative election was by nature a
vote of confidence by the people of Taiwan for the Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) government and himself, /chen said the
increased number of votes and seats has made the DPP the largest
party in the Legislature.</P>
      <P>"It represents the public endorsement and willingness to give
the DPP a chance to govern the country," Chen said.</P>
      <P>To live up to the public's expectations, Chen said, his
administration will actively promote political reforms through
legislation on the Political Contribution Law, the Conflict of
Interest Law, the Political Party Law, the Lobbying Law, and
electoral reform laws.</P>
      <P>"We'll faithfully implement these laws so that the goal of an
honest government and clean elections can be achieved," Chen
pledged.</P>
      <P>Turning to the economic front, Chen said, Taiwan's economy has
live through the bitter winter of recession and a ray of sunlight
has gradually dawned.</P>
      <P>"However, we are not content with these achievements," Chen
said, adding that his administration has come up with a plan to
"deeply cultivate Taiwan with a global perspective" as the vision
for Taiwan's national economic development in the new century.</P>
      <P>On Jan. 1, Chen said, Taiwan became the 144th member of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) -- the "economic United Nations."</P>
      <P>"In fact, Taiwan's accession to the WTO is an important step in
returning to the international community," Chen noted. "Like any
democratic country, Taiwan expects to receive equal treatment and
respect from the world."</P>
      <P>Chen said the people of Taiwan hope that the United States and
other countries around the world can understand their
common aspirations to fulfill their international obligations and
extend greater support to Taiwan's participation in the World Health
Organization and other international bodies.</P>
      <P>Stressing that normalizing relations across the Taiwan Strait
has been one of his most important tasks since he took office,
Chen said Taiwan is willing to resume dialogue with mainland
China, provided there are no preconditions.</P>
      <P>"Now that both sides are members of the WTO, we should be able
to utilize its international mechanism to establish dialogue on
economic and trade issues, which would not only facilitate
normalization of bilateral trade and economic relations, but also
reduce cross-strait tensions," he added.</P>
      <P>The teleconference was organized by the Fairbank Center for East
Asian Research, Harvard University. In addition to delivering a
20-minute speech, Chen also took questions from U.S. scholars and
graduate students.</P>

    <HEADLINE>BROAD DISCUSSION REQUIRED ON TRANSFER OF WAFER KNOW-HOW: OFFICIAL</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  26  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A Taipei official said Tuesday that the
government will take various aspects into consideration before
deciding whether to allow local wafer manufacturers to invest in
mainland China.</P>
      <P>Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) Vice Chairman John Deng made the
remarks while speaking at a public hearing organized by two
legislators on the proposed transfer of wafer know-how to mainland
China.</P>
      <P>Deng said that the government has no intention of postponing its
decision but added that the issue must be discussed fully.</P>
      <P>He noted that the MAC's basic principles on the issue are that
Taiwan's economic growth must be sustained and that enterprises
wishing to invest in the mainland must keep their roots in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The MAC official went on to say that the government will also pay
attention to the flow of capital and the maintenance of a good
environment for up- and down-stream development, as well as the
employment situation on the island.</P>
      <P>He said that the MAC will try to obtain more information on the
issue but admitted that he could not say when the final decision will
be made.</P>
      <P>Minister of Economic Affairs Christine Tsung said recently that
her ministry will submit suggestions to the Executive Yuan for a
final decision on the issue by the end of March.</P>
      <P>In a related development, Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan-tze
said Tuesday that he supports the proposal of allowing local wafer
manufacturers to build eight-inch wafer plants in mainland China.</P>
      <P>He stated that the know-how is not the monopoly of Taiwan
companies and added that even if Taiwan does not invest in the
mainland, other countries will.</P>
      <P>It was the first time that the Nobel Prize winner had openly
voiced his support for the transfer of wafer technology to the
mainland.</P>

(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian lit the key
lanterns at a ceremony held Tuesday evening in the southern port city
of Kaohsiung to mark the annual Lantern Festival.</P>
      <P>Addressing the ceremony, in which a jumping fish and flying
dragon were featured as a theme on numerous paper lanterns, Chen said
the vibrant theme lantern symbolizes Kaohsiung's fast development and
upgrading as one of Taiwan's most important cities.</P>
      <P>The festival was celebrated all over the island, with all the
major cities lighting up their own theme lanterns amid festive
celebrations.</P>
      <P>In Taipei, Vice President Annette Lu and Taipei Mayor Ma
Ying-jeou jointly officiated at a ceremony at the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall Park to kick off the six-day Taipei Lantern Festival.</P>
      <P>The giant theme lantern -- a horse, which is the Chinese zodiac
animal for 2002 -- brightened up the Taipei skies with blinding laser
beams and vivid colors.</P>
      <P>In addition to the horse theme lantern, the Taipei lantern
craftsmen also showed off their skills by presenting a series of
giant lanterns featuring Vincent van Gogh's "Irises in the Garden,"
Marc Chagall's "I and the Village," Gustav Klimt's "Kiss," and Pablo
Picasso's "Dream."</P>
      <P>In Yenshui, Tainan County, where the township's annual fireworks
festival routinely steals the show of Lantern Festivals elsewhere --
at least in terms of noise generated -- the number of spectators
decreased by about one-third after six people were reported killed
the previous day in an explosion at an illegal fireworks factory.</P>
      <P>In the offshore county of Kinmen, residents observed for the
first time fireworks being set off simultaneously with fireworks
displays being staged on the coast at Xiamen, a mainland Chinese port
city located just opposite Kinmen across the Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>Witnessing the unprecedented cross-strait fireworks displays,
Kinmen Magistrate Lee Chu-feng proclaimed: "Let's exchange fireworks,
not gunfire across the Taiwan Strait."</P>
      <P>Kinmen was an outlying Republic of China bastion against the
Chinese communists, who showered the island with bombs and bullets on
alternate days until less than three decades ago.</P>

important point is that he should so profit by what you say to him as
to change his conduct. If you speak to a man in parables, he will
probably be pleased with your story; but the important point is that
he should apply the moral to himself."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>MONGOLIAN STATUS ISSUE NEEDS LEGISLATIVE DECISION: LEGISLATURE HEAD</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet's decision to alter Mongolia's
status may involve changing the boundaries of the Republic of China's
territorial claims which would need to be settled by amending the ROC
Constitution, Legislative Yuan President Wang Jin-pyng said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>The Executive Yuan on Jan. 31 approved an amendment, proposed by
the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), to the Statutes Governing
Relations between the People on Both Sides of the Taiwan Strait,
thereby formally excluding outer Mongolia from the Republic of
China's maps of the "Mainland China Area."</P>
      <P>The amendment redefined the original regulations that defined
mainland China as areas under Communist Chinese control, plus
Mongolia, by excluding Mongolia.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, citizens of Mongolia are now considered by the ROC
government to be foreigners entitled to visas, instead of entry
permits, when they visit Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Subtly hinting his complaint that the Cabinet adopted the changes
without notifying the Legislature, Wang said that related disputes
that will crop up due to the adoption of the amendment will be
mitigated only if the Executive Yuan shows some respect to the
Legislative Yuan in advance.</P>
      <P>Defending the Cabinet decision, MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen said
Tuesday that the amendment is meant to bring the law into line with
the actual current reality, pointing out that it will now be easier
for Taiwan to deal with its increasing trade and cultural exchanges
with Mongolia.</P>
      <P>Chien Shih-ying, chief secretary of the Cabinet-level Mongolian
and Tibetan Affairs Commission, said excluding Mongolia from the
"Mainland China Area" is a pragmatic policy since more than 140
nations around the world recognize the sovereignty of Mongolia, which
has been independent since 1921.</P>

      <P>The officials attributed the rebounds mainly to a lower
comparison basis laid in January 2001, date of last year's Chinese
New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>Chang Yao-tsung, director-general of the MOEA's Statistics
Department, noted that export orders in February are expected to be
lower as a result of this year's February Chinese New Year holidays.</P>
      <P>Chang said the export orders are expected to rebound again,
although slightly, in March and gradually expand in the months to
come. He added that "noticeable growth" in this area will not be seen
until the second half of the year.</P>

      <P>The opposition Taiwan Solidarity Union

Shui-bian to make a state of the nation speech at the Legislative

Cheng Chen-lung, a TSU party whip at the Legislative Yuan.</P>

    <HEADLINE>TAIWAN TO BE STRICTER ON GUARANTORS WHO SIGN FOR MAINLAND CHINESE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The government will impose stricter
responsibilities on guarantors who sign for mainland Chinese people
wishing to enter Taiwan, the head of the Bureau of Immigration said
Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Bureau of Immigration Commissioner Tseng Wen-chang made the
remarks when he briefed Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the bureau is mulling whether to revise related
regulations to increase the responsibilities of guarantors who vouch
for mainland people applying to come to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Under the conditions being considered, the main guarantor would
have to be the spouse of the applicant, who would have to shoulder
the responsibility for all expenses incurred in any problems that
arise. Only if the original guarantor is deceased or cannot be
located can the list of possible guarantors be expanded to the
original guarantor's relatives.</P>
      <P>Tseng said that the stricter regulations are designed to prevent
the common practice of mainland people coming to Taiwan to work or
engage in illegal activities under marriages of convenience to Taiwan
people.</P>
      <P>Yu also said that as mainland China is stalling over the
repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants detained in Taiwan, which
he said has added to the government expenses and resources, he will
submit the issue to the Mainland Affairs Council and related agencies
for more consultation.</P>
      <P>Tseng noted that the repatriation of illegal mainland immigrants
is conducted through the Red Cross Society of the Republic and China
and its mainland counterpart under the Kinmen Agreement, and that
while the ROC has no problem accommodating male illegal mainland
immigrants, the main problem lies with the detention of female
illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>He added that during recent raids, police have cracked down on
many mainland Chinese women who have entered Taiwan on a bogus
marriage. The Hsinchu shelter, he went on, is currently overwhelmed
with female illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>However, National Police Administration Director General Wang
Chin-Wang said that there are only 722 illegal immigrants in
detention at present, compared with more than 2,000 in December 2000,
when mainland China was refusing to take back illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>Wang said that the police administration will continue to
communicate with its mainland counterpart on the issue.</P>

      <P>The search for an American citizen
who was reported missing Feb. 9 is still going on, Hualien police
authorities said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Christopher Dale Deiwert, an English teacher in the eastern
Taiwan county of Hualien, has been missing since visiting the beach
near Chihsing Lake Feb. 9, police said.</P>
      <P>"We combed the area after receiving information about his
disappearance, but have not found him so far," said Chu Ai-hua, chief
of the Hualien Police Bureau's foreign affairs section.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, Chu said, they have discovered some of Deiwert's
personal belongings, including his passport, backpack, a notebook and
bicycle, on the Chihsing beach.</P>
      <P>"We have interviewed residents in the area, but none of them have
seen him," Chu said. "We have also contacted Deiwert's friends based

      <P>Chu recalled that the wind was strong and the seas high at the
beach on the day of Deiwert's disappearance. "We have asked the
Hualien Coast Guard Corps to assist in searching for Deiwert at sea,
but the maritime search has so far not scored any results."</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, Chu said, his section has posted information about
Deiwert's disappearance on a Web site to seek online assistance in
the search.</P>
      <P>"We'll continue the search through every possible channel or

    <HEADLINE>FORMER MAINLAND CHINESE TENNIS ACE VOWS TO NURTURE `TAIWAN SEEDS'</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Committing herself to an ambitious 10-year
training plan, former mainland Chinese tennis player Hu Na envisions
nurturing Taiwan's own version of the Williams sisters.</P>
      <P>Believing that Taiwan's aboriginal youths have potential and
stamina equal to that of Venus and Serena Williams if properly
explored, Hu, the former mainland Chinese Olympian who sought
political asylum in the United States some 20 years ago, embarked on
her 10-year plan to nurture three aboriginal children who she hopes
will become the "seeds" of tomorrow's young Taiwan tennis players.</P>
      <P>Hu, who settled permanently in Taiwan six years ago and now runs
a tennis club in Taipei, traveled to Hualien, eastern Taiwan, during
this year's winter break to interview seven schoolgirls from
Hualien's Kuangfu Primary School who are considered to have high
tennis potential.</P>
      <P>Finding that all seven "could hit the ball the first time they
held a racquet," she invited all seven to Taipei for a month-long
training session at her tennis club during the winter break.</P>
      <P>When the training ended, Hu signed three of them up for long-term
training.</P>
      <P>Despite the fact that it will cost about NT$1 million a year to
nurture the three girls, an "investment" that will not see a return
anytime soon, Hu said she considers the three as "blue chip" stocks.
"I believe the three of them will turn out to be champions of the
12-year-old class National Youth Tennis Competition in two years,"
she said.</P>
      <P>Hu, in her early 40s, is not only a good tennis coach, but also
has a brilliant business mind. Since taking over her tennis club
three years ago, she has signed several up-and-coming young players
who train at her club.</P>
      <P>Hu's training program has won sponsorships from the local
business and industrial communities and she regularly receives cash
donations from local tycoons, including the owners of the Brother
Hotel Chain and the Sampo Corp.</P>
      <P>Hu, who lives with her parents, describes tennis as her "better
half," despite her name being frequently linked with various local
businessmen.</P>

    <HEADLINE>KMT URGES RULING PARTY TO PRESENT PRAGMATIC MAINLAND CHINA POLICY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Lien Chan, chairman of the main opposition
Kuomintang, said Wednesday that he hopes the ruling party can build
consensus among its various factions that will allow the Cabinet to
present a pragmatic mainland China policy.</P>
      <P>Lien made the remarks after hearing Su Chi, an official of the
National Policy Foundation -- a KMT think tank -- present a report on
the cross-strait situation and its prospects at a KMT regular Central
Standing Committee meeting.</P>
      <P>Lien said that there is a discrepancy between the government and
private sectors, as well as between the political and economic
sectors, claiming that the government and political sectors are
lukewarm toward the other side of the Taiwan Strait, while the
private and economic sectors are "rushing feverishly" to the
mainland, which he said runs counter to the expectations of the
people regarding cross-strait relations. He also expressed worry that
the development has even bogged down Taiwan's economic development.</P>
      <P>Lien said that United States President George Bush's recent trip
to the mainland shows that Washington and Beijing are still testing
their relations, while the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's security
remains firm.</P>
      <P>Lien reiterated that Taipei-Washington relations and cross-strait
relations should be two parallel lines and that if the lines are
skewed, then national interests will suffer. He added that as the U.S
has stressed its commitment to Taiwan, the ROC should have more
confidence in reviving the deadlocked cross-strait dialogue and
implementing the consensus reached by a national economic conference
in August.</P>
      <P>He described the KMT's mainland policy as "sound and
middle-of-the-road" -- not advocating Taiwan independence or rapid
unification, which is in tune with the mainstream of Taiwan people
and will create a mutually beneficial situation for both sides of the
Taiwan Strait.</P>
      <P>He also said that cross-strait talks should be based on an equal
footings and that the KMT cannot accept any pre-conditions regarding
the "one country, two systems" espoused by the mainland, nor will it
agree with he said is "the government's tendency to annihilate the
Republic of China."</P>
      <P>He was assumed to be referring to the decision to add "issued in
Taiwan" to the cover of the ROC passport and a plan to substitute the
word "Taiwan" for the existing "Taipei" in the names of ROC overseas
missions, although he failed to explain how such wording could be
construed as "annihilating the Republic of China."</P>

    <HEADLINE>ROC LAYS OUT RED CARPET TO WELCOME PALAU PRESIDENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27  (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian presided over a
ceremony Wednesday to welcome Palau President Tommy E. Remengesau,
Jr., who arrived in Taipei a day earlier for a five-day state visit.</P>
      <P>Remengesau was accorded full military honors, complete with a
21-gun military salute, in a welcoming ceremony held at the Chiang
Kai-shek Memorial Hall complex in downtown Taipei near the
Presidential Office.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the occasion, Chen said relations between the
Republic of China and Palau have been growing steadily since the two
countries forged formal diplomatic ties in December 1999.</P>
      <P>"We believe that President Remengesau's current visit will
further strengthen bilateral cooperation and turn a new page in our
relations," Chen said.</P>
      <P>Noting that both the ROC and Palau will face new opportunities
and challenges in the new century, Chen said he hopes the two
countries can cooperate closely to overcome difficulties and enhance
their people's well-being.</P>
      <P>For his part, Remengesau expressed his gratitude for all the
hospitality the ROC government and people have shown to him and his
entourage.</P>
      <P>Remengesau also echoed Chen's call for increased bilateral
cooperation, saying that his present visit is aimed at seeking new
cooperative programs between the two countries.</P>
      <P>Vice President Annette Lu and many other senior ROC officials, as
well as members of the diplomatic corps, attended the welcoming
ceremony.</P>
      <P>Later in the day, Remengesau paid a visit to Chen and the two
leaders had wide-ranging talks.</P>
      <P>Chen said during the meeting that as a member of the "global
village," the ROC has the right and obligation to take part in
international activities and organizations to fulfill its duties.</P>
      <P>"We appreciate Palau's resolute support for our bids to join the
United Nations, the World Health Organization and other major
international bodies," Chen said, adding that he was impressed by
Remengesau's speech in support of the ROC's U.N. bid at the General
Assembly's general debate session last November.</P>
      <P>Chen said that although the ROC and Palau have enjoyed diplomatic
ties for only two years, bilateral technological and sports exchanges
and cooperation have made significant progress. Palau has recently
opened an embassy in Taipei, the Pacific nation's third after the
United States and Japan.</P>
      <P>Quoting official tallies, Chen said more than 12,000 ROC citizens
visited Palau last year, making Taiwan the nation's second-largest
source of tourist revenue, behind only Japan. "I believe that more
Taiwan people will make pleasure trips to Palau in the future," he
added.</P>
      <P>In addition to reaffirming Palau's strong support for the ROC's
U.N. bid, Remengesau said he has come to understand the importance of
partnership between the two countries over the past two years. "The
ROC is one of our best friends. We should further beef up economic
cooperation and cultural exchanges," he stressed.</P>
      <P>Remengesau is accompanied by his wife and 20-plus Palau officials
and congressional leaders on his current Taiwan visit. Aside from
meeting with senior ROC officials, the Palau president will also tour
major Taiwan economic and cultural development projects during his
stay.</P>
      <P>Remengesau will also hold talks with Chien and tour several
economic and cultural establishments in the country before departing
on March 2.</P>
      <P>Remengesau was elected senator at the age of 28 in 1984, becoming
the youngest senator ever in Palau. He was re-elected four years
later.</P>
      <P>In 1993, he was elected vice president, serving concurrently as
minister of administration. He won a second term in 1996 and was
elected president in 2000.</P>
      <P>He has visited Taiwan many times and last visited in December
2000 in his capacity as president-elect.</P>

      <P>The spokesman said that the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA)

for the state enterprise to take care of the maintenance of all
military vessels. The MOEA has instructed that the CSC should
cooperate with local private shipbuilding companies to share the
market resources.</P>
      <P>The CSC has suffered heavy losses in recent years as a result of
fierce competition from mainland China, Japan and South Korea.</P>
      <P>The company went through a painful "rebirth program" late last
year, laying off 2,300 workers at its Kaohsiung and Keelung shipyards
and cutting the salaries of the survivors by as much as 35 percent. A
MOEA report indicates that the company managed to operate with a
pre-tax surplus of NT$35 million in January, while the operational
cost for the month was cut by NT$340 million.</P>
      <P>Under the MOEA's plans, the CSC will be the sole window to
negotiate with the navy on shipbuilding and maintenance contracts,
while the company will be at liberty to find private shipbuilders to
be its sub-contractors, according to the spokesman.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>The Cabinet-level Mainland Affairs Council
(MAC) said Wednesday it is consulting with relevant government
agencies on easing restrictions on mainland tour groups' nightime
activities during their stay in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>The council issued the statement amid reports that a second
mainland Chinese tour group is scheduled to arrive in Taiwan Friday
from the United States.</P>
      <P>According to the reports, prospective mainland Chinese tourists
are worrying about Taiwan's strict restrictions on their activities
on the island.</P>
      <P>"We are discussing the issue with security authorities," said an
MAC official. "We are confident that the rule requiring all members
of mainland tour groups to end their daily activities and return to
hotels by 11 p.m. during their staye will be eased soon."</P>
      <P>Many members of the first mainland Chinese tour group, composed
of mainland passport holders in Japan, complained about that
restrictions at the end of their visit earlier this month.</P>
      <P>MAC Chairwoman Tsai Ing-wen clarified during a meeting with a
group of Taiwanese businessmen with interests in mainland China that
the MAC has not banned mainland tourists from leaving hotels after 11
p.m.</P>
      <P>Tsai was also quoted as having said that the "curfew" might
have been imposed by other agencies on the ground that tour guides
need a rest at night.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the Tourism Bureau reiterated Wednesday that mainland
Chinese tourists must still abide by the "group tour" and "group
activity" rules.</P>
      <P>Reports from San Francisco said a tour group composed of mainland
Chinese nationals with permanent residency in the United States will
arrive in Taipei Friday for a sightseeing trip.</P>
      <P>It will be the second mainland tour group to visit Taiwan since
the Republic of China government opened its doors to overseas
mainland Chinese citizens traveling in groups at the beginning of
this year. The first group, composed of elderly mainland Chinese

      <P>The San Francisco-based Phoenix Travel Agency has cooperated with
Taipei's Richmond Travel Agency in organizing a six-day, five-night
tour package for the 12-member group.</P>
      <P>A Phoenix spokesman said members of the group include people
working in the high-tech industries and banks as well as social group
volunteers and housewives. "All of them have permanent residency in
the United States and have passed qualification screening by Taiwan's
representative office here," he said. "And our Taipei partner has
asked the Taipei Association of Travel Agents to apply for travel
permits for our customers with the Taiwan authorities."</P>
      <P>In addition to touring Taiwan's major tourist attractions and
historic relics in northern and central Taiwan, the spokesman said,
the mainland visitors also hope to see for themselves Taiwan's
general lifestyle, social customs and cultural development.</P>
      <P>"We have arranged for them to visit noted sightseeing spots in
northern and central Taiwan, including the National Palace Museum in
suburban Taipei and scenic Sun Moon Lake in Nantou County," he added.</P>
      <P>As part of its efforts to boost exchanges across the Taiwan
Strait, Taiwan began Jan. 1 to allow mainland citizens with permanent
foreign residency or mainland students studying abroad to make
pleasure trips to the island, as long as they travel in a group at
all times.

    <HEADLINE>THINK TANK ASKS BUSH TO ABANDON SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  27 (CNA)
(By Flor Wang)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A pro-Taiwan independence group issued an
open letter in Taipei Wednesday, urging U.S. President George W. Bush
to abandon the Shanghai Communique and fully implement the Taiwan
Relations Act.</P>
      <P>The "Taiwan Heart," an action-oriented think tank composed of
about 300 university professors, lawyers and entrepreneurs, asked the
United States to re-examine the effectiveness of what it said was
"the inadequate Shanghai Communique" inked by Washington and Beijing
in 1972, because both Taiwan and mainland China were ruled by
"authoritarian regimes" at that time and the voice of the people in
Taiwan could not be heard.</P>
      <P>Calling the communique a "historical mistake," the group said the
so-called "one China" principle advocated by Beijing is only the
recognition of a minority of political leaders which lacks a popular
representation.</P>
      <P>The letter said, "Bush's clear commitment and unyielding stance
to protect a free and democratic Taiwan is a real godsend. We feel
deeply that your strong gesture is like 'sending us coal during a
severe winter.' We will remember you as the best friend Taiwan has
ever had.</P>
      <P>The letter also highly praised Bush's leadership, indicating that
"Since Sept. 11, you have shown leadership rarely seen in modern
times. Your vision for mankind, courage to defend freedom and
democracy and decisiveness in the war against terrorism will surely
be written into history books."</P>
      <P>The Taiwan Heart issued the letter prior to the 30th anniversary
of the Shanghai Communique to thank Bush's efforts in fighting
terrorism and making the world a more peaceful place.</P>
      <P>The Shanghai Communique was signed by then-U.S. President Richard
Nixon and mainland Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to serve as a
foundation for the establishment of formal diplomatic links between
the United States and mainland China.</P>

      <P>Only 10 percent of Taiwan's 8 million cyber
population are frequent shoppers on the Internet, according to
statistics compiled by the Institute for Information Industry.</P>
      <P>According to industry sources, business transactions made by
shoppers on the Internet totaled NT$8.9 billion (US$250 million) last
year and the figure is expected to hit NT$37 billion within three
years.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the United States-based online trading leader
eBay forecast that the number of Taiwan online shoppers will increase
and that the e-commerce market in Taiwan may amount to NT$476 billion
(about US$14 billion) in 2005.</P>
      <P>Statistics compiled by the Ministry of Economic Affairs show that
Taiwan's private consumption totaled NT$30 trillion in 2001, 0.03
percent of which was made through the Internet, far lower than 1.6
percent in the United States.</P>
      <P>The sources attributed the gap between the two countries to a
lack of confidence for online businesses among Taiwan consumers and
reports of frauds in cyberspace. They also said the e-commerce market
forecast made by eBay remains a remote goal.</P>
      <P>Of the domestic e-commerce business, Taiwan-based auction Web

percent was made for purchases of 3C products -- cars, computers and

    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun ordered an audit of the
state-run Taiwan Museum Wednesday after several important objects
were reported missing from its storehouse.</P>
      <P>Yu asked the Council for Cultural Affairs to form an ad hoc team
to take a thorough inventory of the museum's collection before the
end of the year, address any mismanagement and find out those
responsible for any wrongdoing.</P>
      <P>Cabinet spokesman Chung Suo-hang said the premier gave the order
one day after a Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator accused
museum staff of selling off valuable objects and replacing them with
reproductions.</P>
      <P>Legislator Chen Ching-chun filed a complaint with the Control
Yuan that day, accusing senior museum staff of failing in their
duties by not reporting the disappearance of many valuable objects.</P>
      <P>The lawmaker said the museum's inventory listed 50,000-odd
objects, but he claimed that no one has ever checked them since the
museum was taken over from its Japanese founder in 1945.</P>
      <P>He singled out in particular the staff of the anthropological
department, accusing them dragging their feet as regards
inventory-taking.</P>
      <P>Chen said the three staff members had recorded only some 4,000
objects, or just 16 percent of the entire anthropological collection,
in more than ten years.</P>
      <P>Chen said he suspected that fear of being found out might be
behind the staff's reluctance to hand over parts of the museum's
collection to two other state-supported museums.</P>
      <P>Hsieh Ching-hui, the member of the Control Yuan who accepted
Chen's complaint, said the government's supreme watchdog has assigned
six members to look into the complaints.</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's economy may show signs of recovery
in the second quarter and could well be on the way to getting back on
its feet in the third quarter, a government official said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Hu Chung-ying, director of the Economic Research Department under
the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said
Taiwan's relations with mainland China and political stability are
the two prime factors which will have an impact on the expected
economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the CEPD issued major economic indicators for the
local economy in January, which indicate that an economy recovery is
underway.</P>
      <P>The January leading indicator index, which gauges economic
activities for the next three to six months, increased by 1.5 percent
from December to 98.3 points, the fourth-consecutive monthly rise and
the highest level since Jan. 2001. The January coincident index rose
by 3.2 percent month-on-month to 100.9 points, the same level posted
in March 2001.</P>
      <P>At the same time, the January composite indicator, which reflects
current economic conditions, flashed a "blue light" in a five-color
rating system on the performance of the domestic economy for the 14th
consecutive month at 15 points. It is an indication that Taiwan's
economy has not yet fully regained its momentum.</P>

    <HEADLINE>DGBAS PREDICTS UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO IMPROVE IN THIRD QUARTER</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 27 (CNA)
(By Elisa Kao)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's unemployment situation was better
in January, but an official from the Directorate General of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) said Wednesday that Taiwan may not
be out of the woods until the third quarter.</P>
      <P>Chen Chin-cheng, a DGBAS official, attributed the drop in
January's unemployment rate mainly to higher demand for workers in
the manufacturing and construction sectors.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate is expected to further decline in February
thanks to the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday and the need for
temporary workers during that time, he said.</P>
      <P>However, he warned that the unemployment rate could surge in
March after the temporary workers have been laid off.</P>
      <P>The unemployment rate fell in January for the third consecutive
month and could fall further in the third quarter, the official said.</P>
      <P>He maintained that the unemployment situation as a whole has not
improved yet, but after the third quarter things may improve. The
DGBAS estimated that the unemployment rate for this year will be 5
percent.</P>
      <P>Vice Premier Lin Hsin-yi has said he hopes this year's
unemployment rate can be held at 4.5 percent.</P>
      <P>According to statistics compiled by the Cabinet-level DGBAS, the
island's unemployment rate stood at 5.14 percent in January, with the
number of unemployed reaching 1.14 million, a drop of 34,000 over the
previous month.</P>
      <P>The number of those who lost their jobs in January because of
factory shutdowns or downsizing was 277,000, nearly the same as
December of last year. The figure stopped rising for the second month
after rising for 16 consecutive months.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the DGBAS statistics also show that among those
unemployed in January, their average unemployed period was 30.4
weeks, reflecting the difficulty of finding a job.</P>
      <P>Keelung City, in northern Taiwan, registered the highest
unemployment rate of 5.55 percent. The rates in some counties,
including Chiayi and Tainan, were under 4 percent because of the
winter harvest.</P>

      <P>Minister of the Interior Yu Cheng-hsien
said Wednesday that he has instructed his ministry to come up with
amendments to the immigration laws to enable foreign experts in high
technology or those have made significant contributions to Taiwan to
obtain permanent residency.</P>
      <P>During a visit to the Bureau of Immigration, Yu said he is aiming
to produce amendments by the end of March to allow prominent foreign
individuals to become permanent residents of Taiwan on a case-by-case
basis.</P>
      <P>Yu visited Bjarne Gislefoss, co-founder of the Puli Christian
Hospital, and his wife in Nantou, central Taiwan last week to better
understand their residency problems.</P>
      <P>He said the Norwegian couple, who have dedicated most of their
life to serving people in Taiwan, have lived on and off in Taiwan for
nearly 50 years, but have not received permanent residency because of
the stringent restrictions stipulated in immigration laws.</P>
      <P>Under current Taiwan law, foreigners who have legally and
continuously lived in Taiwan for seven years and have spent over 270
days per year on the island are eligible to apply for permanent
residency.</P>
      <P>"Now times have changed and Taiwan has become a part of the
global village," Yu said, adding that he has instructed the
Population Administration and National Police Administration (NPA) to
complete the revisions to the immigration laws as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Last month, opposition Kuomintang Legislator Apollo Chen said he
would propose an amendment to allow foreigners who have stayed in
Taiwan legally for over 20 years and who have spent over 183 days per
year during 10 of those years on the island to be eligible to apply
for permanent residency.</P>
      <P>Chang Chi, a section chief of the NPA, said foreign experts in
high technology are not as likely to work in Taiwan if they cannot
obtain permanent residency. Chang said that the NPA has considered
allowing some prominent foreign individuals to be exempt from certain

    <TEXT>
      <P>President Chen Shui-bian would be happy to
give a state of the nation address to the Legislative Yuan --
defusing a possible political showdown, a staff member at the
Presidential Office said Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Huang Chih-fang, director for public affairs at the Presidential

his visions for the country to the people.</P>
      <P>The exact details of how Chen's address could be delivered is up
to the legislature and the president will respect its decision if it
is in accordance with the ROC Constitution, Huang said.</P>
      <P>Chen's office made the statement after lawmakers of the Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) proposed Wednesday to ask Chen to make a
report on the state of the nation and explain his ideas about
revising the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The proposal by the TSU, which is a group sympathetic to Chen's
administration, drew a cautious reaction from Chen's Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) earlier the same day, although such an
address to the legislature is provided for in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Before Chen announce through his aide that he would be willing to
address the legislature, DPP whip at the lawmaking body Wang Tu said
that the TSU should think carefully about what it is asking since the
party may be inadvertently painting the president into a corner by
the request.</P>
      <P>Should Chen decide to turn down the offer to speak to the
legislature, Wang said, it could be seen by opposition parties as a
snub of the legislature and could result in political fallout -- even
though the Constitution does not require the president to accept an

conduct, or one who is pleased with my parable without being able to
apply the moral to himself -- I can do nothing for such a man."</TEXT>

    <HEADLINE>PREMIER YU PRESIDES OVER CEREMONY MARKING FEB. 28 TRAGEDY</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Chiayi,  southern  Taiwan,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Premier Yu Shyi-kun
presided over a ceremony at a memorial park in downtown Chiayi
Thursday marking the 55th anniversary of the 228 Incident that led to
a bloody crackdown by authorities and the infamous "white terror" era
in Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Unrest broke out in Taipei and then spread around Taiwan
following a free-for-all scuffle Feb. 28, 1947 triggered by a
conflict between a police officer and a peddler who violated the
tobacco monopoly imposed by authorities.</P>
      <P>Yu offered incense and a white lily plant to a monument erected
at the Chiayi 228 Memorial Park to commemorate citizens who were
killed during the 228 Incident and during the ensuing "white terror"
that lasted for years islandwide.</P>
      <P>In his address at the ceremony, Yu called for forgiveness while
at the same time a remembrance of the lessons that history has
taught.</P>
      <P>In Chiayi City, like Taipei, a great number of citizens -- many
of them among the social elite -- were victimized during the "white
terror" years. It was the first city in Taiwan where a 228 monument
was erected and a memorial park developed to commemorate the sad
incident.</P>
      <P>Yu, meanwhile, announced that 228 Memorial Day will become a
national holiday, with no work or classes, as of 2003 to clear away
the confusion surrounding this year's 228 Memorial Day when local
governments in many cities remained undecided as to whether the day
should be a holiday or simply a day of observance while schools and
businesses remain open.</P>
      <P>In Taipei City, Mayor Ma presided over a commemoration ceremony
held at the Taipei 228 Memorial Park.</P>
      <P>Addressing the occasion, Ma said the 228 Incident was not an
"ethnic conflict" between the "Taiwanese and the people from the
mainland" as he said has long been misperceived. He said the incident
was a conflict resulting from the authorities' suppression of
ordinary people.</P>
      <P>Noting that many historical accounts show that many Taiwanese
helped the "mainlanders" and vice versa during the challenging times,
Ma called for empathy and brotherhood among all people in Taiwan,
regardless of where they are from.</P>
      <P>In a similar function held in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, Mayor Frank Hsieh also called for the people of Taiwan to
be mindful of the historical lessons of the 228 Incident, which left
some 20,000 people, mostly members of the social elite, dead or
missing, and resulted in a long standoff afterward between the
authorities and the private sector.</P>
      <P>In the central city of Taichung, Mayor Jason Hu called for love
and peace during his address at a memorial ceremony as a means for
the people of Taiwan to face history and the future.</P>
      <P>"All of us should show respect for life and learn to love and
forgive," Hu noted.</P>

    <HEADLINE>MAYOR MA TO RECEIVE WCIT AWARD FOR TAIPEI'S CYBER SERVICES</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Deborah Kuo)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou left for
Australia Thursday to receive an award from the World Conference of
Information Technology (WCIT) in recognition of the cyber services
that the Taipei city government offers its residents.</P>
      <P>Ma will receive the Outstanding Governmental Sci-Tech Award from
the WCIT on behalf of the Taipei city government, which since late
2000 has championed building Taipei into a cyber city.</P>
      <P>The Taipei city government has computerized its services for the
city's residents by opening 418 windows on the Internet from where
Taipei citizens can download information or get access to information
in 109 service categories.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, the city government is also aiming to build 800 public
Internet service stations citywide by the end of this year to allow
Taipei citizens to surf the Web more conveniently. As of today, 380
stations have already been established.</P>
      <P>With the implementation of these services, the city government is
now preparing to premiere the Taipei Portal in March to provide
instant and comprehensive information regarding weather, traffic
conditions, travel affairs, consumer news and government policies.</P>
      <P>Representatives from the information technology industry in 41
nations and areas around the world are gathering in Australia's
southern city of Adelaide for the annual meeting of the WCIT --
widely renowned as the "Olympics of the world information technology
industry."</P>
      <P>Ma is expected to give a speech during a WCIT award-presentation
ceremony slated for March 1.</P>
      <P>In addition to taking part in the WCIT gathering, Ma will take
time to visit Taipei's sister city of Perth on the west coast of
Australia and discuss city affairs and urban development with Perth
Mayor Peter Nattarass.</P>
      <P>He will also meet personally with Melbourne Mayor John So and
Adelaide Mayor Alfred Huang, both of whom are Chinese-Australians, to
exchange views on matters of mutual concern.</P>

    <HEADLINE>FOUNDATION FORMS WATCH GROUP TO COUNTER EHTNIC DIVISIONS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A foundation that advocates peace across
the Taiwan Strait announced Thursday the establishment of a group to
promote ethnic reconciliation as Taiwan marked the 55th anniversary
of the 2-28 Incident.</P>
      <P>Chien Hsi-chieh, executive director of the Peacetime Foundation
of Taiwan, which started a "reconciliation day" last year, said that
initially the team will observe political figures and will passively
appeal to people to stop using words or acting to incite ethnic
rivalry.</P>
      <P>The team will present reports on its findings and will publish
the names of candidates for public office who have used racial
epithets to incite voters, he said.</P>
      <P>In the future, the team will be more active in promoting ethnic
harmony with the goal of eliminating the use of ethnic divisions as a
campaign strategy in the year-end mayoral elections and the 2004
presidential election.</P>
      <P>The foundation will also monitor the use of racial slurs and
words of hatred that are posted on online forums used by university
students, as well as radio and TV call-in programs. These terms fall
under the heading of "words of ethnic violence," according to the
foundation.</P>
      <P>Chien noted that some people used "dehumanizing" words, such as
mainlander pigs, Taiwan dogs, aboriginal children, and PRC dogs to
defile other ethnic groups.</P>
      <P>Cultural commentator Ping Lu, who was also at the event Thursday,
said that establishing an watch group on the anniversary of the 2-28
Incident is significant. He said that Taiwan easily falls prey to
ethnic divisions, adding that the most likely crisis in Taiwan will
be the schism along the lines of ethnicity.</P>
      <P>Ping said that the foundation is hoping that the "ethnic
reconciliation" campaign will restrain people and help awaken them to
the potent problem.</P>
      <P>The tragic incident in Taipei on Feb. 28, 1947 was triggered by a
dispute between a police officer and a peddler selling cigarette
which violated the tobacco monopoly. Chaos quickly spread around
Taiwan and led to the infamous "white terror" that lasted for years
islandwide.</P>

    <HEADLINE>HARD TIMES FOR CHINA AIRLINES AS IT SELLS AGING PLANE FOR SCRAP</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei, Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Lilian Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Analysts say that the aviation industry has
seen the worst of the economic slowdown, but things got so bad for
China Airlines (CAL) after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in
the United States that the Taiwan carrier had to sell one of its
aging planes for scrap.</P>
      <P>Wishing to upgrade its fleet, CAL planned to sell a 21-year-old
Boeing 747-200 cargo plane for US$28 million last year. But CAL was
forced to cut the price in half immediately after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks.</P>
      <P>But even at that price there were no buyers so the former
national carrier dismantled the plane and sold the pieces for
US$100,000 as scrap. CAL said that this was preferable to paying to
maintain the plane.</P>
      <P>CAL officials said that fortunately, the aviation industry has
begun to bottom out since the beginning of the year, adding that
CAL's revenues in January were NT$280 million (US$7.97 million),
better than its targeted NT$110 million (US$3.13 million).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's trade with mainland China in 2001
was estimated at US$29.963 billion, down 7.4 percent from the
previous year, according to statistics released by the Board of
Foreign Trade (BOFT).</P>
      <P>The number accounted for 13 percent of the island's total foreign
trade in that year that was up 1.8 percentage points from the
previous year, the statistics showed.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's exports to mainland China in 2001 stood at about
US$24.061 billion, a decrease of 8 percent from 2000. The decreasing
scale accounted for 19.6 percent of Taiwan's total exports in that
year that was 2 percentage points higher than that in 2000, the
figures reveal.</P>
      <P>Taiwan's imports from mainland China in 2001 were approximately
US$5.902 billion, a year-on-year decrease of 5.2 percent. The number

      <P>The BOFT attributed the decrease in both the exports to and

    <HEADLINE>WATER SHORTAGE MAY FORCE HIGH-TECH FIRMS OUT OF TAIWAN (I)</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Hsinchu,  Taiwan,  Feb.  28  (CNA)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>The lingering water shortage
problem may force companies in the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial
Park -- the heartland of Taiwan's high-technology industry -- out of
the island, a group of corporate executives warned Thursday.</P>
      <P>The high-tech CEOs made the warning at a colloquium with Minister
of Economic Affairs Christine Tsung, National Science Council (NSC)
Chairman Wei Che-ho, Hsinchu County Magistrate Cheng Yung-chin, and
other officials as well as legislators elected from the Hsinchu
constituency.</P>
      <P>A drought in northern Taiwan in recent months has hit microchips
companies in the Hsinchu park, whose daily water demand reaches
130,000 tons. The unusual scarcity of rainfall this month has
resulted in a daily water shortfall of 8,000 tons in the region.</P>
      <P>Although relevant government agencies have tried to increase the
water supply to the island's high-tech bastion through a pipeline
linked to the Feitsui Reservoir in Taipei, some 100 kilometers to the
north, the water shortage has continued to trouble corporate
executives inside the park.</P>
      <P>In an effort to allay their worries, Minister Tsung said at
Thursday's seminar that a fallow project covering 18,000 hectares of
farmland in Hsinchu and neighboring Taoyuan County will begin Friday
and will last until the end of May to address the park's water
problem.</P>
      <P>Tsung said the fallow program was worked out after consultations
among the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), the Council of
Agriculture (COA), the NSC and other relevant government agencies.</P>
      <P>"The fallow program will save an average of 600,000 to 650,000
tons of water daily used to irrigate rice paddies in the
Hsinchu-Taoyuan areas," Tsung said. "The saved water will be able to
satisfy the demands of information technology (IT) companies and
ordinary households in the drought-hit region until May when Taiwan
will enter its annual monsoon or 'plum rain' season."</P>
      <P>Tsung's announcement, however, failed to calm corporate
executives present at the seminar.</P>
      <P>Huang Yen-chu, vice president of Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Corp. and managing director of an association of IT
makers in the Hsinchu park, took the lead in complaining about the
water-supply problem.</P>
      <P>"We have long been troubled by frequent water shortages,
particularly before and after the Chinese New Year holiday. I simply
can't understand why the government has failed to resolve the problem
once and for all," Huang said.</P>
      <P>With the park's production increasing steadily, Huang said, its
water consumption has also been skyrocketing. "Why can't the
government improve its overall water supply system after all these
years?"</P>
      <P>Noting that the water shortage is not just a regional issue, but
rather a nationwide headache, Huang said the MOEA should conduct a
thorough review of the island's water resources distribution system.</P>
      <P>"We shouldn't have to rely on fallow projects to satisfy the
industrial sector's water demand," Huang said. "Worse yet, the
upcoming fallow project can only help the Hsinchu park's operations
until the end of May. It remains uncertain whether the 'plum rain'
season will provide enough rainfall to help us out."</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Lee Ching-chao, president of
Taisil Electronics Materials Corp., said many companies in the park
have to hire water trucks to transport water from neighboring
counties to meet their own demand, increasing production costs.</P>
      <P>"Moreover, the price has continued rising amid the current dry
spell, surging from NT$3,000 (US$85.71) per 30 tons to NT$7,000
Wednesday," Lee said, adding that he is worried that if the
water-shortage problem cannot be resolved, IT firms in the park may
be unable to keep their businesses in Taiwan.

      <P>In response, Tsung said that as a provisional pipeline linking
the park to a reservoir in Pingchen, Taoyuan County was inaugurated
Thursday, companies in the park will no longer have to hire water
trucks from now on. She added that a permanent pipeline linking the
park to the Pingchen Reservoir will come on line two months later to
increase the park's water supply.</P>
      <P>As for Hsinchu County Magistrate Cheng's demand that government
compensation to farmland to be affected by the fallow project be
increased to NT$80,000 per hectare, Tsung said the COA will discuss
the issue with the county government and other relevant agencies
before making a final decision in line with current laws and budget

    <TEXT>
      <P>Future high-tech developments will revolve
around the integration of biotech and information technology, but
success will depend on their commercialization and their ability to
meet market demands, Borland Software Chairman William F. Miller said
in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>Miller said at a roundtable forum on the industrial outlook of
the Asia-Pacific region that Silicon Valley has been a high-tech
breeding ground for the past several decades, but future
opportunities lie not in the development of newer technologies but
rather in how these technologies are commercialized and introduced
into business enterprises.</P>

discovery like biochips, while progress in nanotechnology will help
lower the manufacturing costs of microchips and information products.</P>

(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan stands a good chance of becoming an
investment conduit and manufacturing hub for the biotechnology
industry, a local industrial technology expert said Thursday.</P>
      <P>Lee Chung-hsi, deputy director of Taiwan's state-funded
Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), made the remarks at
the opening of BioBusiness Asia 2002, co-sponsored by the ITRI's
Biomedicine Center and the Biotechnology Industry Development
Association.</P>
      <P>Lee said the biotechnology industry has gradually grown in major
Asian countries, including Taiwan, Singapore and India. In the past,
Asian countries have organized many international biotech symposiums.</P>
      <P>"But those seminars tended to focus on technological
developments," Lee said. "Moreover, due to the lack of a transparent
mechanism and a viable conduit to mediate international cooperation,
Asian biotech firms have difficulties acquiring international capital
to help finance their development projects."</P>
      <P>In contrast, Lee said, the ongoing two-day seminar will focus on
biotech investment issues and potential genetic technology
development opportunities.</P>
      <P>Noting that the current seminar is the first of its kind ever
held in Taiwan, Lee said he hopes that similar forums will be held
annually in the future.</P>
      <P>"We also look forward to seeing the forum become Asia's largest
and most famous intermediary platform for biotech investment," he

      <P>Given Taiwan's exuberant venture capital investment environment,
Lee went on, the island should be able to emerge as one of Asia's
most important biotech investment and development hubs.</P>
      <P>Speaking on the same occasion, Shih Yen-hsiang, director of the
Industrial Development Bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs,
said despite Taiwan's economic recession last year, the island's
overall investment in biotech industry still reached NT$22 billion in

      <P>"The investment amount will exceed NT$30 billion this year," Shih
said, adding that he hopes the current forum will attract even more
foreign investors in Taiwan's burgeoning biotech industry.</P>
      <P>The current forum brings together more than 200 senior executives

    <HEADLINE>TSU PLANS TO PUT FORTH BILL ON ADMINISTRATIVE DISTRICTS RESTRUCTURING</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb. 28 (CNA)
(By Sofia Wu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A legislator of the tiny opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) said Thursday that his party plans to come up
with a bill on restructuring Taiwan's administrative districts for
legislative deliberation in the near future.</P>
      <P>Liao Pen-yen, a TSU lawmaker from the Taipei County constituency,
said the existing administrative districts were demarcated decades
ago under Kuomintang rule.</P>
      <P>"The demarcation has become obsolete with the island's economic
and urban development over the past five decades," Liao noted,
adding that many city and county governments should be merged or
integrated to improve operational efficiency and make the best use
of the country's resources.</P>
      <P>Moreover, Liao said, since the Taiwan Provincial Government has
been "marginalized," it has become meaningless to define Taipei
and Kaohsiung -- the island's two largest cities -- as "special
municipalities" under direct jurisdiction of the Cabinet.</P>
      <P>"The reality is that all cities and counties on the island are
now under the jurisdiction of the Cabinet. None of them are under the
jurisdiction of the provincial government," he stressed. "Therefore,
Taipei and Kaohsiung should be deprived of their 'special
municipalities' status."</P>
      <P>The TSU controls only 13 seats in the 225-member Legislative
Yuan. Its bills must receive the support of major political parties
before they can become laws.</P>
      <P>Wang Tuoh, legislative whip of the ruling Democratic Progressive
Party, said he himself supports the TSU's proposal. "Nevertheless,
restructuring involves many complicated problems, it needs further
discussion," he added.</P>

      <P>The check default rate in January in Taiwan
reached 0.66 percent, the lowest level since 1996, according to
statistics compiled by the Central Bank of China (CBC).</P>

    <TEXT>
      <P>Economic Affairs Minister Christine Tsung
instructed Thursday the Hsinchu County government to resolve a land
acquisition problem in order to help pipe water from Taipei to the
region, which has been hard hit by a severe drought.</P>
      <P>Tsung said she expects the problem to be resolved within two
months, as the Hsinchu county government will seek to acquire the
land where a 300 meter-long pipe must be laid in order to allow the
Taipei Water Department to pipe water from the Feitsui Reservoir to
Hsinchu, home to a large number of Taiwan's leading hi-tech
companies.</P>
      <P>According to the Water Resources Bureau under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, the normal daily water supply of 370,000 tons can
be maintained until late May in the Hsinchu area after a large-scale
water rationing was imposed Wednesday. But it pointed out that the
water shortage may worsen if the rainfall continues to be scarce, as
has been forecast by the Central Weather Bureau.</P>
      <P>To help alleviate the situation, which has threatened the
operations of many hi-tech firms in the region, the Executive Yuan
made a decision a day earlier to leave 18,000 hectares of rice paddy
in Hsinchu and Taoyuan fallow, a move will help save about 650,000
tons of water per day for the public and factories.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Water Resources Bureau said the second-phase
construction of the Paoshan Reservoir is slated to be completed in
December 2004, which will increase the water supply by 590,000 tons

    <HEADLINE>TSU TO PRESENT BILL CALLING FOR HALVING OF NUMBER OF LEGISLATORS</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,   Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A leader of the opposition Taiwan
Solidarity Union (TSU) said Thursday that the party will present a
bill to cut the number of Legislative Yuan members from 225 to 113.</P>
      <P>Chen Chien-ming, deputy secretary-general of the TSU legislative
caucus, told reporters that the TSU has collected over 80 signatories
from legislators in support of the bill to be presented Friday.</P>
      <P>Bills for this kind of constitutional amendment require the
signatures of at least 25 percent of the legislature, or 56
legislators.</P>
      <P>Chen admitted that the prospects for the bill are uncertain
because it will have to be forwarded to the constitutional amendment
committee of the Legislative Yuan for review.</P>
      <P>Even if the bill is approved by the committee, it will still
require the approval of more than 75 percent of the legislators
present at a plenary session of the Legislative Yuan, which itself
would require the participation of over 75 percent of the
legislature.</P>
      <P>Once it is approved by the Legislative Yuan, the bill will then
need to be sent to the National Assembly for final decision.</P>
      <P>As the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) and People First Party (PFP)
are reluctant to cooperate with the TSU, Chen said he was not
optimistic about the bill's prospects in the immediate future. The
KMT and the PFP control half of the 225 seats in the Legislative
Yuan.</P>
      <P>The TSU, which has only 13 seats in the legislature, was formed
last year by supporters of former President Lee Teng-hui, with
halving the number of Legislative Yuan members among its main
platforms.</P>
      <P>In another development, Chen also said that his party has decided
to postpone making a request that President Chen Shui-bian deliver a
state of the nation report before the legislature, mainly because of
opposition from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</P>
      <P>As Premier Yu Shyi-kun has already delivered his administrative
report to the Legislative Yuan and as the legislature has just
completed the formation of various committees, Chen explained that
the timing for the request is inappropriate.</P>

      <P>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in Taipei
City stood at 106.07 for last year, an increase of 0.43 percent over
the 2000 figure and the second-lowest growth rate in five years,
according to statistics compiled by the Taipei city government.</P>
      <P>Officials of the city government's Department of Budget,
Accounting and Statistics said that the slow growth in 2001 reflected
relatively stable prices. The CPI is calculated based on prices of
goods and services.</P>
      <P>The statistics show that the prices of goods fell 0.66 percent in
Taipei last year, while those of services increased by 1.46 percent.</P>
      <P>The house-rental index -- included in the service sector --
registered a decline of 0.7 percent last year, while the price index
of food increased by 0.48 percent, due mainly to the typhoons that
made fruit and vegetables more expensive in the city, according to
the statistics.</P>
      <P>The officials noted that the slow CPI growth in Taipei was at
odds with the overall CPI drop for Taiwan as a whole, indicating the
increasing consumption by Taipei citizens.</P>
      <P>Although Taipei's CPI has grown every year since 1997, growth
rates have not exceeded 2 percent, which means prices have remained

    <TEXT>
      <P>Taiwan's biotech industry should not
blindly pursue what is fashionable but should instead play to its own
unique strengths and establish alliances with appropriate partners,
Isis Pharmaceuticals CEO Stanley T. Crooke said in Taipei Thursday.</P>
      <P>Crooke said at BioBusiness Asia 2002, a newly established forum
for biotech companies in the region, that although the most popular
direction for biotech companies at the moment is to create new drugs
with new technologies, agricultural biotechnology might be an area in
which Asian companies can excel.</P>
      <P>He said that Taiwan's biotech industry has good opportunities for
future development because the island's workers are innovative,
professional and hardworking. Meanwhile, he continued, the government
has wisely invested in the local biotech industry, while
U.S.-educated specialists have been returning to Taiwan.</P>
      <P>Crooke said that a company entering the biotech industry should
seek the help of experienced talent, but he added that Taiwan's lack
of large research-focused pharmaceutical companies might hamper its
search for alliance partners around the globe.</P>
      <P>Asked if Isis will look for partners or invest in Taiwan, Crooke
said that this was only his first visit to the island and that no
investment plans are in the works. However, he added that he will not
rule out looking for alliance partners in Asia or Taiwan in the

      <P>The military situation in the Taiwan
Strait is currently stable, but this and other flashpoints in Asia
are still sources of concern, according to Adm. Dennis Blair,
commander-in-chief of the U.S. Pacific Command.</P>
      <P>The military balance across the Taiwan Strait, North Korea's
missile proliferation and continued tension between nuclear neighbors
India and Pakistan "still keep me awake at night and they keep my
forces extremely busy," Blair told a congressional panel Wednesday.</P>
      <P>He later added, however, that the current military situation in
the Taiwan Strait is "quite stable."</P>
      <P>"The fundamental situation is that the Chinese can cause a great
deal of damage to Taiwan in ways that the Taiwanese armed forces and
even the U.S. armed forces cannot stop," Blair said.</P>
      <P>The possible methods of mainland attack on Taiwan include
missiles, long-range aviation and sabotage, he said.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, mainland China "cannot attain its stated goal
of reunifying Taiwan by military force," he said. "They do not have
the military capability to take and hold Taiwan."</P>
      <P>"And that military reality," he said, "as long as the United
States follows the Taiwan Relations Act and ensures that Taiwan has
sufficient defense, and as long as my forces have the orders -- which
they do have -- to be ready to support Taiwan if ordered, that
situation is not going to change."</P>
      <P>Blair said that he believes the increasing economic interaction
and other contacts between Taiwan and the mainland will eventually
lead to a mutually satisfactory agreement.</P>
      <P>"In the meantime," he said, "I think we can ... make it very
unattractive for China to conduct military aggression."</P>
      <P>"Nothing I see in military developments over the year ... changes
that view," he added.</P>

    <DATELINE>Chiayi,  southern  Taiwan,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By Victor Lai)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>A 60-member mainland
Chinese Buddhist mission visited Nanhua University in Dalin Township,
Chiayi County Thursday, accompanied by Foguangshan Monastery founder
Master Hsing Yun.</P>
      <P>The delegation came to Taiwan Feb. 23 along with the Buddha's
finger relic currently being exhibited at the Chinguangming Temple in
Taipei County.</P>
      <P>Shortly after their arrival at the university, the visitors were
given a briefing on the founding and operations of the university by
its president, Chen Miao-sheng.</P>
      <P>Chen noted that the university was founded six years ago with
contributions from some 1 million donors in a campaign initiated by
Master Hsing Yun.</P>
      <P>Hsing Yun expressed the hope that the university, located at the
foot of Mt. Ali, will engage in more cultural exchanges with its
namesake located at the foot of Mt. Heng in mainland China's Henan
Province.</P>
      <P>In the previous few days, members of the mainland Buddhist
mission had visited the complex of the Dharma Drum Mountain in
suburban Taipei, as well as the Tzu Chi Compassionate Relief
Foundation in Hualien and the Foguangshan Monastery in Kaohsiung.</P>
      <P>The Buddha's finger relic has already been exhibited at the
National Taiwan University stadium. It will also be exhibited in
Kaohsiung, Taichung and Nantou before being returned March 31 to its
home, the Famen Temple outside the mainland city of Xian.</P>
      <P>The relic was unearthed in 1987, some 1,110 years after being
hidden in a sealed underground cell by a Tang Dynasty emperor.</P>

    <HEADLINE>CHILDREN UNDER 3 TO GET FREE MEDICAL TREATMENT</HEADLINE>
    <DATELINE>Taipei,  Feb.  28  (CNA)
(By David Hsu)</DATELINE>
    <TEXT>
      <P>Children under the age of three will
receive free medical treatment from Friday at Bureau of National
Health Insurance (BNHI) hospitals, Minister of the Interior Yu
Cheng-hsien announced Thursday.</P>
      <P>Speaking at a news conference, Yu said the move is in line with
the Ministry of the Interior's medical subsidy program for children
under the age of three that has already been adopted by the
Legislative Yuan.</P>
      <P>Under the current national health insurance system, which covers
everyone except servicemen, those who receive medical treatment at
BNHI hospitals must pay a registration fee and a portion of the total
medical expenses, with the remaining expenses paid by the government.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that the implementation of the new program, under
which parents need pay only the registration fee for their offspring,
will benefit 833,600 children and save some NT$1.3 billion
(US$37.1 million) for their parents annually, Yu said.</P>
